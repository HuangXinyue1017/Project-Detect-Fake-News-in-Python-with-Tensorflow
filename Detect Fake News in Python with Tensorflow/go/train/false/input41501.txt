18629,Swedish Man Prosecuted For Assaulting Muslims with Bacon,"A Swedish man is facing charges in court after being accused of eating bacon too closely to a group of veiled Muslim women and calling them derogatory names. [The incident occurred in the Swedish capital of Stockholm over the weekend. The Swedish man, who has not been named by media or the police, is said to have approached the Muslim women who were wearing Islamic veils on a train while he was eating bacon and dangled the bacon in front of their faces, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.  According to the report, the women got up to find seating elsewhere and the man followed them with his bacon. He is alleged to have called them derogatory names and made racist comments, though neither the police nor the court has specified what was said during the incident. The prosecutors allege he then used racial epithets on another woman in the train station after getting off the train. He faces charges of incitement to racial hatred. Reaction to the incident on social media has been a mix of laughter and disbelief amongst English language users. Twitter user PeterSweden tweeted his disbelief at the charges saying: “What’s the next step, being racist for walking your dog?” What’s the next step ? Being racist for walking your dog ? https:  .   —   PeterSweden (@PeterSweden7) March 26, 2017,  Other users found humour in the story posting various reaction images involving Islamic extremism and bacon. Many criticised the policies of the Swedish government and political correctness. @PeterSweden7 This insanity is made possible by so called ”politic correctness” which creates an non liveable situation for nativs! ὢ pic. twitter.   —   Jo Ker #Nexit (@JoKer33817736) March 26, 2017,  However, the reaction to the article from Swedish speakers was different. On Facebook, one Swedish speaker wrote: “I hope I never see this. I will make him eat the bacon raw the f**k up!” The sentiment was shared by another Swedish speaker who posted: “In what way do they really think that it would be okay to shove food in the face of someone you don’t know?” and added:  “Grown men. Shame on you. ” The case is not the first time bacon misuse has led to prosecutions for hate crimes. In the UK last year, two Polish men were jailed for throwing bacon inside a London mosque. The pair were charged with a “racially motivated attack” when one of the men swore at a Muslim man and threw bacon at him. In Bristol last year, police were also alerted to another potential hate crime after several people threw bacon sandwiches at the entrance of a local mosque.  Police commented on the incident calling it “abhorrent”.  Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com",0
18630,"15 Plants and Herbs That Boost Lung Health, Heal Respiratory Infections And Even Repair Pulmonary Damage","by JOHN SUMMERLY 
A wave of viral and bacterial infections is sweeping across the Northern Hemisphere and people are taking longer to heal from an array of symptoms within the respiratory system. If you are resorting to conventional medicine to address these infections with antibiotics, you are not only adding to the problems associated with antibiotic resistance, but you’re also doing little to address the healing mechanisms within your body to address the cause. Herbal remedies not only boost lung health, but they can heal infections and even repair lung damage. Here are 15 of the best herbs to boost lung health. 
1. LICORICE ROOT 
Licorice is one of the more widely consumed herbs in the world. In Traditional Chinese Medicine it occurs in more formulas than any other single herb because it is thought to harmonize the action of all other herbs. Licorice is very soothing and softens the mucous membranes of the throat and especially the lungs and stomach and at the same time cleanses any inflamed mucous membrane that needs immune system support. . It reduces the irritation in the throat and yet has an expectorant action. It is the saponins (detergent-like action) that loosen the phlegm in the respiratory tract, so that the body can expel the mucus. Compounds within this root help relieve bronchial spasms and block the free radical cells that produce the inflammation and tightening of the air ways. The compounds also have antibacterial and antiviral effects to them as well which helps fight off viral and bacterial strains in the body that can cause lung infections. Glycrrhizins and flavonoids can even help prevent lung cancer cells from forming which means they can even prevent lung cancer. 
2. COLTSFOOT 
Coltsfoot has been traditionally by Native Americans for thousands of years to strengthen the lungs. It clears out excess mucus from the lungs and bronchial tubes. It soothes the mucus membranes in the lungs, and has been shown in research to assist with asthma, coughs, bronchitis, and other lung ailments. Coltsfoot is available in dried form for tea or as an alcohol extract known as a tincture. 
3. CANNABIS 
The toxic breakdown of therapeutic compounds in cannabis from burning the plant are totally avoided with vaporization. Extraction and inhaling cannabinoid essential oils of the unprocessed plant affords significant mitigation of irritation to the oral cavity that comes from smoking. Cannabis is perhaps one of the most effective anti-cancer plants in the world shown in study after study to stimulate cannabinoid receptor activation in specific genes and mediate the anti-invasive effect of cannabinoids. Vaporizing cannabis allows the active ingredients to stimulate the body’s natural immune response and significantly reduces the ability of infections to spread. Vaporizing cannabis (especially with very high amounts of cannabinoids) opens up airways and sinuses, acting as a bronchodilator. It is even a proven method to treat and reverse asthma. 
4. OSHA ROOT 
Osha is an herb native to the Rocky Mountain area and has historically been used by the Native Americans for respiratory support. The roots of the plant contain camphor and other compounds which make it one of the best lung-support herbs in America. One of the main benefits of osha root is that it helps increase circulation to the lungs, which makes it easier to take deep breaths. Also, when seasonal sensitivities flare up your sinuses, osha root which is not an actual antihistamine, does produce a similar effect and may be help calm respiratory irritation. 
5. THYME 
Thyme is very powerful in the fight against chest congestion. It produces powerful antiseptic essential oils which are classified as naturally antibiotic and anti-fungal. Thyme is a well known to zap acne than expensive prescription creams, gels and lotions. Thyme tea has the power to chase away and eliminate bacteria and viruses so whether your infection is based on either, it will work. Thyme has been used as a lung remedy consumed since antiquity and is used extensively to day to prevent and treat respiratory tract infections and bacterial infection pneumonia. 
6. OREGANO 
Although oregano contains the vitamins and nutrients required by the immune system, its primary benefits are owed to its carvacrol and rosmarinic acid content. Both compounds are natural decongestants and histamine reducers that have direct, positive benefits on the respiratory tract and nasal passage airflow. Oil of oregano fights off the dangerous bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, better than the most common antibiotic treatments. Oregano has so many health benefits that a bottle of organic oregano oil should be in everyone’s medicine cabinet. 
7. LOBELIA 
Did you know that horses given lobelia are able to breath more deeply? Its benefits are not limited to equestrians. It has been used as “asthmador” in Appalachian folk medicine. Lobelia, by some accounts, is thought to be one of the most valuable herbal remedies in existence. Extracts of Lobelia inflata contain lobeline, which showed positive effects in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumor cells. Lobelia contains an alkaloid known as lobeline, which thins mucus, breaks up congestion. Additionally, lobelia stimulates the adrenal glands to release epinephrine, in effect, this relaxes the airways and allows for easier breathing. Also, because lobelia helps to relax smooth muscles, it is included in many cough and cold remedies. Lobelia should be part of everyone’s respiratory support protocol! 
8. ELECAMPANE 
Elecampane has been used by Native Americans for many years to clear out excess mucus that impairs lung function. It is known as a natural antibacterial agent for the lungs, helping to lessen infection particularly for people who are prone to lung infections like bronchitis. Herbal practitioners often recommend one teaspoon of the herb per cup of boiling water, drunk three times daily for two to three weeks but elecampane is also available in tincture format for ease. 
9. EUCALYPTUS 
Native to Australia, eucalyptus isn’t just for Koala bears! Aborigines, Germans, and Americans have all used the refreshing aroma of eucalyptus to promote respiratory health and soothe throat irritation. Eucalyptus is a common ingredient in cough lozenges and syrups and its effectiveness is due to a compound called cineole. Cineole has numerous benefits — it’s an expectorant, can ease a cough, fights congestion, and soothes irritated sinus passages. As an added bonus, because eucalyptus contains antioxidants, it supports the immune system during a cold or other illness. 
10. MULLEIN 
Both the flowers and the leaves of the mullein plant are used to make an herbal extract that helps strengthen the lungs. Mullein is used by herbal practitioners to clear excess mucus from the lungs, cleanse the bronchial tubes, and reduce inflammation that is present in the respiratory tract. A tea can be made from one teaspoon of the dried herb to one cup of boiled water. Alternatively, you can take a tincture form of this herb. 
11. LUNGWORT 
Lungwort is a tree-growing lichen that actually resembles lung tissue in appearance. However, this natural remedy doesn’t just look the part. As early as the 1600s, lungwort has been used to promote lung and respiratory health and clear congestion. Pulmonaria selections come in all kinds so seek an herbologist for direction. Lungwort also contains compounds that are powerfully effective against harmful organisms that affect respiratory health. 
12. CHAPARRAL 
Chaparral, a plant native to the southwest, has been appreciated by the Native Americans for lung detoxification and respiratory support. Chaparral contains powerful antioxidants that resist irritation and NDGA which is known to fight histamine response. NDGA inhibits aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis (the energy-producing ability) of cancer cells. Chaparral is also an herb that fights harmful organisms. The benefits of chaparral are most available in a tincture extraction but chaparral tea may support respiratory problems by encouraging an expectorant action to clear airways of mucus. 
13. SAGE 
Sage’s textured leaves give off a heady aroma, which arises from sage’s essential oils. These oils are the source of the many benefits of sage tea for lung problems and common respiratory ailments. Sage tea is a traditional treatment for sore throats and coughs. The rich aromatic properties arising from sage’s volatile oils of thujone, camphor, terpene and salvene can be put to use by inhaling sage tea’s vapors to dispel lung disorders and sinusitis. Alternatively, brew a strong pot of sage tea and place it into a bowl or a vaporizer. 
14. PEPPERMINT 
Peppermint, and peppermint oil, contains menthol — a soothing ingredient known to relax the smooth muscles of the respiratory tract and promote free breathing. Dried peppermint typically contains menthol, menthone, menthyl acetate, menthofuran and cineol. Peppermint oil also contains small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, pulegone, caryophyllene and pinene. Paired with the antihistamine effect of peppermint, menthol is a fantastic decongestant. Many people use therapeutic chest balms and other inhalants that contain menthol to help break up congestion. Additionally, peppermint is an antioxidant and fights harmful organisms. 
15. PLANTAIN LEAF 
Plantain leaf has been used for hundreds of years to ease cough and soothe irritated mucous membranes. Many of its active constituents show antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, as well as being anti-inflammatory and antitoxic. Clinical trials have found it favorable against cough, cold, and lung irritation. Plantain leaf has an added bonus in that it may help relieve a dry cough by spawning mucus production in the lungs. 

Seek the advice of an herbologist or Naturopathic Doctor on the preparation, appropriate dosages and frequency according to your condition. Many of the herbs above may also be combined for cumulative effects. All of the above are available in various forms, as nutritional supplements, tea blends and prepared oils. You can always grow your own as well to ensure your herbs are organic and ethically harvested.",0
18631,"Tillerson Signs Docs with Climate Change Statement, Insisting U.S. ’Still Reviewing’ Policy - Breitbart","As a member of the Arctic Council, the United States has signed onto two agreements that include efforts to protect the Arctic from climate change, linking it to human activity and calling on global efforts to reduce its effects, including enforcement of the Paris Agreement. [“The Arctic Council, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, has proven to be an indispensable forum in which we can pursue cooperation,” Tillerson said in remarks to the council. “I want to affirm that the United States will continue to be an active member in this council. ”  “Foreign ministers of the eight Arctic States signed the third binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council, the ‘Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation,’ which will help to facilitate entry and exit of persons, equipment, and material access to research infrastructure and facilities access to research areas the use of traditional and local knowledge and education, career development, and training opportunities for students and   scientists,” the council press release said. The ministers, including Tillerson, also signed the Fairbanks Declaration, which states, in part: Reaffirming our commitment to the   of the inhabitants of the Arctic, to sustainable development and to the protection of the Arctic environment, Recognizing the rights of Arctic indigenous peoples and the unique role of the Permanent Participants within the Arctic Council, as well as the commitment to consult and cooperate in good faith with Arctic indigenous peoples and to support their meaningful engagement in Arctic Council activities, Acknowledging the contributions of local authorities, and the interests of all Arctic residents and communities in the work of the Arctic Council, Further recognizing that activities taking place outside the Arctic region, including activities occurring in Arctic States, are the main contributors to climate change effects and pollution in the Arctic, and underlining the need for action at all levels, Noting with concern that the Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average, resulting in widespread social, environmental, and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide, and the pressing and increasing need for mitigation and adaptation actions and to strengthen resilience, Noting the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change and its implementation, and reiterating the need for global action to reduce both   greenhouse gases and   climate pollutants. The White House has not taken an official position yet as to whether it will stick with the Paris Agreement or withdraw, and Tillerson did not comment directly on the matter while in Alaska, the New York Times reported, despite his signing the document in favor of it. “No decision is imminent, and in his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Tillerson presented the delay as necessary to gain the viewpoints of parties outside the White House and even outside the United States, including the other Arctic nations,” The Times reported. “We are taking time to understand your concerns,” Tillerson told the members of the council, which in addition to the U. S. is comprised of Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Russia. “But we’re not going to rush,” Tillerson said. “We’re going to work to make the right decision for the United States. ” “The council members approved, with little fuss, an agreement on scientific cooperation in the region,” The Times reported. “But the meeting’s closing statement, known as the Fairbanks Declaration, had been the subject of a flurry of   negotiations on Wednesday. ” “We came here to Fairbanks believing that the declaration language was agreed,” Rene Soderman, the senior Arctic official for Finland, said, noting that the U. S. objected to some language, but that the overall council prevailed in its efforts. “We were able to push the U. S. back as much as possible,” Soderman said. “And they were able to go back as much as possible. ” “It’s a decent declaration and contains all the essential issues for all the eight countries,” Soderman said. Protesters were on hand at the venue chanting   slogans, The Times reported, noting Tillerson’s previous job as CEO of ExxonMobil. Terry Chapin, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, was one of the protesters who is critical of the council’s need for unanimous decisions on matters. “They’re constrained in the action they can take because they depend on the consensus from participating countries,” Chapin said. “So if the United States is not going to provide consensus on the climate action that’s needed, their hands are tied. “I think we really need to speak to people like Tillerson to say that this is the kind of action that’s needed,” Chapin said. “While the council only has the power to issue advisories, the language in the statement signed by Tillerson comes in stark contrast to statements and promises made by President Trump about climate change,” ABC reported, noting at the same time that Tillerson “endorsed” the Fairbanks Declaration. The Associated Press describes the Arctic Council as “an advisory body that promotes cooperation among member nations and indigenous groups,” and a “focus is sustainable development and environmental protection of the Arctic. ” “It does not make policy or allocate resources, and its decisions must be unanimous,” according to AP. The gathering marked the end of the   U. S. chairmanship of the council, which was passed on to Finland.",0
18632,Young Turks Finds Out Why Trump Is About To Lose Utah For Republicans For First Time In Decades (VIDEO),"By Wes Williams Election 2016 , Politics , Videos October 27, 2016 Young Turks Finds Out Why Trump Is About To Lose Utah For Republicans For First Time In Decades (VIDEO) Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Utah. It is one of, if not the most conservative states in the nation, largely thanks to the Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints, aka the Mormons. And as such it is usually a solid, bright red state on the electoral maps. Utah has gone for the Democratic presidential candidate exactly once in the past 64 years — in the anti-Goldwater wave of 1964. But this year it is possible that Utah will not be in the Republican column when the votes are added up. That is, at least not in the Republican column headed by Donald Trump, who is largely being rejected by voters in the Beehive State. 
Many Utah voters with strong religious beliefs are not happy with Trump, and unlike many Christian evangelical leaders who have decided to stay hitched to his wagon despite the allegations of improper sexual conduct, Utahans are bolting, putting the state in play. The Young Turks sent Michael Shure to the state to find out what was on people’s minds, and what many of them had to tell him was quite clear — they don’t think Trump is a good representative of their Christian beliefs. 
None of the young Utahans Shure spoke to said they planned to vote for Trump. Some said they would vote for Gary Johnson. One college student indicated that he would consider a vote for Hillary. But the name that seemed to come up more than any others was Evan McMullin. 
McMullin is the Republican who is running an independent campaign for president. He is also a Mormon, which gives him a huge advantage in Utah. Some recent polls of the state have McMullin polling even with Clinton, but still trailing Trump. But as Benjamin Morris notes at FiveThirtyEight, there are questions about the methodology of those polls that could mean McMullin’s support in Utah is even greater than he is getting credit for. 
Whether McMullin wins in Utah or whether Trump is able to squeak out a razor thin victory, one thing is certain: unlike many of their traditional “Christian” counterparts in the deep south and the rest of the Rocky Mountain region, many Mormons want no part of Trump or his policies, which some of them were quite willing to tell Shure that they considered to be un-Christian. Not only will a loss of Utah further hurt Trump’s slim chances of winning the White House, a McMullin win there would make him a footnote in future history books as the first third-party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to win electoral votes. 
Here’s Michael Shure’s report on the mood in Utah, via YouTube:

18633,Pre-Schooler Suspended for Bringing Empty .22 Shell Casing to School,"On Tuesday    Hunter Jackson was suspended for seven days after bringing an empty . 22 shell casing to school to show his friends. [Hunter’s school —  A Place to Grow —  is located in Troy, Illinois.  According to Fox 2 Now, Hunter’s mother, Kristy Jackson, said her son was excited because he had just spent time with his grandpa —  a Caseyville, Illinois, police officer —  who was teaching him about hunting and gun safety. Jackson said: [Hunter] just was wandering around in a field and picked up and put it in his pocket and didn’t tell his parents  …    it’s paranoia.  It’s something that’s become quite an epidemic where guns are automatically assumed that they’re bad  …    and I’m not sure how a   suspension teaches my son anything about tolerance or anything about why he was wrong.  It just means his school doesn’t want him there because of things he enjoys. In a Facebook post, Jackson she went to the school to pick her son up like any other day, only to met by “a stone faced teacher” who said her son had brought a “shotgun bullet” to school. Jackson said her immediate thought was, “My kid? Who just spent the weekend learning gun safety?” She said the teacher then handed her a letter saying “[Hunter’s] behavior warranted a seven school day suspension. Which [Kristy] still was expected to pay tuition for, of course. And a threat that if his enthusiasm for guns continued, he’d be permanently expelled. ” Fox 2 Now reports that the letter also said the school had “repeatedly” told Hunter to quit “using other toys as make believe guns” The school’s   also emailed Jackson to inform her that he was “notifying the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)” about the suspension.

18634,The American Who Accidentally Became a Chinese Movie Star - The New York Times,"Read in Chinese | 点击查看本文中文版 Every foreigner living in China has his share of China Stories. Jonathan   has more than his share. Here’s one: Not long ago, the    American actor received a call with an offer to appear in “Ip Man 3,” the third in a series of biopics about Bruce Lee’s   master. The role was small, but his agent negotiated what   considered an “outrageous” amount of money for it, and the producers agreed.   was thrilled until he read the script and noticed another part for a foreign actor  —   a bigger and better role as a mobster named Frank. This was troubling.   who is known in China only as Cao Cao, is by far the leading foreign actor working in the country today, having appeared in about 100 movies and television programs since his career began in 1999. He is famous throughout the mainland, and his career has been on a steady upward trajectory. Last December he appeared in the action film “Mojin  —   The Lost Legend,” currently the    movie in Chinese history. Who,   wondered, would the producers have cast instead of him?   sent panicked texts to the movie’s casting director, but they went unanswered. “I felt threatened,” he told me recently, only half kidding. A few days later, he boarded a plane from Beijing to Shanghai to begin filming. When he showed up to the set, the mystery was solved almost immediately: There, slouching on a stool surrounded by a scrum of people, was the former heavyweight champion of the world Mike Tyson. The retired fighter had been cast, perhaps misguidedly, as Frank. (The Village Voice later described Tyson’s performance in the film as “sadly unimpressive. ”)   introduced himself and over the next three days developed a bond with Tyson. “He was not at all what I expected,”   says. The pair discussed their young daughters, Montessori schools and, inevitably, boxing. They also spoke about   something each man knows quite a bit about. “Ip Man 3” went on to gross $115 million at the box office in China, with more than half of that coming on the opening weekend. China’s booming movie market grew by nearly 50 percent last year and is expected to surpass North America’s as the largest in the world by next year. These days, Hollywood studios hardly greenlight a blockbuster without first asking, “How will this play in China?” The rewards are too vast. “Furious 7,” for example, earned $390 million in China  —   more than it made in the United States  —   and was for a time the   film ever in the country. And just as Hollywood has begun to crack the market, Chinese cinema has come into its own. In recent years, Chinese studios have started shifting away from the agitprop that defined their cinematic output for generations and are instead focusing on genres that draw viewers to theaters in any country: action, adventure, comedy. In February, a   comedy called “The Mermaid” became the   movie ever in China within 12 days of its release, earning more than $430 million. Increasingly, Chinese cinemagoers are opting to buy tickets for movies made specifically for them  —   like those in the “Ip Man” series  —   not those that pander to them or lecture them. It is in this sort of film that   has finally had the chance to act, rather than portray a   for Western imperiousness. If the Hollywood studios really want to understand how to succeed in China,  ’s journey makes for a kind of accidental guide. In January, I met   at Beijing Capital International Airport to accompany him on a trip to Yiwu, a trading city in Zhejiang Province, 165 miles from Shanghai. From there we would take a van to Hengdian World Studios, the biggest back lot in the world, where he was filming a new TV series.   was tired. He had flown in a few days before from the Bay Area, where his wife and two young daughters live the actor now splits time between the United States and China, which he has called home for almost two decades.   has wavy brown hair, a thick beard streaked with gray and the kind of broad face that looks good on camera. He curses a lot and often wears a look of deep contemplation that borders on exasperation. As we boarded the plane for our 10:30 p. m. flight, he sported a huge   black parka, which he wears on set  —   Chinese sets are notoriously frigid in the wintertime  —   and carried a heavy backpack filled mostly with equipment for photography, a personal hobby. The airplane was only half full.   lumbered through the center aisle until he reached the last row, where he heaved his backpack onto a seat and plopped down into another as if he were claiming a spot on a   bus. During the   flight,   drank a few cans of Yanjing Beer and discussed his role in last year’s “Mojin. ” In the film, he plays a lawyer to a cult leader. After the first act, he turns into a zombie. It was by far the biggest project of his career, with by far the biggest stars, and it increased his   exposure in China by degrees of magnitude. On our plane, a flight attendant recognized him from the film. (In California, by contrast, he is basically anonymous outside of Chinatowns.)   was happy for the opportunity to appear in such a large movie but was disappointed with his performance, which he believes was adequate but not excellent. “In a lot of TV shows, you just have to spit out the lines, really. But in a big movie, you’ve really got to be good,” he told me. “In my first big movie, I stepped up into the big leagues and hit a single. ” Still, acting in one of the biggest Chinese blockbusters of all time is a long way from where   began. Raised in Torrance, Calif. he attended an arts high school, where he got interested in acting. He went on to study film and molecular biology at New York University. There, he took a Mandarin course and became determined to master the language. He moved to Beijing in 1997 and drifted, living for a period in a student dorm and forcing himself to speak nothing but Mandarin for a   stretch. “Like everybody else, I arrived and bummed around for two years, not knowing what I was going to do, trying to do a bunch of things, failing,” he says. “Teaching English. ” Not long after he arrived, he began dating a Chinese woman named Li Zhiyin, a finance major in college who later became his wife. On one of their early dates, he picked up an   listings magazine and saw an ad seeking a foreign actor for a Chinese movie.   had never lost his love for performing, and he thought it could be fun to act in China. He auditioned and got the part, which was supposed to pay the equivalent of about $400 for three months of work. In the movie, called “Mei Shi Zhao Shi” (“Looking for Trouble”)   plays an American documentary filmmaker following around a group of disillusioned bohemians. He says it took the producers two years to pay him. But two weeks after the movie wrapped, he landed three months of work on a Chinese soap opera. There were only a handful of foreign actors working in China at the time, and   quickly realized he offered filmmakers there a rare combination of traits. He spoke good Mandarin, was a decent actor and had a look that many Chinese consider typically “American”: six feet tall, square jaw, blue eyes. He was able to make a living in the industry, but his early roles weren’t great. At that stage of his career, most filmmakers still had limited exposure to foreigners and foreign cultures, and his early parts tended to reflect Chinese stereotypes of Westerners. He rarely played bad guys, because there are very few American villains in Chinese movies (those roles tend to go to the woeful cohort of Japanese actors working in China). Instead,   was often typecast as a “dumb guy,” he says. Most frequently, he was an arrogant foreign businessman who falls for a local beauty, only to be spurned as she inevitably makes the virtuous choice to stay with her Chinese suitor. Sometimes he played the foreign friend whose presence onscreen is intended to make the main character seem more worldly   dubbed another stock character “the fool,” an arrogant Westerner whose disdain for China is, by the end of the movie, transformed into admiration. When he was studying Mandarin at N. Y. U.   adopted a Chinese moniker, as many language students do. He took his, Cao Cao, from a historical general who is also a central character in one of the country’s most revered classical novels, “Romance of the Three Kingdoms. ” Like a Chinese King Arthur or Davy Crockett, the original Cao Cao exists in fact and fiction and in between.   chose the name because it was easy to remember and because he liked that Cao Cao was a wise,   man. Years later, the decision would prove wise indeed. To his Chinese audience, it showed that the American, despite his loutish onscreen personae, took an interest in their history and culture.   acted in film and television for almost a decade before he truly found fame. Before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, he landed his own segment on a Chinese news program called “Sunday. ” Dubbed “Cao Cao Lai Le” (“Here Comes Cao Cao”) the weekly reality bit was designed to help increase the show’s ratings and give it a more international flavor by allowing Chinese viewers to experience their country anew through a foreigner’s eyes. The segment eventually devolved into   more or less being goofy in front of the camera and enlisting Chinese people to cut loose with him. In one episode, for example, he trains to be a Hooters girl. (In China, the chain is known as “American Owl Restaurant. ”) The show was enormously popular, and soon   was being recognized on the street. “One of the reasons I liked ‘Cao Cao Lai Le’  —   it was me,” he says. “Instead of playing stupid stereotypes on TV and in movies, I could go out and be me. It’s my personal prejudice that I’m more interesting than the characters I play. ” In 2009,   began writing a column called “Token White Guy” for an expat publication, Talk Magazine, in which he chronicled his   and   adventures. He wrote about the time an acquaintance enlisted him to act in an ad campaign,  ’s first. His friend told him the product was “some sort of medicine. ” Then,   showed up on set and read his line, which was written in English: “Do you want to be thicker, longer and harder? Then be like Cao Cao and use Strong Balls Hormone. ” (He dropped the ad.) He wrote about the time he was cast to play an English Jew who falls in love with a prostitute and, riddled with guilt, drops to his knees and prays for forgiveness  —   from Jesus. And the time a Chinese magazine wrote a multi page, entirely fictitious profile of him, and then emailed him a copy. “Cao Cao Lai Le” ran for about three years before the struggling “Sunday” dropped it (“Sunday” soon went off the air as well) but it led to better roles in film and TV and a long line of   hosting gigs, which took him to virtually every region of China  —   from the deserts of the west to the grasslands of the north to the hilly metropolis of Chongqing. Hengdian World Studios is sprawling and surreal, covering 8, 000 acres and featuring a    scale model of Beijing’s Forbidden City. “You walk around, and you can’t tell the difference,”   told me as we drove past the complex on the way to the set the next morning. Around the lot, different shows were being filmed. Tourists are allowed on set for 199 yuan ($30) per person, and groups of them were huddled around as filming took place. It offered a considerably different experience from the one you might encounter at a Universal Studios theme park. “Instead of ‘Jaws,’ it’s, like, killing Japanese or hanging out with the emperor’s concubines,”   said. China’s film industry has long been focused on   historical epics, hence the need for a   Forbidden City replica. Even as China became a global superpower in the late 20th century,   Chinese movies were, by and large, treacly, patriotic fare. And though tastes were shifting, the studios used their connections with the government to ensure their own films succeeded. In 2010, for example, the behemoth   studio and distributor China Film Group pulled “Avatar” from 1, 628 screens and replaced it with its own film, a Confucius biopic starring Chow Yun Fat. These days, movies and television shows are still often historical in nature, but they’re less overtly nationalistic and more focused on pure entertainment.   was in Hengdian to film a period show with the English title “Knight’s Glove. ” In it, he plays the British ambassador to China, a close friend of the Chinese lead. The story surrounds a search for a lost treasure, and on this day the crew was filming the pair’s reunion after years spent apart. The scene was filmed at the entrance to a building made to look like the British Embassy.   plastic Union Jacks fluttered outside in the breeze. Inside, the building was numbingly cold, as   had warned there was no insulation or heating. Russian extras in wool military outfits carried fake rifles and shuffled from side to side trying to keep warm. In between shots,   donned his parka and applied heating pads called Nuan Baobao (“Warm Little Buddies”) to his stomach, lower back and feet. There was no coffee or tea at one point some cast and crew members were handed plastic cups of warm water. Because the Chinese government allows only 34 foreign movies to enter the market per year, and the officials’ criteria for selection are mysterious, many American studios have sought to lessen the uncertainty by   films with Chinese firms, thereby sidestepping the import rules (which apply only when a movie’s producers want a share of the   receipts, which is to say they apply, effectively, to all major Hollywood films). And yet few   have achieved anything resembling commercial or critical success. Not only have studios struggled to find ways to appeal to both audiences, they’ve also struggled to work well together on set. This is at least in part because of the collision of two vastly different moviemaking cultures. Whereas Hollywood film sets have rather rigid,   rules, Chinese sets are decidedly unsystematic, ad hoc,        operations. (I once reported on a film whose   guy was also in charge of payroll.) On this set, there were dozens of people, mostly young men, standing around in the cold who didn’t seem to have any job at all. It’s exactly these sorts of differences that have made     so difficult, and those problems follow them to the box office. Hollywood can also stack the deck somewhat by pandering to Chinese audiences, but that comes at a cost: It grants enormous leverage to the Communist Party over how China is portrayed. Chinese censors have forced studios to cut scenes that they believed made China look weak. A 2015 report by the U. S.  Economic and Security Review Commission offered an enlightening selection of anecdotes: In “Skyfall,” Chinese audiences never saw James Bond kill a Chinese security guard, as he does in the original edit in “Mission: Impossible III,” censors cut a scene shot in Shanghai that showed garments drying on a clothesline “Men in Black 3” had a scene removed that showed secret agents using a   tool, leading some to speculate that the censors didn’t want to invite the allusion to censorship. Often censors don’t even have to get involved, as studios have begun   their films to avoid the hassle. “Red Dawn” is perhaps the most infamous case. The 1984 original is about a guerrilla uprising against a Soviet invasion of America in the 2012 remake, screenwriters updated the movie by casting China as the aggressor. MGM executives realized their error too late, and unwilling to risk offending the censors, they reportedly spent around $1 million in postproduction recasting North Korea as the invader. Despite the breadth of roles he has played in China,   is passed over for most  . Hollywood producers want to bring in their own talent, he says. And once, Chinese producers told him that because of the ubiquity with which he appears in Chinese cinema and television, he would make their production seem too local. He has acted in only two   movies: a   epic funded by a Chinese billionaire with a predominantly foreign cast, and a bigfoot movie shot in Shennongjia, a mountainous region in Hubei Province, where there have been hundreds of purported bigfoot sightings. Each film was plagued with   dysfunction, and neither has been released.   says that the reason most   fail is as much about the chaos on the Chinese side as it is the arrogance on the Hollywood side. “They come here and say, ‘We’re from Hollywood, we know better and whatever it is that you think is the right way to do it, it’s by definition not,’’u2009” he says. “You come in with an attitude like that, you will have a lot of problems. You will misunderstand the kind of stories they want to see. ” And as Chinese filmmakers have figured out what sorts of stories Chinese audiences really want to see, the nature of  ’s work has changed for the better. Although his part in “Knight’s Glove” wasn’t groundbreaking, he is now often cast in increasingly complex parts. After the morning’s shoot, we drove across the lot to film another scene. In the back of the van,   scrolled through photos on his phone of some of the roles he has played over the last two years, each with a distinct   style. They included: an American engineer who worked on the first locomotive in China Gen. Douglas MacArthur an “[expletive] lawyer” a World War II radio announcer a   dancer a   alcoholic barfly a Mafia boss an antiquities expert a sleazy Russian lounge lizard a cowboy a bisexual fashion designer and a French detective.   believes the growing variety of roles for foreign actors like him is a result of more Chinese exposure to outsiders. “There are more foreign actors now,” he says. “Chinese know some foreigners. So they write more interesting characters. I’m lucky because I usually get to do the better stuff. ” This trend is likely to continue. The money coming from Chinese producers, and the spending power of Chinese audiences, is simply too great to ignore, and anyone venturing to China from Hollywood  —   whether producer, actor or cameraman  —   has to learn how to play by Chinese rules. That means adapting stories to the changing desires of film fans, and learning how to cooperate on China’s less regimented movie sets. Hollywood pros may be arrogant, says Jonathan Landreth, editor of the website China Film Insider, who has been covering the Chinese entertainment industry for more than a decade, but “in the melding of minds between China and Hollywood, there’s been a tipping in the balance of power. So much money is driving these productions that the folks in Hollywood have to listen. ” In the afternoon, the director of “Knight’s Glove,” a young man with bleached blond hair, recruited me to play an extra in a scene with  . I would be a driver. I wondered aloud who was supposed to have played the driver, but no one answered, and instead I was shepherded outside to a wardrobe truck and outfitted in a World War   military uniform with a Brodie helmet. As I dressed in the truck,   approached with a Chinese crew member and said, “They asked me to make sure you knew that they weren’t actually going to pay you or anything. ” I laughed. As absurd as it may seem to be yanked from the sidelines in an instant and thrown in front of the camera, this kind of thing happens with surprising regularity for foreigners in China, and moments like these become the kind of China Stories that keep people like   around for so long. We filmed four or five takes of a short scene in the car. I pretended to drive, yanking the steering wheel back and forth with the kind of comical exaggeration you might see in “The Andy Griffith Show. ” Two cameras glided on a track and crane outside the car while   sitting in the back, and a young Russian actor, who sat beside me, exchanged a few lines of dialogue. The Russian had until recently been a student in Jinhua, a nearby city, but was now trying his hand at an acting career. Maybe it would have worked out for him had he started a decade and a half ago, like   but his performance didn’t bode well. He struggled with the lines his English was wooden, the delivery stilted.   on the other hand, naturally eased into character as soon as they started rolling. He said his lines in a British accent, smoothly and barely above a whisper, looking out the window as the camera swept by.",0
18635,"Travis Kalanick, Uber’s Chief, Wants a No. 2 Executive - The New York Times","SAN FRANCISCO  —   Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, is seeking a No. 2 executive to lend him a hand after a bumpy start to his year. Mr. Kalanick issued a   statement on Tuesday saying, “We’re actively looking for a Chief Operating Officer: a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey. ” An Uber spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement. Mr. Kalanick’s search for a chief operating officer follows several blows to Uber this year that have raised questions about the   company’s workplace culture and business tactics. Some of the concerns have extended to Mr. Kalanick’s character, and Tuesday’s announcement shows how he intends to restructure the executive suite to get more help, while continuing to lead the company. Mr. Kalanick said last week that he needed to change as a leader “and grow up,” adding that “I need leadership help, and I intend to get it. ” He spoke as part of an apology for berating an Uber driver in February, an incident that was captured on video and made public. Beyond the video, Uber has been reeling from allegations from former employees about a discriminatory and brutal culture a lawsuit from Waymo, a   vehicle rival, that claims an Uber executive stole intellectual property from it and a social   campaign to delete the Uber app. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Uber has for years used a secret tool called Greyball to identify and circumvent authorities who were trying to clamp down on the   service. Mr. Kalanick, a founder of Uber, has long set its tone. He has taken a pugilistic style toward pushing Uber’s services into cities and towns around the world, often flouting laws and regulations, and has spoken publicly about how his company helped him attract women. Filling an executive position at this level will not be easy. “Generally speaking, talent is very tight, and the pool of available executives within the technology industry is small,” said Richard Marshall, a partner with the executive search firm Korn Ferry. “And for     companies, it’s hard to find someone with the skills needed who is a cultural fit. ” Many Silicon Valley companies have placed experienced executives alongside young founders to help them steer    . Eric Schmidt, now chairman of Alphabet, was once known as the adult supervision for Google’s young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. At Facebook, the social network, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, brought in Sheryl Sandberg, a respected tech executive who is now the company’s chief operating officer.",0
18636,Death of a Red Carpet Reporter - The New York Times,"Jeffrey Slonim didn’t shout. While the other red carpet reporters tried to get the attention of celebrities by yelling their names, he usually waited for them to come to him. And they usually did. Although Mr. Slonim specialized in light journalistic fare, he took it seriously. He wrote out his questions in advance and avoided the clichéd “Who are you wearing?” As a result, the quotations he gleaned had some charm. Kim Kardashian West marched straight to his side. Anne Hathaway greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. Gwyneth Paltrow and Melissa McCarthy breezed past the other   reporters to speak into the recorder that seemed permanently attached to his hand. “He was this little island of sanity at every red carpet,” said Andy Cohen, the Bravo talk show host and author. “When I read the news, I just thought, ‘Wow, how sad. ’” From the 1990s until it all came to a blunt and violent end on Oct. 13, Mr. Slonim, who died at age 56, was a steady and affable presence on the circuit, always neatly turned out and professional as he chronicled the endless balls and premieres. So when he jumped from the roof of a Lincoln Center building, it came as a shock to his relatives, friends and   not to mention the celebrities who considered him a gentleman among brutes. “It still doesn’t register,” said Mr. Slonim’s brother, the artist Hunt Slonem (who spells the family name differently). “It’s like, How? What happened? It’s just so shocking. ” He paused. “Anyway, he really made up his mind. ” Mr. Slonim’s writing for Allure was his main source of income from the   until late 2015, when he lost his special correspondent position at the Condé Nast monthly. The change came as part of a cutback that followed the firing of the magazine’s founding editor, Linda Wells. A few months later, Lena Dunham stopped on the red carpet to tell Mr. Slonim she missed his page. He appreciated that. “What a doll,” he wrote on Facebook. In the last year of his life, he was trying to piece together a living by turning out   items for Gotham, Architectural Digest, Hamptons, the New York Post Page Six column and other outlets. “I don’t want to say that’s what he lived for,” his wife, Fiona Moore, a school administrator, said, “but he really loved his work. ” He cut a stylish figure, never failing to dress for the occasions he covered, which meant crisp tuxes for galas and preppy seersucker suits for summertime Hamptons fetes. He wore his eyeglasses low on the bridge of his nose as he worked, and the J. Press scarf completed the look of someone who might have stepped out of a novel he loved, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Tender Is the Night. ” But the man who might have struck casual onlookers as just another partygoer would inevitably leave the night’s affair for his desk, where he stayed until his copy was ready to file. “Hardest working man in the business,” said George Wayne, a veteran    journalist. “The thing about Jeff is, unlike some of us  —   and I’m one of them  —   he didn’t want to be part of the story. He was always the humble   wretch. He waited at the ropes with everybody else, in the herd. He didn’t mind that. He was so unaffected and so good at his job. ” On a typical day, after working the carpet and filing his items, he would get into bed with his wife at 5 a. m. in their railroad apartment on the Upper East Side and sleep until 7:30. “He wasn’t a great sleeper,” Ms. Moore said. After spending time with his two sons, he would take a nap  —   then it was back to the job. “I just couldn’t believe the pace he kept,” his brother, Mr. Slonem, said. “He’d be up writing until 5, 6 in the morning. He seemed to have deadlines all the time. He’d always say, ‘I’m on deadline  —   I’ve got to have this done in two hours.’ For years this went on. ” To those who saw him only when he was in his element, Mr. Slonim seemed to lead a charmed life, unruffled in a milieu peopled with   celebrities and   publicists. He joined the media scrum at Interview magazine in 1984, when Andy Warhol was overseeing it, thanks, in part, to an introduction from his cousin, the writer Tama Janowitz. Mr. Slonim, a Yale graduate, class of 1982, took the job after an unhappy stint at IBM in Florida, where his habit of moonlighting as a cocktail pianist in a hotel bar suggested he was not cut out for corporate life. He spoke French, Italian, Spanish and Swedish. As a young man he banged out short stories on a portable typewriter. Friends fondly recalled him as an expert orchestrator of parties who sometimes entertained guests with his renditions of Scott Joplin rags and Cole Porter standards. What he did for a living gave him a   seat for the passing celebrity parade. He dined with Warhol at the Odeon. He stood nearby when Tommy Hilfiger got into a fistfight with Axl Rose in the V. I. P. area of the Chelsea club the Plumm. He saw Tom Cruise roar into a Vanity Fair Oscar party on a black Ducati motorcycle. When Prince held an impromptu,     at Lily Pond, a cozy East Hampton nightclub, Mr. Slonim stayed among the dozen or so select guests until 5 a. m. A son of the naval officer and nuclear engineer Capt. Charles E. Slonim, whose career took the family to Hawaii, New Hampshire, Virginia and Washington State, Mr. Slonim early on developed a knack for putting strangers at ease, a skill that came in handy on the red carpet. He met Fiona Moore, the woman who would become his wife, on the Greek island of Ios in the early 1990s. She was on vacation with friends, one of whom had just given her “The Andy Warhol Diaries” as a birthday present. He let her know his name appeared as part of the entry for Thursday, Feb. 12, 1987: “And Jeff Slonim from Interview, he’s Tama’s cousin, and he has perfect teeth, a beautiful toothpaste smile. ” In 1993, Ms. Moore moved into his Lexington Avenue apartment, which is still home for her and their two teenage sons. Their 1995 wedding took place in Cork, Ireland, not far from where Ms. Moore grew up. They found a priest who spoke Hebrew to officiate, as if to provide some middle ground for Mr. Slonim, who was Jewish, and the Roman Catholic Moore family. In his toast, the bride’s father mentioned the Warhol line about Mr. Slonim’s smile, adding that you could judge a horse by the quality of its teeth. Early in the marriage, there was a complication: Mr. Slonim had blood clots and difficulty walking. The diagnosis was polycythemia vera, a rare and   blood cancer that may be present for years before symptoms show up. To treat it, he was prescribed the drug Interferon, which he took at regular intervals from the time of his diagnosis until June of this year, according to three relatives. Ms. Moore saw how the changes in New York’s night life and media business affected her husband’s routine and fortunes. Things turned hectic in the giddy late 1990s, with Mr. Slonim working five nights a week soon after the birth of their first son and the onset of his health problem. But the end of the last decade produced a queasiness for Mr. Slonim and others who relied on magazines for their incomes. Blowback from the economic collapse, which coincided with the rise of digital media, made itself felt at Condé Nast Publications, the owner of Allure, in 2009. That is when a McKinsey  Company report led to a budget cut of 25 percent at several Condé Nast magazines. The company rid itself of Cookie, Details, Domino, Men’s Vogue and Portfolio. Toward the end of 2015, amid layoffs at GQ, Glamour, Self and Teen Vogue, Mr. Slonim and 14 other Allure contributors lost their yearly contracts. The cutback occurred at roughly the same time as the firing of Ms. Wells. “People were terrified and upset,” Ms. Moore said. “I think Linda being fired was devastating for him. ” The job of celebrity and society reporter, even one at the top of this rarefied field, seemed no longer enough for a family breadwinner. As Mr. Slonim grappled with this, his health issue came to the fore. In June, he stopped taking Interferon. He told his brother that his doctor had taken him off the drug because it was no longer effective for him. Ms. Moore said he started taking a new drug, in the same family as Interferon, but it left him in a low mood. Ray Rogers, an editor who worked with Mr. Slonim at Interview, BlackBook and other publications, was concerned when he saw his friend at an East Hampton benefit over the Labor Day weekend. “I said to him: ‘Jeff, what’s wrong? Are you O. K.?’” Mr. Rogers said. “He looked despondent. He was not himself. And he was like, ‘I’m fine, I’m fine.’ And I said, ‘Jeff, what’s wrong?’ I must have asked him that in three different ways. ” Mr. Slonim’s work often took him to Lincoln Center, where the red carpet is rolled out dozens of nights every year. On Sept. 20, on assignment for Gotham magazine’s website, he interviewed Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband, Matthew Broderick, at a Lincoln Center benefit for the New York City Ballet. On Oct. 7, also on assignment for Gotham, he covered the premiere of Pedro Almodóvar’s “Julieta,” part of the 54th New York Film Festival. Earlier that day, he called his sister, a psychiatric social worker and professor, Anne Slonim Rafal, and said he was having dark thoughts. After she laid out counseling options for him, he said, as she recalled it, “You know, I’m just being dramatic. ” At home, he told his wife about the call to his sister, and the two of them discussed the possibility of his going on an antidepressant. But Mr. Slonim was against the idea, partly because he did not like the way people looked when they were medicated. “And then I said, ‘Well, if you’re on medication, you’re actually going to feel so much better, so you’re not going to care,” Ms. Moore said. But her argument did not sway him. “And that, I think, was probably the problem,” she added. “Maybe he should have started taking something. ” They spent the weekend in East Hampton, and things seemed to be looking up. “It was a lovely time,” Ms. Moore said. “Hurricane Matthew was coming in, and we went to the beach and all of that. He kept saying, ‘I feel so much better,’ so of course I believed him. ” After the Hamptons idyll, Mr. Slonim went to    Cornell Medical Center to see his hematologist. He apparently spoke of his recent thoughts, and the hospital placed him under observation. His wife said he called from the hospital, saying he wanted to leave. Mr. Slonim also called his sister, Dr. Slonim Rafal, who advised him to be honest with staff members and to follow their recommendations. “They never admitted him,” she said. “They just observed him for, I would say, 36 hours, maybe 48. ” “He wanted out of there, big time,” Ms. Moore said. “He compared it to like the seven rings of hell, basically. ” (A public affairs officer at the hospital said that “regarding Jeffrey Slonim,” she had “no information available. ”) Mr. Slonim was released and made his way home on the evening of Oct. 11, his wife said, and he seemed in good spirits. The next morning, they went for a run together, and he said, as she recalled it: “I can see color for the first time. This is amazing. ” He was also making plans  —   lunches for the following week and a meeting at the Condé Nast human resources department. “He felt he needed to reinvent himself, that print was dying,” Ms. Moore said. “So he was working on his résumé. ” On the morning of Oct. 13, he went to Lincoln Center. The Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Lawn was closed, but he slipped past a chain gate and made his way to its northern edge, above the West 65th Street sidewalk. The lawn, which serves as the roof for the   Lincoln Ristorante, has become an architectural showpiece and neighborhood attraction since it opened to the public in 2010. At the time of the unveiling, the New York Times architectural critic Nicolai Ouroussoff singled out the lawn for praise in his review of the Lincoln Center renovations: “The project’s most dazzling space, the lawn warps up on two sides, so that climbing it can make you feel as if you were about to float off into the air on a carpet of green. ” At its high point, the    expanse of grass is 23 feet above the sidewalk. At 10:52 a. m. someone called 911. Documents from the New York Police Department note “a    male who’s observed pacing    on a roof and sitting on a ledge. ” A crowd formed outside the entrances to the restaurant and the nearby Elinor Bunin Film Center. Two Lincoln Center security guards were talking to Mr. Slonim, and it seemed to be working. At one point, he turned around and moved away from the ledge  —   only to come back. People screamed “No!” when he made his move and hit the sidewalk below. “At 11:05 a. m. the unit was on scene,” a spokeswoman for the Fire Department of New York said in an email. “The unit departed the scene at 11:13 a. m. with one patient to   Hospital. ” Despite the doctors’ efforts, Mr. Slonim died later that day, his wife said. “Here’s a guy who spent his whole career covering high society  —   and to take his life, he walked over to Lincoln Center and jumped,” his friend Mr. Rogers said. “It seemed intentional to me. It seemed pointed. ” Back in the apartment, Ms. Moore found a note on the computer. “He’s rambling and stuff,” she said, “but he thanks a couple of people, and he thanks Linda Wells. It’s really sweet. ” With tears streaming down her face during an interview in her apartment, she went on: “I understand the whole concept of  —   not that he committed suicide, but suicide took him. I know that he didn’t have a choice. Because it wasn’t him that did this. I know he would never dream of doing that and leaving us. And I know that. ” Julianne Moore was another movie star who made a beeline toward Mr. Slonim at red carpet events. Their relationship went back to the   when they were each other’s dates for a homecoming dance at J. E. B. Stuart High School in Falls Church, Va. On the rainy, dark afternoon of Dec. 18, Ms. Moore was among the roughly 350 mourners crowded into the Fourth Universalist Society church on Central Park West. Nearby sat Mr. Slonim’s wife and their sons. Speakers included his two sisters, who recalled the Superman costume he wore as a boy his    Dominic Moore, who described his generosity with the swag bags he picked up at parties the   film producer Bruce Cohen, who reminisced about his days with Mr. Slonim in middle school, at Yale and on the red carpet and the former Allure editor Ms. Wells, who spoke last. “Jeffrey hit the red carpet and he loved it,” she said. “Which sounds hard to believe, now that the red carpet is so often a shouting match and a total fame orgy. But he did, and he respected it, too. ” After describing his amusing encounters with Roseanne Barr, George Clooney and Donald J. Trump, she continued: “You could tell he had a genuine connection with the subjects, many of whom made a ritual out of greeting him with a kiss. He gave as much time and attention to the Oscar winner as he did to the guy who was voted off ‘Survivor: Borneo. ’” A montage of still photographs projected onto a small movie screen gave glimpses of Mr. Slonim from babyhood to adulthood. After the clergyman said a few final words, the mourners stayed in place for a long moment, silent and not quite ready to leave.",0
18637,Times Names Wall Street Journal Editor to Its Masthead - The New York Times,"Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, has been named a deputy managing editor of The New York Times, one of the top leadership positions at the newspaper. Ms. Blumenstein will become one of the   women in The Times’s newsroom. She will join three other deputy managing editors  —   Janet Elder Clifford Levy, who was promoted last week and Matthew Purdy. In a note to the staff announcing the appointment on Tuesday, Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and Joe Kahn, the managing editor, said that Ms. Blumenstein, 50, would help the newsroom “do all the big things we intend to do in 2017 and beyond. ” In particular, they said, Ms. Blumenstein “will focus on making sure we remain an essential destination for readers interested in business, finance, economics and technology. ” In recent months, the newsroom has had a dearth of female leaders. In September, Susan Chira stepped down as deputy executive editor to write about gender issues, and in December, Lydia Polgreen, an associate masthead editor, left to become the top editor at The Huffington Post. Ms. Blumenstein’s appointment will quite likely be seen as a positive step, though it is notable that The Times named an outsider rather than promoting a woman from within. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kahn said it was “absolutely not the case’’ that they could not find a woman within The Times to play a role in newsroom leadership. “This is about Rebecca, who I think has a skill set, a perspective and the experience running a big newsroom that Dean and I and the others at the top of the masthead felt that we needed, to make sure that we’re putting our best foot forward in terms of this digital transition,” Mr. Kahn said. He added that there would be other masthead announcements soon. Ms. Blumenstein was seen as a potential successor to Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Journal, and news of her departure was met with surprise and sadness in the Journal newsroom, where she is known for her passion for breaking news. Asked how it felt to lure someone of Ms. Blumenstein’s caliber from a highly respected competitor, Mr. Kahn was circumspect in his reply. “I can only say that I follow and deeply admire The Journal’s coverage, and they’re a fierce competitor and a constant source of concern for us,” Mr. Kahn said. “So of course it’s meaningful to have one of their top editors come and join us. ” In a note to employees, Mr. Baker called Ms. Blumenstein “a peerless exponent and advocate of the very highest quality journalism. ” “She has been a singularly principled and dignified leader and a great mentor and friend to so many colleagues here,” he wrote. The appointment comes as both news organizations work to determine a strategy for an increasingly digital world. Both have initiated sweeping newsroom strategy reviews that have left employees anxious and uncertain about their futures. Last month, The Times released the findings of its review in a report that called for rapid change. Ms. Blumenstein has worked at The Journal since 1995, where she has held numerous senior positions, including managing editor of WSJ. com and international editor. As the newspaper’s China bureau chief, she led her team to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. China was also where she and Mr. Kahn, who worked in the Beijing bureau for The Times, got to know each other, Mr. Kahn said. “She was unrelenting in pushing her team hard to beat us,” he said.",0
18638,Hungary’s Top Court Blocks Village Ban on Mosques and Burkas,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)  —   Hungary’s Constitutional Court has repealed a ban by a village led by a   mayor on the construction of mosques and headscarves like burkas and chadors worn by Muslim women. [The court said Wednesday that the ban, also outlawing the activity of muezzins, infringed on freedoms of religion and speech.  The measure had been in place since November in the village of Asotthalom, on the Serbian border, led by Mayor Laszlo Toroczkai of the   Jobbik party. Before Hungary built fences on its borders with Serbia and Croatia in late 2015, Asotthalom was a frequent point of entry into Hungary for migrants and refugees on their way to Western Europe. Last year, Toroczkai said the ordinance was adopted to defend the village’s “community and traditions. ”",0
18639,Former Prime Minister Is Elected President of Struggling Somalia - The New York Times,"A man everyone calls Cheese won Somalia’s presidency on Wednesday, and the streets of the beleaguered capital, Mogadishu, exploded in cheers. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a former prime minister, was chosen for the top job, capping a   electoral process that had been widely criticized as corrupt even by Somali politicians who participated in it. Mr. Mohamed, better known in Somalia by his nickname, Farmajo (from formaggio, the Italian word for cheese, for which his father was said to have acquired a taste when Somalia was an Italian colony) was considered the protest candidate and less manipulated by foreign interests than the departing president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Mr. Mohamed enjoys wide support within Somalia’s army. The moment his victory was announced, celebratory gunfire rang out in Mogadishu as soldiers across the city sprayed bullets into the sky. Mr. Mohamed is rare on the Somali political scene for one reason: He is popular. Crowds of ordinary people poured into Mogadishu’s streets to cheer and whistle on Wednesday night. As one Somalia analyst put it: The least corrupt and    candidate won Somalia’s most corrupt and least democratic election. Go figure. Somalia, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the central government collapsed in 1991, did not hold direct elections. Instead, Western donors helped set up a complicated indirect election in which Somalia’s regions and its myriad clans, subclans and subsubclans chose 329 members of Parliament, and those members of Parliament then voted for a president. Western officials thought it too dangerous to hold direct elections because of the persistent threat from the Shabab militant group, which has killed thousands across East Africa. On Tuesday, the Shabab fired mortar rounds into the area in Mogadishu where the election was being held. Mr. Mohamud, the incumbent, handily won the first round of voting, leading Mr. Mohamed by 88 to 72 votes in a field of more than 20 candidates. Many analysts said that Mr. Mohamud had built a huge war chest by receiving secret payments from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, and that he used that money to line up votes ahead of time in Parliament. Many analysts considered it his election to lose. But Mr. Mohamed seems to have tapped into growing resentment about corruption, or possibly, some analysts said, he had his own ways to win over lawmakers. In the last few years, Somali government officials have been steadily enriching themselves, analysts said, while much of the population has sunk deeper into poverty. Aid workers are now worried that millions of Somalis will soon face a famine it would be the third one in 25 years. In the second round of voting, the other presidential contenders threw their weight behind Mr. Mohamed. He won, 184 to 97. Western diplomats quietly cheered on Mr. Mohamed, seeing him as the most organized  —   and least crooked  —   of the contenders. But just about everyone agrees that Somalia still has a long way to go. The government provides few services and controls only small slices of territory. The only reason it controls any territory is the presence of thousands of African Union peacekeepers who have been battling the Shabab for years, taking heavy casualties. Mr. Mohamed, who was born in 1962, had a good reputation as prime minister. As soon as he took office in 2010, he set up a payroll system for soldiers, shrank a bloated cabinet and spoke out against corruption, even though graft continued to blossom on his watch. When he was pushed out less than a year later, as part of a bitter power struggle within the government, protests exploded. Before entering politics, Mr. Mohamed worked as a diplomat for the Somali government and later for the New York State Department of Transportation in Buffalo. He holds American and Somali citizenship, and when he returned to his cubicle in Buffalo after his short stint as prime minister, his   baked him a cake.",0
18640,FBI Investigates Saudi Wife-Abusing Clinton Foundation Donor in Straw Donor Scheme,"FBI Investigates Saudi Wife-Abusing Clinton Foundation Donor in Straw Donor Scheme November 2, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
It's midnight in America. And the Clintons and the Democratic Party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory. I'm sure the line on this will be that the FBI is acting ""inappropriately"" by investigating this. Investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected. 
The FBI is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy Saudi family that supports Democratic Florida Senate candidate Patrick Murphy. 
Murphy, who has covered himself in glory so often already, is denying everything. And I mean absolutely everything. 
The Murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the FBI probe 
What's your name? I decline to answer that question. 
Murphy, 33, is running against Rubio, the incumbent Republican, in a race that could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017. Rubio currently leads Murphy by an average of 5.6 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics. 
The FBI investigation, however, relates to Murphy’s first run for the House in the 2012 campaign cycle. 
The allegation — originally submitted by a Republican super PAC run by a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — is that Murphy’s high school friend and major political donor, Ibrahim Al-Rashid, coordinated a “straw donor” scheme to boost Murphy. 
Murphy knows nothing! 
Murphy’s campaign declined to say whether Murphy’s attorneys had discussed the FBI investigation with Al-Rashid’s attorney. 
Uh-huh 
Al-Rashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected Saudi billionaire. He’s been a major financial benefactor of Murphy’s, giving almost $400,000 to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the Florida congressman. 
Here's how some of these donations worked. 
One example within the alleged scheme: A woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the “owner” and “property manager” of a Texas-based company, Limestone Property Management, gave Murphy’s campaign $300. 
But she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the Texas-based company. In fact, she doesn’t work there. 
She lived in Miami at the time and was Ibrahim Al-Rashid’s “cleaning lady,” according to a Miami-Dade Police Department report filed in 2012 over a home burglary at Al-Rashid’s property. 
Texas property manager vs Saudi's cleaning lady. That's quite a difference. 
Murphy has been forced to return Al-Rashid's donations before for purely Islamophobic reasons. 
Al-Rashid’s three sons have followed in their father’s political footsteps, contributing large sums to top Democrats, including Rep. Patrick Murphy (D., Fla.), whose Senate race could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017. 
Murphy has already returned a portion of al-Rashid’s donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident. 
Ibrahim al-Rashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wife’s Pennsylvania home, where al-Rashid allegedly “grabbed her by the wrist, struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground,” according to a copy of the police report viewed by the Free Beacon. 
Following the 2014 incident, al-Rashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating, “I am not sorry this time I hope you die in hell,” according to the police report. 
Murphy, a longtime friend of al-Rashid, was recently forced to donate around $16,000 in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign. Murphy also returned all of the donations made by al-Rashid during the last three political cycles. 
Is the Clinton Foundation involved in this? Do the Clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets? 
Nasser al-Rashid, one of Saudi Arabia’s wealthiest figures and an adviser to the country’s royal family, has donated somewhere between $1 million to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, putting him in an elite category of prominent donors. 
The Clintons. If there's dirt anywhere, you'll find it on them.",0
18641,2 White House Officials Helped Give Nunes Intelligence Reports - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A pair of White House officials helped provide Representative Devin Nunes of California, a Republican and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, with the intelligence reports that showed that President Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. The revelation on Thursday that White House officials disclosed the reports, which Mr. Nunes then discussed with Mr. Trump, is likely to fuel criticism that the intelligence chairman has been too eager to do the bidding of the Trump administration while his committee is supposed to be conducting an independent investigation of Russia’s meddling in the presidential election. It is the latest twist of a bizarre Washington drama that began after dark on March 21, when Mr. Nunes got a call from a person he has described only as a source. The call came as he was riding across town in an Uber car, and he quickly diverted to the White House. The next day, Mr. Nunes gave a hastily arranged news conference before going to brief Mr. Trump on what he had learned the night before from  —   as it turns out  —   White House officials. The chain of events  —   and who helped provide the intelligence to Mr. Nunes  —   was detailed to The New York Times by four American officials. Since disclosing the existence of the intelligence reports, Mr. Nunes has refused to identify his sources, saying he needed to protect them so others would feel safe going to the committee with sensitive information. In his public comments, he has described his sources as   trying to expose wrongdoing at great risk to themselves. That does not appear to be the case. Several current American officials identified the White House officials as Ezra   the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel’s Office and was previously counsel to Mr. Nunes’s committee. Though neither has been accused of breaking any laws, they do appear to have sought to use intelligence to advance the political goals of the Trump administration. Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, refused to confirm or deny at his daily briefing that Mr. Ellis and Mr.   were Mr. Nunes’s sources. The administration’s concern was the substance of the intelligence reports, not how they ended up in Mr. Nunes’s hands, Mr. Spicer said. The “obsession with who talked to whom, and when, is not the answer,” Mr. Spicer said. “It should be the substance. ” Jack Langer, a spokesman for Mr. Nunes, said in a statement, “As he’s stated many times, Chairman Nunes will not confirm or deny speculation about his source’s identity, and he will not respond to speculation from anonymous sources. ” Mr.   30, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency official who served on the Trump transition team and was originally brought to the White House by Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. He was nearly pushed out of his job this month by Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who replaced Mr. Flynn as national security adviser, but survived after the intervention of Jared Kushner, the president’s    and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist. The officials who detailed the newly disclosed White House role said that this month, shortly after Mr. Trump claimed on Twitter that he was wiretapped during the campaign on the orders of President Barack Obama, Mr.   began reviewing highly classified reports detailing the intercepted communications of foreign officials. There were conflicting accounts of what prompted Mr.   to dig into the intelligence. One official with direct knowledge of the events said Mr.   began combing through intelligence reports this month in an effort to find evidence that would justify Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts about wiretapping. But another person who was briefed on the events said Mr.   came upon the information as he was reviewing how widely intelligence reports on intercepts were shared within the American spy agencies. He then alerted the N. S. C. general counsel, but the official said Mr.   was not the person who showed the reports to Mr. Nunes. That person and a third official said it was then Mr. Ellis who allowed Mr. Nunes to view the material. The intelligence reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about how they were trying to develop contacts within Mr. Trump’s family and inner circle before his inauguration, officials said. The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the intelligence and to avoid angering Mr.   and Mr. Ellis. Officials say Mr.   has been reviewing the reports from his   office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the National Security Council is based. The officials’ description of the intelligence is in line with Mr. Nunes’s characterization of the material, which he said was not related to the Russia investigations when he first disclosed its existence. According to Mr. Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, he met his source on the grounds of the White House. He said he needed a secure location where people with security clearances could legally view classified information, though such facilities could also be found in the Capitol building and at other locations across Washington. The next day, Mr. Nunes gave a news briefing at the Capitol and then returned to the White House to brief Mr. Trump on the information before telling other committee members about what he had reviewed. His actions have fueled criticism that the committee, under his leadership, is unable to conduct a serious, independent investigation. On Thursday, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he needed clarification on whether White House officials had pursued “a circuitous route” to feed Mr. Nunes the materials so he could then hand them to Mr. Trump. “If that was designed to hide the origin of the materials, that raises profound questions about just what the White House is doing that need to be answered,” he said. He later said he accepted an invitation on Thursday to review the same materials that Mr. Nunes had seen. Yet even before Thursday, the view among Democrats and even some Republicans was that Mr. Nunes was given access to the intelligence reports to divert attention from the investigations into Russian meddling, and to bolster Mr. Trump’s debunked claims of having been wiretapped. On both counts, Mr. Nunes appears to have succeeded: The House inquiry into Russian meddling that he is leading has descended into a sideshow since he disclosed the information, and the administration has portrayed his information as vindicating the president’s wiretapping claims. Yet Mr. Nunes has dismissed Democratic calls to step aside. Instead, he has canceled all committee hearings for now, stalling his own investigation, which opened last week with a hearing during which James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. publicly disclosed that the bureau’s investigation into Russian meddling included an examination of any evidence that Trump associates had colluded in the effort. The chaotic situation prompted the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is running its own investigation, to bluntly state on Wednesday that their work had nothing to do with the House inquiry. And television news programs have been dominated by arguments about whether the incidental intelligence gathering of Mr. Trump and his associates was the real issue, or simply a distraction from the Russia investigations. Mr. Nunes has acknowledged that the incidental intelligence gathering on Trump associates last year was not necessarily unlawful, and that it was not specifically directed at Mr. Trump or people close to him. American intelligence agencies typically monitor foreign officials of allied and hostile countries, and they routinely sweep up communications linked to Americans who may be taking part in the conversation or are being spoken about. The real issue, Mr. Nunes has said, was that he could figure out the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. He said some Trump associates were also identified by name in the reports. Normally, intelligence agencies mask the identities of American citizens who are incidentally present in intercepted communications, though knowledgeable readers can often figure out the identities in context.",0
18642,Pakistan police detain dozens of Imran Khan's supporters in Islamabad,"Pakistan Pakistan's cricketer turned politician Imran Khan (C) talks to journalists outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad on October 20, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Police have raided a youth convention for opposition leader Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf (PTI) party in the capital, Islamabad, arresting dozens of activists ahead of a planned protest. 
Images on local news channels showed police in uniform beating activists with batons and leading those detained away to waiting buses. 
""All of a sudden police arrived and started arresting people,"" media outlets quoted Anila Khawaja, a spokeswoman for PTI as saying. 
Several PTI leaders and lawmakers have been infuriated by the police raid. 
""The government has proved that there is no democracy in Pakistan, it is a monarchy,” Asad Umar, a PTI lawmaker, told reporters from the scene. 
A spokesman for the Islamabad district administration said the raid was enforcing the order issued earlier in the day by the city's top administrator which outlawed gatherings of more than five people. 
The Thursday raid came hours after a city order banned all public gatherings ahead of Khan's planned protest set to begin on November 2 in Islamabad. Khan, a former Pakistan cricket star who turned politician, has described the upcoming mass protest as a final push to force Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resign over corruption allegations.

Khan led a previous mass protest in the summer of 2014 in front of parliament, calling for the government to resign over election rigging allegations. 
Khan has insisted that his anti-government protests would continue until the Sharif administration offers an appropriate response to the corruption allegations. 
Leaked confidential documents from the Panamanian Mossack Fonseca law firm have showing how the company helped rich and powerful clients across the world with shady businesses. 
The clients reportedly included three of Sharif's children, who carried out business transactions which could be judged as money laundering and tax avoidance. 
The leaked records revealed that Sharif's children, Hasan, Hussain and Maryam, not only owned offshore companies, but also real estate properties in London. Sharif's family denies any wrongdoing. 
People in Pakistan, with Imran Khan at the helm, are asking for an inquiry to determine how Sharif’s children made all that money to buy offshore companies and real estate in London's prime locations, and whether they had paid their due tax on their income. Loading ...",0

18644,"‘Swiss Army Man,’ the Strangest Movie Shown at Sundance? - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   In “Swiss Army Man,” Hank (Paul Dano) a castaway stranded on a deserted island, spies a body washed up on the beach. Driven   by hunger and despair, he rushes into the surf, only to discover that the body, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is lifeless. Or is it? To Hank’s surprise, the corpse breaks wind, loudly and lustily. Moments later, Hank whoops with glee as he pilots the   Mr. Radcliffe across a   ocean. When “Swiss Army Man” had its premiere at Sundance in January, it became one of the festival’s most   films, eventually winning a directing award. But despite positive reviews (Variety said it was “constantly inventive,” and The Hollywood Reporter called it “bizarrely poetic”) festivalgoers walked out in droves and Vanity Fair wondered if it wasn’t the strangest film in Sundance history. For online commentators who hadn’t seen the film, “Swiss Army Man,” a. k. a. “Daniel Radcliffe’s   movie,” became an easy target. “The premise kind of lends itself to that,” acknowledged Daniel Kwan, the film’s  . “A lot of the   reactions online have been about how stupid this movie sounds. ” Known professionally as Daniels, Mr. Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have created some of the most inventive and visceral shorts and music videos of the past decade. Other directors, like Spike Jonze and Antoine Fuqua, have graduated from music videos to feature films, but few have made music videos as unsettling as Daniels’ work. Which was why no one was pounding on their doors to make “Swiss Army Man. ” The film, which opens Friday, June 24, is the first feature from Mr. Kwan, 28, and Mr. Scheinert, 29. The two are here in the backyard studio of Mr. Kwan’s Highland Park neighborhood home, which he shares with his fiancée, Kirsten Lepore, an   animator. Mr. Kwan’s brother, James, lives here, too he’s an animator and children’s book writer and illustrator (“Dear Yeti”). Mr. Scheinert lives less than a   away. “When we were editing the film here, I would just walk over with my dog every day,” Mr. Scheinert said. The directors, who often finish each other’s sentences and stories or clarify each other’s points, met in a   animation class at Emerson College in Boston. “We didn’t like each other at first,” Mr. Scheinert said, adding that he overparticipated and that Mr. Kwan underparticipated, coming off “like a ‘wasting his parents’ money’ film kid. ” But they soon bonded after they discovered they shared similarly twisted artistic sensibilities. Mr. Kwan’s final school project was an animated short about an insomniac who undresses people while they sleep and does their laundry for them Mr. Scheinert’s starred a dead boy whose body is piloted by small tigers. They began directing music videos and short films together, fantastical pieces in which small dogs are ridden like skateboards (“Dogboarding”) a man kills a red ball after it makes love with his wife (“Interesting Ball”) and a drunk partyer vomits sparks (“Pigeons,” by the band the Hundred in the Hands). Several went viral many featured the directors in starring roles. “Swiss Army Man” began as little more than a joke. “It was Kwan’s idea, originally,” Mr. Scheinert said. “He pitched me this idea of a guy stranded on a desert island finding a corpse and feeding it beans through a funnel, then riding the farts off into the sunset as beautiful music plays. ” The idea was too expensive to film as a short, but the two kept it in their voluminous backlog of weird ideas. And then another idea hit them. Why not make the corpse an amnesiac who must be reminded of the life he left behind to coax him to find his way back to civilization? That could be a feature, they thought. They toyed with various scenarios, and in 2014 the pair entered the Sundance Institute’s Screenwriter Lab. On their off hours, looking for a mental respite from “talking to all those genius filmmakers about how to make your script better,” they pitched a music video for “Turn Down for What,” a dance track by Lil Jon and DJ Snake. “We were like, this is the stupidest song we’ve ever been sent,” Mr. Scheinert said. “Let’s pitch the stupidest video we’ve ever pitched. ” In the video’s opening moments, Mr. Kwan simulates sex with a neighbor’s TV set, melts a police officer’s face and smashes potted plants against his crotch. “In my head, I was like, this might be the last music video anyone asks us to do,” he said. Instead, “Turn Down for What” became one of the most popular and critically acclaimed music videos of 2014, landing multiple MTV Video Music Award nominations and receiving nearly half a billion YouTube views. After completing the script for “Swiss Army Man,” Daniels began searching for the two leads. “I was in from the second or third page, from the moment Hank rides the farting corpse across the ocean,” Mr. Dano said. “It was so funny and absurd and beautiful and glorious, I was like, why didn’t I think of that?” Mr. Radcliffe soon followed, and the two began working   days in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco, and in the redwood forests outside Eureka, Calif. “The atmosphere that the Daniels create on set is like no other I’ve ever worked on,” Mr. Radcliffe said. “They’re so collaborative. Everyone there had either worked together for years on their music videos, or they’d known since college. ” Working with actors of that caliber was a rare treat for the directors. “It spoiled us,” Mr. Kwan said. “We’re used to working with bands who’ve never acted before, or with us and our friends, who don’t really act but just happen to be around. ” The result is not your typical zombie flick or screwball comedy. If anything, it’s a bromance of the purest sort, even though one of the bros is dead, sort of. It’s also a love story, complete with an underwater kiss and the discovery that Mr. Radcliffe’s penis can be used as a field compass. As teenagers, the directors were subjected to “hazing in high school,” Mr. Kwan said. “We were both very expressive boys, neither of us were that good at sports, and that was just something we lived with and kind of accepted. So it’s funny that we tried to make a survival film, which is the most masculine story there is, but ended up making the least manly survival film ever. The two of them sit in the woods, and they talk about their feelings. ”",0
18645,EXCLUSIVE - ’Separation of Church and State!’: Leftist Activists Disrupt Michigan Town Hall,"A group of leftist activists wearing pink pussy hats disrupted a Christian opening prayer at Rep. Jack Bergman’s ( ) Thursday evening town hall in Gaylord, Michigan, shouting, “Separation of church and state!” as other constituents stood with their heads bowed in respect. [Dr. Derek Hagland, the assistant pastor at Grace Baptist Church in Michigan’s First District, had just taken the stage to recite an invocation when activists began chanting, “Separation of church and state!” to disrupt him:   “This guy was giving invocation,” Rep. Bergman’s communication director Farahn Morgan told Breitbart News. “He was not necessarily party affiliated in any way. That kind of reaction to him? It was the most aggressive that the crowd got during the entire event which was, quite honestly, shocking. ” She added that it was surprising that these activists refused “to engage in dialogue after months of demanding there be a dialogue. The display was upsetting for the constituents who attended and really wanted to participate in a dialogue and hear what the congressman thinks and share their thoughts with him in a constructive way. The activists’ behavior flew in the face of any constructive dialogue. ” She described the incident as “a coordinated fiasco. ” Video footage of the event, provided to Breitbart News by an attendee, showed some Republicans and community leaders standing with their heads bowed during the prayer, despite the disruptive chants. Some of the activists wore pink pussy hats, the same ones donned as a symbol of “resistance” during   Donald Trump protests across the nation following his inauguration:  Morgan also noted that the interruption did not sit well with some of Rep. Bergman’s Democrat constituents. “A lot of Democrats approached us tonight and said they were embarrassed and apologized. They said those activists did not represent them or what they are about. I thought that was an interesting dynamic. ” Bergman, a retired   general who served in the Marine Corps, also held a town hall on Wednesday evening:  “Last night, the crowd was certainly more orderly,” Morgan said. She added that there was also a prayer recited Wednesday evening, “but local media live streamed last night’s event and many local groups watched it and planned how to react to tonight’s town hall. ” She said the group Indivisible was most likely one of the main groups involved in the disruption. Morgan said Congressman Bergman felt “disappointed” by the display. Several hours earlier, he had tweeted his enthusiasm about holding constructive dialogue: Gaylord town hall is just starting!

18646,"Your Photos as Princess Leia, a Rebel and Role Model - The New York Times","When Carrie Fisher was cast as Princess Leia in the 1977 film “Star Wars,” she was a    with no idea that her character would come to mean so much for so many. “You’re not just an actor in this movie,” Ms. Fisher said, “you’re a diplomat to a country you didn’t know existed. ” Leia proved especially meaningful to female fans, who found their own new hope in Ms. Fisher’s portrayal of the lone woman at the center of the action. Few movies showcased heroines who showed more guts and ingenuity than many of the men around her. Girls got a new uniform, too  —   instead of putting on a tiara and waving a wand, this princess wrapped her hair into a couple of practical buns and held a blaster in her hand. Over the past 40 years, generations of female “Star Wars” fans have made the character their own, using her image and example as a tool in their own lives. In commemoration of Ms. Fisher’s life, we asked readers to share what she and Leia have meant to them, and the lessons from the character that they will carry on. Here are their edited responses. Liz Cornelius, 37 My husband returned from a one year deployment to Iraq in time to help choose a costume for our daughter, Margot, who had just turned one. We asked ourselves: “Who is a character who is a strong woman? Who is a hero to our generation, and who fought bravely alongside the men? Also, who wore a costume that was comfortable for a baby who is taking her first steps?” This, of course, ruled out Lara Croft, Tomb Raider. We both knew that Princess Leia was the perfect costume choice for our baby daughter, and it must be said: The Force was strong with her. Lisa Roberts, 36 When my daughter was 5 days old, December 2015, we had these photos taken. We chose to name our daughter Lillian, but we seriously considered naming her Leia. Leia is an aspirational character, not because she is a princess, but because she was a rebel for positive change, because she proved that she could rescue herself, and because she was kind above all else. We hope that our daughter can grow into those qualities. Julia Ward, 42 As a child, I never remember thinking consciously about gender. Whenever my brother and I would play, I always just wanted to be the hero of the story. So, I often pretended to be   or Sherlock Holmes or even James Bond. It never occurred to me to be a princess  —   not until Princess Leia. I couldn’t articulate it at the time, but Leia was our first   princess. She was as spunky, stubborn and exciting as every little girl I knew, including me. This picture was taken at Halloween sometime between the release of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi. ” My mother made the costume and helped me with the eye shadow and braids. Leia was the only princess I ever wanted to be. Nia Hays, 36 My    son is obsessed with Darth Vader  —   never having seen the film. But it was the perfect excuse for me then to join in on the Halloween fun and dress up as the   Princess Leia. Michele Anderson, 44 This was my Mom at about    dressed as Princess Leia. She had a wonderful sense of humor and played along with our request to dress like her royal highness. R. I. P. Mom and Carrie Fisher. Anam Ahmad, 26 Princess Leia inspired me to be a strong, bold, unapologetic woman who stood up for what was right and spoke up. She taught me to speak my mind and go after my dreams no matter how scary they were. I decided to cosplay her for the premiere of “The Force Awakens,” and every time I do, it’s an instant confidence boost. She taught me to be brave, and it’s an honor to dress up like her. I cosplay as her classic “A New Hope” look because it’s elegant and it was the easiest to incorporate my hijab into. Carrie Fisher is the reason I haven’t given up on writing and she’s the one that led me to stand up for what’s right and not be afraid to fight for it. Tim Beveridge, 43 I dressed as a bearded Leia for my first “Star Wars” convention, Celebration Europe, in London in August 2016. Although I hadn’t seen the original films until I was 18, her character resonated with me as one who fought to recognize the rights of the “rebel,” or in my case, an    gay man who was struggling to feel accepted. After finding out more about her literary and advocacy work over the years, I had even more respect for her as a person, so she was the logical choice to cosplay as when I decided to attend Celebration Europe earlier this year. Needless to say, the reaction from other fans was incredible. Bekah Platzer, 20 I dress up as classic Leia for children and charity. Growing up, I was made fun of for liking “Star Wars,” so I started to keep it to myself and never talked about it. I was shy and felt out of place. After realizing that no one’s opinion but mine mattered, I wanted to make sure young girls never experienced what I did and always felt that they belonged somewhere. I go to children’s hospitals, library’s, Down syndrome walks and so much more dressed as Princess Leia. The excitement and joy in young girls’ eyes shows me that what I’m doing does make a difference. They see a girl loves “Star Wars” as much as they do and it’s O. K. Doing this has given me so much confidence and I never want to do anything else. Even with Carrie gone, what she has inspired will live on and I hope to be part of making that happen. Jenn Harris, 38 The picture here is a still from a production called “In Your Arms,” which was done at the New York Stage and Film at Vassar in 2014 and again in the summer of 2015 at the Old Globe theater in San Diego. The show is 10 pieces written for dance and I am playing Carrie in her piece that she wrote for the show. Everyone loved her piece. And although she never got to see it, I’d hoped she would have been proud of the gorgeous ballet that we created for her play, as I sat stage right as her typing out the piece, then ultimately joining the two lovers at the end. Carrie Fisher’s piece was a fun, complex play about the dizzying conundrum between love and freedom of adventure. My god I’m going to miss her. Peg Ihinger, 56 When I was in high school, I was obsessed with the first “Star Wars” movie. With all of them, really, but the first one particularly blew all the circuits in my imagination, and I particularly gravitated toward Princess Leia. She was tough, she was a leader, she didn’t let any man push her around. Instead of being sweet and docile, she was snappish and didn’t apologize for it. I was so fascinated by her that I began seeking out other examples of the trope of the woman warrior. I later went on to become a fantasy writer who told stories about brave, strong women bucking their world’s trends. I also eventually earned a black belt in karate.

18647,North Dakota failed to inform the public of 100s of oil spills over last two years – report,"RT 
North Dakota, which ranks second in the US in terms of oil production, endured almost 300 oil spills in under two years and yet managed to avoid reporting a single one of them to the public, according to a new report. 
Documents viewed by the Associated Press indicate that, since January 2012, as many as 750 “ oil field incidents ” were recorded in North Dakota. The distinction between spills and incidents was not immediately clear but presumably was related to the magnitude of the accident. 
North Dakota, which borders Canada and has an estimated population of under 700,000 people, is like many other states heavily involved in oil production in that it is not required by law to inform the public about oil spills. Yet with the potentially devastating consequences a spill could have in a state that relies on farming and water resources, citizens have begun lobbying for greater access to information. 
Dennis Fewless, director of water quality for the state Health Department, told the AP lawmakers and regulators in North Dakota are also reconsidering the current state of affairs after a wheat farmer stumbled across a major oil spill last month. That incident was not made public knowledge until 11 days later, when reporters asked. Questions have also been raised as to whether the relationship between the pipeline’s operator, Tesoro Logistics, with regulators is too close for comfort. 
“ We’re certainly looking at that now and what would be a threshold for reporting to the public ,” he said. One option he said regulators are considering is a method to better track the spills that occur. Officials “ really have to dig through our database to get specifics ,” he said of the current situation. 
North Dakota pumps out millions of barrels of oil every day and installed nearly 2,500 miles of new transport pipelines in 2012. There is now enough pipeline, a total of about 17,500 miles, in North Dakota to travel the distance from Los Angeles, California to New York City. The state ranks behind only Texas as the most productive, yet farmers are still unaware that the land they till every season could be tainted. 
“ What you don’t know, nobody is going to tell you ,” Louis Kuster, a wheat farmer located near the north-western city of Stanley, said. Kuster explained how, earlier this month, he watched as truckloads of oily dirt were driven away from a nearby farm. 
“ We have no idea how big the spill is and why it happened ,” he said, speculating it may have been from a broken pipeline although no one can be quite sure. “ I’d try to get more information from the state but I’m too busy getting my harvest in .” 
In 2013 alone there have already been 291 so-called “incidents.” Of the roughly 2,209 barrels that were lost, all but 490 were contained and cleaned up at the well site. Most of the spills that companies reported to the state totaled less than 10 barrels. 
Nearly 500 barrels of oil spilled in 2012, the result of 153 pipeline leaks. 
“ That’s news to us ,” said Don Morrison, director of the environmentally-minded Dakota Resource Council. “ The public really should know about these. If there is a spill, sometimes a landowner may not even know about it. And if they do, people think it’s an isolated incident that’s only happening to them .”",0
18648,Alex Rodriguez’s Orchestrated Move May Not Be His Last - The New York Times,"This is how it ends for Alex Rodriguez? With a   whimper instead of an   public relations war? Hard to believe. For the moment, let’s not. It is possible that Rodriguez  —   at 41 and having been, as he put it, “to hell and back”  —   talked himself into being “at peace” about walking away after Friday night’s game against Tampa Bay at Yankee Stadium. But after a long and tumultuous career fueled by what even amateur psychologists could positively diagnose as a chronic inner turbulence, we suspect this was   merely acceding to the franchise’s wishes to move beyond him without stirring up memories of his contentious and litigious past. Four home runs short of 700, 18 shy of Babe Ruth, this   and   man, once photographed kissing his reflection in the mirror, is going to retire just because Hal Steinbrenner and Brian Cashman decided it was time? “Of course, I think I can play baseball,” Rodriguez said. “You always think you have one more hit in you. That wasn’t in the cards. That was the Yankees’ decision, and I’m at peace with it. ” All of that rang true except the last part. That is why no one should be surprised if another team reaches out in the next couple of weeks or for next season and Rodriguez’s tenure as a Yankees organizational adviser has the staying power of a Trump news cycle. Understand that the Yankees are great at selling history but are not exactly in the business of overdoing sentimentality. Cashman, above all, was once ready to run off Derek Jeter in the middle of a contract squabble. He was not about to yield to Rodriguez’s wishes for a steady diet of   when he couldn’t produce as the designated hitter and the Yankees had finally come to grips with the recurrence of 1965. For those not versed in pinstriped lore: with the realization that their   roster was old, broken down and overdue for disassembly. As   rode the bench these last few weeks  —   “painful and embarrassing,” he said  —   and Manager Joe Girardi bristled at reporters’ questions of why, anyone who knows Cashman could imagine his hardening feelings about a player the Yankees welcomed back in 2015 after a   suspension for being snared in the net of the Biogenesis drug scandal. Yes, Rodriguez was necessarily contrite and no longer a provocative clubhouse presence. More important, he produced, against all odds and expectations, on the way to 33 home runs. The image enhancement reached the point where the Yankees celebrated his 3, 000th hit with a commemorative day in September, an event unimaginable when Rodriguez was suing or defaming everyone but the talk radio host Mike Francesa in a   attempt  —   wisely abandoned  —   to avoid suspension by Major League Baseball. But more than any singular story line, Rodriguez’s Yankees career was characterized by unpredictable twists and   turns. By his special day, wouldn’t you know that his bat had slowed and the   fastball had become an unhittable blur? His return season was nonetheless hailed as a triumphant character reconstruction. He was no longer an albatross with a capital A  —   until he resumed flailing away this season and the unsparing Cashman had to ask himself, besides $21 million in 2017, how much do we owe this guy? Rodriguez had no more leverage in New York, and what was the point of making a fuss? He went along tamely with the Yankees’ wishes and provided more behavioral assurance for any team that might seriously weigh his explanation on Sunday for why he couldn’t hit a lick after returning from time on the disabled list in May. “Mechanically, I never felt like I caught up,” he said, suggesting that it was more an issue of timing than the intervention of Father Time. If the phone doesn’t ring  —   a good possibility  —   then Rodriguez will at least wear the redemptive aura into his playing afterlife as he contemplates a continued association with the game. But who is naïve enough to think he won’t be burning for one last shot? “As far as 700, or any of those type of milestones, I would have had an unbelievable, fun time going after them,” he said, perhaps a flare to anyone in need of a marketing tool while playing out a lost season? What we can be certain of is that the timing of the departure from the Yankees’ bench  —   one night before Jeter and the 1996 World Series champions return to the Stadium to take another bow  —   was no coincidence. So many of Rodriguez’s machinations with the Yankees were painfully contrived, especially the   $275 million deal that tethered him to the team past the point where the marriage was played out. Remember how word happened to get out during the 2007 World Series that Rodriguez was intending to leave the Yankees as a free agent? As a commodity, he had juice back then, the Yankees capitulated and the deal was officially announced on the very day baseball released the Mitchell report, detailing an entrenched steroid culture we would soon learn Rodriguez was part of. For timing so transparently tacky, it was easy to say, in the flurry of headlines to follow, that   and the Yankees deserved each other. All due respect and good cheer aside, that part of the narrative will never change.",0
18649,"Wall Street, Hollywood, The Media And SJWs Fail To Stop Donald Trump From Becoming America’s 45th President","Gentlemen, Donald J. Trump is the new President-elect of the United States. Though a a few results may still be unclear, Trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of Ohio, Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina, plus Georgia. And, in a change not seen in more than a generation, he has seized Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Pennsylvania and Michigan have not voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since 1988 and Wisconsin since way back in 1984. It appears also that states the Democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them, such as Minnesota, Maine and Virginia, have stayed blue with only wafer-thin or very disappointing margins. The 2nd Congressional district of Maine, a state which divides its electoral votes along with Nebraska, has been called for the Republicans for the first time in nearly 30 years. The last time any Maine district voted for a GOP Presidential candidate was 1988, when George H. W. Bush seized all four electoral votes there.
Importantly, too, avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for Trump. For example, counts so far show that some 40% of voters in Connecticut and Rhode Island, states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally, have opted for the “racist,” “sexist,” and “homophobic” Republican candidate. Their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map, but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm, plenty of people are happy to support Trump. This is despite them facing fierce rebukes and, often enough, violence if they make their views public.
The “clown” candidate has beaten 16 more “experienced” Republican challengers and now Hillary Clinton, the most elite-backed candidate in the world’s political history.
As tonight’s results have shown, plenty of Trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet. Media airtime for pro-Trump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks. Mainstream “journalists” such as Glenn Thrush , Wolf Blitzer , Jake Tapper , Jessica Valenti , and Brent Budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the DNC and Clinton campaign (if you believe that these two groups are actually separate). This only increases the esteem in which the emphatic, resounding Trump victory needs to be held.
And let’s not forget the Senate and House races! After months of spineless GOP cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from Trump, The Donald has still carried them to victory in both Houses of Congress . The White House, Senate and House of Representatives are all in Republican hands until at least the 2018 House midterms. Can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and SJWs yet?
Every powerful vested interest not only supported Hillary, but did everything they could to ruin Trump Yes, it’s happening.
Did you see the last major Hillary Clinton rallies? Celebrities-cum-political hacktivists, chief among them Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Jay Z, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and Katy Perry, all fell into Clinton’s corner well before their final appearances for her, excoriating anyone who had the gall to support Donald Trump. Even long-term Republicans who betrayed Trump, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, were attacked by celebrity SJWs such as Robert DeNiro after they joined the “Never Trump” ranks, as if they were dangerous saboteurs. The celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months. Hollywood, that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers, silver screen actors, and comedians, has become little more than an overpaid trade union for Hillary Clinton.
Likewise, every major American company that has come out for a candidate has come out for Hillary. Plenty of “neutral” corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the Clinton campaign behind the scenes as well. Prominent billionaires like George Soros and Warren Buffett have done all they could to drag Hillary’s stumbling half-corpse, both literally and figuratively, across the line. Whilst Trump has been supported by a number of ten-figure businessmen, these men are regularly attacked in the media. They include the scapegoated but brave Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn.
And then there’s the mainstream media. Countless studies have indicated that about 85-90% of all journalists are liberal. This over-representation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women, particularly prominent mastheads such as The New York Times , Washington Post , and Huffington Post , plus Democratic TV surrogates like CNN and NBC. The 2016 campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias, one that plagued the two George W. Bush Administrations but raged even more ferociously against Donald Trump over the last 18 months.
All of these media elites have lambasted Trump for over a year, at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting Hillary, Podesta and DNC emails. Everything newsworthy on this front, from the overwhelming presence of Clinton Foundation donors in Hillary’s Secretary of State diary book to more recent revelations about John Podesta’s involvement with Satanic rituals, has been brushed off the balcony by the Wolf Blitzers and Chuck Todds of the American mainstream media. Yet Trump has triumphed nonetheless!
The new administration must crush the criminal Democratic elites and Clinton Foundation with the rule of law Will Hillary now find herself stumbling into jail?
Inasmuch as the Clinton campaign, the SJWs, and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this year’s election, they retain very well-oiled and effective means for trying to undermine President Trump once he takes office. Trump’s first priority as Commander-in-Chief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the Clinton Foundation. He also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities, as uncovered by Wikileaks, perpetrated from within the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
The Department of Justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery, most notably when Attorney-General Loretta Lynch had a private meeting with Bill Clinton during the most crucial time of the FBI investigation into Hillary’s emails. Additionally, elements of the State Department illegally informed Hillary about new developments in that same case. Enough is enough. It’s time to drain the swamp.
Election night produced another curve-ball: after weeks of calling Donald Trump a “sore loser” for him not saying if he would respect the final result, Hillary Clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the American people. It would seem that she only telephoned Trump privately. So who’s the sore loser now?
Last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral sea-change in American—and perhaps global—history. We cannot lose sight of the work to be done, but for the next 24 hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds.
Hail to the Chief, Donald J. Trump.

18650,William Henry: Born Again… Into the Rainbow Resurrection Body,"My Epiphany at Edgar Cayce’s Association for Research and Enlightenment By William Henry
God, S/He moves in mysterious ways.
On October 7-9, 2016, I had the pleasure of speaking — and having my mind blown (!)– at the “Ancient Mysteries” conference at Edgar Cayce’s Association for Research and Enlightenment in Virginia Beach, VA.
My presentation, “The Essenes and Ascension”, featured my last several years research on these (mostly) Jewish mystics who, extraordinarily, claimed to be living with angels (celestial beings/’extraterrestrials’) who taught them how to transform their human flesh — in a FLASH!!! — into the celestial flesh of the angels. Radiant, luminous, shining, this ‘flashy flesh’ of the angels is composed of a rarefied ‘perfect’ spiritual substance that is as ‘real’ or ‘solid’ in the higher realms as our physical body is on the earth. Attainment of this ‘light body’ is the next step in human spiritual evolution.
According to the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Essenes alienated themselves from the rest of society to ‘perfect’ themselves in order to prepare and make way for the visitation of a high celestial being and to lead a revolution in human evolution by transforming themselves into angels and the earth into a planet of righteousness.
The scrolls reveal the Essenes were also obsessed with transforming themselves to be like their visiting angels and their state of being (in light bodies) in order to ascend to and enter a celestial city called Sion or the New Jerusalem . In Hebrews (12:22), we learn this place is inhabited by “ angels gathered in joyful assembly and just humans made perfect .
The Essenes sought to take their place at this family gathering of angels and perfect ones.
THE ESSENES AND THE RAINBOW BODY It so happens that Hurricane Matthew was spinning toward Virginia Beach while I was there. I had no idea that coming on those clouds was a lightning strike of revelation and it was headed my way!
I was excited to hear Cayce expert, John Van Auken’s, talk about Edgar Cayce and the Essenes. Incredibly, the great seer had provided numerous readings about the Essene teachings at least fifteen years before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947. In startling ways, Cayce’s dream-state readings about the Essenes matched what the scrolls said in detail after detail. In particular, I was intrigued by Cayce’s references to the Essenes and perfection which appeared on several of Van Auken’s slides.
While at the A.R.E. I was given a tour of the vault containing Edgar Cayce’s original readings and other artifacts, including the gorgeous painting “Flight Into Egypt” (featured above). I even got to sit at his desk!
A great souvenir from the A.R.E.!
During my talk, I presented the research that led to my unique hypothesis that the Essenes living in Jerusalem and Alexandria Egypt c. 150 B.C. to 66 AD were practicing Buddhist Rainbow Light Body techniques referred to as the Great Perfection . The Tibetans teach that the Great Perfection was originally of extraterrestrial / cosmic origins and represents the highest form of enlightenment or spiritual realization on earth.
The ultimate goal of the Rainbow Body practitioner is to accelerate the frequency of the body until it dissolves into five colored rainbow light, leaving behind only hair, toe and fingernails that have no nerves to be transmuted. The result is a new birth or rebirth into a luminous, humanoid body shot with gold and which emits rainbow colors.
In a process that is as natural as a caterpillar morphing into a butterfly, practitioners ‘ascend’ in new perfect bodies of light matching those of the celestial beings. This ‘light body’ is known in virtually every spiritual tradition. It goes by many names, of which the Garment of Light, Robe of Glory, Beaming Garment, Star Body, Diamond Body, Body of Bliss, are just a few.
What ‘called’ me to the Essenes was my discovery that they called their ‘research group’ the House of Perfection and referred to themselves as those who walk in the Perfect Way .
Researchers have observed the link between Jesus’s ‘perfect’ rainbow Resurrection body and the Rainbow Light Body of the Great Perfection. Side by side mages of the rainbow clad resurrected Christ with the Tibetan images of the Rainbow Body (as below) have been a staple of my books, presentations and TV shows since 2006. My three latest books have explored the sayings of Jesus that correspond to this body.

As I listened to Van Auken’s talk, I had no idea that a (major!) new piece to the correspondence between these images and the Tibetan and Christian teachings was about to slip into place.
For years, I additionally have been linking the images of the Rainbow Light Body with those of the Seraphim angels. The highest order of angels, the Seraphim dwell at God’s Throne (in the celestial city, Sion), but routinely interact with humanity, including the Essenes, as discussed in the Dead Sea Scrolls and other documents.
The Seraphim are the angels the Essenes sought to become. The ‘new bodies’ they sought are the same as the bodies of these beings. 
In Jewish mysticism, the complete physical characteristics of the Seraphim (also known as the Watchers or Angels of the Lord) includes:
a humanoid body, a ‘serpentine face’, a many colored garment, rising up into the air like whirlwinds, luminous or radiant bodies, feathered cloaks, many eyes, and the ability to fluidly morph or change form and to shape-shift.
This is why, in Christian art, the Seraphim are portrayed as humanoid beings with swirling, vortex shaped bodies covered with feathers. Are the feathers meant to symbolize flight, but also an energy field or waves of light emitted from these beings? I believe so. To me, the visual similarity between the Rainbow Light Body and the energetic bodies of the Seraphim is not a coincidence.
I have proposed the Rainbow Body state and the Seraphim are same class of enlightened celestial beings. The Tibetans haven’t claimed this. Nor has the Judeo-Christian tradition. As far as I know, this is unique to me. I point this out not out of ego, but rather to alert the reader to the source of this link and in hopes that those ‘in the know’ will contact me with any additional references to support my hypothesis.

As they were developed in corresponding Christian theology, Seraphim are beings of pure light and pure love and have direct communication with God. As noted, they dwell at the Throne of God. However, they don’t stay there. They can manifest in our world.
In fact, the resurrected Jesus appeared to St. Francis of Assisi as a Seraph, demonstrating that the state of being of the Seraph is the same as the resurrected state of being. In the art of resurrection, which is derived from eye-witness accounts (John the Revelator, for example) Jesus is either seen with a rainbow around his body or with the body of a Seraphim. In my view, these bodies are the interchangeable or energetic phases of the same light body. One, the Rainbow Body version, is a sped up version of the other (the Seraphim). This because these heavenly beings ‘slow down’ their frequency in order to be perceived by our earthly senses.
Jesus manifests as a Seraph to St. Francis of Assisi. For more on this remarkable contact please see my article Gentle Heart.
As I discussed in my book, The Secret of Sion , Thomas Aquinas said the Seraphim have the quality of clarity, or brightness; which signifies that these angels have in themselves an inextinguishable light, and that they also perfectly enlighten others…” With the revival of neo-Platonism in the academy formed around Lorenzo de’ Medici in Renaissance Florence, the Seraphim took on a mystic role in Pico della Mirandola’s Oration on the Dignity of Man (1487), the epitome of Renaissance thinking.
Pico took the fiery Seraphim—”they burn with the fire of charity”—as the highest models of human aspiration: “impatient of any second place, let us emulate dignity and glory. And, if we will it, we shall be inferior to them in nothing,” the young Pico announced.
“In the light of intelligence, meditating upon the Creator in His work, and the work in its Creator, we shall be resplendent with the light of the Cherubim. If we burn with love for the Creator only, his consuming fire will quickly transform us into the flaming likeness of the Seraphim. “Models of human aspiration: “impatient of any second place, let us emulate dignity and glory. And, if we will it, we shall be inferior to them in nothing”, the young Pico announced.
According to Renaissance thought, the Seraphim are a different type of human being, a fully transfigured one. Their ‘perfected’ bodies are immortal bodies of light and are therefore able to hold the highest frequencies of love and light. We can become Seraphim by meditating exclusively on the love of the Creator, say Renaissance thinkers. In other words, if we perfect ourselves.
The Essenes believed exactly the same thing. I have proposed the angels the Essenes were living with were Seraphim and the celestial body they were teaching them about was the (or their) Rainbow Light Body.
No other Essene or Tibetan scholars have made this amazing connection. This is because the scholars who have discussed the scrolls are usually specialists and have not gone out of the box to link the Essene’s concept of Perfection with that of the Tibetans, as I have done. Likewise, the Tibtan Great Perfection scholars I have read to not stray into Essene light body practices either. However, once the two spheres are entwined, as I have don, they become one.
This premise is out of the box, but it did not come to me out of the blue. It arose out of the historical fact that Buddhist missionaries brought their teachings to the Essenes in Alexandria in c. 150 B.C, when the Essenes, as we know them in the Dead Sea Scrolls, were formed. The historical background will be featured in my forthcoming book about the Essenes, the light body and ascension.
My reading of Dead Sea Scrolls shows that they contain the proof of this interaction and the Essene practice of human transformation or transmutation into perfect light bodies. Their goal of attaining perfection is the core power pack and red hot coal of the Seraphim found in the scrolls.
Taking this one bold step further, in my presentation, I showed how the Essenes were practicing this “Rainbow Body Resurrection”. This revolutionizes our understanding of the Dead Sea Scroll and the Essenes. I will have copies of this presentation available on the latest edition of my flash drive .
ONLY THE BORN AGAIN CAN ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD The thing is, I never really thought about the connection between the Essene light body or perfection teachings, which are both explicit and veiled in Christianity, and the defining Christian concept of being ‘born again’
The reason is because I am neither a Protestant or an Evangelical Christian, the two Christian movements who have done more than the other several hundred Christian sects to illuminate the mysteries of being “Born Again”. In Christian understanding, one is “born again” after one, proclaiming belief in only One God, two, being baptized in the Name Jesus Christ and then, three, following Jesus into the Kingdom of God.
Thunder rolled for me during Van Auken’s presentation on Cayce and the Essenes when he mentioned Jesus’s teaching on the necessity of being “born again” to enter the Kingdom of God.
Then, lightning struck.
It happened when I put the images I had shown of the resurrected Christ in the rainbow (body) together in my mind with the belief that he is the first “born again” Essene and Christian.
I suddenly realized the Kingdom of God and the celestial city are the same state (of being).
When the smoke cleared, I realized that to be “born again” means to attain the perfect light body or the Rainbow Resurrection Body.
In my talk, I said that, according to the Essenes, the only way to enter the celestial city is to be dressed appropriately. That is, we must attain /wear the flashy perfect body of the angels and “just humans made perfect” who dwell there.
This means attaining the perfect body has the same meaning as being “born again” into a body of spirit (light, love).
I was blown away by the winds that followed this revelation and the simplicity and elegance of this match.
Remember this Memorex ad from the 1970s? That was me putting the Rainbow Resurrection Body together with the Born Again body!
Here is the section from the Book of John (3) containing Jesus’s teaching:
3 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”
3 Jesus replied, “ Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again .”
4 “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”
5 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit[ gives birth to spirit . 7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’ 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”
9 “ How can this be ?” Nicodemus asked.
10 “ You are Israel’s teacher ,” said Jesus, “ and do you not understand these things ?11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
Jesus taught the uninitiated Nicodemus, “Ye must be born again” (John 3:7) and made it clear that only by being born again can you see the Kingdom of God, let alone enter it.
If the new Born Again body is the same as the body of the angels, it means Jesus taught that, in order to enter the Kingdom of God (the celestial Sion), we must be “born again”… into our Rainbow Resurrection Body. We receive this body by following him.
THE PERFECT BODY AND THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN As I take a look around Christendom, I don’t see too many Christians following, teaching, or demonstrating Jesus’s light body or perfection teachings.
You can’t blame or judge them for that. Just google the words “star body” or “perfect body” and see what comes up in our contemporary imagination!

As Jesus lamented, even Nicodemus, a religious leader of his day, had no concept of what it meant to be born again or to attain the perfect body!
We find that the very same thing is true today. Many men and women who fill positions of spiritual leadership in our world have no real understanding of the light body or born again experience.
Consequently, the term “born again” is one of the most (mis) used phrases among present-day Christians.
Like the new age conception of “ascension”, if asked what the term born again means, most Christians likely could not give a clear explanation.
We can see what Jesus was up against when, in his rebirth / resurrection, Jesus enacted or demonstrated the Essene perfection teaching of the transmutation of the earthly body into a heavenly body composed of celestial flesh. Christians would call this the plan of salvation and argue that Jesus authored this plan during his crucifixion, entombment/resurrection and ascension. The problem is the “how to” build the light body from this plan has been veiled in Christianity. Fortunately, the Essene teachings in the Dead Sea Scrolls unveil these teachings for us.
Jesus spoke of perfection numerous times. In particular, in a conversation with a rich man about eternal life.
The man had asked Jesus, “What is required for eternal life?”
Jesus replied, “keep the commandments.”
Which are: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like unto it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments.” (Matthew 22:35-40)
The rich man told Jesus that he had always kept the commandments and wanted to know what else was required (like how much $?).
Jesus says, “… I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .”
The camel is a symbol of the human body and the material cargo the soul accumulates during is sojourn on earth. Jesus is telling the rich man that his earthly, material being and all that it collects on earth will have to be left behind or transmuted into a celestial substance. In other words, the flesh and blood body will not make it through the portal to the otherworldly realms spoken of by Jesus, but a soul clad in a light body or Garment of Glory can and will. Jesus is simply saying that our ‘stuff’ is not going with us when we enter the eye of the needle to the Kingdom of God.
Jesus then told him, and here is the Essene Rainbow Light Body teaching, and the ‘punch line’ of this blog, “ If thou wilt be perfect (holy, whole, complete), go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me” (Mat. 19:21).
In other words, Jesus is telling the rich man that if attains the perfect light body, and is “born again”, he has found earth’s greatest treasure. He then can follow him through the eye of the needle (or stargate) into the Kingdom of God where perfected humans dwell in bodies of light.
Jesus in the ‘eye of needle’, a gateway filled with stars. He wears the bright white garment of light that symbolizes the Perfect Body.
JESUS LIFTS THE SERPENT AND TELLS US HOW TO ATTAIN THE GARMENT OF LIGHT
Jesus told us how we will transform and attain eternal life in his further remarks in John 3:
13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man. 14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him .”

Jesus is referring to an episode in the Book of Numbers (21:8) in which the Israelites “Make thee a fiery serpent (literally, a seraph), and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live”.
Moses and the Nehushtan, Salisbury Cathedral.
The serpent lifted on a pole is called the Nehushtan , meaning the Brazen Serpent or Fiery Serpent. This last definition is mind blowing, as the Jewish Encyclopedia states Seraph means “fiery flying serpent”. The Nehushtan is the device (‘sign’, ‘symbol’, ‘seal’, ‘tool’, ‘appliance’), symbol or logo of the Seraphim! Jesus is referring us directly to it as the means to attain eternal life! A moment before he told us that LOVE was the key to eternal life. Oh wait. I get it! The serpent on the pole symbolizes the cosmic love within us that arises when we follow the commandments to “love with all our heart and love our neighbor as our self”!
THE HOLY FORCE For me, this is a ‘proof’ or confirmation that Jesus was demonstrating the light body secrets of the angels, specifically the Seraphim. Again, transformation into a Seraph / Rainbow Light Body is the same as being Born Again.
In some Christian movements (especially Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism), to be born again is to undergo a “spiritual rebirth”, or a regeneration of the human spirit from the Holy Spirit. As Jesus tells us John 3:3, no one can enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless they are in their born again body.
The earthly body is born of flesh. The Born Again Resurrection Rainbow Body is born of a spirit, a higher vibration. That holy spirit is love. True love.
Interestingly, the Greek for again also means from above, suggesting that the power or spirit of regeneration comes from above…in in the stars, in the higher worlds. This means our Rainbow Body comes from and exists in a higher realm or in the stars, as the Tibetans teach.
In Christian terms, being born again is the result of a secret act of regeneration (love) by God. A mysterious power or force, the Holy Spirit, transforms our flesh and blood existence in to spirit-filled body and state of being.
The serpent on a pole is a symbol for the regeneration into a spirit body of the Seraphim. Again, they are considered the beings of highest love.
The power of regeneration is found in the prophecy of Ezekiel:
A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you ; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances . (Ezek. 36:26–27)
Ezekiel is telling us that regeneration affects us as whole persons. EVERY part of our being — body, mind and spirit — is affected: “If any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come ” (2 Cor. 5:17).
The new Rainbow Body of Light, that is.
Being “born again” is nothing less than receiving the actual body of Christ after his Resurrection and Ascension — the body of a Seraph or a Rainbow Light Body. In order to ‘attain’ it, Christianity teaches that his Holy Spirit actually enters us and brings our spirit (and its light body) to life. Our spirit is joined with Him” ( 1 Corinthians 6:17 ). We then become one with the perfect One. “It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me”(Galations 2:20).
The mystery of being born again into the Light Body is now revealed, “that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” ( Colossians 1:26,27 ).
The Holy Spirit that transforms us and “makes us new” is ever-present, but invisible in the life and teaching of Jesus. I hope this blog has shown that the “born again” body this spirit produces is the same as the Rainbow Body of Light and the body of the Seraphim. Jesus’s teaching about his light body is also ever present, and with this understanding, hopeful more visible.
Jesus compares the mysterious force that regenerates us with the wind: Jesus says, “The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit” (John 3:8).
The Bible says that things which are visible are temporary but things which are invisible are eternal (see 2 Corinthians 4:18 ).
In other words, those with born again bodies are living in the eternal everywhere, everywhen and at one with God. This is how the Tibetans define the Oneness of the Rainbow Body state of being.
The Essenes were great scholars, researchers and practitioners of the most advanced spiritual teaching on earth. They said it came from the angels. It matches the Tibetan light body teaching they said came from the stars, meaning it is a universal teaching. It is my hope that my linking the Essene Perfect Way, the Tibetan Great Perfection and the Christian Born Again traditions is received today in the spirit of love and unity with which the Essenes received it two thousand years ago. Then, as now, the promise is the same. When we live from our light bodies we become a new being, a born again being in the here and (or the here and new). We live a life like those of the Seraphim, the Essenes and Christ. Filled with the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit we are able to do the same things they could do.
I am thankful, once again, for the winds of Hurricane Matthew and the thunder of John Van Auken and Edgar Cayce that blew this understanding my way.

Are you aware of Karla Turner’s work? The negative aliens who have controlled this planet for ages have many tools in their box. For example,where an incorruptible person has acquired a large following but works against their agenda, one way of dealing with such a person is to replace his soul. This way, it would appear as if that person has switched allegiances. Unless you are psychic enough to see the soul, you would have NO idea that there has been any such switcheroo. http://www.reptilianagenda.com/exp/e112300a.shtml Quote: HOW THE ALIENS MIGHT CONTROL THE LEADERS: 
“…. if they wanted to use one of their own souls … perhaps to inhabit the body of a politicians and work full-time through it, that could be done. …. they could simply take the soul out and stick another soul in. They have the ability to retrieve what we call the soul, to store it in a container, and to put it back into another body. They can put it in any body they wish.” Ariana October 30, 2016 at 11:37 am

18652,Trump Holds First Conversation with Putin in Oval Office,"President Donald Trump has scheduled five calls to world leaders on Saturday, and has completed most. Among the most anticipated was his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which occurred at noon today. [The call between Trump and Putin was the first of its kind regarding policy, and reportedly lasted around 30 minutes. The two had spoken on the phone most recently in November, when Putin called to congratulate Trump on winning the presidential election.  During the call, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer posted a photo of the Oval Office on Twitter, showing the President engaging Putin while surrounded by senior staffers: National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor Stephen K. Bannon, and Vice President Mike Pence. After speaking with Chancellor Merkel for 45 minutes @POTUS is now onto his 3rd of 5 head of government calls, speaking w Russian Pres Putin pic. twitter.   —   Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 28, 2017,  Neither the White House nor the Kremlin have released details regarding the contents of the call at press time. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered questions regarding the scheduled call on Friday, however, lowering expectations for any major policy breakthroughs. “One can hardly expect substantive contacts on the entire range of affairs from this call  …     Let us wait and see, let us be patient,” he told reporters in Moscow. Peskov added that Russia and the United States had yet to establish official contacts in the new Trump era, but that “routine diplomatic work is underway” to ensure proper communications. In addition to the phone call following November’s election, Putin sent President Trump a letter in December wishing him a merry Christmas and happy holiday season, which Trump described as a “very nice Christmas letter” and thanked Putin for. While Putin’s relations with the Obama White House were notoriously strained  —   though Putin greatly expanded the diplomatic influence of Russia during President Obama’s tenure, particularly in the Middle East  —   Putin has appeared publicly favorable to establishing positive relations with the Trump administration. Following President Obama’s announcement of new sanctions on Russia in December, shortly before Trump took office, Putin said in a statement he would not retaliate, calling President Obama’s actions “regrettable” and implying he would wait for Trump to assume the presidency before evaluating how bilateral relations should go forward. Putin also came to Trump’s defense following the publication of unverified documents by the entertainment website Buzzfeed, which claimed Trump had engaged in inappropriate behavior while in Russia. Putin called those giving publicity to the documents “worse than prostitutes” and stated that, while he did not believe that Trump had requested the services of “loose women” while in Moscow, “ours are undoubtedly the best in the world. ” Putin also appeared unintimidated by President Trump’s call for the refurbishing of America’s nuclear arsenal, stating that there was “nothing unusual” about the President wanting to maintain the quality of the U. S. military. Prior to speaking to Putin, Trump held conversations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe is scheduled to visit the White House on February 10.",0
18653,"Bitcoin Price Soars, Fueled by Speculation and Global Currency Turmoil - The New York Times","SAN FRANCISCO  —   The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics  —   highlighted by Donald J. Trump’s election victory  —   has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight. “The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,” said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government’s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1, 025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin’s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1, 150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1, 000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low  —   under $200  —   in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a   American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. “I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,” Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.",0
18654,Trump Says the U.S. Should Expand Its Nuclear Capacity - The New York Times,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —     Donald J. Trump said on Thursday that the United States should greatly “expand its nuclear capability,” appearing to suggest an end to decades of efforts by presidents of both parties to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American defenses and strategy. Mr. Trump’s statement, in a midafternoon Twitter post, may have been a response to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who in a speech to his military’s leadership in Moscow earlier on Thursday vowed to strengthen Russia’s nuclear missiles. Mr. Putin said nuclear forces needed to be bolstered so they could “reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems,” apparently a reference to the Pentagon’s efforts to develop systems capable of shooting down   rockets. Shortly after Mr. Putin’s comments were reported by the news media, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the United States must “strengthen and expand” its nuclear forces “until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ” He did not elaborate. The vagueness of Mr. Trump’s posting made it difficult to assess its possible impact on American foreign policy, and further illustrated the potential dangers in setting policy, especially on such grave matters, in Twitter bursts and offhand remarks. Nuclear weapons are so fearsome that only a president can order their use, and deterrence is normally a complicated subject debated in academic treatises and negotiated over years by diplomats. Aides to Mr. Trump, asked to clarify what the   meant by the need to “expand” the nuclear ability of the United States, responded with a statement that did not address that point. Jason Miller, the incoming White House communications director, said in the statement that Mr. Trump was referring to “the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it  —   particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes. ” Mr. Miller added that the   had in the past “emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength. ” It was the second time in two days that aides had tried to recast a statement from Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, he appeared to say that recent terror attacks in Europe had vindicated his campaign pledge to bar Muslims from entering the United States. Aides later said he was merely restating his promise to implement strict vetting and suspend the admission of people from countries associated with terrorism. With his Twitter post on nuclear arms, it remained unclear from his use of the word “expand” whether Mr. Trump would try to reverse agreements such as the New Start treaty, which Russia and the United States signed in 2010 and which commits both nations to modest reductions in strategic nuclear forces. But the implications of Mr. Trump’s post  —   if it signals the beginning of a new era of nuclear weapons expansion in the United States  —   could be profound. Derek Johnson, the executive director of Global Zero, a group that seeks the elimination of nuclear weapons, accused Mr. Trump of calling for a “new nuclear arms race,” even as Mr. Putin appears eager for a major expansion of Russian nuclear abilities. “The use of even a single nuclear weapon, anywhere in the world, would be a global humanitarian, environmental and economic disaster,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement. “A nuclear buildup in the U. S. and Russia only makes that nightmare scenario more likely. ” The United States and Russia are already racing to modernize their existing nuclear arsenals, replacing aging missile systems with smaller, more modern weapons that are harder to stop and more precise. That effort by Moscow and Washington, while allowed by current arms control treaties, has nonetheless caused fears of renewing a kind of Cold   arms race as the two nations seek technological dominance. The United States is also moving ahead with a modest system of missile defenses in Europe, a program that has deeply angered the Kremlin, which rejects arguments that it is aimed solely at the threat from Iran. But if Mr. Trump also intends to increase the number of America’s nuclear weapons, it could represent a significant break in strategic policy that dates to talks between the two nations that began under President Richard M. Nixon. It could also be a drastic reversal of President Obama’s approach. In one of his first major speeches in 2009, Mr. Obama told a cheering crowd in Prague that the United States would lead an effort to pursue rules and treaties that would result in a world without any nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama has had some limited success in pursuing that vision during his eight years in office. He convened a regular nuclear nonproliferation summit meeting aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear material with special concerns about terror groups gaining access to these materials. Mr. Obama negotiated a deal with Iran that his administration says would delay that government’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. But during Mr. Obama’s time in office, North Korea has conducted several nuclear weapons tests. Contrary to Mr. Obama’s own conciliatory nuclear posture, and concrete steps in that direction, his administration has also embarked on a sweeping modernization of the American nuclear arsenal that may cost up to $1 trillion over three decades. It features new factories, refurbished nuclear arms and a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. The bombers are to carry a new   cruise missile meant to slip through enemy air defenses. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons even though he called their potential use “a horror. ” In an interview with The New York Times in March, the   also suggested that Japan and South Korea might have to obtain their own nuclear weapons, which would be a reversal of an American policy that for decades extended promises of protection to allies and foreclosed the need for them to go nuclear. John R. Harvey, who from 1995 to 2013 held senior positions overseeing nuclear weapons programs in the energy and defense departments, said Mr. Trump’s Twitter post on Thursday had several possible meanings, ranging from the routine to actions that could exceed current treaty limits. For example, Mr. Harvey said, Mr. Trump could have simply been voicing support for continuing the “nuclear modernization” program. But Mr. Trump might also have been suggesting that he wants to substantially increase the number of bombers, missiles and submarines. The United States currently has about 7, 000 nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including about 1, 750 strategic warheads deployed in missile silos, on bombers and in submarines around the world, according to the Federation of American Scientists. That is down from more than 30, 000 warheads at the height of the Cold War. Russia has about 7, 300 nuclear weapons, the federation says. Under the New Start treaty, both countries have committed to reducing the number of deployed nuclear weapons to 1, 550 by 2018, though that figure can be exceeded because each bomber is counted as a single weapon even if it carries more than one. David Wright,   of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, expressed dismay at Mr. Trump’s choice of Twitter to discuss nuclear weapons policy. “It’s a pretty blunt instrument to be trying to say something intelligible on what his plans are,” he said. “It sounded to me more like an advertisement to appear to be strong to the world as opposed to an assessment of what the U. S. may or may not need. ”",0
18655,"How a Word, ‘Chee-na,’ Renewed a Crisis Between Beijing and Hong Kong - The New York Times","HONG KONG  —   Thousands of people marched in Hong Kong on Sunday to protest an expected decision by the Chinese government that would effectively block two newly elected politicians from taking their seats in the semiautonomous territory’s legislature. The decision, issued the next day, came after the prospective lawmakers, Sixtus Leung, 30, and Yau   25, made controversial remarks last month during an   ceremony in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council. Rather than say “China” in their oaths, they said “” a term that many find offensive, associating it with its use by Japan during its occupation of China during World War II. Ms. Yau also added an expletive to her oath. Relations between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, a former British colony of 7. 3 million, were already frayed by   demonstrations that erupted in 2014 in response to the Chinese government’s rejection of calls for free elections in the territory. The remarks by the two politicians, who have argued that Hong Kong should be independent from China, were widely seen as acts of defiance  —   and catalysts for a renewed political crisis. Where does the term ‘ ’ come from? Aoki Masaru, a Japanese Sinologist, argued that it originated in early Sanskrit transcriptions of Qin, the name of the dynasty that unified China more than 2, 000 years ago, according to a 2012 essay by the historian Joshua A. Fogel. Qin, pronounced “chin,” may have contributed to the country’s name in many Western languages. With the spread of Buddhism from India, and the translation of scriptures into Chinese, the word entered China and then Japan. Professor Fogel, who teaches at York University in Toronto, wrote that the Japanese used the name   for centuries, but especially from the 19th century through World War II. Before the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, the country had no official symbols or constitution, noted Xu Guoqi, a professor of history at the University of Hong Kong who is writing a book titled “The Idea of China. ” Its last imperial dynasty, the Qing, was established by Manchu invaders in the 17th century. Many Chinese nationalists and reformers in the final years of Qing rule  —   such as Liang Qichao and Zhang Taiyan  —   used the term “with no hidden bad meaning,” he said.   was one of many names these intellectuals used to refer to their country, said John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Some of the intellectuals were involved in the   resistance and had gone into exile in Japan, he added. “They felt their country had been stolen for hundreds of years by an invading,   Chinese, Manchu people, and now they were trying to get it back,” Professor Delury said. They were searching for a name for the new nation, he said, that would differentiate it from the Qing dynasty. When did Chinese people begin to view the term   as a slur? The term is the name for China that has “most exercised Chinese opinion” throughout history, Professor Fogel wrote in his 2012 essay. Jan Kiely, a professor of Chinese studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in an email that “strong feelings” were stirred in Chinese people when the Japanese Empire used the word to refer to China during its incursions into Chinese territory, from the     War through World War II. For many Chinese today, Professor Kiely said,   recalls the sufferings of the occupation and references a Japanese imperial sense that the Chinese were inherently inferior. On Monday, Li Fei, the chairman of China’s parliamentary committee on the Basic Law, the   that governs Hong Kong, criticized Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau for using the term. “I especially condemn insults to the country and the nation,” Mr. Li told reporters in Beijing. “I hope Hong Kong people do not forget how Chinese were slaughtered by the Japanese invaders, and especially that the Japanese invaders committed huge crimes when they occupied Hong Kong. ” Professor Kiely said that public memory of World War II had surged in China over the past two decades in tandem with rising nationalism, thanks in part to a proliferation of   memorials, museums, exhibitions and documentaries about the war. If the term   can be perceived as a slur against Chinese people, why did the two Hong Kong politicians include it in their   remarks? Professor Delury said the politicians appeared to be making a satirical comparison between the Chinese government’s current control over Hong Kong and Japan’s invasion in the 20th century. He said it was significant that the remarks were made in the context of what is normally an   ceremony that is designed to indicate submission to the Chinese government. “All this historical stuff is very interesting, but at a certain level,” he said, “what they’re trying to do here is to register their refusal to obey the way they’re being told to obey. ” But the  ’ critics include people in Hong Kong who have pushed for democratic reforms in its political system. What explains that? After taking the oath in the Legislative Council, Mr. Leung attributed his pronunciation of China as “ ” to his local Hong Kong accent. But Ming Sing, a professor of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said in an interview that some people in Hong Kong dismissed that explanation as “moral hypocrisy,” because Mr. Leung had previously made a point of attacking   legislators for their purported unwillingness to challenge the Chinese government. “He was perceived to cover up his real intent,” Professor Sing said. Professor Sing said that many people in Hong Kong also believed that the two politicians’ remarks at the   ceremony handed the Chinese government a pretext to reinterpret the Basic Law, which was negotiated before Britain returned the territory to Chinese rule in 1997. He said they fear the Basic Law may be interpreted “in a way that could undermine the rule of law and political freedoms in Hong Kong. ”",0

18657,"Donald Trump, After Difficult Stretch, Shows a Softer Side - The New York Times","It has been a rough few weeks for Donald J. Trump and his team: a bruising loss in Wisconsin, a public campaign   and some   missteps and gaffes, including his reference to the attacks on the World Trade Center as occurring “on  . ” In a lengthy interview in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower on Tuesday, shortly after casting a ballot for himself and hours before the polls closed, the usually boastful Mr. Trump seemed a bit more humbled as he reflected on his “evolving” campaign and looked to the challenges ahead. Alongside his oldest son, Donald J. Trump Jr. and his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump spoke freely, talking about whether to court delegates with lavish perks like visits to his mansions. Below are some condensed excerpts from the conversation. On what it was like to vote for himself  in New York on Tuesday:  I got over to the booth, a lot of people on the street. Obviously, they saw somebody was coming, and when I got out, it was all cheers. And then I went in and I got the voter slip, and I saw my name, and I said: “Oh, that’s very interesting. I’m voting for myself as president of the United States. ” And it does sort of hit you, a little bit differently than when you’re thinking of it in a different context. You see your name, and it says “president of the United States” on a quite nicely printed form. And check the box. And it’s very big for not very many names. So it’s a great honor. Honestly, it’s a great honor. On the recent    he ordered, which diminished the role of Corey Lewandowski, his campaign manager:  Well, now we are evolving. I’m very happy with my people  —   the people that both got me here and the people that will take it to the next level. I think that Corey, and my whole group, I’m just very happy with them. We’ve become something that’s a very big thing. On Jeb Bush: I think Jeb would have been the nominee had I not gotten in, but I was able to define Jeb early. On what he sees as his unique ability to bring fresh thinking to old issues:  Don’t forget I’m the one that, when Jeb would say, “The country was safe when my brother was president,” I said, “Excuse me, the World Trade Center came down. ” Do you know, nobody thought of that? It’s like the paper clip. Nobody thought about the paper clip except for the guy that thought of it, and he became rich. And everyone else said, “Why didn’t I think of that idea?” On the race for delegates: It’s a rigged system. It’s a disgraceful, disgusting rigged system in the Republican Party. Worse than the Democratic Party, because in the Democratic case it’s obvious with superdelegates. Look at Bernie. He wins every week, and everyone says he can’t win. In the Democrat Party, it’s obvious because they have a superdelegate, that’s like throwing it in your face. The Republican Party is worse, the Republican Party has a system where you can buy the delegates if you want. And you can do anything you want with a delegate, except give them cash. I can play the game better  —   I can fly them on a 757 to    I can fly them to California where I own a place that’s unbelievable, on the Pacific Ocean. But it’s a bad system. You’re buying the election. It’s really wrong, and I’m looking into it, legally. On whether he will emphasize the economy and trade in the Pennsylvania and Indiana primaries: I think my message is so incredible for those two places, because they’ve been decimated, they’ve been decimated. There are some places where it wouldn’t work as well. On Ted Cruz possibly beating him in the delegate race: Look, other than the fact that he’s using a corrupt system and rigged system to get delegates, he’d be out of it already. He can’t win. But how do you pick a guy who’s down millions of votes and many hundreds of delegates. I’m already over 200 delegates up. So how do you do that? Do you understand? That’s pretty hard. I won. The voters voted for me. I think you’d have bedlam in the party. On top of it, Cruz is not a popular guy. He’s not liked. On Senator Marco Rubio of Florida’s attempts to wage a war of insults with him: He played Don Rickles, and then I played Don Rickles times five. And then he stopped. They had to try something. All right? On not wanting to woo delegates: I don’t like the process of it  —   you’re buying the election. I’m not ruling anything out, but I’ll tell you what  —   I think that there’s a serious legal challenge to all of this, and it starts with the “super PACs. ” This is a very serious dilemma for the Republican Party. On whether he actually wants the job of  president or simply wants to win: Look, there’s no greater honor. But I’m not doing it for the honor. I’m doing it because I really believe that with substance, intelligence and having the proper   ability, which I have, we can make this country so successful, so fast. We can bring it back. You know, make America great again. Which is also a great slogan.

18659,Graham’s 2020 Tax Law for POTUS Candidates Unconstitutional,"Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) is proposing a federal law that would require all candidates for president to release their 1040 personal income tax returns, including President Donald Trump. But such a law should not survive a court challenge, because it would be unconstitutional. [Article II of the Constitution sets forth three criteria to be eligible for president. A person must be (1) a natural born citizen, (2) at least 35 years of age, and (3) been residing in the United States for at least 14 years before the election.  That is all. Everything else is left to the voters to decide whom they want as commander in chief. Consequently, a federal statute requiring submitting tax returns would impose a requirement beyond what the Constitution specifies. Any candidate running for the presidency in 2020 would have legal standing to challenge the statute’s legality in court. Several Supreme Court cases involving Congress buttress the idea that Graham’s idea would not pass constitutional muster. In Powell v. McCormick (1969) the Court held that the Constitution’s provision that a simple majority of the U. S. House (or Senate) can decide the qualifications of its new members before allowing them to be sworn into Congress is limited to the criteria set forth in the Constitution (citizenship, age, and residency). Excluding a duly elected candidate for any other reason amounts to expelling that person from Congress, which requires a   vote by Congress, instead of 51 percent. More recently, in U. S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995) the justices split on whether states can impose term limits on people from that state in Congress (there, six years for House members and 12 years for senators) voting   that such limits imposed by states are unconstitutional. Justice Thomas dissented, joined by the conservative justices plus one moderate justice, arguing that under the Tenth Amendment each state has sovereign authority to add its own conditions for people from that state. The Supreme Court is currently divided on whether state lawmakers can impose additional requirements to qualify for various federal offices on each state’s ballot, but there is likely no disagreement regarding requirements imposed by federal lawmakers to qualify for the ballot. Both the majority and the dissent in Term Limits seemed to indicate that Congress could not impose additional requirements beyond the Constitution’s. The only other constitutional provision relevant to this discussion gives Graham no support. The Elections Clause in Article I says that while states have primary jurisdiction over elections, Congress can pass laws altering the “times, places and manner” of elections for federal office. That Article I provision does not include Graham’s proposed law. This has nothing to do with an election’s time (such as having federal elections on a Tuesday in November) place (polling locations) or manner (such as allowing   requirements to cast a ballot). This would instead add a requirement on who can be listed on the ballot. This has nothing to do with transparency or making information available to the public. This is instead about who gets to decide such matters. In this case, the Constitution sets forth what conditions must be satisfied to run for president. The voters can impose whatever additional requirements they choose as shown by who they vote for, but that is between the candidate and the electorate, not legislators who seek to insert themselves into the voting process in ways not authorized by the Supreme Law of the Land.

18660,Trump Says Refugees Are Flooding U.S. in Misleading Allusion - The New York Times,"JUPITER, Fla.  —   President Trump said on Saturday that judicial decisions that halted his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries had allowed a flood of refugees to pour into the country. “Our legal system is broken!” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter posting a day after he said that he was considering a wholesale rewriting of the executive order to circumvent legal hurdles quickly but had not ruled out appealing the major defeat he suffered in a federal appeals court on Thursday. “SO DANGEROUS!” the president added. Mr. Trump cited a report in The Washington Times that asserted that 77 percent of the refugees who entered the United States since Judge James L. Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the order on Feb. 3 had been from the seven “suspect countries. ” Still, his allusion to a rush of dangerous refugees is somewhat misleading. According to an analysis of data maintained by the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center, the percentage of refugees arriving from those countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   has risen considerably since the directive was suspended, but the weekly total of refugees arriving from the targeted countries has risen by only about 100. And all are stringently vetted. At the same time, refugee arrivals from countries not affected by the order have fallen sharply. Since the judge blocked the ban, 1, 049 of the 1, 462 refugees who have arrived in the United States, or 72 percent, were from the seven countries affected. In Mr. Trump’s first week of office, before he issued his order, more refugees arrived, 2, 108, and 935 of them, representing 44 percent, were from those seven nations. The figures suggest that the State Department and refugee resettlement agencies, which meet weekly to determine which individuals and families to admit to the United States, may be stepping up their efforts to help refugees from the seven countries. Mr. Trump’s order also sought to put an indefinite freeze on Syrian refugee admissions and temporarily suspend the rest of the refugee program until the screening process could be reviewed and made more restrictive. The figures show a similar phenomenon for Syrian refugee arrivals their proportion has nearly doubled since Mr. Trump moved to block them, although that represents a relatively small increase of about 100. While the 296 Syrians who arrived during the president’s first week in office made up 14 percent of the total, the 402 who have entered since his order was blocked amount to 27 percent of all refugee arrivals over that period. Refugees already face the strictest of vetting procedures to enter the United States, a process that takes from 18 months to two years because of multiple layers of security and background checks. Mr. Trump made his Twitter post at the start of a day of golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his resort in Jupiter, Fla.",0
18661,"Can G.O.P. Tell Donald Trump, ‘You’re Fired’? Probably Not - The New York Times","We are in the midst of yet another of Donald J. Trump’s   spirals of terrible news. And with prominent Republicans saying they will back Hillary Clinton and others announcing this week that they won’t endorse Mr. Trump, there has been yet another round of speculation about how the party could get rid of him. But it almost certainly can’t. And even if it could, it probably wouldn’t be worth the effort. Here’s why. Under Republican Party rules, Mr. Trump is the only one who can take himself out of the race at this point. The only provision that exists for replacing a candidate nominated at the party convention, Rule 9, was written to apply only in the event of a candidate’s death or refusal to run. Then the   Republican National Committee  —   a body made up of the men and women from each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories  —   would be able to name a new nominee by a majority vote. Each state and jurisdiction is given the same number of votes as delegates it has to the national convention, so the system favors larger   states. There is, however, some air in the rule  —   which actually spells out how to fill a vacancy “by reason of death, declination or otherwise”  —   that an enterprising lawyer could try to exploit. But arguing that Mr. Trump’s nomination can be rescinded by   party bosses over the word “otherwise” seems highly improbable. Even if Mr. Trump withdrew as the nominee, replacing him after the convention is uncharted and potentially messy territory. “The rules are vague, and there is no precedent,” said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a lawyer with Jones Day who has worked on multiple Republican presidential campaigns. Naming someone would be hard enough. Finding a suitable alternative was always the problem with the “Never Trump” movement. No matter how distasteful party leaders found him, they could never agree on anyone else. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump’s running mate, would seem to have a strong claim to make because he is the only other Republican formally nominated by his party. But what if others, rivals of Mr. Trump from the primaries like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, decided they deserved a shot? A new candidate would almost certainly not be chosen by acclamation. And determining who and how many are eligible would be a huge fight  —   one the Republican National Committee would have to resolve before it could ultimately vote. Given that the process of replacing the Republican nominee would probably not go smoothly or quickly  —   what has for Republicans this year?  —   there would be very little time left for other essential aspects of a presidential campaign. One of the issues is ballot access. Each state has its own set of rules and deadlines for getting on the ballot, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have already done. Getting their names off and the names of the new presidential and   candidates on would be a logistical and legal headache. Some states, including important battleground ones like Iowa, start voting later next month. Legal and logistical complications aside, how would a candidate run a campaign under such a compressed timeline? One thing is for sure: He or she would almost certainly not have the name recognition that Mr. Trump has. Convincing the country’s voters that they should elect you president is an undertaking that requires months, not weeks.",0
18662,Bad Jewish Losers Lament Trump’s Victory on BBC Newsnight,"By Francis Carr Begbie 
ERIC CANTOR , Republican politician, and LISSA MUSCATINE, Hillary Clinton’s former speech writer, were two of the many Jews given free rein to reflect on Donald Trump a few days ago before millions of BBC viewers. 
“In the end one could not help noticing one interesting if rather awkward fact about that edition of BBC Newsnight. The editor, two out of three of the main presenters, and all seven of the main interviewees in Washington and London were JEWISH. Not bad for a group said to represent less than 0.4% of the British population.” — Francis Carr Begbie 
You might think that after a disaster as humiliating as the election of Donald Trump that our anointed elites would take this opportunity for a bit of humility — that this would be an opportunity for introspection and some soul-searching self-reflection. 
Well, the good news is that you would be wrong. For this would involve a level of self-awareness far beyond our narcissistic elites. All around they are demonstrating a complete inability to understand the forces behind their humiliation at the hands of a man they dismissed as a joke from day one and whose demise they predicted every inch of the way. 
This self-deception was wonderfully on display in an immediate post-election edition of the BBC’s flagship current affairs programme Newsnight , broadcast to the nation the day after and including a number of American interviewees. In a specially extended version of the show, programme editor Ian Katz dispatched Emily Maitlis , Mark Urban and David Grossman to find answers on the day after the result. 
In both London and Washington a stellar line up of the finest brains from the media and the academy were assembled to help them chew it over. 
Entertainingly, the vanity, narcissism and entitlement of the BBC presenter-ocracy was fully on view, proud and undented. To the accompaniment of the Beatles tune “Fool on the Hill” anchor Emily Maitlis could barely contain her rage and sputtered about how “a game show host and someone who owned a beauty pageant” could become president. 
Populism, uprising, nationalism versus globalism; as with former President Bush’s puzzlement over “the vision thing,” they seemed to be able to mouth the words but comprehension was lacking. 
With every guest, Emily Maitlis showed that old habits die hard or not at all. She dripped condescension from the outset, snapping at immigration traitor , pro-Israel fanatic former US Congressman Eric Cantor who was perhaps trying to redeem himself given the new winds in the Republican Party: “We talked about the vulgarity of this man … This is a man who talked of grabbing women by the pussy. Is that a man you are proud [of]?” An angry school teacher furious with the behaviour of her immature, irresponsible charges. 
Easily the funniest moment in the programme came during a virtuoso splenetic performance from historian Simon Schama who seemed to think it was Germany in 1933 all over again. Race, he said, was more important factor in the election than the economic arguments. SIMON SCHAMA, ASHKENAZI JEW 
Wriggling in his seat, as if it was subjected to regular electric shocks, he said. 
“It is really weird to me how we pussyfoot around the toxic malodorous element of race which has played an important part of this. Anti-semitism has long been part of populism… [beginning] in the early twentieth century. Even today there were sinister references by the likes of senator Jeff Sessions to George Soros who was singled out as a particularly odious figure in this international banking conspiracy.” 
(To which many people in the Alt Right might have replied: “couldn’t have put it better myself.”) 
Schama almost lost it completely when co-interviewee and neocon stalwart Melanie Phillips told him to calm down a bit. 
“It is not a moment for calm, it is not a moment for calm.” he screeched. MELANIE PHILLIPS, ASHKENZI JEW AND VIRULENT ZIONIST 
Melanie knows very well what these anti-semitic dog whistles are like. This too is part of populism. We are facing a cataclysmic moment. Melanie is right to say it is a populist revolt. It is nothing to do with conservative republican politics. It amuses me to hear that Eric Cantor imagines that things are going to go on as they always did in the Republican party … [that they] will restrain Donald Trump. They won’t. George Washington warned about despotism and that is what we are facing. 
Melanie Phillips, for her part, agreed the most important problem was anti-Semitism, but she saw it coming from a completely different quarter. 
There are noxious elements around. … Clearly some of the people supporting Trump are anti-semitic and racists but that is also true of people on the left. There is no sign that he (Trump) personally is anti-semitic or racist. People call people racist when they want to restrict as he does, legal immigration. Anti-semitism is now at record levels at liberal universities overseen by liberal professors and liberal vice chancellors. 
Studio presenter Evan Davies muttered about how they had to give up something to people worried about the loss of their traditional societies and really act on illegal immigration. But Schama wasn’t listening. He was worried about David Duke. 
Donald Trump re-tweeted a neo-Nazi tweet. It is not a coincidence that David Duke, KKK Imperial Wizard, is exhilarated and rejoicing with the advent of Trump who is his man. We will see race crimes, hate crimes explode now. We will have a far-right supreme court which will reverse Roe [v.] Wade. 
As a glimpse into the fevered imagination of at least one strongly identifying Jew, it could not have been more revealing. Before Schama actually self-detonated on air, the programme moved on to more heavyweights. 
Neoconservative think tanker Danielle Pletka , senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, complained she had no idea what Trump’s policies were. Which was not very helpful. 
Mary Kaldor , professor of global governance at the London School of Economics, complained that Trump was “wildly unpredictable” in his stated foreign policies. “He says ‘I love Israel,’ then he says he wants to be neutral between Israel and Palestine.” For her the real danger seemed to be peace. Or as she framed it, Trump getting friendly with Putin to create an “alliance of authoritarian right wing leaders.” 
But it was the Pulitzer prize-winning historian of communism Anne Applebaum who painted the most apocalyptic scenario. Applebaum, who has never seen a “Deep State” she didn’t like, said that Trump had been disdainful for NATO and cannot understand why America needs to be in Europe. His admiration for Vladimir Putin as an ideal was very worrying. ANNE APPLEBAUM . . . ANOTHER ASHKENAZI JEW 
Europeans need to start from the assumption that United States is not a reliable partner. We need to keep repeating that until it sinks into people’s brains. 
She really said that. 
Applebaum said Trump sees no need for a relationship with the UK. He said that Trump, who has spent millions developing his two golf courses, which include Turnberry, is, apparently, “not an anglophile and has no interest in Britain. Hillary Clinton does.” Surely, asked presenter Grossman, the Brexit referendum puts Britain and the USA on the same page? Applebaum: “No, no, no.” 
Both these women think it makes the election of Marie le pen more likely. Likely correct, and thank god for that! 
Alan Greenspan , former chairman of the Fed, was wheeled on to say that he, a lifelong Republican had not voted. He also explained that Trump would not be able to get rid of the current Federal Reserve Bank chair Janet Yellen without a complicated impeachment process. 
Earlier in the show, Maitlis tried to get Republican Eric Cantor to condemn Trump but got no change. Cantor responded lamely about Trump’s promise to build a border wall. “I’m not so sure that is going to happen” — showing (not surprisingly) that he remains an immigration traitor at heart. And he continues to show his allegiance to Israel. Cantor said he was less interested in Trump’s immigration policies than his Middle East policies, including his intention to get rid of ISIS. 
Lissa Muscatine , Hillary’s former speech writer, assured Maitlis that her old college friend had bounced back as strong as ever. 
Elsewhere David Grossman did a breakdown of the vote to show that women and Hispanics had leaned to Trump in far greater numbers that anyone thought possible. (In fact, a solid majority of White women voted for Trump, proving Schama right: Trump voters are racists.) In the end one could not help noticing one interesting if rather awkward fact about that edition of BBC Newsnight . The editor, two out of three of the main presenters, and all seven of the main interviewees in Washington and London were Jewish. Not bad for a group said to represent less than 0.4% of the British population. 
I should note, however, that there were a smattering of Vox pop style three-second sound-bite interviewees of men in baseball hats celebrating in bars and so on. There was also an abortive panel of a Hispanic man, black woman and Jewish New York Times reporter, and there was a Latvian politician down the line. But otherwise it was an extremely Kosher programme. 
The BBC operates one of the most aggressive affirmative action policies in the Western world. In keeping with its position as the Vatican of political correctness, a finger is kept on the scales of employment opportunity to ensure that jobs are skewed heavily for favoured groups. 
But given that self-awareness is one area where the elites are notably deficient, it might be s good idea to remind them of the massive Jewish overrepresentation on display here. This is one very privileged group indeed. Overrepresented and overprivileged, one might say. Like this? Share it now.",0
18663,AG Sessions Suggests Openness to Review of Obama DOJ’s Actions,"WASHINGTON (AP)  —   Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested Thursday that he would be open to the appointment of an outside counsel to review actions taken by the Justice Department during the Obama administration. [Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Sessions in an interview if the new attorney general would consider designating an outside counsel “not connected to politics” to take a second look at Justice Department actions that provoked Republican ire in the last eight years. Those include the Fast and Furious gun scandal and the decisions against bringing criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s email practices or the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of conservative groups.  Hewitt contended during his radio interview that the department had become “highly politicized” in the Obama administration and floated the idea of a special review by an attorney with the authority to bring criminal charges and “just generally to look at how the Department of Justice operated. ” Sessions was noncommittal but left the door open, saying he would do everything he could to “restore the independence and professionalism of the Department of Justice. ” “So we would have to consider whether or not some outside special counsel is needed,” Sessions said. “Generally, a good review of that internally is the first step before any such decision is made. ” The exchange reflected the lingering deep partisan anger over the Justice Department’s decision to close without charges the Clinton email investigation and a separate probe into how the IRS processed requests for   applications. Sessions said the outcome of the IRS case, in particular, remained “of real concern. ” The Justice Department in 2015 found mismanagement at the tax agency but no evidence that it had targeted a political group based on its viewpoints or obstructed justice. Democrats have called for an outside counsel to probe possible contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Sessions recused himself last week from any investigation that touches the campaign, and Rod Rosenstein, the prosecutor nominated as his deputy, would not commit at his confirmation hearing this week to step aside from any such investigation. During the campaign, President Donald Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton, though he expressed ambivalence about that idea after he won the election. It’s not clear how serious Sessions was about the idea of a special counsel to investigate past Justice Department decisions, or how such an undertaking might work.",0
18664,Some Early Signs of ‘Brexit’ Upheaval - The New York Times,"FRANKFURT  —   Only hours after Britain decided to leave the European Union, Emmanuel Lumineau cast his own “remain” vote  —   with his feet. Mr. Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial   with him. The looming question on Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain’s status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment. Mr. Lumineau’s reasoning was simple. His customers operate under European rules and so must he. “We need to be inside,” said Mr. Lumineau, the French chief executive of BrickVest, a company that allows customers to invest small sums in real estate online. The   business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the “remain” camp’s warnings of economic tumult could come true. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo on Friday that in months to come “we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles. ” Mr. Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan’s 16, 000 employees in Britain might need to relocate. Shares of British property companies plunged Friday on fears that the Brexit vote will cause a recession and deflate London’s real estate boom. Jürgen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit. “All companies will be holding fire to see what happens,” said Mr. Maier, Siemens’s chief executive for Britain. For decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their     beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany. Now that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a   trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as   parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain’s coattails out of the union. It is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain cheaper to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports. Britain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels. If the “leave” forces are correct, that would make the country a magnet for companies seeking to escape the regulatory corset of mainland Europe. But any advantages are likely to be outweighed by the enormous uncertainties ahead. With no road map, executive   could be paralyzed and investment could come to a standstill. Britain’s financial services industry, which employs 1. 2 million people, is especially vulnerable. New stock listings in London are likely to all but cease while companies take stock of the damage. Foreign banks may face the costs of moving thousands of employees out of London to the Continent so they can satisfy regulations governing trading and investment advice on behalf of European clients. London had provided a convenient hub to serve Europe. James P. Gorman, the Morgan Stanley chief executive, and Colm Kelleher, the president, said Friday that they had no plans to relocate staff from London. But in a memo to employees  —   many of whom worked through the night to handle a huge trading volume  —   they said they might “consider adjustments to our operating model. ” Even Deutsche Bank, the symbol of German banking nominally based in Frankfurt, uses London as a base for investment banking and trading. It has often made most of its profit there. “I’m afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe,” said John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief, who happens to be British. “At this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there’s no doubt that they will be negative on all sides. ” Perhaps no company embodies the European project more than Airbus, a politically driven consortium that allowed Europe to remain a player in the aircraft industry after smaller national manufacturers could no longer compete. Airbus produces wings in Broughton and employs 15, 000 people in Britain plus tens of thousands more at suppliers. Outside the union, Britain may no longer have as strong a claim on those jobs. “This is a   result for both Britain and Europe,” said Thomas Enders, the Airbus chief executive. “We will review our U. K. investment strategy, like everybody else will. ” Other sectors as different as petrochemicals and Scottish whisky could be damaged by increases in customs duties, diverging legal requirements and slumping growth. Energy companies like BP or Royal Dutch Shell are worried about having to deal with an unwieldy snarl of differing regulations once the European Union umbrella is gone. “Uncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours,” BP said in a statement Friday. United States technology companies like Google and Facebook have sizable operations in Britain, though their headquarters are technically in   countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. Google employs roughly 1, 000 engineers across Britain, working on global products like its search engine and Android mobile operating system. Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe’s common marketplace. The ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany’s   customer for exports, after the United States and France. German brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday. German companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and   are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen. Probably the most important company in the renaissance of British car manufacturing has been Nissan, which has pumped close to 4 billion pounds since the   into a   factory in Sunderland in northeast England. Last year the company produced about 475, 000 vehicles, about a third of Britain’s total, exporting about 55 percent of them to the European Union. Yet despite the European Union’s importance to local jobs, voters in Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave. The Brexit camp won 61 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for remain. Stuart Boyd, a Nissan spokesman, said on Friday that the company was not ready to comment on how it might respond. Perhaps workers believed that Nissan sales would increase because of a weaker pound. But any stimulus to British exports from a devalued currency is likely to be offset by higher prices for imported goods. Britain has a trade deficit, so a weaker pound is on balance negative. Another huge foreign manufacturer is Siemens, based in Munich, which has 13 factories and 14, 000 workers in Britain making products like electric motors, gas turbines and trains. Siemens is not about to pull up stakes. But Mr. Maier, the Siemens chief for Britain, said the Brexit vote could force the company to recalculate some investment decisions. For example, European Union grants help finance Siemens research and development projects in Britain in areas like   cars. That financial support will disappear once Britain is out. “The question is more about future investment, future research and development,” Mr. Maier said. “That’s hanging in the balance. ” He embodies the strong ties between Britain and the mainland. Born in Germany, Mr. Maier has lived in Britain since he was 10, studied there, and speaks with a British accent. He said that there was a palpable sense of anxiety Friday morning when he visited a company office in Manchester that is used by engineers and customer service representatives. “It’s usually a really buzzing office,” Mr. Maier said. “This morning it was definitely quiet. Customers weren’t calling. That’s not a good sign. The country is just taking all of this in. ”",0
18665,"WATCH: Nine Injured as Erdogan Guards, Kurdish and Armenian Protesters Clash in DC - Breitbart","Guards accompanying Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan violently attacked protesters in Washington, D. C. Tuesday who had congregated outside the Turkish ambassador to America’s residence, most Armenians and Kurds protesting Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian bent under Erdogan. [CNN cites D. C. officials as stating that nine individuals, most protesters, were injured in the brawl. An estimated two dozen protesters congregated in front of Turkish ambassador Serdar Kılıç’s residence, some waving a flag associated with the Syrian Kurdish People’s Democratic Union (PYD) which Erdogan’s government perceives as a direct threat to the integrity of Turkey. Two were arrested, one charged with assaulting a police officer it is unclear whether those arrested were protesters or members of Erdogan’s security detail.  Videos circulating on social media appear to show Erdogan’s guards among the most violent aggressors. A video published by Voice of America appears to show men in black suits carrying Turkish flags  —   believed to be Erdogan’s security detail  —   attacking individuals holding megaphones and protest signs. The guards surround a   man who had been kicked to the ground and continuously kick him in the face. Men who appear to be wearing D. C. police uniforms then attempt to surround and capture the men in black suits.  The Kurdish outlet Rudaw published an exclusive video showing the injuries of some of the protesters involved. One man, walking away from the incident with a bloodied face, tells the camera, “the Turks attacked me. ”   Speaking to CNN, a protester identified as Flint Arthur said that his group had congregated to protest Erdogan’s presence in Washington and his “policies in Turkey, in Syria and Iraq. ” “They think they can engage in the same sort of suppression of protest and free speech that they engage in in Turkey,” he argued. A similar incident occurred during Erdogan’s visit to Washington last year, in which Erdogan guards beat Turkish journalists protesting for their rights. Erdogan’s government has engaged in a prolonged military operation against the nation’s Kurdish minority in the southeast of the country, arguing that the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) a U. S.  Marxist terrorist group, is a threat to Turkish security. Ankara does not distinguish between the PKK and the PYD and its militia, the People’s Protection Units (YPG) who are strong U. S. allies and considered the most effective force against the Islamic State in Syria. Erdogan came to Washington in part to demand that President Donald Trump rescind his approval of a program to arm the YPG in anticipation of an operation to liberate Raqqa, the Islamic State “capital” and its final stronghold in Syria. A week before arriving in America, Erdogan announced his “patience has ended” with the United States and its alliance with the YPG. Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım reiterated that resolve hours before Erdogan met with Trump, telling reporters that Turkey was open to doing “what is necessary” to keep the YPG from participating in the fight against the Islamic State, implying military action. Shortly after the Pentagon’s announcement that Washington would provide the Syrian Kurds with heavy weapons, the Turkish military executed airstrikes against YPG positions in Syria. While Trump confirmed in a joint statement following their meeting Tuesday that he opposed the PKK, he did not walk back his administration’s support for the YPG.

18667,"California cities poised to impose ‘utility’ tax on apps, streaming, pay-per-view","Print 
[Ed. – The taxation aspect is bad enough. But think about it. Think how the city has to track what people are doing in order to impose such a tax. Since it involves the collection of money for the government, there’s no way IT service companies will be able to keep their books on this private. The vendor’s books on what consumers are doing will have to be as open as the books on buying gas by the gallon at a gas pump. The difference with infosphere activities is that there is no such thing as cash-based anonymity for the customer. One way or another, a trail is left.] 
You just want to watch movies and TV shows where and when you want to, so you probably think a column about utility taxes has nothing to do with how you get your entertainment. Wrong. The city of Alameda, California, has put a measure, Measure K1, before its voters that would allow Alameda to tax pay-per-view and video streaming services like Netflix and Hulu as if they were public utilities. Watsonville has a similar measure. Other California municipalities have passed similar language. They haven’t begun to levy utility taxes on these platforms, but figure as soon as one city decides to levy this tax, there will be a stampede across California. … 
Michael Petricone of the Consumer Technology Association calls Measure K1 “an absurd expansion of the definition of utility.” Think of “the precedent this sets,” he noted, if cities can tax services that don’t utilize public easements or infrastructure as utilities.",0
18668,Comment on Will Michelle Obama Be The Replacement Nominee If The FBI Email Investigation Ends Hillary Clinton’s Campaign? by marlene,"  Michael Snyder 
I realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. 
In fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled “ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside “… 
So what should the Democrats do now? 
If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: 
They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. 
Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. 
But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th… 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. 
Who would they choose? 
Let’s take a look at the top five options… 
#1 Tim Kaine 
He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton’s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. 
And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. 
So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. 
#2 Joe Biden 
Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run … 
Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. 
Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. 
But according to the vice president, the short answer is “no.” The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. 
Unfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. 
Biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn’t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. 
Biden would probably represent the “safest” choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. 
#3 Bernie Sanders 
Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. 
First of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. 
Secondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. 
Thirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be “another McGovern” and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. 
So even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. 
#4 Elizabeth Warren 
Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the “Bernie Sanders” wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. 
So she is definitely a possibility. 
But she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as “another McGovern” because of her far left policies. 
#5 Michelle Obama 
One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. 
And these days Barack Obama’s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. 
So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. 
Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as “the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign” in a recent MSN article entitled “ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice “… 
The speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama’s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. 
“When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. “We know she didn’t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.” 
If I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. 
Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. 
And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. 
In the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. 
And if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down.

18670,BREAKING: Mega Turnout Reported Across Michigan,"This morning a colleague asked if I had a prediction on the election. Of course, trying to predict the outcome today is a fool’s errand. I won’t even take a stab at it. Like literally everyone else in the country, I have no idea what is going to happen when results start flooding in.
And that’s what I said.
Then the conversation transitioned to one of us both picking a state we think the unthinkable might happen in. I chose Michigan .
Call it a hunch. Call it a feeling. Or call it hope. Whatever the case, I feel something special may happen in Michigan tonight and Donald Trump may be the benefactor.
I see a couple reasons for this. First, Michigan has no early voting. Right out of the gate this causes problems for Democrats and their heavy use (or abuse in many cases) of early voting. Democrats struggle with getting voters out on a single day, something Republicans tend to not only do well, but actually favor as traditionalists.
Second, Michigan has been hit hard by Democrat policy for decades. And Democrats can’t squirm their way out of blame on it. The collapse is on their shoulders. They know it, we know it and Michigan’s electorate knows it.
Third, Republicans have enjoyed a lot of recent success across Michigan. Michigan Republicans have been winning a lot of local, federal and statewide races as of late.
Fourth, the Trump campaign got wind of something that sent them to campaign heavily across Michigan in the final weeks leading up to today. It’s possible they just wanted to force Clinton to spend time and money up there, but I think it’s more likely they see something internally that suggests the state is in play.
Fifth, Bernie Sanders almost beat Clinton in Michigan. Her core support there is shaky at best.
Turns out my hunch may be proving possible in terms of voter turnout so far today. Indeed, there are wide scale reports of record turnout across Michigan.
Frank Luntz tweeted out saying the working-class turnout is extremely high and the Governor said “it looks like this precinct has had a lot of people turn out. I hope that happens throughout Michigan” following his vote earlier today.
Twitter is full of reports of long lines and busy precincts, many of which are in parts of the state Democrats don’t have full control over.
Will it be enough? Maybe not. But in August Clinton led the average of Michigan polls by 9.5%. Today her lead is within the margin of error.
Meaning that yes, Michigan is completely up for grabs. And it turns out there is a good chance Trump comes out with a win.

18671,Colin Kaepernick’s Anthem Protest Underlines Union of Sports and Patriotism - The New York Times,"The pressing question for many viewers tuning in to a preseason football game on Thursday night will be whether San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick will once more refuse to stand for the national anthem. But that question obscures some more meaningful ones: Why is the national anthem a staple of sporting events to begin with? Why does the United States stand apart in making the anthem a part of the pregame ritual? And what does it mean to be patriotic? Kaepernick, once regarded as one of the N. F. L. ’s top players, has suddenly become its most provocative ahead of Thursday’s game in San Diego because, in a country that is unusual in its marriage of sports and public patriotism, he has chosen the anthem as the moment to communicate a message of protest. After declining to stand during the anthem before a game on Friday night, Kaepernick explained that he was motivated by issues of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States  —   eliciting vitriol from fans who believed his gesture was an affront and praise from those who admired his decision to take a public stand at a time when few prominent athletes are willing to do so. Lost in that debate, though, is that while   sports are a type of entertainment, few other forms of   entertainment  —   movies or concerts or exhibitions  —   have the anthem ingrained into every performance. Tens of thousands of theater goers, for instance, have packed a Broadway musical that is devoted to the life and times of one of this country’s founding fathers, yet “Hamilton” does not feature the national anthem. On the other hand, a game between the Cleveland Gladiators and the Arizona Rattlers in the Arena Football League could not begin without it. For the athletes, the juxtaposition might be even stranger: The president of the United States is not required to listen to the national anthem before beginning his day, but Jay Bruce must hear it before taking the field as an outfielder for the Mets. “I don’t think it’s unusual because every baseball game I’ve ever played, there’s been an anthem,” Bruce said. “I was thinking about that the other day: Like, how many times have I been involved with an anthem? It’s so many times. It’s what I’m used to. ” Historically, the roots of “The   Banner” in American sports have been traced as far back as baseball games in the   century, and the song became more widespread in baseball during the heightened atmosphere in this country around the First World War. Other sports followed, folding the anthem into their own protocols, and decades later, the pattern seems inextricably linked  —   though it is unclear why. Pat Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said that the national anthem has been performed before all of its games since 1942 and that “it remains an important tradition that has great meaning for our fans. ” Tim Frank, a spokesman for the N. B. A. said the anthem has been performed before games since the inception of the league in 1946 and that it is done “in honor of the United States and those who have sacrificed to protect it. ” Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N. F. L. said the anthem is required because “we believe there is tremendous value in coming together to honor our nation’s history and also remember the men and women who have built and protect our country. ” John Dellapina, a spokesman for the N. H. L. cited minutes from a Board of Governors meeting that noted the league has mandated the anthem be played since 1946 “as a show of patriotism” but has allowed “God Bless America” as a substitute since the 1970s. The newest top professional league in America, Major League Soccer, was formed in 1996, and according to Dan Courtemanche, a league spokesman, the original M. L. S. executives had little choice on this issue. Rules regarding the playing of the anthem were enacted, Courtemanche said, because “at this point, it has become part of the tradition of playing a sporting event in America. ” The key words there are “in America. ” No national anthems are played before a French league soccer game or a German handball league game or a Japanese rugby game. So why does the connection exist in the United States? According to Eric Liu, a former speechwriter and adviser to President Bill Clinton who   a 2007 book on patriotism titled “The True Patriot,” the difference probably lies in America’s distinctive foundation. Unlike a majority of countries in the world, the United States was not created on a common platform of religion or ancestry or, as Liu said, “some origin myth which goes all the way back to the beginning of history. ” Instead, Americans are bound by notions and concepts  —   that all men are created equal, as one example  —   and the ethereal nature of those ideas makes anything that Americans can latch on to concretely seem more important. “I think that’s why this whole thing strikes so many people in such a passionate way,” Liu said. “This is not a country in Europe or Asia that has the traditional patriotic ideas built into it. We are united by a creed, and in a creedal society, the outsize rituals  —   like the anthem  —   just carry a lot more weight. ” Perhaps that is why athletes have used it as an opportunity to protest. The basketball player Mahmoud   was sanctioned by the N. B. A. in 1996 when he refused to stand for the anthem. The American track athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos were kicked out of the 1968 Olympics after raising gloved fists on the medals podium. Those athletes, like Kaepernick, were explicitly making political statements, forcing the public to reconcile an apparent slight of the national anthem versus the rights bestowed on all citizens that the song symbolizes for some. Liu and his   the entrepreneur and activist Nick Hanauer, highlight a quotation from Carl Schurz, a Union Civil War general and senator from Missouri, who in 1872 made the distinction between a popular line of patriotic thinking  —   that essentially, what the United States is doing is always right  —   and what he believed to be a more appropriate philosophy. “The Senator from Wisconsin cannot frighten me by exclaiming, ‘My country, right or wrong,’” Schurz said on the Senate floor before adding his own corollary. “My country, right or wrong,” he said. “If right, to be kept right and if wrong, to be set right. ” Is sitting for the national anthem, as Saints quarterback Drew Brees said in his criticism of Kaepernick’s actions, “being disrespectful to the American flag”? Is it, as Brees continued, “an oxymoron” that Kaepernick is sitting down because it is the anthem, and the flag, that give him the right to speak in the first place? Or is it the reverse: that the contradiction comes from those who trumpet the freedoms the flag represents but then criticize someone who exercises those freedoms? Is Kaepernick simply doing his duty, as Schurz said, by trying to set right that which he sees in his country as having gone awry? More than 60, 000 spectators in San Diego and an international TV audience can wrestle with this again on Thursday night. Game time at Qualcomm Stadium is scheduled for 10 p. m. Eastern. The national anthem will be sung a few minutes before.",0
18672,‘Up Is Down’: Trump’s Unreality Show Echoes His Business Past - The New York Times,"As a businessman, Donald J. Trump was a serial fabulist whose   boasts about everything he touched routinely crumbled under the slightest scrutiny. As a candidate, Mr. Trump was a magical realist who made fantastical claims punctuated by his favorite verbal tic: “Believe me. ” Yet even jaded connoisseurs of Oval Office dissembling were astonished over the last week by the torrent of bogus claims that gushed from President Trump during his first days in office. “We’ve never seen anything this bizarre in our lifetimes, where up is down and down is up and everything is in question and nothing is real,” said Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity and the author of “935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity,” a book about presidential deception. It was not just Mr. Trump’s debunked claim about how many people attended his inauguration, or his insistence (contradicted by his own Twitter posts) that he had not feuded with the intelligence community, or his audacious and   claim that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote only because millions of people voted for her illegally. All week long, news organizations chased down one Trump tall tale after another. PolitiFact, a website devoted to checking the veracity of claims by public officials, published 12 “of the most misleading claims” Mr. Trump made during his first White House interview. The Chicago Tribune found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he claimed two people were shot and killed in Chicago the very hour President Barack Obama was there delivering his farewell address. (There were no shootings, police records showed.) The Philadelphia Inquirer found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he said the city’s murder rate was “terribly increasing. ” (The murder rate has steadily declined over the last decade.) The indefatigable fact checkers at The Washington Post cataloged 24 false or misleading statements made by the president during his first seven days in office. But for students of Mr. Trump’s long business career, there was much about President Trump’s   ways that was familiar: the mystifying false statements about seemingly trivial details, the rewriting of history to airbrush unwanted facts, the branding as liars those who point out his untruths, the deft conversion of demonstrably false claims into a semantic mush of unverifiable “beliefs. ” Mr. Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for   insecurities. But throughout his business career, Mr. Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his   image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand. Nearly 30 years ago, in his   book “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump memorably extolled the advantages of “truthful hyperbole,” which he described as “an innocent form of exaggeration  —   and a very effective form of promotion. ” It is one thing when the hyperbole comes from a reality TV star exaggerating his ratings to a roomful of television critics. The stakes are infinitely higher when it comes from the leader of the free world, and this reality is provoking alarm from many across the political spectrum. Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s cascade of falsehoods was “a direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy” in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration’s “alternative facts” on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell’s “1984,” in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. ” “In a democratic government, there must be truth in order to hold elected officials accountable to their sovereign, which is the people,” Mr. Schmidt said. “All authoritarian societies are built on a foundation of lies and alternative facts, and what is true is what the leader believes, or what is best for the state. ” Mr. Lewis argued that the president’s untruths were a deliberate strategy to position the nation’s leading news organizations as the enemy of his administration. “  becomes an act of war by the media,” he said. Indeed, last Saturday, on Day 2 of his administration, Mr. Trump told hundreds of C. I. A. employees that he had “a running war with the media” and called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth. ” The next day, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, accused the news media of trying to “delegitimize” the new president and promised, “We are not going to sit around and let it happen. ” By Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, was referring to the news media as “the opposition party” during an interview with The New York Times. “It feels like this was part of the plan all along,” Mr. Lewis said. Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer   historian who has written about Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s brazen willingness to deny “objective reality” had, if nothing else, succeeded in diverting public attention from matters of more lasting consequence, like his flurry of executive orders. “I don’t know that he is doing it strategically,” she said, “but it certainly had the impact of a magician’s sleight of hand. ” Deception, dissembling, exaggeration  —   what Fortune magazine called his “astonishing ability to prevaricate”  —   has deep roots in Mr. Trump’s business career. In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from Trump University students who said they had been defrauded, to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to   contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them. In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a “spurious” lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trump’s denials, there was “strong evidence” he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits. In the case of Trump University, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that he had “handpicked” each of the instructors who were hired to teach students the secrets of his real estate investing strategies. Yet during a deposition, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single instructor, even after he was shown their photographs. The price Mr. Trump paid for this record of prevarication was modest and manageable. His lawyers quietly settled cases when necessary, almost always after binding plaintiffs to secrecy. Some major banks and law firms quietly pulled back from doing or seeking business with the Trump Organization. Skeptical judges turned away his libel suit against a journalist who wrote a book calling into question the amount of his wealth. But usually, by the time the truth caught up, Mr. Trump had moved on to the next big thing. Once he stepped into the political arena, however,   operations began cataloging his false statements in ways he never experienced during his years as a real estate developer and reality television star. PolitiFact, for example, has scrutinized 356 specific claims by Mr. Trump and found that more than   of the claims were “mostly false,” “false” or, in 62 cases, “Pants on Fire” false. “Trump is a different kind of figure than we’ve ever seen before in our 10 years of ” Bill Adair, the creator of PolitiFact and a journalism professor at Duke University, said in an interview. “No one has come close to Trump in the high percentage of falsehoods. ” Mr. Trump’s election alone is evidence he did not pay a high price for his plethora of false claims on the campaign trail. Nor are there many signs that his loyal base of supporters is troubled by the misstatements he has made in the first week of his presidency. “There’s no question that the messages and the actions of the first week are deeply resonating with tens of millions of Americans,” Mr. Schmidt said. And even if some Republican leaders in Washington view the president’s behavior as “strange” or “worrisome,” he said, they are for now more focused on the tax cuts and deregulation they hope to achieve under his administration. Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about whether he understands the difference between fallacies uttered by the president of the United States and promotional puffery from a real estate developer boasting of his latest hotel or golf course. In Mr. Trump’s first interview as president, David Muir of ABC News asked, “Do you think that your words matter more now?” “Yes, very much,” Mr. Trump said. Yet then Mr. Muir asked, “Do you think that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence?” “No, not at all,” he replied. “Not at all because many people feel the same way that I do. ” As if to prove the point, Mr. Trump then doubled down on his lie about millions of illegal votes. “Believe me, those were Hillary votes,” he said. “And if you look at it, they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn’t vote for me. ” For Ms. Goodwin, Mr. Trump’s week of reality distortions brought to mind Lincoln’s address to the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Ill. on Jan. 27, 1838, where he made an appeal to Enlightenment values as the best antidote to what he called the “mobocratic spirit. ” “Reason  —   cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason  —   must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense,” he said. “He was worrying about authoritarian behavior,” Ms. Goodwin said.",0

[“Yiannopoulos does not deserve to be granted the platform of a university campus to espouse his hateful beliefs,” wrote the student newspaper on Sunday. “Institutions of higher education pride themselves on generating new knowledge and challenging old beliefs for the purposes of advancing our understanding of the world.

18674,Trump Plays Budget Hardball in Congress to Build Border Wall - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s budget director is threatening to withhold funding for Obamacare subsidies unless Democrats agree to help fund the border wall in the 2017 budget supplemental. [The offer follows weeks of determined Democratic opposition  —   amid determined waffling by top GOP leaders  —   to any funding for Trump’s wall during this year.  “We have our list of priorities,” budget director Mick Mulvaney said at a business conference on Thursday. He continued:  Won’t surprise anyone what some of them are. We want more money for defense. We want to build a border wall. We want more money for immigration, law enforcement. The Democrats may have some of their own priorities. I [already] indicated making some of these payments for the Obamacare subsidies is one of their priorities. Okay, that’s fine. We’re willing to be at that discussion if they want to have it and that’s what we’re telegraphing   …     we understand they have a certain amount of leverage in the Senate because we do need 60 votes [to get funding]. So we need some sort of bipartisan support in the Senate. They are entitled under that set of circumstances to get some of their priorities funded. It is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and Democrats some of their priorities. We think we’ve opened the door [to a compromise]. I know that we have. Democrats may be open to that compromise. On Wednesday, the Democrats’ Senate leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer told reporters that Democrats are trying to preserve funding for Obamacare. “We’re working hard to get it in the bill. We’re very hopeful, negotiations seem to be going quite well   …     We want to make a good budget that meets our principles   …     so far, so good,” he said, according to a report from BNA. com. Democrats will pay a price for obstructing Trump’s priorities, Mulvaney warned. If [Democrats] tell us to pound sand, I think that’s probably a disappointing indicator of where the next four years is going to go. If they tell us, however, that they recognize that President Trump won an election, and he should get some of his priorities funded for that reason, elections have consequences, as folks who win always like to say. ” For months, GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have declined to champion funding Trump’s wall in the 2017 budget supplemental, which is due April 28. Trump has asked for roughly $1 billion to install or upgrade roughly 60 miles of border walls and fences this year.  GOP leaders are reluctant to fund the wall, in part, because they don’t want to trade some of their budget priorities to persuade the Democrats to compromise on their   opposition to Trump’s wall. Many Democrats fervently oppose the wall, which would literally and symbolically cement his 2016 victory and also block the migration of consumers, cheap workers, and future voters into   cities.  Also, GOP leaders know their business donors oppose the wall, which would reduce the inflow of   consumers and workers to the corporate members of the many Chambers of Commerce throughout the United States. Democrats know the GOP leaders are not willing to champion’s Trump’s wall, so they are escalating their opposition to Trump’s wall and his border reforms, such as greater enforcement of current laws. For example, Democrats are threatening to block all budget funding  —   and so shut down many government agencies  —   unless they get their way.  On Wednesday, Schumer said all extra immigration funding should be held up until the next round of budget debates in the fall of 2017.  “We think that the immigration issue should be discussed in the 2018 budget where there’s votes and discussion and nothing should be shoved down people’s throats and that would apply to the many immigration issues that are before us, not just the wall,” Schumer said in a press call. BNA reported:  Billions of dollars for the wall and other funds that Trump wants to boost enforcement have emerged among the “poison pill” riders that Schumer said could threaten passage of the omnibus by the time federal money runs out at midnight April 28. The government is operating under a stopgap continuing resolution because only one of the 12 fiscal 2017 bills was enacted last fall. Schumer suggested that Democrats have considerable leverage in the talks over the details of the omnibus, which have continued during lawmakers’   recess. “Our Republican colleagues know they control the House, the Senate, the White House [and] a shutdown would fall on their shoulders and they don’t want it,” Schumer said. On multiple occasions, GOP leader Ryan has said the Trump wall will be funded in the 2018 budget starting in October, while hinting it will get little funding for construction in 2017.  This month, Officials at the Department of Homeland Security  However, officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been told by GOP budget leaders that they can reprogram some of their existing funds to pay for construction of prototype wall designs in June.  In his Wednesday call with reporters, Schumer gloated that the GOP leaders are not supporting Trump’s budget request.  “I think there’s agreement, quiet agreement in the [GOP and Democratic budget leaders] that if the president doesn’t interfere and insist on poison pill amendments [funding for the wall] to be shoved down the throats of the Congress, we can come up with an agreement. ” Follow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart. com",0

18676,"Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General, Could Overhaul Department He’s Skewered - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, as the courtly senator from Alabama used to be known, was a stalwart Justice Department prosecutor for almost 15 years, a job he called the adventure of a lifetime. Today, Mr. Sessions has a growing list of gripes about how the Obama administration has run his old department, from its “breathtaking” stance on immigration to its “shameful” refusal to defend a federal ban on gay marriage. “I’m not happy about what’s happened to my Department of Justice,” Mr. Sessions said last year, jabbing his reading glasses in the air at the Senate confirmation hearing for Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. After nearly a   away, Mr. Sessions  —   now known simply as Jeff  —   is poised to return to the department to clean house as   Donald J. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, with a mandate to carry out the “law and order” agenda Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail. If he is confirmed, Mr. Sessions, who is considered one of the most conservative members of the Senate, will most likely push for wholesale changes and   stances on immigration, terrorism, crime, drugs and guns. Democrats fear he could wipe away progress in civil rights, changes in sentencing and police accountability. “The Justice Department is likely to be one of the most transformed departments in the cabinet in a Trump administration, and with an Attorney General Sessions, you’d obviously see a very strong    figure at the top,” said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor. “Much of his   is as a prosecutor  —   a real,    prosecutor,” said Mr. Turley, who testified before Mr. Sessions at a Senate hearing last year about the Obama administration’s use of executive authority. Mr. Sessions, 69, was the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump in February, when many Republicans were still shunning the businessman. He has since become a close adviser. The Senate Judiciary Committee, where Mr. Sessions has served for years and sometimes clashed with fellow members, will consider his nomination. Democrats are eager to interrogate him on the rockier patches of his long career, particularly the accusations of racially charged comments in the 1980s that derailed his nomination as a federal judge. Critics charge that the controversy was a harbinger of hostility toward minorities that has continued in his two decades as a senator. “He’s one of the most strident      . G. B. T. voices in the Senate,” said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way, a liberal civil rights group in Washington. Mr. Sessions, like Mr. Trump, has made tougher immigration policies a central priority. He has said President Obama’s Justice Department flouted the will of Congress by failing to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. When many Republicans distanced themselves from Mr. Trump’s startling campaign proposal to ban Muslim immigration, Mr. Sessions said he was open to considering it in a Breitbart interview last December with Stephen K. Bannon, who was chosen by Mr. Trump this week as a top White House adviser. Mr. Sessions acknowledged in the  interview that the proposal was “treading on dangerous ground” because of the country’s long history of religious freedom. “At the same time, we’re in an age that’s very dangerous, and we’re seeing more and more persons enter, and a lot of them have done terrorist acts, and a lot of them believe it’s commanded by their religion,” he said. “So I think it’s appropriate to begin to discuss this. ” As the nation’s top law enforcement officer, Mr. Sessions, and the political appointees under him, would hold wide discretion in shaping policies across the federal government and in overseeing the enforcement of federal laws at the F. B. I. and other agencies within the Justice Department. His department would also play an important role in advising the White House on Supreme Court nominees and working to get them confirmed in the Senate. Mr. Sessions, an avid student of constitutional history, has called Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, a model, hailing him for “an unwavering commitment to the rule of law” rather than judicial activism. Mr. Sessions was born in Selma, Ala. the son of a country store owner. The diminutive Mr. Sessions was an Eagle Scout known as “Buddy” as a child. His parents, he said, instilled in him the values of “honesty, hard work, belief in God and parental respect. ” With a law degree from the University of Alabama, Mr. Sessions worked as a private attorney and as an assistant federal prosecutor before President Ronald Reagan tapped him in 1981 as the United States attorney for the southern district of Alabama. He held that post for 12 years. Accusations of inappropriate racial remarks  —   one black prosecutor said Mr. Sessions called him “boy,” and another prosecutor said he referred to groups like the N. A. A. C. P. and the American Civil Liberties Union as “ ”  —   doomed his nomination for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench in 1986. But Mr. Sessions took satisfaction not only in winning election to the Senate a decade later, but also in earning a seat on the powerful Judiciary Committee, the same panel that had rejected his nomination as a judge.",0

18680,Mobilizing in Guatemala,"[Photo: Chiquibul Forest Reserve near Guatemalan border: top showing significant illegal clear cuts. while the bottom shows the beginnings of cutting. Credit: Tony Rath .] =By= Jeff Abott Editor's Note The forests, waterways, and tribal homelands are under growing threat across Latin and South America. Increasingly, the indigenous peoples are taking strong stands against the illegal activities, as well as the government sponsored intrusions into the Reserves. It seems that they are virtually the only ones willing to stand in the way of the decimation of their homelands, and of the wild rainforest on which out planet depends. The rainforest is essentially the lungs of the planet and it is being continuously destroyed. A cross Guatemala, indigenous communities are organizing to challenge logging in the country’s vast forests. These communities are concerned with the impact that both legal and illegal logging will have on their watersheds and on the environment.
On June 15, concerned residents from the highland Ixil Maya municipality of Nebaj, Quiche staged a protest outside the municipal building to express their concern with the steady increase in trucks leaving town loaded with lumber. 
The action was organized by residents and members of the Indigenous Authority of Nebaj in order to pressure the state authorities to strip the nine companies of their licenses to exploit timber on private lands. Residents raised concern over the fact that the deforestation affects everyone in the area. 
Following the protest, concerned residents in the neighboring Ixil municipality of Chajul blocked and detained several trucks transporting lumber from the region for a number of hours. They demanded that the National Institute of Forests, or INAB, and the Division for the Protection of the Environment cease their operations and described the amount of lumber being taken from the local forests as “excessive.” 
The Indigenous Authorities of Nebaj also issued a statement to INAB asking them to take action. But the government body declined to act and issued a statement that they are planting new trees for every one that is cut down. But this response did not satisfy concerned residents. “We went to the government bodies and issued statements asking to cease extending licenses for the exploitation of forests,” said Caty Terraza, the communications representative for the Indigenous Authorities of Nebaj. “They told us that they are sowing new trees, but how long will it take for those trees to grow to the same size as the trees that were there before?” 
The companies involved in logging operations responded to the protests by significantly reducing the number of trucks transporting lumber from mountains. According to residents, however, it is unclear if this will continue into the future. 
The mobilization of communities organizing to challenge logging operations in the highlands of Guatemala represent a growing concern over the destruction of the environment by companies. This challenge to logging companies reflects the understanding of communities of the vital part forests play in the protection of the water sources. 
“The trees serve us and the animals,” Terraza said. “The loss of trees is drying up the aquifers. As a youth and as human, I must think of my future, and what I’m leaving my children.” Other communities held similar protests following the actions taken in the Ixil region. On June 26, a similar action was held in Santa Cruz del Quiche, the department’s largest city. Once again protesters were demanding that authorities stop issuing licenses for the exploitation of forests. Increase in Logging across Guatemala 
Guatemala is home to vast forests and jungles, but these regions have increasingly come under threat to deforestation. Critics blame uneducated campesinos clearing land for agriculture as one of the prime culprits. This does represent a threat, but there are other bigger threats, including lumber companies, and organized crime. The protest over logging industry activity in indigenous regions occurs at a time in Guatemala of increased concern over deforestation, and comes after the historic march for water in April 2016. Community representatives, nongovernmental organizations, and activists see a connection between forests and water. The Guatemalan government, too, maintains a campaign of reforestation, but this has not stopped companies from cutting down forests for the valuable woods, or the razing of forests by narco-traffickers in the northern department of Petén to build landing strips. 
The Guatemalan Ministry of the Economy actively promotes the investment of companies interested in exploiting the country’s nearly 2 million acres of forests. Logging companies and lumber traders have taken an interest in the vast forests of the highlands of Guatemala, where they can find rare hard and soft woods, such as teak, mahogany, oak and the more common pine. These resources can fetch hefty prices at market. 
The exportation of lumber and products produced from wood from Guatemala has increased significantly. From 2013 to 2014, lumber exports increased 8 percent, from $6.7 million dollars to $8.6 million. This continues the long trend of the increase in the exportation of lumber and wood products, such as furniture. 
But this increase in export of lumber brings the companies into conflict with indigenous communities. According to research by Guatemalan environmentalist and researcher, Juan Skinner, the indigenous regions of the country on average contain more forest cover than the non-indigenous regions of the country. 
A 2005 report that Skinner authored highlights that municipalities that are less than 25 percent indigenous have forest cover of around 12 percent. Whereas regions where the population is more than 75 percent indigenous have forest cover of around 35 percent. Guatemala’s Mayan communities are not alone in their concern with the destruction of forests. The southern Xinca community of Quesada, Jutiapa has long taken steps to protect the forests that make up their communal territory. The Xinca people are one of the many ethnicities that make up Guatemala. The rural community in the southern department of Jutiapa has held their forest as communal lands since the 1850s, with subsequent generations continuing to protect the mountain and the forests. Today the forests represent 80 percent of the more than 13,500 acres of land, with the remainder utilized for crops, such as coffee and maize. “Our ancestors left us the land and a group to protect our mountain,” said Jak Mardogueo Ogorio, a representative of the communities’ Directive Council. “All this was passed down through the generations, and we continue this today. In order to cut a tree down, you first must receive permission from the council.” The community leaders have also barred any large-scale logging operations. “We don’t permit companies to operate in our forests,” Ogorio said. “In past epochs companies tried to negotiate for access to the forests, but they always wanted more. How many years for a new tree to grow? Up on the mountain there are trees that you cannot encircle with three people. This is what we are protecting.” 
Ogorio and the other 13 members of the community council work directly with the residents to build awareness of the importance of the forests through regular meetings, trainings and a campaign to build alternative cooking stoves that utilize less firewood. In August and September 2016, the council implemented the insulation of 400 cooking stoves in conjuncture with Utz Che, a Guatemalan non-governmental organization. 
“This project allows us to slow deforestation because the stoves use less firewood, and there is no need for more and more wood,” Ogorio said. “These stoves allow us to protect our forests.” 
Community leaders of Quesada maintain vigilance over the threat of forest fires on communal lands for which they receive funding from INAB. This has generated work opportunity in a region where there are not many options. 
The community of La Bendición in the southern department of Esquitla is one of the few regions on Guatemala’s southern coast not dominated by sugar and African oil palm plantations. Residents of the small community were displaced by the country’s 36-year-long internal armed conflict. At the end of the war they negotiated the purchase of a 5,500-acre coffee farm through the Land Fund in 2000 for about $1 million, far more than the value of the land. 
When the families already burdened by debt arrived in 2001, they were shocked to learn that the land was not in the state that the Land Fund had promised. There were no rivers, as they were promised there would be, and the high winds meant that their crops were damaged, and there was no paved road. But there was a forest that contained an aquifer. Disappointed residents quickly left the community, leaving just 53 families of the original 170. 
Residents continued to be burdened by debt, despite the rich forests. In 2002, the Land Fund proposed a solution: sell the forest. “The same Land Fund that assisted us in purchasing our land was pressuring us to sell the forests in order to resolve the debt,” said Veronica Hernandez, a 47-year-old community leader. “But we refused because if we would have sold our forests, we would have been left without water, or with contaminated water.” Since refusing to sell the land to logging interest, the community has organized to maintain the forests, and protect them from illegal logging and from forest fires. The residents also hold regular community-wide meetings to work to train everyone on the importance of the forests, and to guarantee that no one goes up into the mountain to cut down the precious trees. 
Residents have also worked to develop projects like those being implemented in Quesada in order to decrease their impact on the forests. These stoves and solar projects are received across the community to great success. The residents’ resolve to protect their forest was further strengthened following the April 2016 water march, when thousands of campesinos marched to demand the protection of Guatemala’s water sources. 
“The April march was important for us and other communities along Guatemala’s coast,” Hernandez said. “It has strengthened our drive to protect the forests and the mangroves along the coast.” 
Despite the fact that the community was able to hold off the lumber interests following the purchase of the land, Hernandez and the other residents maintain vigilance to guarantee that no company comes to exploit their land and forests. “These companies always come into our communities to rob from us,” Hernandez said. “They then leave us with all the costs.” 
Back in Nebaj, the Indigenous Authority is working to replicate the awareness in La Benedición and Quesada over the importance of forests. 
“We are trying to inform community members of the impacts of deforestation,” Terraza said. This sharing of information is strengthened through the local Ixil University, which works to build awareness, and bring higher education to the region. 
“But we have to do more,” Terraza added. “We must struggle to guarantee that people know what the impacts are.” 
The Indigenous Authorities of Nebaj stated that they are considering other actions, including the continuation of pressure on the state bodies, including INAB, the continuation of protests, and the direct action of blocking trucks transporting lumber. 
“[INAB] is an institution of the state,” Terraza said. “If we have all these trees, then it is because we have protected the forests for some time; our ancestors also protected these forests. It should not be so easy for them to arrive and issue licenses to companies to exploit the forests.”

18681,D’Amato Removed From Plane After Urging Walkout Over Delays - The New York Times,"Alfonse M. D’Amato, a former United States senator, has given many speeches in his day, trying to rouse his peers into action. Not all have worked. But of all those failed exhortations, none  —   at least, none known so far  —   have occurred on a JetBlue Airways flight, ending with Mr. D’Amato’s removal from the plane. Mr. D’Amato, 79, who represented New York as a Republican from 1981 to 1999, was removed from a JetBlue flight in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. after causing a conflict, according to the airline. The episode, captured in part on cellphone videos taken by passengers, was on a New   airplane at Fort   International Airport on Monday, days after a gunman killed five people there. The JetBlue flight, which had been scheduled to depart around 1:40 p. m. Monday, did not take off until about 8 p. m. after delays. During the delay, Mr. D’Amato stood in the aisle and urged other passengers to walk out with him, according to video of the episode. “We can still speak in this country,” Mr. D’Amato said in the video. “I am making an appeal to all you people. Stand up for what’s right and walk out with me. ” At least one unidentified passenger stood to join him. “I’m going,” he said. It is not exactly clear what prompted Mr. D’Amato’s response. The crew was trying to move passengers to address a weight imbalance, an airline spokesman said. A passenger, Jeffrey A. Wurst, said that the plane’s captain explained that about 10 people needed to move to the back of the plane from the front to balance how the cargo had been loaded. “I saw Al D’Amato go to the back, to one of the last rows,” Mr. Wurst said. “People spotted him and asked to take pictures. The captain then asked for more people to move. D’Amato gets up and starts” shouting, he said. Eventually, the police were called. An officer from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office can be seen walking toward Mr. D’Amato in the video. Mr. D’Amato seems to refer to the issue with the seats, speaking during an announcement that the plane would take off once everyone was seated. “I’m getting thrown out because I stood up and said to the captain, ‘Why don’t you do what you’re supposed to do? ’” Mr. D’Amato says in the video. “If you’re supposed to move two or three people, move them. And so he got annoyed at that, and I’m getting thrown out. ” As he walks by the open cockpit door, Mr. D’Amato can be seen telling the captain that he is a “poor excuse” for a leader. He turns to a flight attendant and appears to curse. JetBlue said that decisions to remove passengers from flights were not made lightly. “If a customer is causing a conflict on the aircraft, it is standard procedure to ask the customer to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs a risk of escalation in flight,” the company said in a statement. Gary Lewi, a spokesman for Mr. D’Amato, said that the former senator was in Florida to visit an ailing friend. Mr. Lewi cited Mr. D’Amato’s frustration over the long delay and “sleep deprivation” as factors in the incident. “Anyone who knows Senator D’Amato knows he speaks his mind,” Mr. Lewi said in a statement. “JetBlue has apologized to the senator for overreacting, and the senator apologized for speaking his mind at a time when he clearly had left his patience at the gate. ” The sheriff’s office said it had referred the matter to JetBlue. The airline said no further action would be taken. The intensity of emotions raised by travel and the ubiquity of social media have combined to produce a perpetual stream of caustic episodes that spin into viral news after being captured on cellphone cameras. This year, tempers flared in the wake of an emotional presidential election. A video of a supporter of the   Donald J. Trump, taunting other passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa. spread widely in November. The airline eventually barred the passenger for life. Weeks later, a man was kicked off a JetBlue flight about to depart from Kennedy International Airport after causing a disturbance upon learning Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were on the flight. His husband posted about it on Twitter. Mr. Wurst said that what concerned him most about the D’Amato episode was the lack of civility. “What I find disappointing in the situation is that we were one terminal away from where a tragedy erupted on Friday,” he said.",0
18682,Voters’ View of a Donald Trump Presidency: Big Risks and Rewards - The New York Times,"Most voters consider Donald J. Trump a risky choice for president, saying he lacks the right temperament and values, but he is seen as more transformative and better at handling the economy than Hillary Clinton, according to the latest New York   News poll. Mrs. Clinton, despite being as disliked as Mr. Trump, is seen as a safer option. Majorities of voters say she has the temperament for the job and would better handle foreign policy. Only 36 percent of them, however, view her as an agent of change. That perception deeply worries some Clinton campaign advisers, who want the race to hinge on Mr. Trump’s character rather than voters’ desire to upend the status quo. With less than eight weeks until Election Day, the two candidates are locked in a close contest in which the challenge from   candidates may make a difference. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, compared with 44 percent for Mr. Trump, the Republican that result includes voters who said they were leaning toward a candidate. Looking more broadly at all registered voters, Mrs. Clinton holds a wider edge, 46 to 41 percent, driven by her support among women, minorities and college graduates. Getting registered but unlikely voters to the polls in November is a large challenge for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump has an advantage among men, whites and less educated voters. In a   race, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are tied at 42 percent each. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, has the support of 8 percent of likely voters, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, takes 4 percent. Mr. Johnson is hoping to qualify for the coming presidential debates, but he is short of the requirement of reaching 15 percent support in an average of major polls. Among likely voters younger than 30, Mrs. Clinton’s support drops 10 points in a   race. Their support for Mr. Trump falls seven points, but he is not relying on young voters as much. The race has clearly grown tighter in recent weeks. National polling averages have narrowed markedly from early August to today. Polls in a number of key swing states, including Ohio and Florida, have narrowed in the past week as well. Projections of Mrs. Clinton’s Electoral College advantage have also shown a tightening based on recent polls. Voters expressed discontent with both candidates. Among those who say they intend to vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, slightly more than half express strong support. The rest say that they harbor reservations about their candidate or that they are voting simply to thwart the other nominee. Despite the voters’ misgivings, the   nominees are consolidating support among their party faithful. Mrs. Clinton commands support of 87 percent of Democrats, while Mr. Trump is supported by 85 percent of Republicans. The poll results offer more cause for concern than confidence for Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton as they prepare for their first debate, on Sept. 26, and as early voting begins in some states next weekend. Their favorability ratings remain stubbornly low, with only about   of voters seeing each of them positively, despite the candidates’ attempts to use their conventions, commercials and public appearances to persuade voters to see them in a new light. A majority of voters say Mr. Trump does not care about the needs or problems of Hispanics most voters see Mrs. Clinton as caring about Hispanics, and a majority of voters agree with her view that most illegal immigrants in the country should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted with 1, 433 registered voters from Sept. 9 to 13 on cellphones and landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all voters. Mr. Trump’s temperament stands out as potentially his most damaging vulnerability, as his penchant for insults and provocations often undercuts his political message. Trump advisers see the televised debates as Mr. Trump’s greatest opportunity to reassure people about his personality, but he starts off in a weak position, with 64 percent of voters saying he does not have the right temperament to be president.   percent of voters see Mr. Trump as a risky choice for president, compared with 51 percent who hold that view about Mrs. Clinton  —   a surprising number in itself given that she has been a president’s spouse, a senator and a secretary of state. For Trump advisers, the image of Mr. Trump as a gamble comes with an upside. They concede that he is most likely to lose the election if a majority of voters view him as dangerous or reckless. But if he can persuade people to see him simply as unpredictable  —   even cagey in a strategic sense  —   as well as committed to disrupting the federal government, voters could regard him as worth taking a chance on for four years while looking to his advisers and Congress as a check on his power. Several Trump supporters said in   interviews that they believed he was worth the risk, given the economic and security challenges facing the nation.   percent of voters think Mr. Trump could bring real change to Washington, a   edge over Mrs. Clinton another 48 percent think he could not bring change. “The risky part with Trump is the fact of his rhetoric, how he says things,” said Patrick Kellegher, 52, a political independent and a retired deputy sheriff from Anaconda, Mont. “But I think he is outside the known government circles. ” He added, “I think Trump will bring about real change because he’s looking at it through a different scope. ” The candidates also face continued doubts about their honesty. Of the two, Mrs. Clinton has tried more visibly to address misgivings about her trustworthiness, by releasing decades of tax returns and more details about her health than Mr. Trump has. Yet one stain on her reputation is proving indelible: About seven in 10 voters say she did something wrong when she used a private email server as secretary of state, including 45 percent who say she did something illegal. Concerns about her judgment linger even among some of her supporters, who say she could have been more forthcoming about her email practices before they grew into a political controversy and the focus of a scathing F. B. I. report. “I don’t think she’s been dishonest or untrustworthy in a way that disqualifies her to be president, but she shouldn’t have worried so much about political ramifications and come clean up front,” said Lindsay Dofelmier, 36, a lawyer in Houston who is supporting Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump has yet to release any of his tax returns, a break with political tradition that goes back decades, and has been far less specific than Mrs. Clinton on many personal and political questions, including his policy proposals. Asked if it was necessary for Mr. Trump to release his tax returns, 59 percent of voters said it was.   percent of voters said they would like the candidates to release more medical records.",0
18683,Too Many Favorite Shows? Take Them In at High Speed - The New York Times,"So much media, so little time. Consumers face a dizzying array of entertainment choices that include streaming video such as Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Netflix cable channels and apps from outlets like HBO and Showtime YouTube and as many as 28, 000 podcasts. With them all offering uncountable hours of addictive programming, how is a listener or viewer supposed to keep up? For some, the answer is speed watching or speed listening  —   taking in the content at accelerated speeds, sometimes two times as fast as normal. While speed viewing does save time  —   devotees say it can save hours over the season of a series  —   others raise concerns that it undermines the rhythm of a production and can dilute some creative elements. Jan Rezab said in an article in Forbes last year that his viewing eventually progressed from 1. 2 times to two times as fast. “As you continue to speed watch, higher speeds get easier and easier to comprehend,” he wrote. “I’ve been speed watching for the last 2 years, and I now feel comfortable watching at 2x the normal viewing speed. ” He watches some even faster. Be prepared to jump through a few hoops if you want to speed up your content, though. While some players make it easy to change your playback speed, others make it more difficult. On YouTube, it lives under settings. On Apple’s native podcast app, it’s right next to the play button, and other podcast players have a similar function. Audible, the major audiobook app, offers the option as well. Netflix, Hulu and HBO, however, don’t offer higher speeds on their players, but there are workarounds available. It’s possible to speed up online video through a Google Chrome extension, and an   media player called VLC will play many formats of digital media. Some   boxes like TiVo allow   playback of recorded programs. It’s not clear how widely the practice has been adopted. In an informal poll on Twitter, David Chen, a host and producer of the movie and television podcast “Slashfilmcast,” asked, “Do you ever listen to podcasts or watch   at a faster speed than intended?” Of 1, 505 responses, 79 percent chose the response “No, it’s an abomination,” while 16 percent said they did so for podcasts, and a total of 5 percent said they did so for films, television and podcasts. On a recent episode of the podcast, Mr. Chen and his   Jeff Cannata and Devindra Hardawar, took up the question of speed viewing. A listener asked, “In this increasingly     world, I wonder, how much of a crime against culture I am committing by speeding through these shows?” The podcast hosts seemed aghast. “How dare you,” Mr. Cannata, said, adding that the practice “cheapens your entertainment. ” Mr. Hardawar said speed viewing did not allow time to soak in what was happening. “I feel like you are not even actually watching it,” he said. “You’re consuming it. You’re not actually like absorbing it or letting it work on you in a creative way. So yeah, this is bad. This is bad. ” Speed viewing waters down the emotional impacts of a movie, Peter Markham, senior    at the American Film Institute Conservatory in Los Angeles, said in an interview last week. “If you were watching a play by Pinter, for example, the pause could carry the greatest meaning,” he said. “I can’t imagine watching a movie at twice the speed. ” Renan L. Borelli, 31, who is director of audience growth and engagement at MTV News and who has a   commute from Park Slope in Brooklyn to the West Village in Manhattan, is a big fan of podcasts. He listens to as many as three or four a day and subscribes to about 30. Mr. Borelli estimated he could save about five to 10 minutes per podcast. “Even if it’s a couple of minutes, it’s a help,” he said in an interview, noting that he has “many gigabytes” of podcasts stored on his phone. Nicholas Quah, who writes Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts, said in an email that it was unclear how widespread speed listening was, but that anecdotally, it appeared to be “an established behavior” among   listeners. He said he saw no harm in it. He wrote, “Speed listening might be more offensive to folks who make highly produced, preciously crafted and   podcasts (vs. a loose conversational one, like the Slate gabfests) but what we’re actually confronting here is that tension in the relationship between artist and consumer: Which is more important, the artist intent or the consumer’s preference?” Mr. Chen, of “Slashfilmcast,” said in an email that speed listening was a consumer’s way of saying: “I don’t care how you wanted me to experience this work you’ve created. I just care about the information exchanged. ” Lost are elements of dramatic or comedic timing and intentional silences, he said. “It becomes a fundamentally different experience that disregards what the creator intended” at an accelerated speed, he wrote. He said the practice was like trying to eat twice as many meals as normal to avoid missing any culinary treats. “Sure, you might actually be consuming more, but you’re probably having a worse, more grotesque experience,” he wrote. “And you’re certainly not doing it in a way that the chef intended. ”",0
18684,Hurricane Plunges a North Carolina Town’s Future Into Doubt - The New York Times,"FAIR BLUFF, N. C.  —   Under a clear twilight sky, well after Hurricane Matthew broke up and moved offshore, this tiny town was drowning. Homes were submerged and deserted after officials evacuated about 400 people by boat and by truck, and Main Street was a canal of   water. Frank Horne, 79, drove a large tractor slowly through the water inundating the lovingly maintained main drag. Most of the awnings and street lamps were eerily intact, even as merchandise and storm debris floated through businesses like the Ellis Meares  Son hardware store and community pillars like the town hall. At the Ford dealership, every vehicle was partly underwater. “My granddaughter has a beauty shop right up on the right,” Mr. Horne said grimly on Monday, pointing toward Carolina Class Salon. “If that hardware store goes, the town’s gone. That’s the only thing holding us. ” Hurricane Matthew’s disastrous turn over North Carolina lashed some areas with more than a foot of rain and left behind swelling rivers and streets like rivers throughout much of the region south and east of Raleigh. By Tuesday, emergency crews in trucks, boats and helicopters had rescued more than 2, 000 people from houses, porches and rooftops. Here in Fair Bluff, they included James Thomas, 57, who cannot walk because of a spinal cord injury, but was hoisted into a boat by firefighters on Sunday. The upheaval had a special sting here in a town that has tried, with no shortage of grit and heart, to remake itself in the face of economic shifts that have sucked the life out of so many other small towns. Now, Fair Bluff’s future looks even more challenging. The extent of the damage here and in places like Lumberton, Fayetteville, Goldsboro and Pinetops sank in like a recurring bad dream on Tuesday after a storm that killed 17 people in the state and left commerce and daily life in some areas grinding to a halt. “Certain parts of the state, we’re going through recovery at this point in time,” Gov. Pat McCrory said on Tuesday morning. “Certain parts of the state, we’re still going through ongoing floods. And now, we have other parts of the state that are about to deal with some very serious circumstances, especially along two of our major rivers. ” Mr. McCrory said that a state trooper had shot and killed a man on Monday after a “confrontation”  —   the authorities later said he had become “hostile” and displayed a handgun  —   in Lumberton, a site of major flooding north of here. He added that state officials were especially worried about residents farther northeast, in and near Goldsboro, Greenville and Rocky Mount. With flooding expected in the state throughout the week, he urged drivers to use caution. “There are going to be conditions during the next 72 hours which will be extremely dangerous,” Mr. McCrory said. As residents evacuated and the authorities imposed curfews, officials issued advisories to boil tap water for drinking and school districts canceled days of classes. The airport in Greenville, a city of about 91, 000, will be closed until Oct. 20. “A lot of communities are dealing with terrible flooding,” President Obama said on Tuesday night in Greensboro, where he addressed a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton. “Lives have been lost, and so the entire country has been thinking about North Carolina. ” The flooding this month has evoked memories of Hurricane Floyd, which devastated parts of the state 17 years ago. “The scars of the memories of 1999 are still there, and they’re fresh,” said Tony Sears, the city manager in Kinston, where the Neuse River is expected to approach a record height by Saturday. “And people are thinking back to how difficult of a time that was, and they’re anticipating that this time. ” In Fair Bluff, with a population of about 900, officials said the water rose further on Tuesday, to levels no one here had seen. The town has a poverty rate of 33 percent, and its population has decreased over time, with older residents dying off and the young moving away. Some in the area wondered if all of the flooded businesses, most operated by longtime residents, would reopen. “Because it’s so small, income levels are so low here, it’s going to be hard for them to justify putting the money back in to reopen their businesses,” said Brenden Jones, a candidate for state representative from nearby Tabor City and an owner of a funeral home in Fair Bluff that was spared from flood damage. Fair Bluff was incorporated in 1873, with the Lumber River  —   currently inundating the town  —   and a railroad as its lifeblood, supporting logging and trade. By the 1970s, it was small but thriving, sustained by tobacco farms and warehouses, said Ken Elliot, 48, who like many people here grew up in a tobacco farming family. When those tobacco farms began to go under, people found new work. Mr. Elliot became a firefighter and paramedic, and he spent last weekend rescuing his friends and neighbors from the encroaching floodwaters. Others found work in a new plant that makes vinyl building materials. The town, which has a museum, built a visitors’ center and a new river walk, earnestly seeking tourists. And locals fought tooth and nail to sustain a vital Main Street as the town’s heart despite pressure from stores like Walmart and Family Dollar. “That’s what keeps this area above water,” Mr. Elliot said, adding that the town would pull together once again. Would everything reopen? “I’m not going to lie,” Mr. Elliot said. “That’s always a worry. ” Others were confident the town would prevail. Kathy Ashley, 55, the vice president of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Horne’s daughter, said that Fair Bluff was a   trading post and had shown a penchant for reinvention ever since. “We got history,” Ms. Ashley said. “When the water goes away, we’re going to sweep it out and we’re going to make our town better. ” Critical to the floods’ devastation was how surprising they were: Many people did not expect Hurricane Matthew to drop nearly as much rain as it did, and they prepared only for a small storm. “This is a river town,” said Rodney Singletary, 47, a behavior specialist at the county school who took a boat back to his house on Monday to pick up medication for a relative. “We’re used to the river. We just don’t think that it’s going to look like that. ” His family had evacuated on foot over the weekend, walking along the railroad tracks as water rose on both sides. “We had to get out of here,” he said. “I have to say, I was a little frightened. ” At a shelter at West Columbus High School in a neighboring town, Cerro Gordo, Fair Bluff residents described harrowing rescues and domestic crises. Twyla Denise King, 44, worried about the five dogs she had left at home in the evacuation. And Simon Stephens, 33, who called for a rescue of himself, his wife and his two children when the waters rose because he cannot swim, wondered what had become of his house and two cars. “Words cannot describe it,” said Mr. Stephens, a fabricator. “House paid for, cars, one car paid for, only $800 left on the truck. ” So when it was time for a shelterwide meeting, Tom Guilliams of the Salvation Army opened with a prayer. “We thank you for getting us out of the waters and onto the land,” he said. “Be with us through the storm. ”",0
18685,"Fake News in U.S. Election? Elsewhere, That’s Nothing New - The New York Times","HONG KONG  —   Facebook rumors force a   politician to publish proof of his heritage. Fake images show a prominent female leader in a hangman’s noose. A politician’s aide decries violent crime with a Facebook photo of a girl’s corpse  —   an image that turns out to come from another country. Another day on social media for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump? Think again. Those incidents took place in Indonesia and the Philippines, where social media’s outsize place in politics is widely acknowledged, even as that role is coming under sharper criticism in the United States. Well before last week’s American election threw Facebook’s status as a   news source into the spotlight, leaders, advocacy groups and minorities worldwide have contended with an onslaught of online misinformation and abuse that has had   political repercussions. And for years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news. Now Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late. “They should have done this way earlier,” said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in the Philippines, one of Facebook’s   markets. “We already saw the warning signs of this years ago. ” On Thursday, President Obama, speaking in Berlin and standing alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel, criticized Facebook and other social media for disseminating fake news. He became so impassioned that at one point he lost track of the question he was answering. “If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect,” Mr. Obama said. The impact of Facebook and other social media platforms on international elections is difficult to quantify. But Facebook’s global reach  —   roughly a quarter of the world’s population now has an account  —   is difficult to deny, political experts and academics say. Some governments are pushing back, sometimes with undemocratic consequences. Ms. Merkel has said she is considering plans to force social networks to make public how they rank news online. Some African countries have banned the use of Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter before elections. Indonesia’s government has closed sites that it says promote fake news, though experts say some portals were also targeted for political reasons. Facebook said on Thursday that the social network was a place for people to stay informed and that what people saw in their news feed was overwhelmingly authentic. The Silicon Valley company previously denied that it failed to deal with misinformation and said it continues to monitor the social network so that it meets existing standards. “I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way  —   I think is a pretty crazy idea,” Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, told a tech conference days after the American presidential election. “Voters make decisions based on their lived experience. ” Facebook’s power is often stronger overseas than it is in the United States. In many developing countries with populations new to both democracy and social media, experts said, fake stories can be more widely believed. And in some of these countries, Facebook even offers free smartphone data connections to basic public online services, some news sites and Facebook itself  —   but limits access to broader sources that could help debunk fake news. One such place is the Philippines, where a spokesman for its populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared on Facebook an image of a corpse of a young girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer. Fact checkers later revealed that the photo had come from Brazil. Despite the debunking, proponents of Mr. Duterte’s bloody crackdown on reported drug dealers and addicts still cite the image in his defense, according to political analysts. Tens of thousands of Philippine Facebook users also recently shared a story claiming that NASA had voted Mr. Duterte “the best president in the solar system. ” While many commenters on the Facebook post took it as a joke, some appeared to take it seriously. And an image of Leila de Lima, a local lawmaker and a critic of Mr. Duterte, depicted her facing a hangman’s noose. “Facebook hasn’t led to empowerment of the average citizen, but empowerment of professional propagandists, fringe elements and conspiracy theorists,” said Mr. Heydarian, the Philippines political analyst. “Voices that were lurking in the shadows are now at the center of the public discourse. ” In Indonesia, where Facebook is so popular that some people confuse it with the broader internet, the service has considerable sway. When Joko Widodo, Indonesia’s president, was running for office in 2014, he was accused through social media of being a Chinese Christian and a communist  —   severe criticism in the deeply Islamic country. The Indonesian politician released his marriage certificate to prove he wasn’t Chinese and made a pilgrimage to Mecca just before voting. “The fake news had a very big impact in our campaign,” said Tubagus Ramadhan, who helped Mr. Widodo run his social media campaign during the election. The online misinformation has not been limited to elections. In Colombia, Facebook users widely shared a crudely altered photo of a pop singer, Juanes, wearing a   suggesting he opposed a peace deal with the country’s largest rebel group. On Twitter, Juanes denied it. Colombia’s voters narrowly rejected the deal in a referendum last month. While Facebook has won plaudits for allowing people in disaster zones to tell friends and families they are safe, it has also been a conduit for dangerous rumors in those situations. At the height of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, a false message widely distributed in Sierra Leone on Facebook and WhatsApp, which is owned by the social network, said bathing in hot water with salt would cure and prevent the spread of the virus. Even in   democracies like Germany, Spain and Italy, false news reports and hate speech on social media have whipped up   populist movements, which have often targeted the recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees, to garner wider electoral support. Now, many European politicians are questioning what role social media has had in deciding what voters can and cannot see. They also have forced social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google to sign up for voluntary  —   so far  —   standards to police hate speech online. In Germany, Ms. Merkel’s push to require American social network companies to publish how they rank news is intended to give voters greater control over what they read online. “Algorithms must be more transparent,” Ms. Merkel has said, “so that interested citizens are also aware of what actually happens with their own media behavior and that of others. ” Other politicians, often in more recently established democracies, are going a step further. In some African countries, including Chad and Uganda, officials cite uncorroborated security threats and fears that false results could be shared online as reasons for shutting down social media ahead of elections. Christian Echle, director of the   Africa media program at    a German political foundation, said such actions were   and that social media had played a role in helping voters  —   many located far from urban centers  —   to gain access to   information and interact with political candidates. But, he added, a growing amount of news shared through social media was either false or biased, making it difficult for people in these often fledgling democracies to know which news outlets to trust. “There’s a big, big threat  —   that social media will deepen existing gaps in these societies,” said Mr. Echle, who is based in Johannesburg. “People are still learning how to use social media, so many can easily fall for hoaxes. ”",0

18687,What Is Racism?,"License DMCA Racism is generally thought of as discriminating against any group of people because of certain distinctive physical features they have in common. The barren shallowness of this definition is itself actually characteristic of the 'consciousness' of people who engage in racist attitude and orientation. To find the real roots of racism we have to go down to the level of culture formation itself. It is here that what we call racism becomes inevitable. Racism does not exist merely as a flaw in cultural formation. It is an innate feature of culture formation because of what culture has always historically shown itself to be. All culture formation begins in the response of awareness to reality as experienced through the filter of this particular awareness. Everything we know about human pre-history and history tells us that fear plays a radical role in culture formation. The very fact that culture formation is a group response rather than being characterizes by any significant degree of individuality supports this thesis. The group forms as a means of protection against real possibilities of danger. Reality is perceived as dangerous, or at least as presenting possibilities of danger. And ultimately reality means the apparently inescapable mystery of mortality, which is anything but welcome and non-threatening. - Advertisement - The group forms as a means of protection and as the group develops, its group identity begins to form the rudiments of culture. This culture identity has fear as part of its elementary constitution. And the primary means of countering the threats this fear perceives is to find and develop features of reality that affirm the group identity. This involves both finding actual features in and projecting desired features onto reality. And the primary projection always involves seeing reality as having a face that affirms and reflects the face of the group itself. And this absolutely includes affirmation of the physical characteristics of the group. These physical characteristics become inseparable from the entire cultural panoply. This does not mean that culture is simply fantasy. But the fact that there are real elements in any culture only fortifies the fantasy elements and makes them indistinguishable from the real. The iconic imagery of all cultures shows the superhuman higher powers as having features that precisely reflect the features of the human group that develops this imagery. This is not merely coincidental or accidental. It shows that the human group has a fear-based emotional need to believe its particular features, which are subject to mortality, are, in spite of this fact, the features of truth . Truth becomes the protective shield of the distinctively featured group. And it must be kept in mind that this Truth is Absolute Truth (God) and therefore gives an Absolute value to the features of the group. So any human feature or behavior that varies from this group-truth is seen as at least potentially threatening and dangerous and can easily be seen as evil . But wherever it falls in the spectrum of evaluation, it is always alien and suspect because it challenges the group-truth-identity with existential fear at its foundation. The fact that aspects of culture such as art and religion can bring a joy to the people of a particular culture does not nullify anything I have said. And it also does not mean that these aspects are of no real value. But it does reveal the fact that even these aspects are of limited reality-value. And this limit is exposed by the existence of other humans who have developed a clearly different culture. The problem of racism is precisely the problem of how humans develop the Reality-Truth picture that sustains them as a group. Paranoid fear of a person or group with different physical and psychological-orientation features is not just arrogance. It involves an existential fear of identity dissolution and it reflects the failure to adequately deal with this fear in human history. Some degree of racism exists wherever culture exists. The idea that racism is a feature of exclusively any one group of people is ludicrous and very dangerous. It's all about human fear-constriction and the human desire for power over what is frightening in reality rather than expanding further into reality and keeping an open-ended identity. It is the result of partial human identity development pretending to be absolute and finished. To end racism means to end desperate attachment to dangerously undeveloped identity. It means consciousness expansion to a depth that reveals all culture as relative in truth-value and all humans as transitional forms in evolutionary movement. We are all racist because we are all afraid of reality and its evolutionary movement. The solution to this is not the development of black culture, or white culture, or yellow culture... The solution is the development of a fearless open-ended human culture and such a culture does not yet exist anywhere on the earth. Until it does humanity is in danger of self-destruction. In the present context of American society there is no ready solution to racial discrimination because there are no social structures that feed the consciousness expansion required. This oligarchic society is the death-cold pyramid of human fear of reality that feeds the forces of exploitation, abuse, and neglect. It induces pathological behavior from the top of the pyramid to the bottom. The solution to the rabid discrimination against Native Americans and African Americans at the bottom of the pyramid is not the popularizing of Native-American or African-American culture that just ends up as pulp for the amoral capitalist machine in the form of decadent and feckless entertainment. The solution is the creation of a human culture that is genuinely open to everyone because it encompasses all human experience and response. There is no other solution. However politically incorrect it might be, there is no other solution. - Advertisement -",0
18688,The Future of Not Working - The New York Times,"The village is poor, even by the standards of rural Kenya. To get there, you follow a power line along a series of unmarked roads. Eventually, that power line connects to the school at the center of town, the sole building with electricity. Homesteads fan out into the hilly bramble, connected by rugged paths. There is just one working water tap, requiring many local women to gather water from a pit in jerrycans. There is no plumbing, and some families still practice open defecation, lacking the resources to dig a latrine. There aren’t even oxen strong enough to pull a plow, meaning that most farming is still done by hand. The village is poor enough that it is considered rude to eat in public, which is seen as boasting that you have food. In October, I visited Kennedy Aswan Abagi, the village chief, at his small   home, decorated with posters celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden and the lives of African heroes, including JaKogelo, or “the man from Kogelo,” as locals refer to former President Barack Obama. Kogelo, where Obama’s father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his town’s fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. “I asked, ‘Why this village? ’’u2009” Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him. The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself. But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the village’s 220 people crowded into a    tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless. Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. “People of the village,” he said, “are you happy?” “We are!” they cried in unison. Then he laid out the particulars. “Every registered person will receive 2, 280 shillings”  —   about $22  —   “each and every month. You hear me?” The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. “Every person we register here will receive the money, I said  —   2, 280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?” “Twelve years!” Just like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers’ safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6, 000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed,      income. An additional 80 villages, with 11, 500 residents all together, will receive a   basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly  —   with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley  —   is starting the world’s first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly,   places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and   Africa. GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. “We have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year,” Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the world’s neediest immediately and practically without cost. What happens in this village has the potential to transform   institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectly’s backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too. The basic or guaranteed income is a curious piece of intellectual flotsam that has washed ashore several times in the past   often during periods of great economic upheaval. In “Utopia,” published in 1516, Thomas More suggests it as a way to help feudal farmers hurt by the conversion of common land for public use into private land for commercial use. In “Agrarian Justice,” published in 1797, Thomas Paine supports it for similar reasons, as compensation for the “loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property. ” It reappears in the writings of French radicals, of Bertrand Russell, of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and   as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an   revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks  —   financial analytics, marketing, legal work  —   could be automated out of existence. In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a   version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking   labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya? A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time  —   when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child. And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million,   initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altman’s   incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1, 000 families in California and another     state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its   effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix. In December, Altman, the    president of Y Combinator, spoke at an   event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution? “There have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions  —   the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example  —   that have really changed the world in a big way,” Altman said. “I think we’re in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one. ” GiveDirectly may be a charity, but it speaks in the argot of Silicon Valley. It is a platform, connecting donors and recipients, that prides itself on low overhead and superior analytics. It disdains what it sees as the bloated, expensive,     incumbents that dominate the nonprofit space. And it even has a privileged bootstrapping creation story, beginning with its   founders batting the idea around in Harvard Square academic buildings and scraping together money from friends. The idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the   gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If you’re hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls won’t be worth much to you. “Once you’ve been there, it’s hard to imagine doing anything but cash,” Faye told me. “It’s so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like it’s a trick question. ” But at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But   mobile phones with     minutes began flooding into   African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called   for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today. Faye and Niehaus  —   along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students  —   thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. “Because it was a   and we started in grad school,” Faye said, “we were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing. ” The following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5, 000, came out of the foursome’s own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating.   rates dropped, and mental health improved. In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its   young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave   donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friend’s brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google. org, the tech giant’s giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2. 4 million. At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1, 000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofit’s field officers would locate   villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out. On a steaming October morning, I went with two GiveDirectly executives, Joanna Macrae and Ian Bassin, to visit one of the villages that had received GiveDirectly’s   payments. We took off at dawn from Kisumu, a bustling industrial city on the banks of Lake Victoria, and followed a   highway to Bondo, a small trading city filled with cattle, bicycles and roadside food stands. From there, we turned inland from the lake and drove into a lush agricultural region. The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the   pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. “Could you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs?” Bassin said as he admired a   cow tied up by the lakeside. “It would just be impossible. ” Perhaps, but delivering money by   has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her   hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.) By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these   tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families’ houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down. Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma  —   a Burning Spear devotee wearing a   hat and bell bottoms when we visited  —   had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center he bought two cows, one of which had given birth and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2, 500 shillings  —   roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. “I used to go out drinking with 1, 000 shillings, and I’d wake up in the bar with 100 shillings,” he said. “Now I go out drinking with 1, 000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900. ” “I didn’t imagine I would be living in an   house,” he said, referring to his roof. “I didn’t imagine I’d be wearing nice shoes. I didn’t imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didn’t imagine I would be a man who owns cattle. ” Many popular forms of aid have been shown to work abysmally. PlayPumps  —       contraptions that let children pump water from underground wells as they play  —   did little to improve access to clean water.    programs have saddled families with animals inappropriate to their environment. Skills training and microfinance, one 2015 World Bank study found, “have shown little impact on poverty or stability, especially relative to program cost. ” All across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas  : People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families. In the   village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. “I do not want to talk about it,” she said. What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambo’s hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. “The question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash?” Faye said. “There usually is not a way to answer that question. ” A vast majority of aid  —   94 percent  —   is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. “There’s the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole ‘Give a man a fish’ thing,” said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. “It’s so powerful. It’s really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. You’ll start drinking. You’ll start lying around at home because you’re getting paid. ” Cash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. “The visual of putting a pill in a kid’s mouth is so much more attractive to people,” Glassman said. Institutional inertia is another factor. “There are a lot of good people working in the system,” Niehaus said. “And there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down  —   they aren’t structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients. ” Moreover, cash might force aid workers and nongovernmental organizations to confront the fact that they could be doing better by doing things differently  —   often by doing less. “It’s easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer,” said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. “The harder argument is: You should shut down your U. S. A. I. D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. That’s the radical critique. ” Faye put it more bluntly, if  : If cash transfers flourished, “the whole aid industry would have to fire itself. ” There is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap  —   meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line  —   was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid. In the   village, the residents had just started to work through how transformative the program would be, what they could do with the money and how different their lives could feel in 12 years. Detractors often say that no one would work in a world with a basic income, that the safety net could grow a bit too comfortable. Ultimately, what a universal income would do to workers in the rich world will remain a mystery until someone tries it out. But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1, 000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food. Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed   Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the   had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows’ goats and cattle from one     meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. “I’m happy! I’m happy! I’m happy!” he said. He bought himself a goat that day. When he got his money, Erick Odhiambo Madoho walked to the   local highway nearest the village and took a matatu, a shared minibus, overloaded with 20 passengers, down to Lake Victoria. There he found an   stand and converted his mobile money into shillings. He used the cash to buy the first of three rounds of   fishing line that he would need to   into nets to catch tilapia in the lake. When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2, 000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadn’t saved money for nets beforehand. He shrugged, smiled and said, “I could not. ”",0
18689,How Spy Tech Firms Let Governments See Everything on a Smartphone - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Want to invisibly spy on 10 iPhone owners without their knowledge? Gather their every keystroke, sound, message and location? That will cost you $650, 000, plus a $500, 000 setup fee with an Israeli outfit called the NSO Group. You can spy on more people if you would like  —   just check out the company’s price list. The NSO Group is one of a number of companies that sell surveillance tools that can capture all the activity on a smartphone, like a user’s location and personal contacts. These tools can even turn the phone into a secret recording device. Since its founding six years ago, the NSO Group has kept a low profile. But last month, security researchers caught its spyware trying to gain access to the iPhone of a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. They also discovered a second target, a Mexican journalist who wrote about corruption in the Mexican government. Now, internal NSO Group emails, contracts and commercial proposals obtained by The New York Times offer insight into how companies in this secretive digital surveillance industry operate. The emails and documents were provided by two people who have had dealings with the NSO Group but would not be named for fear of reprisals. The company is one of dozens of digital spying outfits that track everything a target does on a smartphone. They aggressively market their services to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. The industry argues that this spying is necessary to track terrorists, kidnappers and drug lords. The NSO Group’s corporate mission statement is “Make the world a safe place. ” Ten people familiar with the company’s sales, who refused to be identified, said that the NSO Group has a strict internal vetting process to determine who it will sell to. An ethics committee made up of employees and external counsel vets potential customers based on human rights rankings set by the World Bank and other global bodies. And to date, these people all said, NSO has yet to be denied an export license. But critics note that the company’s spyware has also been used to track journalists and human rights activists. “There’s no check on this,” said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. “Once NSO’s systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they’re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place. ” The NSO Group’s capabilities are in higher demand now that companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are using stronger encryption to protect data in their systems, in the process making it harder for government agencies to track suspects. The NSO Group’s spyware finds ways around encryption by baiting targets to click unwittingly on texts containing malicious links or by exploiting previously undiscovered software flaws. It was taking advantage of three such flaws in Apple software  —   since fixed  —   when it was discovered by researchers last month. The cyberarms industry typified by the NSO Group operates in a legal gray area, and it is often left to the companies to decide how far they are willing to dig into a target’s personal life and what governments they will do business with. Israel has strict export controls for digital weaponry, but the country has never barred the sale of NSO Group technology. Since it is privately held, not much is known about the NSO Group’s finances, but its business is clearly growing. Two years ago, the NSO Group sold a controlling stake in its business to Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, for $120 million. Nearly a year later, Francisco Partners was exploring a sale of the company for 10 times that amount, according to two people approached by the firm but forbidden to speak about the discussions. The company’s internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and   contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013. “Our intelligence systems are subject to Mexico’s relevant legislation and have legal authorization,” Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. “They are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law. ” Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said that the sale of its spyware was restricted to authorized governments and that it was used solely for criminal and terrorist investigations. He declined to comment on whether the company would cease selling to the U. A. E. and Mexico after last week’s disclosures. For the last six years, the NSO Group’s main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, has been used by a growing number of government agencies to target a range of smartphones  —   including iPhones, Androids, and BlackBerry and Symbian systems  —   without leaving a trace. Among the Pegasus system’s capabilities, NSO Group contracts assert, are the abilities to extract text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and GPS locations. One capability that the NSO Group calls “room tap” can gather sounds in and around the room, using the phone’s own microphone. Pegasus can use the camera to take snapshots or screen grabs. It can deny the phone access to certain websites and applications, and it can grab search histories or anything viewed with the phone’s web browser. And all of the data can be sent back to the agency’s server in real time. In its commercial proposals, the NSO Group asserts that its tracking software and hardware can install itself in any number of ways, including “over the air stealth installation,” tailored text messages and emails, through public   hot spots rigged to secretly install NSO Group software, or the   way, by spies in person. Much like a traditional software company, the NSO Group prices its surveillance tools by the number of targets, starting with a flat $500, 000 installation fee. To spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650, 000 $650, 000 for 10 Android users $500, 000 for five BlackBerry users or $300, 000 for five Symbian users  —   on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal. You can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800, 000, 50 extra targets cost $500, 000, 20 extra will cost $250, 000 and 10 extra costs $150, 000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter. What that gets you, NSO Group documents say, is “unlimited access to a target’s mobile devices. ” In short, the company says: You can “remotely and covertly collect information about your target’s relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities  —   whenever and wherever they are. ” And, its proposal adds, “It leaves no traces whatsoever. ”",0
18690,"‘Veep’ Season 5, Episode 6: The Affront - The New York Times","Even though Selina Meyer is the leader of the free world and, also, a woman, “Veep” rarely digs deeply into the gender politics that affect women in positions of power. The show has subtly highlighted the fact that Selina has to worry about her haircuts, her acne and the visibility of the bags under her eyes to a degree that most men officials probably don’t. We’ve also seen her male political colleagues underestimate her on more than one occasion. But most of the time, she and her staff are too busy dealing with things like teleprompter   and data breaches to directly address the sexism that a woman of Selina’s stature would likely confront on a daily basis. That changes in this week’s episode, in which Selina handles several crises unique to a woman POTUS. For starters, there’s that Politico story that claims that a member of the White House staff referred to the president using That Word. (I say That Word because the word in question  —   the most insulting thing a woman can be called  —   is unfit for print here.) Selina instructs Amy, the only woman in her inner circle of advisers, to find out who’s responsible for calling her such a derogatory name. Not surprisingly, it quickly becomes clear that Amy and almost everyone else in that aforementioned inner circle has recently used That Word to describe their boss. (“I shouted it into my phone on the Acela quiet car,” Mike confesses in one of the great,   lines in this episode.) The fact that there’s an ugly, sexist aspect to that particular expletive doesn’t necessarily seem to have occurred to any of them (note: they’re mostly men) and in a way, that makes sense. To borrow a line from “A Christmas Story,” the Oval Office dwellers of “Veep” work in profanity the way other artists might work in oils or clay. It is their true medium they are masters. So many obscenities trip and fall off their tongues every day that it’s unlikely they even considered the harsh ramifications of what they said about Selina. But Selina is very aware of how hurtful That Word is and calls Amy to the White House in the middle of the night to discuss it. In a scene that feels as though it were ripped from an old Bette Davis movie, Selina, dressed in a flowing nightgown while darkly barking orders and smoking a cigarette, delivers a blistering monologue: “I am the first female president of the United States and this is an affront. I’ll tell you something, Amy, a lot of people don’t want me to be president. And you know why. Because fundamentally, people hate women. Right? I mean, they’ll just stop at nothing to get me out of here. Everybody’s trying to get me. But I’m not going to let them. ” Theoretically, it is possible to listen to this speech without being reminded of Hillary Clinton. But so far, I haven’t figured out how. It’s telling that Selina only feels comfortable speaking so pointedly about her gender in a dimly lit room, in the dead of night, with only a single other woman present. It implies that she knows if she were to say any of this during the work day, with all the Oval Office lights on and everyone on her team present, she’d be perceived as crazy or overly sensitive. Consequently, Selina tends to suppress her worst suspicions about how she’s perceived or simply distract herself with the 87 other messes spilled at her feet. For example, later in this episode, when she finds out that Jonah is succeeding in his Congressional campaign by railing against her record, a move that actually validates her theory that everyone is “trying to get her,” she lets it roll off her back. Ben tells her it’s good news since once Jonah gets elected, he’ll support her presidency. (Though, really, can’t we all see Jonah   on that promise once he gets a tiny taste of power?) Regardless, the truth is there’s only so many attacks a woman can worry about at once. There are key points in this episode that deliberately show Selina leaning too hard into stereotypical female behavior. One is that   Oval Office scene with Amy, which casts Selina as the harpy. The other involves her waffling about whether or not to bail out the bank overseen by Charlie Baird, a move that may be the best thing from an economic standpoint but a terrible thing for her image since she’ll be perceived as doing a favor for her lover. That whole story line traffics in two classically demeaning perceptions of women: That they’re indecisive, and that they’re always driven by their hearts instead of their heads. By depicting Selina in this way, it’s as if the show is inviting its audience to see her as a prototypical woman, too. But then “Veep” does something brilliant and subverts all of that by having Selina decide not to bail out Charlie’s bank, primarily because of that drippy “love is what matters” pep talk from Gary. Selina isn’t going to fall for the kind of talk she calls “When Gary Met Sally. ” You can call her That Word and you can think she’s being indecisive but she is still a woman who can’t be pigeonholed. (It’s worth noting that this episode was   by a woman, Georgia Pritchett, and a man, Will Smith, and directed by a man presumably inclined to be sympathetic to Selina  —   Brad Hall, husband of Julia  .) Other examples of women raging against various machines are sprinkled throughout this episode, too. There’s the reappearance of Candi Caruso, the seemingly competent job applicant who once again is called in for an interview and immediately dismissed because the position is being filled  . There’s poor Amy, who’s so overworked that she hilariously tells Siri to set a reminder for her to freeze her eggs. And then there’s Catherine, who has more of a right to feel neglected and demeaned than maybe any other woman on “Veep. ” After struggling for days to have a conversation with her mother, she finally drops a bomb on her at the end of this episode when she announces that she’s fallen in love with Marjorie, Selina’s Secret Service agent who was hired because she supposedly looks like Selina from behind. Despite all those progressive things Selina says for the cameras during a   for her holiday shopping trip to Kramerbooks  Afterwords Café  —   she claims she plans to purchase a book by the   poet Wanda Coleman, as well as a graphic novel “with a strong Asian protagonist”  —   Selina’s   goes out the window when she realizes her daughter is gay. “I wish mother was alive, because this definitely would have killed her,” Selina says. But shouldn’t she have seen this coming? Of course Catherine has fallen for Marjorie. She’s the one person on Earth who looks (a little) like Selina and actually pays attention to Catherine.",0
18691,"Iranian Minister Trolls Trump, Praises Pope Francis","In a series of tweets, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif slammed U. S. President Donald Trump while praising Pope Francis for his alleged “denunciation of #MuslimBan” and of the Rohingya genocide going on in Myanmar. [Zarif appears to have attempted to drive a wedge between Trump and the Pope, tweeting that the world “needs leaders who urge dialogue  compassion, not walls  exclusion. ”  Welcome @Pontifex denunciation of #MuslimBan  #RohingyaGenocide. World needs leaders who urge dialogue  compassion, not walls  exclusion.  —   Javad Zarif (@JZarif) February 10, 2017,  The Iranian minister was referring to a recent general audience in which Pope Francis made some extemporaneous remarks urging prayer for the persecuted Rohingya people, who are Muslims. The Pope actually never mentioned President Trump’s temporary travel ban on 7 nations that are hotbeds of Islamic terrorism, including Iran. In his remarks Wednesday, Francis asked his hearers to pray in a special way for “our Rohingya brothers and sisters. ” “Driven out of Myanmar, they go from one place to another because they are unwanted,” he said. “They are good people, peaceful people. They are not Christians, but they are good, they are our brothers and sisters. And they have been suffering for years,” Francis said. “They have been tortured, killed, simply because they follow their traditions and their Muslim faith. Let us pray for them. I invite you to pray for them to our Father in Heaven, all together, for our Rohingya brothers and sisters. ” Earlier in his address, the Pope repeated a favorite   of his regarding the need to “create bridges rather than walls,” though the Vatican has insisted that this figurative expression refers to an attitude of openness to dialogue with others, and does not refer to specific walls or persons. Charles Maung Bo, the first Catholic cardinal from Myanmar (the former Burma) has called the persecution of the Rohingyas “an appalling scar on the conscience of my country. ” According to Cardinal Bo, the Rohingyas are “among the most marginalized, dehumanized and persecuted people in the world. They are treated worse than animals. Stripped of their citizenship, rejected by neighboring countries, they are rendered stateless. ” Among his recent tweets, Zarif also confirmed his support for U. S. protesters against President Trump, saying that many Iranians had also demonstrated in defiance of “threats  insults” from the U. S. government.

18692,Alien-Looking Skull From Peruvian Desert Awaits Further Investigation,"We were recently shown, and examined the above artifact that supposedly was found, along with many others, in a cave in the southern desert of Peru; exact location to be given, hopefully, in the future. 

The underside of the skull (full set of images below) indicates that this artifact is bone, about 3 to 5 mm thick, and still has a stiff, grey, skin-like material attached to it. 

Note the very narrow foramen magnum aperture where presumably a very thin vertebral system once entered the skull.

The adult hand indicates the size of the specimen, and note that it is relatively bilaterally symmetrical, and that the skull is greatly elongated.


Though easy to state that it is a complex fake, the caretaker and those that presumably found it, along with other specimens, have no access to artisans or taxidermists that could have made them.

The caretaker removed some of the bone from the underpart of the skull and exposed what is presumably marrow. 

This, as well as the bone and skin can be sampled for DNA and radiocarbon testing in prominent laboratories in North America that we are working with already.

The television series Ancient Aliens has shown initial interest in the specimen, and more specimens like this, from the same location may soon be available for observation and study.

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. 
Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn’t plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi.

Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama’s purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true.

18695,A Judge Just Declared Trump’s New Hotel BANKRUPT,"Comments 
Yet another one of the obnoxiously ostentatious monuments to Trump’s ego is going under. The Trump International Hotel in Toronto is filing for bankruptcy, a mere four years after it opened. 
The champagne and caviar toned tower will be auctioned off after a Canadian bankruptcy judge placed the building into receivership on Tuesday. 
In a story that is now very familiar to all of us , the $310 million project was beset with lawsuits from the start from angry investors who claim that Trump and his partners lied to them with “wildly overstated projections of Trump Toronto’s performance,” telling investors the “worst case” scenario for occupancy rates would be 55%, when in fact court documents show it varied between 15% and 45%. POLITICO details just how hard Trump screwed his investors: 
It is clear from affidavits in the fraud cases and the bankruptcy case that the buyers have taken a financial beating. A warehouse supervisor named Sarbjit Singh, who was earning about $55,000 a year, testified that he borrowed money from his father, a retired welder, for the deposit on his hotel unit; he never closed on the deal, but he says he still lost $248,000. Se Na Lee, a homemaker who was married to a mortgage underwriter, borrowed money for her deposit from her parents; she did close, and ended up losing $990,000 through December 2014, she says. 
Trump licensed his name for the project to Talon International, owned by a Russian-born oligarch, Alexander Shnaider. “The whole business model has been overpromise and underdeliver, and it’s Trump’s name on the thing” said an insider to POLITICO. 
The hotel has been the site of numerous protests against the racist rabble-rouser, and a city Councillor of Toronto has publicly demanded the Trump name be removed from the building, saying in a statement to the project managers that: 
There are some who may suggest that Canadians should just ignore Mr. Trump, or that he doesn’t matter because he is a political figure in another country. 
However, recent attacks against Muslims in Toronto, and other Canadian cities, show that we are not immune to hateful actions against peaceful people. As well, the Canadian government’s similar internment of Japanese-Canadians is a part of our past that is still very painful for many. 
To have the Trump name displayed so prominently on our skyline signals a tacit acceptance of hateful and divisive views. 
Such is the legacy of Donald Trump, disgraced businessman and divisive race-baiting sexual predator: angry citizens, angry investors, bankruptcy, and a prominent stain where the letters of his name once stood.",0
18696,"""Top Five Clinton Donors Are Jewish"" - How Anti-Semitic Is This Fact?","""Top Five Clinton Donors Are Jewish"" - How Anti-Semitic Is This Fact? Top five Clinton donors Are Jewish, campaign tally shows. 
Something is wrong with the above statement. Isn't it anti-semitic? Did Trump say that? Readers of that statement may assume, somewhat reasonably, that there is a club of rich Jewish people controlling the Clinton campaign and, maybe, Clinton herself. That sounds like it was taken from the fake Protocols of the Elders of Zion. It clearly must be anti-semitic. 
It is also true . 
Facts have no bias. They can't be anti-semitic (or can they?). But while facts as such can not have a racial-religious bias, openly stating them surely can. Thus the above statement is anti-semitic. The fact itself isn't bad, reporting it publicly is bad, bad, bad. 
Who but an alt-right rag would report such at all? And for what purpose if not for spreading anti-semitism? 
Well - quot licet jovi, ... 
Jewish papers are of course allowed to report such a fact. That isn't anti-semitic. It is solely to brag about Jewish powers. Within the club that is not only allowed, but welcome. Thus Haaretz writes (sourced to the the Jewish Telegraph Agency) under the identity defining headline at the top of this post: Haim Saban, George Soros and others stand at the head of a list of wealthy donors who contributed mainly via super PACs. 
The Washington Post analysis, posted October 24, named the top donors, who are contributing $1 of every $17 of the over $1 billion amassed for the Democratic nominee’s presidential run. 
They are Donald Sussman, a hedge fund manager; J.B. Pritzker, a venture capitalist, and his wife, M.K.; Haim Saban, the Israeli-American entertainment mogul, and his wife, Cheryl; George Soros, another hedge funder and a major backer of liberal causes, and Daniel Abraham, a backer of liberal pro-Israel causes and the founder of SlimFast. 
Many of the big Clinton campaign donors also give to the Clinton Foundation which at times is a washing machine to put money into the Clinton's private accounts. It is kind of difficult to understand where Clinton Inc begins and where it ends. Campaign funds, Clinton foundation, speech fees, private accounts - does it even matter? Surely those who pay, to whatever Clinton entity, expect a service in return. Given the Clinton's occupations as Senator, Secretary of State and President the ask in return is unlikely to be commercial. It will be political. 
And here is why it matters that the five top donors to Clinton's campaign are Jewish, and all big supporters of Israel. (Haim Saban: ""I'm a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel."") They surely will ask for political favors in the interest of the Zionist entity. This is also the reason why Haaretz, an Israeli paper, finds the strong racial-religious bias at the top Clinton campaign tally newsworthy. Big money paid to a Clinton entity can directly effect U.S. policies towards Israel. It buys its acquiescence to Israeli escapades even when those are not consistent U.S. interests. 
Clinton's positions towards Syria, Iran and Russia (which limits Israel's freedom of action) are surely not independent of Israeli interests. 
But that is of course, anti-semitic speculation ... Posted by b on October 28, 2016 at 11:16 AM | Permalink",0
18697,Thousands of Mourners Celebrate Gwen Ifill’s Tenacity and Grace - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. learned he would be sitting down for an interview with Gwen Ifill, he prematurely breathed a sigh of relief, thinking about the    woman he had befriended through house parties and family barbecues. “She wasn’t Gwen the national figure, but Gwen the sistah,     ” he said. “The sistah with fascinating stories, with funny jokes and juicy    observations better known as gossip. ” The two had bonded over their shared connection to Barbados and took to calling each other “cuz,” imagining they might be distant cousins through ancestors on the Caribbean island. But moments into their interview, Mr. Holder, still early in his tenure as attorney general, realized that the   woman from the weekends had “transformed. ” “My dear Gwen, unexpectedly to me, went from ‘cuz’ to newsperson,” Mr. Holder said. “She was fair but she was piercing, serious but unfailingly nice, smiling the whole time as she forced me out of my prescribed talking points. ” Mr. Holder told his story and read a letter from President Obama in front of thousands of mourners who gathered for nearly three hours Saturday for Ms. Ifill’s funeral, which was held at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, a former haven to runaway enslaved people where Ms. Ifill had worshiped since 1989. Ms. Ifill died on Monday from complications of uterine cancer. She was 61. On Saturday, some wept as they studied the long wooden pew in the seventh row in the center of the church where Ms. Ifill and her friends regularly sat, and where, after her death, the church placed a plaque with Ms. Ifill’s name. (The church has placed plaques on other pews for figures like Frederick Douglass.) The funeral became a reunion of Ms. Ifill’s large family and a gathering of luminaries. Michelle Obama, the first lady Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama and Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, sat alongside a number of prominent journalists, including Dorothy Gilliam, Chuck Todd, Roland Martin and Charlayne  . While many stood to speak about Ms. Ifill’s life, recordings of her own interviews and speeches that she gave were sprinkled throughout the service. Ms. Ifill was born on Sept. 29, 1955, in Jamaica, Queens. Her father was an A. M. E. minister and her family was deeply religious, as well as committed to watching the news to keep up with current affairs. She graduated in 1977 with a bachelor of arts degree from Simmons College in Boston, where she majored in communications. Her first job as a professional journalist was with The Boston  . In between that job and her final one with PBS, Ms. Ifill worked for The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, where she was a White House correspondent and covered Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Her career in television began in 1994, when Tim Russert recruited her to cover Capitol Hill for NBC. She joined PBS in 1999. Her highest visibility came as the moderator and managing editor of the public affairs program “Washington Week” on PBS, where she was also   and   editor, with Judy Woodruff, of “NewsHour. ” They were the first   team to anchor such a program. Under the church’s large stained glass windows, generations of people hugged, wept and shared their sadness about Ms. Ifill’s death. Many lamented that her voice would be especially missed as the nation prepared for   Donald J. Trump to take office. The funeral began in silence as images of Ms. Ifill were projected onto the wall. A recording of Mr. Obama calling her an “extraordinary journalist” boomed throughout the church. Soon after, it was Ms. Ifill’s voice that filled the room, saying, “You can be the person who turns toward, not away from, the chance to rise above the fray. ” In another recording that was played later, Ms. Ifill said, “It’s important to be reminded how easily we can be denied simple, obvious opportunity, how low the ceilings can get and how much fortitude it takes to refuse to accept the limits that others place on you. ” Audio also played of PBS viewers, who thanked Ms. Ifill for explaining the world to them every night and expressed sorrow that she would no longer help the nation grapple with political changes. Transfixed in the moment, most of the mourners stayed silent as latecomers shuffled into squeaky pews and the choir members, dressed in purple and gold robes, began to sing “Now Thank We All Our God. ” Several of Ms. Ifill’s friends read from Scripture and spoke of her ability to connect with family and friends and to mentor young journalists. Athelia Knight, a former reporter for The Washington Post and a close friend who frequently sat next to Ms. Ifill at church, read from 1 Corinthians: “Death has been swallowed up in victory. ” Puncturing the sadness, Ms. Ifill’s voice was played again. This time, she joked about the satire that followed when she moderated   debates. “And along the way, I have to say, there were some perks. I was played by Queen Latifah twice on ‘Saturday Night Live. ’” Yet the void left by Ms. Ifill’s death radiated through the morning. The sorrow seemed to reach its peak as her cousin Darlene   sang “It Is Well With My Soul,” belting out the hymn as many raised their hands and cried. Ms. Ifill’s   Ms. Woodruff, said in her reflections that the two had grown extremely close as they planned their program. “We didn’t look like other anchor pairs, and we loved that,” she said to loud applause, before adding that her heart was broken. Ms. Woodruff also said she could only imagine what Ms. Ifill might be doing in the afterlife. “A friend wrote, what a glorious scene is it to picture Gwen and Tim today, up in heaven, grilling James Madison and Alexander Hamilton about the Electoral College,” she said, referring to Mr. Russert, who died of a heart attack in 2008. Michele Norris, a friend and fellow journalist, said that she and Ms. Ifill were part of a circle of women who became as close as family and who supported one another through both struggles and successes. “Her ability to be a friend was epic,” Ms. Norris said, saying Ms. Ifill had nudged her at a party to talk to the man who later became her husband. Sherrilyn Ifill, Ms. Ifill’s cousin and the president and   of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, shared memories of playing dominoes and Scrabble together and of spending Thanksgiving with families deeply interested in politics and justice. She pointed out that both her parents and Ms. Ifill’s had immigrated to the United States from Barbados. “At this particular moment in our country, I do want to note that Gwen represented the most American of success stories,” she said.",0
18698,On Trump: an Open Letter to the Brokenhearted,"Donate On Trump: an Open Letter to the Brokenhearted ""To those of you that care about diversity, about the environment, about the beauty of queer sexual orientations, about indigenous lands and their right to thrive, and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and women...I write."" How do we respond to this confusing moment? What do we do now? How do we recover? By Adebayo Akomolafe / bayoakomolafe.net 
Let us acknowledge these difficult feelings of loss, these terrifying thoughts that are suddenly very alive in the air today. It is as if Pandora’s Box has not only been emptied out into the world, but that it has been mass-produced and spread out to the corners of all lands. Hope now seems in short supply. We are undone. 
I write you because things have indeed fallen apart. While this unspeakable insurgency of despair might goad us into rushing into the next ‘organizational moment’– the itch to hit them back or do something – I want to invite us to slow down and pay attention to the stark grief that haunts us now. She stares us in the face, this repulsive visitor. If we must survive, we must return her gaze and let her do her important work with us. 
I am a Nigerian living in India. But like most people on the planet that tuned in to the surrealism of the 2016 American presidential campaigns, I woke up to the shocking news that Donald Trump was not only beating Hillary Clinton on election day, but that there was a frightening possibility he could win. And then that distant possibility, once laughably out of the question, became a gut-wrenching reality-to-come. Hillary’s ‘blue wall’ fell to the man who promised to build more; the media people stuttered as their once pristine cast of glossy pundits groped for words; the Mexican peso fell. And in one fell swoop, it felt like America, the so-called home of the brave was exactly that : a place dyed in fear, where braveness would now be required to keep on living. 
Ever since Donald Trump became the 45 th president of the United States, the internet has been flooded with articles attempting to make sense of this story-bursting, crystal-ball-shattering moment. Politico published a piece with a title that must have resonated with many people around the world: “How did everyone get it so wrong?” The London-based Independent insisted that “Donald Trump would have lost US election if Bernie Sanders had been the candidate”, while Thomas Frank opined on the pages of The Guardian that “Donald Trump is moving to the White House, and liberals put him there”. Across the fractured landscape of YouTubia, self-professed Trumpists – also surprised by their fortune – laughed at liberals, mocking the ‘feminazis’ that thought Hillary Clinton – an admittedly troubled candidate who didn’t seem to have a message beyond insisting on her entitlement – would simply waltz into the White House. 
I will not attempt to pry open the cadaver of this moment – it is probably the case that no post-mortem analysis is good enough to assuage our feelings of shock. What happened is not reducible to a single causative factor or a decidable ‘active ingredient’. The world isn’t that simple. I will however state, in the spirit of full disclosure – the kind of radical honesty we probably need at this time – that I secretly wanted this to happen: I was so invested in the idea of a Sanders presidency (and so mortified by what was obvious to me as an establishmentarian attempt to stifle his voice) that I became possessed by a schadenfreude I couldn’t easily exorcise. I understood the dangers of a potential Trump presidency, but decided even that was better off to the inertia of the neoliberal status quo as embodied by a Hillary Clinton regime. That argument is not easily maintained in the face of the orange predicament we now find ourselves in. 
In an all-too-real case of “be careful what you wish for”, I find not relief but a painful sympathy with many who had hoped that the morning of 9 th would somehow usher in a more tolerant America. A more beautiful country. A country that cares about its many colours and contours. Now because of Trump and the energies he has activated, minorities are probably less safe. At a time of unprecedented racial tensions and phallic exhibitions of gunmanship, some folks are already dreading their next brief visit to the shopping mall, knowing that the streets are now being painted red with hate, white with racial acrimony and blind nativism, and blue with the authoritarian aloofness of a candidate who promised ‘law and order’. The new America. 
It is to these vulnerable ones I write. Those of you that care about diversity, about the environment, about the beauty of queer sexual orientations, about indigenous lands and their right to thrive, and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and women. 
Without pre-empting Donald Trump or falling into the trap of disillusioned punditry – and yet with a keen awareness of the likely consequences of his presidency – I ask: how do we respond to this? What do we do? How do we recover? What opportunities are presenting themselves to us to work for (with) a caring world? At the time of writing this letter, there is news of revolt on the streets of Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and other American cities. People are protesting the rise of Trump. People are angry. Around this same time, famed documentarian Michael Moore has suggested concerned Americans should ‘fire the punditry’ and ‘take over the Democratic party’. It is impossible to answer the question of what a ‘right’ response is, or to speak as if one is situated outside the swirl and flow of things. I do however want to invite you to try doing something less spectacular…something small, for it is my opinion that with Trump, the seeds of a ‘new’ politics may yet be planted. 
When I was growing up in Christian Nigeria, I was taught to think of my life only in terms of its ‘greatness quotient’. I was conditioned early to yearn for prominence. Fame. Fortune. Legacy. Success. ‘Awakening the Giant Within’. Getting to the top. Lasting forever. Those were resonant memes in my developmental years. The figures of Mandela, Bill Gates, Jack Welch, and Jesus were placed before me as aspirational objects. If I did not do all I can to increase my ‘greatness quotient’, my life did not really matter. 
I suspect this story is not uniquely mine to tell. We live in a world that places priority in the ‘top’ and discountenances the ‘bottom’. The condition for living a life of meaning and purpose was moral probity: the stunning city of bigness only admitted those who walked the straight and narrow way, I was told. 
Well, if all that held true once, November 8 was a spectacular repudiation. Donald Trump, ill-prepared, a self-decorated humble person, and one who had said awful things about women, attained the highest office in America – his face beamed on to the Empire State Building in New York amidst the pomp and pageantry that defined his life. The Joker won…and nothing adds up anymore. Punditry is broken. Polls are broken. The sure-banker firepower of celebrity is broken. Virtue is broken. 
Trump strolled to the grand stage up in the front and wrecked it, but in so doing he inadvertently ‘gave’ us permission to inhabit the aisles – to rearrange the entire room. By becoming president, Trump disturbs the idea that the top is worth reaching – not because he is so vile that his new position as president denigrates the office, but because his unprecedented campaign and quest for power shakes us loose to recognize that where we stand is a thick place, sewn through and through with voices and potential and power. 
The stunning revelation of these times of upheaval is that ‘winning’ is defunct, and new relational modes are desperately needed: the red tape, the raised chair, the grand stage, the green room, and the white house are not the interesting, glorified objects they once were. The emperor has lost his clothes. This whole idea that greatness is some end goal to be achieved by the morally pure, the experienced, and the hardworking, has itself been reworked. And we are left with an awkward coming to terms with the fact that life isn’t a highway but an ecology of small things and ordinary becomings. 
The way forward is thus awkward – or rather, there is no clear algorithm on what to do now except perhaps, among other things, to pay close attention to these twists and turns, these rabbit holes and tricky terrains. To take a critical look at the material details of our lives outside of the lenses of identity politics. An immaculate straight line was never ‘there’ to begin with. We are left with these small lives the media pretends doesn’t really matter until you achieve celebrity status; we are left with the first stuttering words of a politics that invites us to the incommensurability of our small hours, and – in place of our fascination with distant power and oh-so-shiny things – urges an attention to our bodies, our relationships, our communities, our hidden miracles, our own stories, and our own knowings. 
Let me spell it out…what I suggest we can do. Please understand that I do not offer these points with any confidence in their stability or with any sort of finality. I offer them sensing that this moment could very well be that bright spot in the middle of a shadow, affording us an opportunity to co-create a politics that does not terminate with concession speeches – a politics that is not tied so stubbornly to single candidates and anorexic voting lines. I sing the songs of other places of power: Embrace the fact that the world is larger than our plots: 
The plot of a story is both its gentle guiding hand and its suffocating grip, helping it move along but also blinding it from realizing that life is bigger, sterner, and more promiscuous than its logic. I could have sworn that with Bernie Sanders’ candidacy, the world was finally stepping into an age of deeper justice and beauty – that evolutionary moment we all await. His ‘failure’ to clinch the nomination was a chastising moment for many keen followers of the American primaries. I slowly came to terms with the fact that the world is not beholden to my liberal fantasies. Simply put, the map is not the terrain. The world stretches far and wide beyond our blind spots, our analyses, and our convictions about what justice looks like. Let grief do her work: 
Globalizing society hardly has any place left for grief. When we get uncomfortable, we are urged to pull ourselves together and get back on the wheel. I reckon that today’s grief has something to teach us; there is a genius to its workings that allow a shift in how we relate with the world. I do not mean that we should all sit down and hold hands. I do however feel we can acknowledge that we are in a mess, and adjourn the quest for a palliative solution for the time being. Perhaps instead of counting down to 2020, or calling on Michelle Obama to run for office, we can use these days to investigate the edges of our politics. I believe grief disciplines us for this slow kind of work. What is at stake here is more than a liberal agenda, it is how we see the world and therefore how we maintain power structures that no longer serve our fondest hopes. At least for the moment, nurture a suspicion for shiny objects : 
We have become a photogenic people – attracted to the spectacular, repulsed by the unseemly. We live in cosmetic pixels. With selfies, Instagram posts, televised news that seems more committed to graphics and bloated soundtracks, and the ongoing digitization of relationships, our lives have been reduced to images – and we are forgetting the art of living in the spaces between those images. We are thus habituated to a regime of visuality that defines what is real to us – and silences/excludes other voices from mattering. Perhaps the reason why most people were shocked by the news of Trump’s win was because they were contained by narratives and material conditions that forced a certain view about America. But then the terrain met the map. We need a new set of eyes. Find the others: 
When things break, we are afforded an opportunity to make reconfigurations. This perhaps is a good time to investigate the contours of our relationships with others, with those we love, with our neighbourhoods, with the strangers who breeze past us in a blur of inconsequentiality. American politics is premised on fixed identity categories – that Democrats and Republicans are essentially two aspects of an adversarial binary. To a large extent, each side sees the other as a noxious blight on the face of the country. The first moments of ‘healing this divide’ is the recognition that even evil has a story, that those persons who hate black people, or curse at ‘the gays’, didn’t just spring out from the earth, fully realized and fleshed out. In a sense that often escapes us, we are unfolding, hyphenated aspects of each other. None of us is on the side of ‘good’. Donald Trump and the people that support him are just as much a product of the same media-infused, economically imperilled, people-denying politics that have created us. In a game of sides, the greatest loss we suffer is the other side. Let us leave room for the outlier, for the strange, and for the unexpected. We are not as ‘sorted out’ as we think we are. Notice the ground upon which you stand: 
I like to say that falling could very well be flying, without the tyranny of coordinates. Technically speaking, falling objects are actually the gravitational pull of attraction between objects. I won’t succumb to, or insist that, we are being ushered into a more glorious paradigm of politics…I cannot make that claim. There are however sympathies between place and feet, between our stories and our contexts, that call on us to participate in the sacredness of where we are. What attracts you now? What questions matter to you? What performances of place are pressing themselves upon you? What do you do every day? Where do you come from? Does that question make sense? A friend, Eric Chisler, put this sentiment this way: “Remember the earth. Remember your ancestors. Remember your four-legged, winged, crawling relatives. Remember life. Your life, your way of living, that is the only activism you’ve ever had. Use it. Make your existence a ritual that honors everything your body and words touch. The times are troubled and you are needed. Wake up—notice the consequence of every action and non-action. You are needed. You are needed. You are needed.” The confusion about what to do next is redemptive : 
If you are still confused about what this all means, how anyone could vote for Trump, what the future holds and how to respond to this proto-crisis of sorts, count yourself among the lucky ones. Confusion and uncertainty are how multiple agencies negotiate directionality – and this ongoing process is important. Even inertia isn’t determinately still. We must slowdown in these times of urgency, and allow other agentic forces to reshape us. 
It might be the case that within the specificity of your own context, you know what to do. That’s great. March on the streets. Print BLM tee-shirts. Learn how to plant your own food. Investigate your ancestry. Or open a gift shop and invite passers-by to get free hugs. Out of the logic of our emergence, new moments are distilled and new activisms become possible. We must be humble enough to recognize that the ‘right thing’ to do is almost always known in retrospect, and that justice is always justice-in-the-making. Small lives matter: 
Finally, don’t beat yourself up for not saving the day. Even if some archaic policy were conjured by the White House, annulling president-elect Trump’s win, it still wouldn’t do much to address the politics that made him happen. The fight is not so much with Trump as it is for a new way of meeting our own selves – a way of speaking with those we consider ‘other than us’. In short, we must turn to each other, for it is in the smallness of our embrace that new worlds burst into life. 

All considered, would it have been great to have a woman president? Yes. That would have assured many of their place in the world and told them that they are valued and needed and worthy of love. And yet, that message finds a more interesting home now that we have lost our way…now that hope seems faraway. 
The politics that knocks on our doors right now doesn’t have to wait for the next four years. Let your campaigns of sacred enlivenment continue.

18699,"NATIONAL REVIEW, Conservatism Inc., Plan to Cave EVEN MORE On Immigration!","  => A tsunami is a natural phenomenon. Mass immigration is government policy. Credit: VDare.com. 
Conservatives are fond of saying, “Being a liberal means never having to say you’re sorry. ” Unfortunately, the same is true of Conservatism Inc. functionaries. They acknowledge conservatives are facing demographic extinction. They admit it is happening because of immigration. But they refuse to listen to the very people who warned them about this. Instead, they will continue skipping towards annihilation and drag the entire country with them. 
Exhibit A: the recent cover story from National Review telling us, once again, how Republicans need to “adapt to a diversifying electorate or lose their influence” [ Can the GOP Overcome Demographic Change in Red States , by Tim Alberta, [ ]November 7 2016]. 
Incredibly, the hook of the story is the tale of an American couple who used to live in California before fleeing the state. 
The state had been overrun, first by immigrants legal and illegal, their cultures and traditions in tow, and then by liberal politicians who seized control of the government by catering to these constituencies and turning their communities into Democratic garrisons. The state became majority-minority in 2001; whites are now 39 percent of its population and dwindling. In turn, the GOP is essentially extinct, representing conservative enclaves around California but irrelevant in statewide elections. 
They fled to Arizona, but the same process of ethnic cleansing via mass immigration is underway there as well. So they are supporting Donald Trump in order to stop it. 
Needless to say, author Alberta does not sympathize with their solution. 
But Trump cannot deliver that; nobody can. The country will soon look very different. And the biggest contributor to that change—the single trend that could propel the GOP toward oblivion—is the ethnic diversification of the electorate. 
Alberta’s brilliant suggestion: Republicans need to somehow win the votes of the very people this couple is fleeing from! Here's my @NRO cover story on America's demographic transformation and the dire implications for Donald Trump's GOP https://t.co/mMa98v1QLI pic.twitter.com/FYUTOkvcoi 
— Tim Alberta (@TimAlberta) October 31, 2016 
What makes this even more amazing is that Alberta acknowledges Republican failure to win a majority of non-white voters anywhere in the country. 
He suggests there’s hope for Republicans in Texas. But as Steve Sailer has shown , the strong state identity and white bloc voting suggests Texas is a unique state, and even in this best-case example, Romney only won 37 percent of the Hispanic vote. Alberta also suggests Florida. But here too, it is older Cuban Hispanics who vote Republican, a declining demographic relative to the larger “Latino” community. 
Alberta blandly blames the GOP for trying to “repel non-whites.” And as an example of someone who is doing the opposite and somehow winning over this demographic, Alberta points to…Paul Ryan! 
Ryan, for example, has toured the nation’s poorest neighborhoods and met with community leaders to craft anti-poverty proposals, and has long been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. 
But this isn’t a new idea. It’s just another attempt at “Jack Kemp conservatism,” which spectacularly failed to win minority support or even enough white votes . And despite Ryan’s boasting about opposing Prop. 187 , Hispanics don’t support Republicans who favor mass immigration. Even Alberta admits Ronald Reagan’s share of the Hispanic vote actually declined from 37 percent to 30 percent after he passed the nation-destroying 1986 Amnesty. 
The central problem is something Alberta doesn’t mention at all, let alone confront. Non-whites do not want conservatism . They have nothing to gain from it. The black middle and upper classes (and its exemplars like Michelle Obama ) are a creation of Affirmative Action. Hispanics favor liberal economic policies by larger margins than they favor more immigration. Arabs are eager to jettison their supposed “white privilege” so they can get government benefits too. 
At some point, one of these Beltway Right shills has to show some evidence— any evidence—that babbling about “enterprise zones” or an “opportunity society” actually wins over minority voters. 
Why would any of these people want “limited government” when they can get handouts, privileged treatment and tributes to their tribal identities? Why would they want to assimilate to an “American” identity which is fundamentally a creation of European-Americans when they can receive more psychological and financial benefits from claiming they are the victims of racism and “white privilege?” 
The demographic death spiral was not necessary. After all, Peter Brimelow warned conservatives ( in National Review!) that it was “ Time To Rethink Immigration ” back in 1992. He and Edwin S. Rubenstein told conservatives “demography is destiny” and broke down exactly what i mmigration would do to the Reagan coalition in their 1997 “ Electing A New People ,” also a National Review cover story (!) . But, as Brimelow noted when VDARE.com reposted the piece in 2000, the response was silence, without anyone even addressing the argument. 
As we see from Alberta’s article, the silence continues when it comes to grappling with hard realities. William F. Buckley and the “ movement ” he created “ simply did not have the energy or the courage to adapt to the next generation of issues ” following the election of Ronald Reagan. 
However, that “movement” was not idle when it came to purging the people who understood what was happening. Peter Brimelow , John O’Sullivan , Sam Francis , Patrick J. Buchanan and many others who accurately predicted what was coming were driven out of the Respectable Right. And Conservatism Inc. is left with people who not only won’t, but can’t intelligently interpret what is happening [ The Intellectual Rot at the Heart of the Beltway Right , by Gregory Hood, American Renaissance, April 9, 2016]. 
Alberta expresses the deluded hope that conservatives can, contra Brimelow’s warning, prevent demographics from becoming destiny. In contrast, despite the silly rhetoric about “Stronger Together,” progressives are refreshingly frank about their desire to use engineered population transfers to ensure liberal hegemony. “Ensure demographics is destiny” is one of the major strategic objectives listed by John Podesta in a memo given to a group of liberal billionaires in late 2007 [ Revealed: Liberal Money’s Longterm Strategy To Control Public Opinion And Secure ‘Advantageous’ Demographics , by Peter Hasson, Daily Caller, November 2, 2016]. 
Podesta boasts about an “emerging progressive majority” featuring “communities of color.” He confidently describes blacks as the Democrats’ “most reliable voting bloc” but speaks about Latinos in some detail. And, interestingly, he dismisses the mystical “ Bush won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote” poll which many Beltway Right operatives evidently still believe . 
Considered a swing group by many analysts, Latinos appear to have become much more Democratic over the Bush years. In the 2004 election, it was initially reported that they gave Bush 44 percent of their vote. However, the exit poll is now widely acknowledged to have been flawed and the generally accepted estimate is that Kerry carried Hispanics 58 percent compared to Bush’s 40 percent… Latino support for the Democrats appeared to go up substantially in 2006, with the group as a whole favoring Democrats by a 69 to 30 percent margin. The rapid increase in demographic importance of Latinos will continue for decades. 
What can Conservatism Inc. do in response? Winning over minority voters with Paul Ryan-style strategies isn’t something that has never been tried: it has already been tried, and it failed. 
But this demographic change is not a natural process. It’s the result of deliberate government policies and could be easily reversed. Even Mitt Romney acknowledged this with his fleeting reference to “self-deportation.” If conservatives want to save their movement, and the country, they need to change the demographic facts on the ground. 
Of course, this is much harder than stopping America from becoming majority minority to begin with. But Conservatism Inc. wouldn’t listen. Now it has a much more serious challenge to deal with—one which will remain no matter how much wishful thinking Beltway hacks engage in. Still, acknowledging you have a problem is a first step towards solving it. 
Perhaps at this late hour Conservatism Inc. could try heeding the warnings, and the proposed solutions, of those they cast into the outer darkness. If they don’t, conservatives, and the country, will face extinction. And they will have no one to blame but themselves. 
A word to National Review . Don’t call it a grave. It’s the future you chose.

18700,Mindboggling: Scientists Create A System That PREDICTS Events Hours Before Happening,"According to reports, scientists have come up with a never-before-seen system that has the ability to predict big events on our planet hours before they actually occur. 

After over half a decade of research, several scientists claim they have uncovered the existence of a so-called ‘collective consciousness.’ They are calling it the ‘Noosphere,’ and it exists all around us.

As it states on their website :

The Global Consciousness Project is an international, multidisciplinary collaboration of scientists and engineers. We collect data continuously from a global network of physical random number generators located in up to 70 host sites around the world at any given time. The data are transmitted to a central archive which now contains more than 15 years of random data in parallel sequences of synchronized 200-bit trials generated every second. 

Our purpose is to examine subtle correlations that may reflect the presence and activity of consciousness in the world. We hypothesize that there will be structure in what should be random data, associated with major global events that engage our minds and hearts.

Subtle but real effects of consciousness are important scientifically, but their real power is more immediate. They encourage us to make essential, healthy changes in the great systems that dominate our world. Large scale group consciousness has effects in the physical world. Knowing this, we can intentionally work toward a brighter, more conscious future. 


The revolutionary system is called the Global Consciousness Project and its a revolutionary results acquired after more than 50 years of extensive studies.

Experts strategically positioned electronic circuits around the globe which act as ‘coin flippers’ but instead of coins being flipped, the flip bits – digital bits.

In the experiment, scientists characterized ‘heads’ as being 1s and ‘tails’ as being 0s. The system generates random sequences of 1s and 0s.

So what did scientists actually do? To get the system starting, scientists asked people to focus their mind so the system could generate more 1’s. Results showed that ‘somehow’ aft the end of the study, the system registered spikes in the random number generator RNG which came up with more 1s than 0s.

After years of tests and studies, experts discovered there were biases showing in the randomness. The system that should behave ‘randomly’ no longer behaved so when people interact mentally with them.

These fascinating results –which many people find impossible— gave scientists an idea to create so-called RNG eggs around the globe. These ‘devices constantly work and acquire data.

So far there are around 60 of these ‘devices, aka eggs.’ They are located all around the globe: Europe, the US, Canada, India, Fiji, New Zealand, Japan, China, Russia, Brazil, Africa, Thailand, South America, and Australia.

That’s fascinating but how does it work? Ok, so you have these RNG ‘eggs’ which are basically like receivers. Imagine each egg is flipping a coin and trying to guess the outcome. Every time it guesses correctly, it’s interpreted as a ‘hit.’ The ‘eggs’ can do this 100 times every second.

Experts behind the Global Consciousness Project found that they obtain a large number of hits, more than what can be attributed to pure chance, which coincides with MASSIVE global events.

According to reports, hours before tragedy struck the United States and the first place crashed into the WTC on 9/11, researchers noticed huge spikes in the number of registered hits. Apparently, this anomaly was first noticed then Princess Diana died.

These spikes would appear around different noteworthy global events.

After 20 years of tracking these events, expert’s realized that the results were far above random and that they were onto something.


Reports indicate that over the 426 pre-determined events measured in the entirety of the project, the recorded probability of a hit was greater than 1 in 2. In fact, the probability is one in a trillion that the effect is due to chance.

Many people believe that these results are the ultimate evidence that some sort of collective, entity or consciousness exists on planet Earth.

Today, the Global Consciousness projects is an international multidisciplinary collaboration of scientists and experts in different fields. They monitor and collect data from a global network of random number generators around the planet.

A mobile app has been created which can notify you when there is a spike somewhere near you, or on a global scale.

The mobile apps can also be used to track the activity of RNG around the globe.

Dean Radin, a scientist that participates in the project explains in the video below:

18701,Feminism Has Lost The Minds Of Young Women,"Home This Month Popular Feminism Has Lost The Minds Of Young Women Feminism Has Lost The Minds Of Young Women Maximus Decimus Meridius 
Maximus is a Man, capital M, period. Love. Truth. Justice. Liberty. Respect. These are the lodestones pointing true to magnetic masculinity in a polarized feminist west. His goal for writing on ROK is to be the gadfly that provokes thought and counters groupthink. October 29, 2016 The Sexes 
The idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west. One would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the man-o-sphere, and to a great degree it is. But truly, the root of feminism’s death was in Man, capital M, from the very beginning. One look at Conan is all a man needs to know this truth. 
Feminism is dead. The movement is absolutely dead. 
The women’s movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long. There’s no room for dissent. It’s just like Mean Girls. 
If they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction. My wing of feminism—the pro-sex wing—was silenced. I was practically lynched for endorsing The Rolling Stones. Susan Faludi is still saying I’m not a feminist. Who made her pope? 
Feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women. You can’t talk to them about anything. 
~ Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture for MacLeans.ca 
Neurotic women indeed. 
Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars/Prison Planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of 2014. But he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion. Feminists did not just lose the debate, they lost the war. 
The feminist attempt to demonize normal male/female behaviour in public— men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation —backfired in less than a month. 
When you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as Princess Leia, the QUEEN of 70’s patriarchal sexist ‘misogyny’, to ridicule feminists, you have lost the war for hearts and minds. 
And when I say hearts and minds… I mean the silent majority of young women who want NOTHING to do with feminism. 
Leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys. So too will jawas, Darth Vader and even Yoda apparently, that sly dude. Who knew? 
And that’s a good thing! Men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship. Feminists may hate this, but the vast majority of women still prefer, and expect, the man to take the initiative to get the girl. This is how men and women were created and evolved, you can’t fight Darwin and God and come out on top. 
This video shows that the majority of NORMAL women LOVE male attention. They WANT men to look at them. They WANT men to notice them. Why? 
THEY WANT A MAN!!! 
I realized this is the case when I decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism . 
This image from the Women Against Feminism Tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism. This woman was raped. She is not running around spreading lies like the UVA RAPE HOAX story that Rolling Stone ran and had to retract . She justs wants to go back to living a normal life. She does not want to be angry at ALL men for the crime of ONE of them. She does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge. She does not want to be a victim. Feminists have lost the female youth of Millenials, the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the 21st century. 
I understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that Millenial men have become vocal, blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of ‘women’ it has reared . The problem with this type of knee-jerk reaction is just that—you’re being a jerk. Yes, far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore. But, that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them. 
Young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence (an illusion) easier for them to choose, but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society. 
Case in point. 
I met a wonderful young Russian blonde a little while back. Twenty-three. Tight. Feminine. So freaking perfect. We hit it off immediately on first contact. Having myself only traveled outside the west twice, I still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time I do, I am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls. As I conversed with this well educated and refined young Russian lady, she told me she was attending university and so naturally, I asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home. 
Her answer was revealing… Boys? They completely ignore the girls. Don’t even look at them. Just walk on by. 
This really surprised her. Being a feminine Russian girl who expects men to look at women, this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her. 
Men, young boys, in their prime 20s, completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day. 
According to Wikipedia, women against feminism started on Tumblr in 2013 . I see #WomenAgainstFeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society. It is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage. All you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship, one with love and respect . I don’t think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is. 
As men, we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting, but offensive opinions. The very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism, and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate, is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into ape-shit, mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left . Here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a ‘generational’ adjustment.",0

The Great Climate Change Bamboozle 
“The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.” H. L. Mencken 
Earth’s carbon cycle contains 46,713 Gt (E15 gr) +/- 850 Gt (+/- 1.8%) of stores and reservoirs with a couple hundred fluxes Gt/y (+/- ??) flowing among those reservoirs. Mankind’s gross contribution over 260 years was 555 Gt or 1.2%. (IPCC AR5 Fig 6.1) Mankind’s net contribution, 240 Gt or 0.53%, (dry labbed by IPCC to make the numbers work) to this bubbling, churning caldron of carbon/carbon dioxide is 4 Gt/y +/- 96%. (IPCC AR5 Table 6.1) Seems relatively trivial to me. IPCC et. al. says natural variations can’t explain the increase in CO2. With these tiny percentages and high levels of uncertainty how would anybody even know? 
Mankind’s modelled additional atmospheric CO2 power flux (W/m^2, watt is power, energy over time) between 1750 and 2011, 261 years, is 2 W/m^2 of radiative forcing. (IPCC AR5 Fig SPM.5) Incoming solar RF is 340 W/m^2, albedo reflects 100 W/m^2 (+/- 30 & can’t be part of the 333), 160 W/m^2 reaches the surface (can’t be part of the 333), latent heat from the water cycle’s evaporation is 88 W/m2 (+/- 8). Mankind’s 2 W/m^2 contribution is obviously trivial, lost in the natural fluctuations. 
One popular GHE theory power flux balance (“Atmospheric Moisture…. Trenberth et al 2011jcli24 Figure 10) has a spontaneous perpetual loop (333 W/m^2) flowing from cold to hot violating three fundamental thermodynamic laws. (1. Spontaneous energy out of nowhere, 2. perpetual loop w/o work, 3. cold to hot w/o work, 4. doesn’t matter because what’s in the system stays in the system) Physics must be optional for “climate” science. What really counts is the net W/m^2 balance at ToA which 7 out of 8 re-analyses included in the above cited paper concluded the atmosphere was cooling, not warming (+/- 12.3 W/m^2). Of course Dr. Trenberth says they are wrong because their cooling results are not confirmed by his predicted warming, which hasn’t happened for twenty years. (“All of the net TOA imbalances are not tenable and all except CFSR imply a cooling of the planet that clearly has not occurred.”) 
Every year the pause/hiatus/lull/stasis continues (IPCC AR5 Box TS.3) IPCC’s atmospheric and ocean general circulation models diverge further from reality. 
As Carl Sagan observed, we have been bamboozled, hustled, conned by those wishing to steal our money and rob us of our liberties. Hardly a new agenda. 
BTW I have a BSME same as Bill Nye so I’m as much a scientist as he is.",0
18703,"The Moldovan election, seen from Italy: ""Moldova turns toward Moscow with the Socialists of Dodon""","November 18, 2016 - Fort Russ News - 

- Enrico VIGNA in  Opinione Pubblica , translated from Italian by Tom Winter - 

The election of Igor Dodon follows upon decades of the robbery and systematic looting of the country by politicians and related parties, financed and protected by  

the West,  the International Monetary Fund,  the World Bank,  the EU and  NATO,  
which have made the country Europe's poorest; in fact, according to an IMF study, per capita income in Moldova at constant purchasing power is $ 5,006. This is a figure referring to those who physically live in the country, disregarding those who have emigrated to the West.  

Even a UNDP report (United Nations Development Program), has determined that 8.1% of the population lives below the international poverty line of $ 1.25 a day (2000-2007); but 48.5% live below the so-called national poverty line.  

Moldova is a country located between Ukraine and Romania with population of 3.6 million, of whom more than half live abroad. Its official language is Romanian, but a large part speaks Russian.  

Moldova is considered one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, preceded only by Georgia, located at 103rd position in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 of Transparency International.  

On November 13 there was the second round of presidential elections, where the candidate of the Socialist Party of the Republic of Moldova prevailed with 52.18% of the total, but in Moldova without the foreign votes, the figure is 75%.  

This is despite the whole set of the ""big powers"" system: parties, apparatus, media and pro-Western NGOs that have made every effort and financial investment, electoral sabotage, blackmail, pressure and threats in the press and the media, which are completely in the hands of pro-Western rulers.  

An example reported by the electoral bloc for the Socialist candidate Dodon is that while in the West the Moldovan government set up hundreds of polling places to allow their emigrants to vote, (overwhelmingly supporters of the West as they became rich and culturally westernized, no need to comment further), in the first round in Italy 80% had voted for the American Sandu and 7% for Dodon!  

BUT, in Russia and in other countries where the migrant workers do not recognize the West as a model or solution, the government reduced polling places to a minimum: just think that in a city like Moscow, where more than 700,000 Moldovan emigrants live and work, the government only put up three polling places. 

On the ballot were Igor Dodon, a lawyer and economist, until 2011 leader of Moldovan communists, who then joined the Socialist Party, of which he is currently president; and Maia Sandu, former education minister from 2012 to 2015, of the corrupt governments of Filat, who is currently in jail.  

She represents the Action and Solidarity Party, supported by the US and EU; she graduated in the United States where she lived from 1989 to 1994, served as an official of the World Bank, protected by the Soros Foundation.  

Igor Dodon is a man who comes from the people, the father of three sons, the person who founded the Charity Foundation ""Solution,"" which, in all the years of its existence has helped tens of thousands of people; who organized and leads the patriotic campaign ""I love Moldova,"" which managed hundreds of actions at national level supporting the Moldovan identity and the defense of Orthodoxy as the spiritual heritage of the people.  

The clash between the candidates was very deep and went beyond the exclusively Moldovan reality. Rather it involves a change of balance with geopolitical meanings, which could give a strong blow to the Western hegemonic and imperialist aims: just think of the internal problem of Transnistria, the hitherto close relationship between the coup leaders in Ukrainian Kiev and the pro-europeen forces of Chisinau, the position towards the Donbass Popular Republics, Belarus, South Ossetia and especially the position of rejecting NATO.  

Yes this a sensitive issue and a harbinger of strategic upheavals; in addition to the rejection of reunification with (in fact as a submission to) Romania, Ms Sandu supported the Association and Free Trade with the European Union Agreement ratified in 2014, which is now part of the DCFTA (Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Dodon instead proposed and supported Moldova's entry into the Eurasian Economic Union with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, and supported trying for closer relations and investment with China. 


The Dodon victory is based 90% on the population that lives out the devastated social reality produced during thirty years of robbery and wild privatization, namely the workers and the poorest peasants, regional minorities such as the Gagauz, the Bessarabi and the Russians; by the hundreds of thousands of migrants in Russia; and even the Orthodox Church supports the change.  

The pro-European candidate was driven primarily by the inhabitants of the capital Chisinau, by profiteers who settled in the state and public offices, through corruption and political favoritism, and especially by the emigrants in the West.  

Now, it is a matter of waiting for the excellent election platform to be applied into Moldovan reality, and above all the next steps, including calling new elections.  

One thing is certain: the programs hitherto adopted resulted in impoverishment and social devastation, products of Western policies in the former Soviet countries, but they have found they here an unexpected setback, and the Moldovan people, like others in the realities of Eastern Europe, are taking charge of their destiny.   

Hope finds a seedling to nurture and strengthen. In any case it is a disturbing signal for the aims of Western expansion and domination, and especially the military ones and oppression by NATO.

18705,America’s Most Popular ‘Legal’ Drug is Responsible for 25% of ALL Cancer,"Home / Health / America’s Most Popular ‘Legal’ Drug is Responsible for 25% of ALL Cancer America’s Most Popular ‘Legal’ Drug is Responsible for 25% of ALL Cancer John Vibes October 29, 2016 Leave a comment 
There are many factors contributing to the massive rise in cancer cases in the US, but according to a new study from the American Cancer Society, cigarette smoke is by far the leading cause. The study found that roughly 25% of all cancer deaths could be attributed to cigarette smoking. 
Although cigarette smoking has waned somewhat in recent years, nearly 40 million adults in the U.S. currently smoke cigarettes. The CDC says cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S., responsible for more than 480,000 deaths annually. 
According to the study : 
We estimate that at least 167 133 cancer deaths in the United States in 2014 (28.6% of all cancer deaths; 95% CI, 28.2%-28.8%) were attributable to cigarette smoking. Among men, the proportion of cancer deaths attributable to smoking ranged from a low of 21.8% in Utah (95% CI, 19.9%-23.5%) to a high of 39.5% in Arkansas (95% CI, 36.9%-41.7%), but was at least 30% in every state except Utah. Among women, the proportion ranged from 11.1% in Utah (95% CI, 9.6%-12.3%) to 29.0% in Kentucky (95% CI, 27.2%-30.7%) and was at least 20% in all states except Utah, California, and Hawaii. Nine of the top 10 ranked states for men and 6 of the top 10 ranked states for women were located in the South. In men, smoking explained nearly 40% of cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Kentucky). In women, smoking explained more than 26% of all cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states, which included 3 Southern states (Kentucky, Arkansas, and Tennessee), and 2 Western states (Alaska and Nevada). 
Smoking is one of the leading causes of illness and death in the world. The use of tobacco has become more widespread than ever and the substance itself is far more dangerous than it has ever been before. 
Today, cigarettes are mass produced and treated with thousands of additives and chemicals. Carcinogenic, poisonous chemicals and toxic metals can all be found in modern tobacco products. These chemicals are present for many reasons ranging from taste and preservation to being purposely addictive. There are over 4000 of these chemicals in cigarettes and all of them are not revealed to the public. They are protected under law as “trade secrets” — meaning they can add anything they want in there without our knowledge. 
The financial advantage alone should be enough of an argument to quit smoking. In most states, cigarettes are now over 6 dollars a pack, more than half of which is taxes. So people are literally paying the government and rich multinational corporations an average of 10 dollars every day, for a product that destroys their bodies. It is true that there are addictive chemicals in cigarettes but their strength and power has been blown way out of proportion. 
The psychological addiction is always much stronger than the physical addiction even with harsh narcotics like heroin and especially with nicotine. All you have to do is stop and get through a few days without it. Soon enough the smell and taste will no longer be desirable to you and you will be happy to have that extra 6 dollars a pack in your pocket. It will be easier to breathe, you won’t get sick as often and you will overall be in better spirits. Quitting cigarettes is one decision that you can make that will drastically improve your life in a number of ways and it will give the elite less control of your money and your health.

18706,These Blast Points on Hillary’s Campaign… Only The Deep State Is So Precise,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith 
Back in August, I asked Could the Deep State Be Sabotaging Hillary? I think we now have a definitive answer: “These blast points on Hillary’s campaign… too accurate for the Mainstream Media. Only the forces of the Imperial Deep State are so precise.” 
The Mainstream Media is presenting the FBI investigation as a “lose-lose” situation for embattled FBI Director Comey. If Comey remained quiet until after the election, he would be accused of colluding with the Clinton campaign and its allies in the Department of Justice (sic). 
But in going public, he stands accused by Democrats of “intervening in an election,” i.e. raising doubts about Hillary’s judgement and veracity days before Americans go to the polls. 
Another narrative has Comey’s hand forced by the threat of disgusted FBI agents leaking information that would show the FBI caved into political pressure from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign to keep relevant material out of the public eye until after the election. 
I submit another much more powerful dynamic is in play: the upper ranks of the Deep State now view Hillary as an unacceptable liability. The word came down to Comey to act whether he wanted to or not, i.e. take one for the good of the nation/Deep State/Imperial Project. 
As a refresher: the Deep State is the unelected government (also called the invisible or shadow government) that is not as monolithic as generally assumed. 
The neo-conservative globalists who want Hillary to continue pushing their agenda are the more visible camp, but another less visible but highly motivated camp realizes Hillary and her neo-con agenda would severely damage the nation’s security and its global influence. It is this camp that is arranging for Hillary to lose. 
The consensus view seems to be that the Establishment and the Deep State see Trump as a loose cannon who might upset the neo-con apple cart by refusing to toe the neo-con line. 
This view overlooks the reality that significant segments of the Deep State view the neo-con strategy as an irredeemable failure. To these elements of the Deep State, Hillary is a threat precisely because she embraces the failed neo-con strategy and those who cling to it. From this point of view, Hillary as president would be an unmitigated disaster for the Deep State and the nation/Imperial Project it governs. 
Whatever else emerges from the emails being leaked or officially released, one conclusion is inescapable: Hillary’s judgement is hopelessly flawed. Combine her lack of judgement with her 24 years of accumulated baggage and her potential to push the neo-con agenda to the point of global disaster, and you get a potent need for the Deep State’s most prescient elements to derail her campaign and clear a path to Trump’s executive team. 
Once this path is clear, the management of Trump’s executive team can begin in earnest, a management process aimed at disengaging the nation and its global Empire from neo-con overreach. 
If you think this scenario is “impossible,” let’s see how the election plays out before deciding what’s “impossible” and what’s inevitable.",0

18708,How Did G.M. Create Tesla’s Dream Car First? - The New York Times,"ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich.  —   Ten years ago, a   tech entrepreneur named Elon Musk published a secret master plan for Tesla Motors, an ambitious electric car   he had funded. Revolutionary technologies always start as impractical and expensive, Mr. Musk explained, so Tesla’s first car would be a   roadster that sold for $110, 000. But by plowing profits from that car into research and production capacity, Mr. Musk promised that Tesla would quickly create a series of cheaper cars in higher volumes, all toward an almost mythical aim: creating a   electric car that could travel more than 200 miles on a single charge, but that cost less than $40, 000 for the privilege. This year, Mr. Musk’s white whale  —   a car that will get 238 miles per charge, and will sell for about $30, 000 after a federal rebate  —   will finally make it to the roads. Mr. Musk’s master plan has gone exactly as he promised, except for one tiny hitch. A first affordable   electric car, which I drove last month and which blew my mind, is not a Tesla. I had to fly from Silicon Valley to Detroit to drive it because the vehicle was invented not by a celebrated   but by that hoariest cliché of tarnished American manufacturing glory, Chevrolet, which is owned by General Motors. The car is the Chevy Bolt EV, a squat,   compact hatchback. It is an important car for G. M. and, in a larger sense, for the traditional auto industry. It demonstrates the seriousness with which automakers are taking the threat posed by   that are promising to alter everything about the car business. Not only is the Bolt the first inexpensive   electric on the road, but it will also function as G. M.’s platform for testing new models for   and autonomous driving. The Bolt is also proof that, in the car industry, size matters  —   that even if they may be slow to come around to the latest tech, big automakers can alter the car business even more radically than Tesla has, purely as a function of their bigness. Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, has made a habit of embarrassing his naysayers, but there are increasing signs that his little     is nearing the limits of its potential. This spring, Tesla unveiled its own   car, the Model 3, which will sell for just under $30, 000 after a rebate, and will go 215 miles on a charge, which is less than the Bolt. About 400, 000 people have paid $1, 000 to get on the waiting list for the vehicle, which Tesla says will begin shipping to customers in late 2017. But few industry analysts think Tesla will meet its production goals, and the very fact that there is a waiting list highlights its fundamental hardship. Tesla paved the way for the broad acceptability of electrics, but the Model 3 is, at this point, merely a concept car. G. M.’s Bolt goes on sale this year, and the company will probably be able to make enough to satisfy everyone who wants one. It’s a delicious irony: Cocky billionaire makes grand promises in a blog post. Ten years later, he gets his wish, in the worst way. Before we get to the Bolt’s implications, let me describe the car. Most of the   fully electric cars on the road today  —   vehicles like the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3 or Volkswagen    —   are afflicted with a problem that is a nonstarter for many Americans. They get, at most, around 100 miles per charge. That is enough for a lot of people to get to work and back, but not enough to let them feel entirely comfortable about it. At the other end of the spectrum are Tesla’s luxury rides, the Model S and Model X, which each get more than 200 miles per charge, enough to put to rest any range anxiety. But relief comes at a cost. After federal rebates, the S starts at $66, 000, and the X starts at $74, 000. The Bolt isn’t a luxury car. It’s surprisingly spacious inside (it could easily accommodate two car seats for my children) and has a nicely designed   infotainment panel. But it looks and largely drives like a generic compact car. What is revolutionary about the Bolt is that it bridges category distinctions  —   it brings luxury car electric range at   prices. In fact, it beats the luxuries. In their cheapest configurations, every Tesla gets a lower range than the Bolt. “Normally for electric vehicles we talk about going from point A to point B and back to A,” said Darin Gesse, G. M.’s product manager for the Bolt. “This car is designed to go from A to B to C to D and back to A, so it has more of a lifestyle focus, and it’s not just a commuter car. ” How did G. M. create Tesla’s dream car first? There is a lot to it, as I saw on a tour of the company’s Bolt operations. G. M. started building one of the world’s most advanced battery testing facilities in 2008, around the time the company faced imminent death after the financial crisis. The car that emerged out of that research, the   hybrid Chevy Volt, can be said to have literally saved the company. The Volt was frequently held up as evidence of G. M.’s creativity by politicians who favored a bailout of Detroit. President Obama, who led the successful rescue, said in 2012 that he would buy a Volt after he left office. Most of G. M.’s advantages come down to size and operational efficiency. Tesla has had to build a huge factory to produce the Model 3’s batteries at scale. G. M. batteries are being outsourced to the electronics giant LG Chem. Tesla has had to retool a   facility in Fremont, Calif. for its own purposes, while G. M. is tapping into its existing production system. At the company’s Orion Assembly plant outside of Detroit, I saw Bolts on the same line as   Chevy Sonics and Buick Veranos. Robots and workers seamlessly shifted between the Bolt and more traditional cars as if nothing was different. Finally, G. M. enjoys the regulatory advantage of producing a fleet. Because the     Bolt helps the company stay under the federal government’s   standards, it perversely allows G. M. to keep selling more profitable,   cars, like the Tahoe S. U. V. As a result, G. M. could lose money on each Bolt and still find the overall project valuable to its bottom line. Can Tesla compete with these advantages? Tesla fanboys (they exist) might point out that the Model 3 will have some luxury appointments that the Bolt lacks, including the option to upgrade to Tesla’s semiautonomous driving system, and access to the company’s network of   stations. Tesla also has brand cachet and exclusivity that elude Chevy. And when its battery factory is running at scale, it should be able to produce batteries at a lower price, bumping up its profitability. Tesla declined to comment for this article, but analysts I spoke to are skeptical of its plans. One question is whether Tesla will hit its production goals. The company made about 50, 000 cars in 2015, and it is on track to produce about 82, 000 this year, despite some recent setbacks. Though Tesla has frequently missed Mr. Musk’s targets, he has again promised big production increases in the coming years. Tesla is aiming to make 100, 000 to 200, 000 cars in 2017, and 500, 000 in 2018. But the company is running out of cash, and investors have been miffed by Mr. Musk’s hasty plan to buy out his solar panel company, SolarCity. Another worry is that Tesla will hit its production targets, but only by skimping on quality. Over the last few decades, in a project first started by Toyota, global car manufacturers have greatly reduced defects using production systems that let workers slow down the line when they spot mistakes. Edward Niedermeyer, an analyst who edits the industry site Daily Kanban, said Tesla has departed from those methods to speed up its line. As a result, its cars have been afflicted by poor reliability. Last year, Consumer Reports stopped recommending the Model S after a survey showed that customers’ cars were plagued by squeaks, rattles, leaks and various other problems. “If you don’t have quality right, you start building cars really quickly, and then a defect happens, and you can’t stop yourself from producing hundreds or thousands of defective vehicles,” Mr. Niedermeyer said. G. M. has of course had its own share of defects. But its history of building a lot of cars mostly well may be a   over a quickly growing  . “We have 108 years of manufacturing ” Pam Fletcher, G. M.’s chief electric vehicles engineer, told me. “This is what we do. ”",0

18710,"Paolo Gentiloni, Italy’s Foreign Minister, Will Try to Form a New Government - The New York Times","ROME  —   Italy’s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, accepted a presidential mandate on Sunday to try to form a new government, hoping to lead Italy out of a political crisis that ensued with the resignation of Matteo Renzi as prime minister. Mr. Renzi stepped down last week after the defeat of a referendum on constitutional changes that he had hoped would streamline Italy’s government. He staked his seat on the outcome, and failed. In a brief speech on Sunday, Mr. Gentiloni, 62, said he had accepted the challenge of forming a new government out of a “sense of responsibility. ” “I’m aware of the urgency to give Italy a government in the fullness of its powers, to reassure the citizens and to face with utmost commitment and determination international, economic and social priorities, starting with the reconstruction of the   areas,” Mr. Gentiloni said. In coming days, Mr. Gentiloni is expected to form a government using the same majority, led by the   Democratic Party, as his predecessor, and to then face a confidence vote before Parliament, perhaps as early as Tuesday. His cabinet is likely to resemble that of Mr. Renzi, with whom he has had a close relationship. For those reasons, the opposition,   Five Star Movement has already called Mr. Gentiloni “Renzi’s avatar. ” Mr. Gentiloni, a journalist, has long worked in   parties. A communications minister in Romano Prodi’s government until 2008, he has been in charge of Italy’s foreign affairs for two years. He has advocated international support to stop violence in Libya and help for migrants who gather on those shores before risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean. This year, he lobbied with the Egyptian government to find out who was responsible for the death of a young Italian researcher in Cairo. In his brief speech on Sunday, Mr. Gentiloni said he would work to clarify Italy’s new electoral rules “with the necessary promptness. ” Disputes over the laws are a central obstacle to the country’s holding a new election. In late January, Italy’s Constitutional Court is scheduled to issue a   verdict on the current system, which may face an overhaul. Most of the opposition parties are calling for elections soon after, a year ahead of the due date in spring 2018. But Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, noted at the end of his consultations with Italy’s political leaders that the Democratic Party still held a parliamentary majority. The decision whether and when to call elections, then, will rest in the hands of Mr. Mattarella. Mr. Renzi has all but vanished from Italy’s political scene. Soon after moving boxes of “books, clothes and notes” out of Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister’s residence, Mr. Renzi repeated that he had kept his promise to step aside if he lost the referendum, writing in a long Facebook post from his hometown in Tuscany. He also pledged to try again to reunite the country. “Only those who change can help a country as beautiful and difficult as Italy,” he said, acknowledging his mistakes.",0
18711,Mets Overcome a Season of Adversity and Claim a Wild-Card Berth - The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Mets Manager Terry Collins was in the middle of a television interview near the entrance to the visitors’ clubhouse at Citizens Bank Park when Jose Reyes dumped beer on his boss’s head. “Thank you for bringing me back, man,” Reyes said, hugging Collins. Reyes was not on the Mets’ roster when the season began. Neither was James Loney, nor Jay Bruce nor T. J. Rivera nor Seth Lugo nor Robert Gsellman. Saturday’s starter, Bartolo Colon, was supposed to have been in the bullpen by now. Up and down that battered and patchwork roster, the Mets looked distinctly different from the team that won the National League East and reached the World Series last season. Yet there they were on Saturday afternoon after a   win over the Philadelphia Phillies, celebrating a return to the postseason that seemed improbable six weeks ago. “This year was harder for us to get in, even if it is to play only one game,” Colon said, his shirt wet with beer and Champagne. With the victory, the Mets secured the top N. L.   spot they will host a     game on Wednesday at Citi Field against either the St. Louis Cardinals or the San Francisco Giants. It is only the second time in the Mets’   history that they have reached the playoffs for a second consecutive season. To secure their berth, the Mets required 46 players, 87 wins, eight months and countless visits to the training room. By winning on the penultimate day of the regular season, the Mets can save their best starter, Noah Syndergaard, who was originally scheduled to start on Sunday, for their biggest game of the year. “It’s like every little kid’s dream come true to pitch in a   game,” Syndergaard said. “I’ll embrace it, and I look forward to it. ” Colon allowed two runs but provided five solid innings on Saturday. The bullpen, as it has often done during the   surge, completed the win. Loney smashed a     homer in the sixth and then dropped his bat and pointed to the Mets’ dugout in glee. “You don’t script that,” said Loney, whom the Mets plucked from the San Diego Padres’ AAA affiliate in late May to fill the void left by an injury to first baseman Lucas Duda. “Your body just takes over. Those are the moments you dream of. ” Having to play a    game after a World Series appearance may seem disappointing, but not to a team that sustained so many significant injuries. “A huge accomplishment,” said catcher Travis d’Arnaud, one of seven players from the Mets’ opening day lineup who spent time on the disabled list. The starting rotation, the backbone of the Mets last season, was hit the hardest. Zack Wheeler, who was supposed to have replaced Colon in the rotation, never joined the Mets in the season’s second half, as planned, because of setbacks in his rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery. Matt Harvey has not pitched since July 4. Jacob deGrom has not pitched since Sept. 1, and Steven Matz, who will have surgery next week, has not pitched since Aug. 14. “Surprisingly, our greatest strength was deeper than we even expected that strength to have been,” Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said. In the far corner of the clubhouse, Gsellman and Lugo, the unheralded prospects who saved the rotation, posed together for a photo amid the revelry. Gsellman started the season at Class AA Binghamton. Lugo posted unimpressive numbers in Class AAA, and some scouts doubted that he would ever reach the majors. Yet as deGrom and Matz succumbed to   injuries, Lugo and Gsellman impressed everyone with their poise and their pitching. The Mets went   in games they started. “There are no words to describe this feeling,” Gsellman said. “This is the first step to the playoffs. Hopefully, this is not our last time. ” The Mets were also missing second baseman Neil Walker, who has been out since Aug. 27, and the team’s captain, third baseman David Wright, who has not played since May 27. He was replaced by Reyes, who was released by the Colorado Rockies after serving a domestic violence suspension and was given a second chance by the Mets. Many players pointed to Reyes’s energy as a catalyst. But so were the returns of Asdrubal Cabrera and Yoenis Cespedes from injuries on Aug. 19. That day, the Mets lost to the Giants in San Francisco and fell to  . They sat five and a half games out of the second   spot. A feeling grew within the clubhouse that this was a doomed season. But behind Cabrera, Cespedes and Reyes, the Mets started a hot streak. The   offense improved. Cabrera persevered despite a balky left knee. “It wasn’t easy,” Cabrera said. “I gave my 100 percent  —   actually my 200 percent  —   to help the team win. ” Since the season’s low point in San Francisco, the Mets have been the best team in the majors, going   thanks in part to a soft September schedule. “It’s great to see the team this year accomplish as much as it did with as many obstacles placed in its path,” Alderson said. Roster moves throughout the season paid off. Although Bruce struggled for more than a month after the Mets acquired him in a trade on Aug. 1, he caught fire at the plate in late September. The already dominant relievers Addison Reed and Jeurys Familia received help from Fernando Salas, also acquired by trade. “Sandy deserves so much credit,” Collins said. “He took a chance on Jose Reyes when nobody else would. He brought kids up from the minor leagues and stuck them in the rotation. He’s not afraid. ” As the celebration in the clubhouse died down, Alderson and the assistant general manager John Ricco sat in Collins’s office to talk. The preparation for Wednesday’s game had begun.",0

This window begins and ends with what is known as a ‘Void Of Course’ (VOC) moon. This is when the moon is ‘between signs’; these are periods of immense occult importance, as the the anecdotes in the first link below demonstrate: 
http://www.astrologybyjudithryan.com/void-of-course-calendar-2016 
The second link helps to literally ‘fill in the gap’ regarding the second VOC which occurs as the calendar transitions from October to November on both sides of the Atlantic. Hence, this second VOC period crosses months and is not explicitly identified in either link. 
This period is often described in many cultures as a time when the separation between the physical and non-physical realms is much thinner. Hence, this is also time each year when light & dark forces do battle. This represents a key moment for us to reassert control of the plasma plane within the Solar System via a spoken declaration of our free will. The instructions are quite simple: 

1) Face – as closely as possible – toward the general direction of the Sun, Moon, Galactic Central Sun, and the important light stronghold of Antares during all three meditations. A general rule of thumb is to direct your gaze a bit to the left of where the sun is (or would be if you could see it through either clouds or the ground below) at all three key meditation times. 
Note – if it is not possible to face the direction of the Sun/Moon/GC/Antares, please focus your intention instead on the first image of the woman at the beginning of this article; this picture can inspire each of us to reach toward the goddess energies of the Galactic Central Sun – beckoning them to come quickly into our Solar System. 
2) Follow the regular ‘Ascension Meditation’ instructions at three separate times: 
A. 4 PM GMT Friday, October 28 (during the first VOC period) 
B. 4 PM GMT Sunday, October 30 (the actual day of the Scorpio New Moon) 
C. 3 AM GMT Tuesday, November 1 (during the second VOA period) 
For those seeking a refresher, the instructions can be found at the first link below, and an English-language guided-meditation audio can be found at the second link below (A “P.S.” statement regarding the guided meditation audio can be found at the end of this article): 
http://recreatingbalance1.blogspot.com/2016/09/weekly-ascension-meditation-guided-audio.html 
3) Speak the words below aloud after the end of the guided meditation audio – note that you will be speaking these words with no other sounds – just your true voice expressing your free will: 
We, the awakened starseeds of Gaia, announce our readiness for the pulse of Goddess energies from the Galactic Central Sun to bring an end to spiritual duality. 
We declare our desire for a peaceful transition to the Golden Age and a speedy end to this final galactic war in our solar system – for peace, abundance, and happiness to be present throughout our solar system forever more. 
We demand an end to any further delays to the Event: that all remaining secrets of the dark forces be made known immediately, that all dark rituals from this day forward be rendered ineffective, and that all tactical advantages which are used to maintain Quarantine Earth be nullified so that the Ascension of Gaia and her inhabitants can commence. 
It is our free will that the effects of biochips, implants, and scalar interference cease completely so that our fellow Lightworker & Lightwarrior Starseeds fully awaken to their respective missions and assist in leading the way into the Golden Age. 
The time for our freedom is now. We use the energies of this Scorpio New Moon to announce our desire for liberation, abundance and First Contact. 
Let the Goddess finally bring peace to Earth and the galaxy. 
So be it, and so it is. 
We demand peace. We demand the Event. Let us make our free will known throughout the cosmos. 
Victory of the Light! 
P.S. The guided audio track at the “Recreating Balance” blog is highly important for many reasons. Foremost, the evolution of modern communications is such that English ends up being the most universally spoken & understood language in the world. Let all of us Lightworkers and Lightwarriors use that to our advantage… there’s a reason Cobra writes his blog posts in English. 
Additionally, the audio was recorded in 432 HZ and contains healing codes which lend energetic support and focus for the intention of the meditation.

18715,Federal Judge Upholds North Carolina Voter Rules - The New York Times,"RALEIGH, N. C.  —   A federal judge on Monday upheld sweeping   changes to election rules, including a voter identification provision, that civil rights groups say unfairly targeted   and other minorities. The ruling could have serious political repercussions in a state that is closely contested in presidential elections. The opinion, by Judge Thomas D. Schroeder of Federal District Court in   upheld the repeal of a provision that allowed people to register and vote on the same day. It also upheld a   reduction in the   period the end of preregistration, which allowed some people to sign up before their 18th birthdays and the repeal of a provision that allowed for the counting of ballots cast outside voters’ home precinct. It also left intact North Carolina’s voter identification requirement, which legislators softened last year to permit residents to cast ballots, even if they lack the required documentation, if they submit affidavits. The ruling could have significant repercussions in North Carolina, a state that Barack Obama barely won in 2008, and that the Republican Mitt Romney barely won four years later. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which sits in Richmond, Va. will be the first to consider an appeal, which the law’s opponents said they would pursue. If the Fourth Circuit or the Supreme Court does not intervene, the changes will be in force when voters go to the polls this autumn. North Carolina voters will also elect a governor in what is expected to be one of this year’s most competitive state races. The ruling is an early signal of how federal judges might regard changes and challenges to voting laws in the aftermath of a 2013 Supreme Court decision that effectively eliminated a portion of the Voting Rights Act that had forced nine states, mostly in the South, to obtain advance federal approval before changing their election laws. “North Carolina has provided legitimate state interests for its voter ID requirement and electoral system,” Judge Schroeder said near the end of his   opinion. The judge, an appointee of President George W. Bush, found that North Carolina’s system was not beyond “the mainstream of other states. ” Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, who signed the bill scaling back the voter access provisions in August 2013, welcomed the decision. He said in a statement that “this ruling further affirms that requiring a photo ID in order to vote is not only common sense, it’s constitutional. ” But critics vowed to appeal the ruling, and charged, as they often have, that the legislature sought to eliminate tools that made it easier for everyone, but particularly minority voters, to get to the polls. “By meticulously targeting measures that were most used by people of color  —   in addition to imposing a restrictive photo ID requirement  —   the legislature sought to disturb the levers of power in North Carolina, ensuring only a select few could participate in the democratic process,” Penda D. Hair,   of the Advancement Project and a critic of the law, said in a statement. “This fight is not over. ” In his ruling, the judge suggested that past discrimination had abated. “There is significant, shameful past discrimination,” he wrote. “In North Carolina’s recent history, however, certainly for the last quarter century, there is little official discrimination to consider. ” The law, which originally included a much stricter voter ID provision, was passed by the   legislature in summer 2013, shortly after the Supreme Court’s    ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. The ruling effectively eliminated what was known as the “preclearance” process, in which certain states and local governments had to submit proposed voting changes to the Justice Department or to a federal court in Washington. Judge Schroeder’s decision capped a trial court record that stretched more than 23, 000 pages and included weeks of testimony about the General Assembly’s revisions to the election laws here. The voter identification standard, which required voters to display one of six forms of documentation, was central to an overhaul that supporters described as a bulwark against fraud. But opponents of the changes said they were intended to disenfranchise black and Hispanic voters, an assertion they repeated on Monday. “Through widespread actions, rallies, marches and protests, we have said all along that we would accept no less than unabridged access to the ballot for all eligible voters,” said the Rev. William J. Barber II, the president of the North Carolina N. A. A. C. P. “Just like those who carried on before us, we will continue our movement challenging regressive and discriminatory voter suppression tactics on behalf of   Latinos, seniors, students and all those for whom democracy has been denied. ” Such comments surfaced occasionally on Monday here in the state capital, where Mr. Barber led demonstrations against the state’s new law about gay and transgender rights and, occasionally, veered into other issues that have propelled his Moral Monday movement of activism. The N. A. A. C. P. the League of Women Voters and the Justice Department were among the plaintiffs challenging the 2013 law. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Daniel T. Donovan, said he expected a higher court to block the changes from being enforced this year. “We’re disappointed in the ruling, reviewing the decision carefully and evaluating our options,” said Dena Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. The plaintiffs may have reason to be optimistic about their chances at the Fourth Circuit. In fall 2014, a   panel of the appellate court issued a preliminary injunction forcing the state to temporarily restore two ballot access provisions: one that allows   registration and another that allows for the counting of provisional ballots filed outside voters’ home precincts. The panel ruled that the elimination of those two provisions probably violated another section of the Voting Rights Act that remains intact, known as Section 2, which prohibits racially discriminatory voting rules. Judge James A. Wynn Jr. wrote at the time that there was “undisputed evidence” that those two provisions “were enacted to increase voter participation, that   voters disproportionately used those electoral mechanisms and that House Bill 589 restricted those mechanisms and thus disproportionately impacts   voters. ”",0
18716,"Finance Committee Dem Boycott Halts Votes on Mnunchin for Treasury, Price for HHS - Breitbart","The Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee withdrew from the committee’s business Tuesday, forcing the committee to delay voting on confirming Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary and Rep. Thomas E. Price (R. .) for Health and Human Services Secretary. [Leading the walkout was Sen. Ron Wyden (D. .) the committee’s ranking member, who said the extreme action was a tactic to force Mnuchin and Price to answer questions from the Democrats.  Wyden said he opposes both men for nomination. “This morning, the Finance Committee was scheduled to vote on two nominees who have misled the public and held back important information about their backgrounds,” he said. “Until questions are answered, Democrats believe the committee should not move forward with either nomination. ” Senate Finance Committee rules require at least one member of the minority party to be present for the committee to conduct official business. Wyden said he was not satisfied with the answer Price gave him regarding his stock trading. “I asked Congressman Price directly if he got an exclusive discount on stock in an Australian biomedical firm, and he said no,” the senator said. “From the committee’s investigation to company documents to the company officials’ own words, the evidence tells a different story. It looks more and more like Congressman Price got special access to a special deal. ” The Oregon senator said he was also concerned about the fullness and veracity of Mnuchin’s answers regarding his leadership at OneWest Bank. “Mr. Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank under his leadership engaged in   foreclosure documents, but that is indisputably false,” he said. “Court documents and testimony show that OneWest employees processed hundreds of documents a week, spending only seconds on each, and they routinely did so without verifying their contents,” he said. “What OneWest did is the textbook definition of shady   practices. ”   was a common practice in the middle of the last decade as the real estate boom overwhelmed the capacity of banks and other financial and real estate companies to properly review documents. Lawyers have challenged documents that were approved by   and   employees under pressure to process paperwork more quickly, which produced the   practice. Wyden said Democrats on the Finance Committee are committed to denying quorum for the committee until they have their concerns allayed and questions answered in regards to Mnuchin and Price. “The Finance Committee needs to continue following its bipartisan vetting process that has been upheld for more than 20 years,” the senator said. “This is about getting answers to questions, plain and simple. Ethics laws are not optional, and nominees do not have a right to treat disclosure like a shell game. ”",0
18717,"Exclusive Rand Paul: Repeal Now, Replace Now!  - Breitbart","  Republicans are starting to stammer, talk of delay and say we can’t repeal all of Obamacare. One GOP plan even keeps the Obamacare taxes. Another GOP plan says to blue states: “If you like Obamacare, you can keep it!” and red states will pay for it. Other GOP plans want to keep Obamacare subsidies but rename them refundable tax credits. [Conservatives need to unite behind immediate and complete repeal!  At the same time, conservatives need to rally to a plan that allows more people to buy insurance at a cheaper price. I have just such a plan, and it is gaining momentum. We should not hesitate. Repeal and Replacement should happen as soon as humanly possible. Each day, more stories appear about when to repeal, when and how to replace, and every day it seems some in my party lose their nerve. Let me be as clear as I possibly can: The time is NOW. We must keep our promises and FULLY repeal Obamacare, every bit of it. We must also at the same time offer to the American people our plan for healthcare going forward, and it must take us away from government control and toward a free market. Big Government approaches are wrong, whether they are offered by Democrats and Republicans. We must move in another direction. I’ve offered a broad, bold and free market Obamacare Replacement bill. It is available to view at paul. senate. gov, along with a summary.  My plan will ensure millions more people have access to better, less expensive health care.  First, my plan legalizes the sale of inexpensive insurance. Under Obamacare, it became illegal to sell or buy less expensive catastrophic insurance plans. Second, my plan allows people to save for insurance by expanding   Health Savings Accounts (HSA’s). My plan allows the individual to use their HSA: As more and more people spend their first dollar out of their HSA account, a marketplace will develop that makes patients cost conscious driving prices down. Third, my plan will allow every individual the freedom to join an association to buy their health insurance. For the mom and pop small business, my plan allows them to leave behind a terrible system that causes them to live in fear of becoming ill or getting cancer. Allowing individuals to join an association with hundreds of thousands of other individuals will allow them to gain leverage to get less expensive insurance and demand protections against   conditions clauses. Virtually every item in my bill has been previously introduced by Republican legislators. My bill is a consensus bill that compiles the reforms all Republicans generally agree with and leaves out controversial subjects like refundable tax credits that will create a new trillion dollar entitlement program. While it may not be everything everyone would want, it is largely everything we agree on. So let’s get it done, and then continue to work on it over the next year. So I say, Repeal Now. Replace Now. Keep our promises to those who overwhelmingly voted for change, and do it right now. As a physician, no one hates Obamacare more than I do. I ran against it. I will vote to repeal it, and I want the chance to do so very soon. But as a physician, I also know the underlying system is still broken, and simply repealing won’t fix it by itself. We need the kind of reforms I have proposed.  I spoke last week to my fellow physician, incoming HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price. He agreed with me on the need to move soon, and the need to both repeal and offer a replacement. In fact, as I pointed out to him, many of the ideas in my plan came from bills he has offered in the past as a member of Congress. So we have broad agreement. We have a mandate from the elections. We just need to have the political will to get it done. I plan to lead this charge.",0
18718,Компания Alibaba открыла вакансию кота,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как сообщает Crienglish.com, кота компания рассчитывает найти до 10 ноября. В этот день в преддверии крупнейшего в КНР торгового фестиваля состоится гала-вечер интернет-магазина Tmall (его символом является черный кот). В Alibaba рассчитывают, что животное станет объектом для новых мемов и вирусных видео, а также увеличит продажи. 
Ранее Alibaba ранее уже удалось привлечь ставших популярными в сети котов, к примеру, сердитого котика из США (Grumpy Cat), кота по кличке Анри из Франции, Мару из Японии. В должности заинтересованы Милк и Орео из Великобритании, а также китайские коты, сообщает портал. 
Напомним, компания Alibaba основана в 1999 году. В ее структуру входит десяток интернет-площадок, в том числе AliExpress, Taobao и китайское подразделение Yahoo!. 
Американские ученые пришли к выводу, что гладить кошек - опасно для здоровья. 
В ходе исследований ученые выяснили, что близкое общение с кошками опасно для человеческой жизни, сообщает РИА VladNews со ссылкой на Информинг. 
Согласно исследованиям, домашние любимцы передают своим хозяевам инфекции чаще, чем считалось ранее. Результат исследования показал, что кошачьи царапины, которые появляются в ходе общения между кошками и их хозяевами, могут привести к серьезному заболеванию - «кошачьей лихорадке». 
Ранки от кошачьих ногтей могут спровоцировать высокую температуру и даже могут стать причиной летального исхода. 
По словам специалистов, не следует заводить кошек, когда в доме есть маленькие дети, а также после общения с животными следует тщательно мыть руки. 
Специалисты-фелинологи уже полгода ведут наблюдение за хвостатыми подопытными и к 2021 году обещают объяснить, что означает вся гамма издаваемых нашими любимцами звуков. 
Исследователи в процессе опыта записывают все звуки, которые выдают 50 подопытных котов, когда они голодны, испуганы, ищут ласки или просто довольны. 
Полученные результаты анализируют и классифицируют. Уже установлено, что кошки способны изменять интонацию или мелодику осознанно, желая донести до хозяина определенную информацию, делится наблюдениями специалист в области фонетики Сусанна Шетц . Например, когда кошка просит еду, она мяукает тоньше. 
По мнению фелинологов, вербальное общение - не главное средство связи этих животных с человеком: диалог в основном идет на языке тела и запахов. Некоторые проблемы во взаимопонимании возникают еще и потому, что по сравнению с собаками, и уж тем более людьми, мурки имеют очень мало лицевых мышц. Впрочем, научившись шифровать эмоции, сами они легко считывают информацию с лиц хозяев.

If you care about the outdoors, stop him https:  .  #PruittHearing,  —   Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) January 18, 2017,  The Jimmy Kimmel Live! host’s tweet linked to a website for Washington, D. C.  environmental nonprofit American Rivers. “  Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency is someone who has fought consistently to block environmental protections,” the group’s website reads. “The American people did not vote to put the EPA in the hands of someone who has recklessly worked against its mission to protect Americans’ water. ” Pruitt, who has served as Oklahoma Attorney General since 2010, has been a relentless critic of President Obama’s climate strategy, the “Clean Power Plan,” and has sued the EPA. Pruitt attended a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Wednesday morning. Pruitt told lawmakers Wednesday that he “does not believe that climate change is a hoax. ” “I believe the ability to measure with precision the degree of human activity   …     is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or [that] human activity contributes to it,” Pruitt said.

18721,"Smile for the Phone, Creep - The New York Times","I was assaulted the other evening when I was strolling along the High Line. Maybe groped is the more physically accurate word, but given the nature of the violation and the feelings of anger and helplessness it kicked off, I can’t help considering it an assault. It happened a little after 7 p. m. on a brutally humid evening, but a promising one. I was walking home from an art opening in my favorite   dress, enjoying the deep summer scent of the gardens, thinking about going to a bar in Brooklyn that promised rowdy opera  —   horned helmets optional, the website says. Really, is there anything you can’t find in New York on a summer night? I see three teenage boys, maybe ages 13 or 14, walking in my direction. Suddenly I feel a hand shoot up my skirt and a kid grabs the outside of my thigh. There’s laughter. Then the kids run off. You know the lightning responses you see in action movies when an attack takes place? I don’t have those. I stand frozen for what seems like a long time as my brain processes what has just happened.  Huh? Was that a hand on my thigh? That hand was under my dress. I turn around to see where the creep has gone and see him and his two buddies half a block away. They aren’t running, they’re looking over the rail, scoping out the crowd. I see no police officers. Obviously I’m going to have to take justice in my own hands. “CREEP!” I yell. The kids sneer. Then I remember what the modern victim is supposed to do: Get a photo. I open the flap of my   bag unzip the phone pouch try to unlock my phone with a sweaty fingerprint  —   and fail, because wet hands mess up the ID punch in my security code swipe through the icons for the camera find it and aim. By which time the kids have, of course, disappeared. You know those assault horror stories that have exploded this summer? Women groped on subways perverts exposing themselves black drivers pulled over and terrorized by the police officers murdered by snipers. What has amazed me about these crimes is the ability of many victims or   to quickly grab their phones and get a photo. Or   the attackers on Facebook. America is a country of   artists, with apps instead of guns. But not me. I am, I realize, one of those helpless townspeople who after years of being terrorized by a gang of sneering bandits, would have to hire a gunman. Clint Eastwood, say, in a remake of “High Plains Drifter”  —   call it “High Line Drifter. ” Clint  —   I am talking the young, chiseled Clint, not the Clint who talks to chairs  —   would have known what to do with that groper. He would have gotten a photo and posted it on Twitter instantly. Then he would have sprinted after the creep and dangled him by his heels over the High Line rail, two stories over 10th Avenue  —   dangled him with one hand,   him on Periscope with the other. Clint would not be oblivious to how I look in my favorite summer dress either. “You know a good place for fried chicken?” Clint would ask me, as the kid begged for mercy. “I like fried chicken. ” Then Clint would drop the creep on 10th Avenue and there would be a public outcry and his   license would be suspended and I would still not have a boyfriend. Where was I? Oh, yeah, my inability to handle a locked and loaded cellphone. Obviously I needed to brush up on my technological skill set, which means rounding up a young person. The ones I rely on are my nieces, Caity and Freyja. They tell me which printer to get and why I should not be on Tinder. (S. T. D. s, and people don’t actually use it to find someone to have dinner with in a strange town.) I consult with Caity. She is horrified when she hears about the High Line incident and immediately gives me some   basics. “When you grab your phone, it’s probably going to be locked, but there’s a camera icon on the lower right,” she says. “You don’t need to unlock it to use the camera. Just swipe up and you’re ready to go. ” I had never noticed a pale gray camera icon on my phone it’s lost in a pale gray corner of my home screen, but when I put on my reading glasses I see it. And since sometimes there is a different screen and the camera icon does not appear, Caity shows me a bar at the bottom of the phone I can swipe upward. That brings up several icons, including the camera still in the lower right.   on Facebook takes longer on my phone. When Caity opens the app, a “Go Live” button appears on the   corner of the screen. Although I have the same phone, I have no such tab. I have to take an extra step going first to my page, then opening the “What’s On Your Mind” tab to find the “Go Live” button. I see on the web that other people are having this problem. Further research is required. But I have the basics. You know the way people practice their aim in the Westerns, shooting bottles off the fence? That’s me, metaphorically, with my phone. I’ve moved it to a more accessible pocket of my bag, and walking through Union Square, I sometimes practice my draw. Bam! Bam! Gotcha, Gandhi statue! I may not be as fast as a    but I can confidently say there’s a new sheriff in town. And if I see another creep in action, this time I will get him.",0
18722,"Tom Hayden, Courageous Warrior for Peace","License DMCA 
When Tom Hayden died on Oct. 23, we lost a courageous warrior for peace and equality. Hayden was on the front lines of nearly every major progressive struggle for more than 50 years. Vilified by the Right and at times criticized from the Left, Hayden remained steadfast in his commitment to social, economic and racial justice. 
An activist, political theorist, organizer, writer, speaker and teacher, Hayden was a Freedom Rider in the South during the 1960s; a founder of Students for a Democratic Society; a leader of the anti-Vietnam War movement; a community organizer; a negotiator of a gang truce in Venice, California; the author of more than 19 books; and an elected official in California for nearly two decades. 
""Tom made important contributions as a writer and a political leader, but his greatest strength was as a visionary strategist,"" said Bill Zimmerman, who worked with Hayden in the Indochina Peace Campaign and later managed his 1976 U.S. Senate campaign. ""Tom was able to see far over the political horizon, and was then able to create and lead political movements that were often ahead of their time. Whether it was radical opposition to war or mainstream support for candidates, progressive ballot initiatives and necessary legislation, he was a true leader, clay feet and all."" 
The Indochina Peace Campaign (IPC), founded in 1972 by Hayden and Jane Fonda, who became his wife the following year, was a traveling road show that opposed the war in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Daniel Ellsberg, whose leak of the Pentagon Papers helped to end the war, traveled with Fonda, Holly Near and others for two weeks, speaking around the clock against the war. 
According to Ellsberg, IPC was instrumental in ending the war. While some in the organization took to the road to organize opposition to the war, others lobbied Congress to cut the funding for combat operations. Although the Paris Peace Accord was signed in 1973, many, including Ellsberg, knew the war was not over. - Advertisement - 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was pressuring President Richard Nixon to restart the bombing. Congress cut the funding in 1975 and the U.S. war in Vietnam finally ended. 
""IPC was a model of grassroots activism and lobbying,"" Ellsberg said. 
Hayden was steadfast in his opposition to the Vietnam War. He made several trips to North Vietnam, calling attention to the U.S. bombing of civilians. On one trip, at the request of the North Vietnamese government, Hayden returned to the U.S. with American prisoners of war. Since the U.S. government refused to recognize the government in Hanoi, the Vietnamese would only release the prisoners to Americans in the anti-war movement. 
Advice from Dr. King 
A transformative event in Hayden's life occurred in 1960 when he was a college student. He interviewed Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on a picket line outside the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. The picket demanded that the Democratic Party include a strong commitment to civil rights in its platform. King told Hayden, ""Ultimately, you have to take a stand with your life."" - Advertisement -",0

18724,Some Liberals Say Bob Dylan Isn't 'Left Enough' For His Support of Israel and Nobel Prize Snub,"Share on Twitter 
The fury over the Nobel Prize for Literature having been awarded to music legend Bob Dylan— and his subsequent snubbing of it— has come from many sources. 
But the most surprising source may be liberals who have championed Dylan for decades as the troubadour of progressive politics— even though he's long since moved on from his folk song beginnings. Image Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for AFI 
As Chris Queen of PJ Media points out in a piece posted there Wednesday, this isn't the first time Dylan has failed to be on “the right side” of an issue— his pro-Israel stance has been irritating progressives forever. Image Credit: Koh Hasebe/Shinko Music/Getty Images 
Queen cites a recent Al-Jazeera editorial written by French sociologist and media critic Ali Saad. 
In the article, Saad takes exception with much of the media for not pointing out Dylan's pro-Israel political stance when reporting the news of his Nobel award. 
Saad writes: 
“....media outlets, both Arab and international, framed the story without taking issue with Dylan's pro-Israel stance and instead portrayed him exclusively through the prism of his constructed image as defender of the oppressed.” 
Saad also cites Dylan's early '80s song “Neighborhood Bully,” whose lyrics supposedly express support of Israel metaphorically, as proof that Dylan has held that point of view for decades. 
Naturally, since the majority of ultra-progressives tend to view Israel as an “occupying force” with an aggressive military, Saad sees it as unbecoming of an anti-war icon to pledge allegiance to such a state. Image Credit: Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images 
Of course, more than a few were simply angry over Dylan's refusal to acknowledge that he'd received the honor at all. The musician still hasn't responded to the Nobel organization's attempts to contact and congratulate him. 
As Ultimate Classic Rock writes: 
""Bob Dylan‘s decision to not acknowledge having won the Nobel Prize for Literature, unsurprisingly, isn’t sitting too well with the Swedish Academy, the body that awards the prize. Calling it 'an unprecedented situation,' an academy member has lashed out at Dylan for ignoring their attempts to contact him. 
'It’s impolite and arrogant,' Per Wastberg, a Swedish writer said on SVT public television, as reported by The Guardian. 
'Yesterday, we reported that Dylan has rebuffed every attempt by the committee to contact him, either directly or through someone described as his “closest collaborator.” He even removed the acknowledgement of the prize from his website. They are remaining optimistic that Dylan will attend the ceremony on Dec. 10, at which point he will be given an 18-carat gold medal and a check for approximately $900,000. As of now, Dylan’s current tour is scheduled to conclude on November 23."" 
But should any of it— Dylan's “Zionism,” his public indifference to having received what's considered one of the great humanitarian honors in the world— surprise anyone? 
Dylan has a long history of defying expectations, from when he abandoned folk music for electric rock 'n roll, becoming a “Judas” to millions of folk fans, to when he converted to Christianity in the '70s and wrote gospel tunes. He even famously once beat up a stalker in 1971. Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons 
It seems that the man whom poet Allen Ginsberg once called a “trickster hero” isn't someone who wants to be on anyone's team. ",0
18725,Just Another Day In the Life of the Clinton Crime Family,"

 
In the past 24 hours, some very stunning pieces of information have leaked out regarding the Clinton Crime Family. I am shocked about how pervasive the criminality is in what has been only a 24 hour news cycle.
Assange’s Lawyers Are Dead There are two lawyers who represented WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who died and their deaths were in very close proximity, only a Â mere month apart.
Assange attorney, John Jones,Â suicide was committed by the top lawyer Â when he jumped in front of a train in West Hamstead, in which the police did not even consider the possibility of foul play. The authorities, courtesy of the Clinton Foundation, found nothing suspicious about the manner of Jones’ death.
Michael Ratner made a career out of defending government whistle-blowers and detainees, something that one could argue was right inside of Assange’sÂ Â wheelhouse. Ratner’s death was shrouded in mystery. It is important to note that Ratner had actually sued three sitting US Presidents and tried to get George W. Bush impeached for lying America into the Iraq war. Certainly, when someone like Â Ratner who had begun to represent Assange, was a terrible threat to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation and had to be dealt with.
Chief Investigator for Bill Clinton’s Impeachment Trial Lives In Fear of His Life Aaron Klein, yes the same Aaron Klein who released emails, before they were purged, which demonstrated that Clinton was sending out, through her personal server the travel plans of Ambassador Stevens prior to his death at Benghazi, recently interview Dave Shippers the Chief Investigator of Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial. Shippers professed that he still lives in fear of his life.
â€œToday, I am still terrified of Hillary. Absolutely I am terrified. Because if she gets into office. In fact, Iâ€™ve told my wife, I said, â€˜If Hillary gets elected, look for the FBI or somebody to come and pick me up the next day.â€™ 
â€œAnd I think Iâ€™m the only one left. [Former Congressman] Henry Hyde is dead. [Independent Counsel Kenneth] Star didnâ€™t really hurt her. Yeah. I was scared when I was out thereâ€Ś Iâ€™ve been terrified ever since. Because things happen. Things happen.â€ 
Klein allowed his interview to drift into the area of Vince Foster’s alleged suicide which Shippers was convinced that his event was a murder designed to cover up Hillary Clinton’s criminal behavior. Shippers also mentioned the impeachment investigation, centering around Clinton lying about his affair with Monica Lewinski, uncovered evidence of at least three murders connected to Hillary Clinton. However, as Shippers stated, the investigation was limited to to the Lewinski angle. This is really ashame because of the fact that Hillary Clinton could have been stopped in the 1990’s and this nation would not, today, be fighting for its life under the threat of an extinction level event such as the specter of a Clinton Presidency.
Anthony Weiner Fears for His Life At the Hands of Hillary Clinton The perverted Congressman, who could not stop sexting grossly inappropriate images of himself to underage girls, may have unwittingly put another very large nail in the political coffin of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
According to sources , we now know that the FBI accidentally discovered that Weiner had several emails that were suspiciouslyÂ marked â€œlife insuranceâ€ Â and the FBI found that these email were directly related to the FBIâ€™s investigation of Hillary Clinton.Â Disturbingly, these same sources indicated that the sources were turned over to the FBI over Â a month ago while the FBI was still running interference for the Clinton Crime Family. It is very concerning that Comey never mentioned these damning emails.
The NYPD had the same information and they planned to leak the information despite intense pressure not to do so. This information not only shows that Anthony Weiner was in extreme fear of his life, from the Clintons, that he actually created his Julian Assange’s style of a dead man’s switch in the event of his death. I would add, that Huma may want to avoid subway trains and airplanes for awhile for her own safety. I predict that Weiner will become a star witness in either the immediate take down of Hillary, or her impeachment trial should George Soros be able to steal the election for her.
Conclusion For the good of the country, Hillary needs to step down immediately. She has made our justice system and nation, as a whole, a complete laughing stock. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who would vote for Hillary Clinton, needs to take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself what kind of person are you. How can you face your kids and claim to be a moral authority in their lives and vote for this evil monster?
This is just another day in the life of the Clinton Crime Family.

18726,Russia And NATO Engage In One Of The Largest Military Build-Ups Since The Cold War,"  
DAILY CALLER 
  330,000 Russian troops amassing along European borders. 
NATO will contribute a 4,000-strong force to bolster the defenses of its members in the Baltic states and eastern Europe. Four battle groups will be created out of forces by early next year. The battle groups will be bolstered by a 40,000-strong reaction force, and various reinforcements as needed. The plan is the fulfillment of a promise to increase the defenses of former Soviet-bloc members under threat from Russian aggression. 
“This month alone, Russia is deploying nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad and suspending a weapons-grade plutonium agreement with the United States,” said Stoltenberg Wednesday while attending a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium. The deployment of the missiles to Kaliningrad, a small Russian satellite territory located between Poland and Lithuania, puts Poland and the Baltic states directly in Russia’s sights. 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a battalion of 900 “battle-ready” soldiers will be deployed to eastern Poland as part of the new commitment. British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said his country will be sending a battalion of 800 soldiers to Estonia, in addition to a contingent of Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania. Canada plans to send 450 troops to Latvia, backed by 140 Italians. Germany will contribute 400 to 600 troops to Lithuania. 
Russia steadily built up its military presence on the European border for several months. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced a plan to recruit 30,000 additional forces to be stationed on Russia’s eastern flank in May, followed by the deployment of the Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad in early October. 
The massive military build-up represents one of the largest since the Cold War, and comes at a time when tensions between the West and Moscow at are dangerously tense.

18727,Game Is A Modern Rite Of Passage That Helps Turn Boys Into Men,"Anyone who’s been involved in the manosphere for long enough knows about the concept of a rite of passage. For tens of thousands of years, when boys hit the age of puberty, they were forced to undergo a set of challenges.
These challenges were meant to break them down, and build them back up even stronger. These challenges were meant to test them as men, and they are collectively known as an “initiation,” or as a “rite of passage.” When a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him, he became a man.
Our society, for the most part, lacks these rites of passage. This is, in large part, why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture —boys are never given a chance to develop into men. We have all of these 45 year old boyish-men running around for a reason: there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the West.
Despite this, however, I believe that learning game is a form of initiation. It contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man. It teaches boys to develop self-confidence , despite what women think of them, to become decisive and assertive, and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will.
Death Of The Ego 
One of the primary functions of a rite of passage, is that it destroys a boy’s ego. This is necessary, for in order for him to become a man, his identification with boyhood must be destroyed. In other words, he must cease to view himself as a boy, and come to view himself as a man.
This is, in a nutshell, what most of the rites of passage were designed to do—this is why many of them simulated death, in a rather belly-of-the-whale-esque fashion. One rite of passage, of the Aborigines to be specific, entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother.
When a boy would reach the age of puberty, the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him; his mother would put on a big show, screaming and fighting, to make it seem realistic. The men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods.
He would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges; he would not see a single woman for this period of time. This sudden yanking from the “mother-world,” of safety, and being thrust into the “father-world” of dangerous challenges, symbolized his death as a boy.
When the boy returned home, he would view himself as a man. He would carry himself taller, he would interact with the women differently, and he would have a new sense of purpose. In many ways, as I will soon explain, game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it.
Facing Fears 
Many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears. Fear of death, fear of the unknown, and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage. As an example, one Native American rite of passage involved making a boy sit, blindfolded, on a tree trunk for three days straight.
Imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night; the howling, the cawing, and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men. Then, add in the elements of cold and wind, the bugs that must have crawled over his feet, and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him, and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been.
Then, once three days had passed, a man of the village would come and remove the boy’s blindfold. This, again, is symbolic of his rebirth; for three days straight, he was blind and helpless. Then, his vision returned and he emerged a new man.
All throughout the rites of passage of history, whether they be of the Inuits, the Amazon tribes, or the South African tribes, there are some very common characteristics: facing your fear, being reborn, and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations.
Why Were These Rituals Necessary? 
Upon contemplation, it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary. The world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in. A tribe of weak men meant extinction; there was no “military,” or “safety.” If the men could not protect the tribe, it would not be protected.
Imagine, right now, if a marauding band of 25 vandals roamed into your neighborhood. They were all extremely jacked, mean looking, and each one was carrying some sort of weapon; a baseball bat, a stick, or a crowbar. Do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them off?
You, being a reader of ROK, may very well fight a noble fight—but your neighbors? I seriously doubt that a purple-haired, complaining, self-castrating feminist “man” would be of any use during a battle such as this.
Now, try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors. It was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you, so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle. But, being trained for battle requires more than physical strength.
It requires ferocity, it requires strength of will, decisiveness, assertiveness, and a complete lack of fear. These are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed, for without them, a tribe would go extinct.
Are These Rituals Still Necessary? 
Someone might point out that we aren’t at war anymore, so these rituals aren’t necessary. Although I agree that we aren’t in a state of constant warfare anymore, I still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary. Here’s why.
Men and women both have distinct psychological makeups; there is no denying this, no matter how hard the Marxists cry and clamor. Men and women are different. Boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves, namely a tribe. Boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of men…and we aren’t getting it, because there isn’t even a world of men anymore.
The once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated. Only a select handful of men’s organizations still exist: the manosphere, the Freemasons, and various other spiritual organizations. It used to be commonplace for gentleman’s organizations to exist everywhere, but they’ve become a thing of the past.
This is why, in large part, we’re experiencing such a crisis of masculinity; men don’t know who they are anymore. We don’t have any healthy male role models. All we’ve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms. We want more, but we don’t get more.
Any man who is attuned to this can feel it; he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto. There’s no chance for us to prove ourselves. There’s no dragons to slay, no enemies to fight off, and no fears to overcome.
And we’re suffering. We can feel it in our bones. Not only are men unnecessary, but we don’t even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past. We don’t have any initiations or male guidance; no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe, no obstacles to face.
Learning Game: The New Initiation? 
I believe that, although it isn’t perfect, game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual. Game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man, and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past did:
Destroys your ego Requires you to face your fears Forces you to be decisive, in times of uncertainty Develops confidence, ferocity, and a strong will Again, obviously game isn’t perfect. One could certainly make the argument that one’s masculinity shouldn’t be contingent upon what women think, and I agree 100%. But do you know what? You may get into game for women’s approval, but any seasoned player knows that you actually STAY in the game for your own personal growth.
When men first start learning game, they get into it because their sex life isn’t what they want it to be. They think that learning game will get them girls, and it does. But something happens along the way—they start getting all of the sex that they could ever want, and they realize that game has changed them on a deeper level.
Game provides you with an outlet to overcome your anxiety, and to live life fearlessly ; by consistently going out and facing your fears of rejection, you develop a certain fearless mindset that bleeds into other areas of your life.
Learning game creates a whole-personality transformation, that cannot be found anywhere else. No other hobby, outlet, or activity will change you as much as game does, aside from an actual initiation conducted by the men of the past.
Game Makes You A Man 
Game will transform you from a boy into a man, for a vast number of reasons. First off, game demolishes your ego . A lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want, but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls.
This is why so many men hate game, and can’t handle it: you’re forced to face reality very quickly, and most men can’t take this. When you start to go out and learn game, you have one of two choices:
Accept that you suck with girls, and keep trying to improve Viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection Most men choose the latter. Their ego is far too precious, and they can’t handle it being challenged. Those men who do have the courage to demolish their ego, however, will end up bedding women more gorgeous than they ever imagined (take my word for it).
Second, learning game requires you to face your fears. Think of how many men have approach anxiety nowadays; do you think that this underlying anxiety might bleed into other areas of their life? Of course! So once you overcome your approach anxiety in pickup, this fearlessness will bleed into other areas of your life. In other words, you’re starting to develop a totally new personality that isn’t afraid of living life and taking risks.
Game forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty. A lot of the time, in fact most of the time, you don’t know whether or not a girl’s friends will be okay with you. You don’t know if she has a boyfriend, you don’t know if she lives nearby, you don’t know this, you don’t know that. When it comes to game, there’s a lot of uncertainty.
This is why learning game teaches you to accept uncertainty and make take decisive action in the face of it. What other skill could be more masculine? The men of the past revered this skill, because it’s what their entire livelihood was based around.
You see a pack of deer 100 feet away; you don’t know if you can kill them or not. Should you take the risk? An enemy tribe is attacking; should you run to your hut and get a better weapon, or pick up a rock and do what you can? You’re injured and alone, but you see a nearby village; should you ask them for help? Would they kill you or heal you?
Learning to take decisive action in the face of uncertainty was a skill that every man had for millenia; his life depended on it. Now, the only way to cultivate this skill is through game or other, more extreme measures, such as fighting in a war or something (although even then, you won’t have much freedom to make decisions).
All in all, game will take you from a boy to a man. It will teach you to be confident, and to become completely detached from either rejection or acceptance from women. It will help you to develop assertiveness and social calibration.
Most importantly, however, it will teach you to overcome your fears. In the words of my favorite pickup mentor: “Learning game is an Odyssey of the mind.” It teaches you to overcome your fears, to face your lingering negative beliefs, and to grow as a man. Our society gives us no right of passage, so we’ve created our own. Go out and learn game, for it will change your life.

18729,LinkedIn Could Soon Be Banned in Russia,"LinkedIn Could Soon Be Banned in Russia 
Business networking site LinkedIn refuses to utilize Russian servers, and collects information on people without their consent Originally appeared at RT 
The world's largest professional network LinkedIn could soon be blocked in Russia. The company has failed to comply with a law that obliges companies to keep data on Russian users in the country. 
Apart from not moving servers to Russia, LinkedIn collects and sends information about people who are not users of the network without their consent, according to the Russian internet watchdog Roskomnadzor. 
""We are seeking a court order to block LinkedIn. We twice sent requests in the summer, but they did not provide answers to our questions,"" said Roskomnadzor spokesman Vadim Ampelonskiy in an interview with the TASS news agency. 
According to the spokesman, Moscow’s Tagansky District Court has ruled in favor of the watchdog, but LinkedIn has appealed to a higher court. 
“If the appellate court upholds the judgment, and it will no longer be appealed, the decision will enter into force within 30 days. We will include the appropriate IP address in the register of violators of the personal data rights, which means blocking,”Ampelonskiy said. The decision will be announced on November 10. 
The watchdog will remove the ban, if the social network provides information that it has fulfilled the law and moved servers with data about Russians to the country. 
""This is the first company we are suing in court. In future we will use the same mechanism in relation to other companies,""the spokesman said. 
Roskomnadzor also told Kommersant daily that another reason for the lawsuit was ""numerous publications in the media about repeated leaks of user data from the social network."" 
In May, website Haker.ru reported the sale of 167 million stolen LinkedIn accounts, and passwords for 117 million accounts on the dark web. LinkedIn said the leak happened in 2012, and passwords have now been updated. 
LinkedIn is the world's largest business and employment oriented social network. As of 2015, it had 400 million users with 5 million people registered in Russia.

18730,Barrel Bomb: The Cataclysmic Close of Campaign 2016      : Information," Barrel Bomb: The Cataclysmic Close of Campaign 2016 By Chris Floyd
 Well, here we are: at the bottom of the barrel under forty feet of slag. In a few days time, well know our fate: the five-alarm fire of Trump Rule (oh, how those police unions are chomping at the bit!) or the Clinton Age of Hyper-War (oh, how those neocons are chomping at the bit!). In either case, the entrenched coagulation of corporate interests and war profiteers that have strangled the peace, prosperity and prospects of the American people will not be budged an inch. The change that people are so desperately hungry for  so hungry that that some of them might well elect an Establishment insider whose sinister clowning makes him appear to be a rebel  will not come. Thus their bitterness will grow deeper, more sour, erupting more and more often in physical violence: from militarized police against protestors, from Trump-empowered racists (if he wins or loses), from extremist militias, from angry, maddened people on every side. And of course there will be more  much more  of the horrific, never-ending, globe-spanning violence of the bipartisan Terror War that churns on and on, no matter who is sitting temporarily in the White House.
Theres no use in pretending thats not what we face. But theres also no use in pretending that this situation is somehow sui generis , some terribly unlucky conflation of unforeseen circumstances coming together at this particular time. It is in fact the culmination and embodiment of the deliberate choices of the most powerful forces in society: the choices to enrich themselves beyond all reason and extend their military and economic dominance over the earth.
It doesnt matter that many if not most of the practitioners and functionaries of this system believe in its rightness. It doesnt matter that brutal neoliberal nostrums and extremist imperial notions have become religious dogmas for those who see themselves as the meritocracy. It doesnt matter if the leaders and factotums genuinely believe in the exceptionalism they preach or if they are cynical power-seekers. It doesnt matter if they actually believe their rapacious financial machinations are reflections of the natural law of the the market that will eventually benefit all, or if they know themselves to be what they really are: ugly souls disfigured by greed. The end result has been the same: a long series of deliberate choices by a bipartisan elite that have hollowed out the lives and communities and futures of millions of Americans, and created a living hell of war, ruin and hatred over much of the earth.
This is a system that has delegitimized itself, a system that has undermined its own institutions. Through its own actions, it has rotted out the foundations of trust and reason which once upheld it. Some might say, Oh, but theres been a decades-long, concentrated effort by right-wing billionaires and corporate forces to foment ideological and religious extremism to undermine the legitimacy of secular government, which might restrict their profiteering or let more people have a share in power. And thats true. But its been accompanied at every step by the collusion and cowardice of the putative opposition. The so-called New Democrats, exemplified by the Clintons, jettisoned concern for the common good to embrace centrist and technocratic policies: i.e., to adopt the neoliberal dogma that unbridled pursuit of private profit by a connected elites will somehow, someday, lead to general prosperity. The idea that the party should fight to improve the lives of ordinary people in the here and now, to fight for their quality of life in a genuine, substantive way, came to be seen as old-hat, a quaint and fusty notion of has-beens and dreamers who didnt understand the way the world really worked. A true, savvy moderate knows you must compromise every ideal, show yourself to be a willing and avid servant of the monied interests and the militarists, in order to gain power so you can make a few cosmetic changes around the edges, a few little social improvements here and there (but only  of course!  in partnership with private interests), but never, ever challenge the system at its core.
This is the only deal in town: outright, unvarnished right-wing rule, or simpering, cowardly moderate management of a violent, rapacious system. Thats been the choice on offer since 1976. Thats the choice on offer today. The only difference is that the system has metastasized to a monstrous degree over the years: lacking any genuine opposition, the system has grown more violent, more rapacious.
Establishment collusion  and Democratic cowardice  finally and completely degraded and delegitimized the American electoral process 16 years ago, when the Supreme Court  with two members who had direct family ties to the Bush campaign  stopped a recount that would have resulted in the actual winner of the election to take office. This outrageous action was accepted by every single organ and institution of the American system. (With the momentary exception of the Black Congressional Caucus, whose members tried, in vain, to get a single Democratic senator to challenge the result.) Instead, Americans were encouraged to applaud the fact that power had changed hands without tanks in the street. That is, we were to celebrate that an actual coup detat had taken place before our eyes without the slightest show of resistance.
Once in place, the coup regime  staffed at the highest levels by extremists who a year before had publicly called for a vast militarization of American policy and society, even if the public had to be galvanized by a new Pearl Harbor  led the nation into a disastrous war based on false pretenses, a vast crime that not only killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people but has led directly to unbridled turmoil, extremism, conflict and corruption around the world. The elite-supported coup regime instituted torture programs and death squads, and launched an orgy of war profiteering unprecedented in world history. The regime then presided over the worst economic collapse in generations.
Not a single member of the regime was ever tried  or even investigated, at even the most preliminary level  for a single crime committed during its time in power. There were no high-profile Congressional investigations into the hideous carnage and ruin and instability they wrought; not even a Chilcot Commission into the origins of the war, as the UK belatedly launched. Instead the regimes leaders and top factotums were heaped with honors and wealth. Today their endorsement is eagerly sought  and gained  by the progressive Democratic candidate for president.
In 2008, the desperate electorate turned to a figure presented to them as an outsider who would at last bring real change. He had the trappings of difference  a black man with a Muslim name, who spoke eloquently of peace and social justice, who most people thought was far to the left but voted for him anyway. But Barack Obama was of course a meritocratic centrist to his core. Riding an enormous wave of popularity, and a strong Congressional majority, he proceeded to bail out Wall Street fraudsters and finaglers with tax money and create a health care system based on the plan of a rightwing think-tank that prioritized corporate profit  and probably killed the chance for a genuinely public health care system for generations, if not for good. He also doubled down on the Terror War, expanding it to more countries, extended Bushs death squads, helped destroy nations like Libya and Yemen (thus spawning more chaos and terror), expanded illegal surveillance of the populace (and the world) to an extent beyond the wildest dreams of the Stasi or KGB. And after saving Big Money from itself and securing the guaranteed profits of the healthcare-insurance corporate complex, he spent most of his time on the domestic front trying to strike a grand bargain with Republicans to cut Social Security and Medicare.
Again, all hopes of any real change were thwarted. So now the nation swings from being ready to embrace a perceived leftist to the brink of voting in a bellicose rightist as it seeks the genuine change no one will give them. Of course, after the scorched-earth tactics of bipartisan neoliberalism and the inevitable moral degradation and brutalization that comes from year after year after year of vicious aggressive war, the choice for Trump is more nihilistic. Its as if people believe positive change is no longer possible  so lets tear everything down and see what happens. (This is the actual, open philosophy of the Breitbart gang, who are now directing Trumps campaign.)
Even if Clinton wins, this nihilism will still be rampant. And given that she happily embodies the bipartisan Establishment now roundly despised on all sides for its many depredations, the nihilism will grow even worse  especially as she has given no indication whatsoever that she will even try to make substantive changes in the neoliberal-militarist system that is strangling us. Quite the contrary.
So yes, this has been a campaign like no other  but mostly because it has brought the systematic decay of the Republic into the sharpest possible relief, and has shown, more clearly than before, that the neoliberal-militarist ascendency offers no hope for a better life, a better world; indeed, that it offers nothing at all  except more violence, more bitterness, more ruin, more degradation for us all.

18732,Battling the Zika Virus in the United States,"Since its origin in Entebbe, Uganda, in 1947, the Zika virus has spread through Brazil, into South and Central America and the Caribbean.
The Zika virus is contracted through a bite from an Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquito, native to Brazil. It can also be transferred through sexual intercourse with an infected person. The virus was first found in a monkey, in 1947, and finally released as the Zika virus in 1952.
In 1954, a human in Nigeria was infected. From then until 2015, there have been minimal cases of the Zika virus, around the world, including Africa and Asia, in 2007. At first, the virus was mistaken for dengue fever, which is also spread through mosquito bites. It is viral and transmitted throughout the tropics. Side effects include a rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia. Serum taken from the patients showed ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the Zika virus, even though both conditions are similar.
The symptoms of the Zika virus are usually mild and most of those infected do not even notice. However, a few adults have experienced temporary paralysis. Unfortunately, the virus can cause severe birth defects in the brain of the baby, as it develops. It can cause the infant to have brain damage and a smaller head. Pregnant women have been urged by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) not to return to areas that have been affected by the virus, and women who are looking to get pregnant have been told to get tested for the virus. In three months, Brazil reported over 3,500 cases of birth defects, and some have led to death.
In late July 2016, the Florida State Department of Health released information reporting that four people were discovered to have contracted the virus, revealing that it had reached the U.S. The location was limited to a small area in Miami, but according to the CDC there are travel-related virus cases in all the states. The worst was Florida.
Unlike these four patients, over 1,600 people in America have been infected by the Zika virus due to travel to an affected area. These four people were infected by a mosquito located in Florida. Researchers have said this was inevitable due to the state’s close proximity to Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, which are both highly infected areas.
They believe that the mosquitoes in Florida are not the original mosquitoes that carry this virus since their travel is limited to 500 feet. Instead, researchers think the mosquitoes bit people already infected with the virus, and that is how it began to spread, in southern Florida. In an effort to rid the Miami area of these mosquitoes, Wynwood, a small part of the city, has been aerially spraying pesticides to kill the pests.
Public health officials are fairly confident that the number of infected people would be limited since most homes in the south have air conditioning, unlike many of the other countries that have been infested. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is rare in the U.S. and is not often found in the northern hemisphere. This newly reported information has led to a push for Congress to allow more funding to battle this virus. In July 2016, Congress left for recess without approving any funding for the virus.
However, in late September, due to the continuing outbreak of the Zika virus, the U.S. Senate approved $1.1 billion in funding to battle the virus. This money will go toward rebuilding Louisiana, increased control of the mosquitoes, continue to fund research on the virus, and hopefully find a possible vaccine.
Most recently, the Florida Department of Health stated there were 878 cases of the virus. In the U.S. alone, there have been 3,358 cases. It is even more staggering in the U.S. territories, where the number of infected people reached close to 20,000, as of September, according to the CDC website. The virus is becoming a serious health issue in the U.S. Federal and state agencies are working together to battle this virus from spreading any further.

18733,Hillary Clinton Named Attorney General,"Thursday, 17 November 2016 
In surprising news today, Hillary Clinton was named attorney general by president-elect Trump. 
Sources indicate that the Trump transition team has found plenty of Republicans with significant foreign policy experience and plenty of Republicans with lucrative consulting contracts with other countries. 
Unfortunately, they happen to be the same people. Trump tweeted, ""If my attorney general has conflicts of interest, I couldn't care less, but the media will be all over it, so I am proposing a very Trumpian move--hire crooked Hillary! The media will love me!"" 
In a related tweet, Clinton said, ""I am sure Donald and I will have fewer conflicts than I would have had with all those Democratic whiners who blame me for losing the election and I look forward to building on our foreign policy successes such as financially crippling Russia for invading the Crimea."" 
Trump retweeted her statement adding, ""I thought we were going to make Russia part of NATO."" Make wasabiphil's  ",0
18734,Megyn Kelly Leaving Fox News for NBC,"Megyn Kelly will leave her position as one of Fox News’ top anchors to take on a role at NBC News. [Kelly will headline her own afternoon news program at NBC News as well as a primetime “ ” Sunday night news show, according to the New York Times. The    anchor will also appear on NBC News panels during coverage of marquee political events.  “While I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox, I am delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge,” Kelly wrote Tuesday in a post on her Facebook page. “I remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch, and especially to all of the FNC viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters. More to come soon. ” In leaving Fox, Kelly will turn down Lachlan and James Murdoch’s reported $20 million per year contract offer, a figure that other networks have said they are unable to match. Kelly’s new salary at NBC News was not disclosed, but she is likely to remain one of the   journalists in television news. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, Kelly hinted at dissatisfaction with her current role at Fox, where she has consistently ranked among TV news’ highest ratings drivers, along with fellow anchor Bill O’Reilly. Kelly told the Post that she wanted a job with more amenable hours to ensure she could spend more time with her children: “My next deal is all about greater balance,” she told the paper’s Erik Wemple. A source close to the negotiations told the New York Times that NBC News chairman Andrew Lack won what was reportedly a network bidding war for Kelly’s services by asking her what she wanted from a new job instead of simply explaining what his network could offer her. The move to NBC caps a tumultuous year for Kelly at Fox News, the network she joined in 2005. During the first GOP presidential debate, the anchor “became the story,” as she put it to the Post, when she challenged    Donald Trump with a question about his past treatment of women, which led to months of headlines and an eventual reconciliation. In her   first memoir, Settle for More, Kelly accused former Fox News chief Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her shortly after she arrived at the network in 2005. In the book, Kelly accused Ailes  —   who resigned from the network over the summer after multiple women, including former anchor Gretchen Carlson, made similar accusations  —   of engaging in a “cat and mouse” game with her and making “sexually charged comments” toward her. She also accused Ailes of at least one incident in which he allegedly grabbed her and tried to kiss her on the lips. Ailes has vehemently denied all of the allegations. The anchor has also increasingly butted heads with O’Reilly, the other star at Fox News and host of the   O’Reilly Factor. In November, O’Reilly criticized the anchor for publicizing the sexual harassment allegations against Ailes. “If somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance. You don’t like what’s happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave,” he told CBS This Morning, without mentioning Kelly by name. O’Reilly later backtracked, calling Kelly a “very smart, talented woman. ” Kelly, for her part, said her relationship with O’Reilly had grown more “competitive” over the years: “We are both Irish, we’re both Catholic, and we’re both very competitive. So the dynamic has changed. But I really will always be grateful to Bill,” she told the Hollywood Reporter in November. In December, a source at Fox News told Breitbart News exclusively that staffers inside the network’s headquarters were growing increasingly irate with the media focus on Kelly and her possible career moves. “Everybody in the building is sick of it. We absolutely can’t stand it anymore,” the source said. It was not immediately clear when Kelly’s new position at NBC News would commence. The anchor’s contract with Fox News is set to expire this summer. A representative for Kelly did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
18735,Fox News Slips to 3rd Place in Primetime for First Time in 17 Years,"Fox News slipped to third place in the primetime demo for the first time in 17 years last week as competitors CNN and MSNBC enjoyed a surge in viewership thanks to a chaotic news week for President Donald Trump’s administration. [For the week of May   Fox News averaged just 497, 000 viewers in the   key demo of adults   during primetime hours, compared to CNN’s 589, 00 and MSNBC’s 611, 000, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which cited data from ratings tracker Nielsen.  However, the longtime cable news king remained second in total viewership, with an average of 2. 41 million viewers over the course of the week, compared with CNN’s 1. 65 million and MSNBC’s leading 2. 44 million. Fox News also remained in the lead in primetime and total day viewership for the month of May. Flagship shows such as CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show performed particularly well, while Fox has seemingly struggled with the loss of Bill O’Reilly’s The O’Reilly Factor, which had consistently led all cable news programs in the ratings for the better part of two decades. O’Reilly departed the network last month following a report that he had allegedly settled multiple claims of sexual harassment with   payouts. As a result, Fox News’ primetime lineup has undergone perhaps its most significant   ever, with anchor Tucker Carlson now hosting the 8 p. m. hour and the panel show The Five moving to 9 p. m. Meanwhile, MSNBC and CNN likely benefitted from a week of seemingly   breathless coverage of Trump and his administration, including the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and allegations that the president shared classified information with Russian government officials during a meeting at the White House. The ratings news comes as Fox News   Rupert Murdoch held a   meeting at the network’s New York City headquarters last month to unveil a new   studio, Studio F, which will replace the network’s longtime basement operations center. Murdoch also reportedly discussed the overall direction and future of the company, with the meeting being conducted in two shifts so as to include all employees. The ratings developments also come less than a week after the death of former CEO Roger Ailes. Ailes died Thursday due to complications from a subdural hematoma he sustained after a fall at his home, according to the Palm Beach County medical examiner.

18736,Nunes ’Unmasking’ Report Vindicates Trump Claims on Surveillance - Breitbart,"House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) announced on Wednesday that he had learned that members of President Donald Trump’s transition team had been under surveillance by the Obama administration, that individual names had been “unmasked” by the intelligence community, and that those names had been leaked to the media. [Nunes’s information  —   which he said he would deliver to the White House later  —   vindicates the bulk of Trump’s claims earlier this month.  Nunes said that while there was no direct “wiretap” by President Barack Obama of Trump Tower, there was indeed surveillance  —   perhaps collected incidentally  —   of people close to Trump, possibly including Trump himself. Much of that had been suspected, on the basis of mainstream media reports, but Rep. Nunes reported something new: that the surveillance did not involve the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiry into Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Indeed, none of the surveillance had intelligence value, he said. “I believe it was all done legally,” Nunes told a press conference. The question, he said, was why names of those swept up in the surveillance had been leaked. The collection of the intelligence appeared to have been legal, but the leaking may have been illegal. Most of the activity occurred during the transition period from November to January. Furthermore, Nunes said, he did not know whether phone calls  —   including phone calls involving Trump  —   were among the communications captured. Nunes added that the new information had come to light after Monday’s hearing with FBI Director James Comey, when the congressman had appealed to anyone with new information to come forward. He said the new revelations had been “legally brought to me by sources who thought that we should know it. The new information vindicates earlier reporting by Breitbart News, Mark Levin, and others, and which President Trump may have relied upon in tweeting the wiretapping claim Mar. 4. Following Monday’s hearing, the mainstream media appeared to celebrate Comey’s statement that there was no evidence of wiretapping at Trump Tower. Politicians, too, piled on  —   including some Republicans, like Sen. Jeff Flake ( ) who demanded that Trump apologize to Obama. However, the only new revelation at the hearing was that senior members of the Obama administration may have been involved in “unmasking” former General Michael Flynn in intelligence reports. Wednesday’s revelations by Rep. Nunes confirm earlier media reports of surveillance of Trump aides and associates, with the added twist that the revelations were unrelated to investigations of Russian ties to the Trump campaign. No evidence of any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign has been found, and former Obama administration intelligence officials have said publicly that such evidence does not exist. Though the media, and the political opposition, had attacked Trump for his claims about wiretapping, he later clarified that he had used the term to refer to surveillance in a general sense. He also suggested that more evidence would soon emerge. The result is a vindication of Trump’s controversial claims. Questions remain about whether President Obama himself knew of the surveillance, which other Obama administration officials were involved, and whether Trump was monitored directly. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the “most influential” people in news media in 2016.

18737,Russian official reports hackers crippling ADAMS anti-doping system - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
MOSCOW, November 17. /TASS/. The Anti-Doping Administration & Management System (ADAMS) has started to malfunction in the wake of hacker attacks, spokesperson of Russia’s Federal Medical and Biological Agency Veronika Loginova told the All-Russian Athlete Forum. 
“Recently ADAMS has frequently been glitching because of hacker attacks,” she said. “But athletes have an opportunity to report this fact by sending an email to the address available on the WADA and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) websites. This email will serve as an excuse, if athletes fail to register in the ADAMS system. 
ADAMS is a web-based database management system that coordinates anti-doping activities worldwide under the World Anti-Doping Code. Each athlete has his or her profile containing information on the athlete’s whereabouts, doping probes and permission to use various medications. 
Some time ago, the Fancy Bear hacker group hacked the ADAMS database and began to publish documents proving that in the past years some renowned athletes had taken banned substances for medical purposes. A total of six lists were disclosed with 127 athletes from different countries on the lists. The sole Russian athlete mentioned in the documents was boxer Mikhail Aloyan.

18738,Patriots Tight End Martellus Bennett to No-Show White House Celebration with President Trump - Breitbart,"“It is what it is. People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter,” New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett said when he announced he would not attend the White House celebration with President Trump for the victors of Super Bowl LI on Sunday. [Bennett stated that he’s “not really worried” about the fact that Tom Brady, Coach Belichick, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have all expressed their friendship with the nation’s 45th president. “I’m not worried about it at all,” he insisted.  One day before the November presidential election, Bennett tweeted “I’m with her,” indicating that he planned on casting his vote for Hillary Clinton. I’m with her.  —   Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 8, 2016,  Bennett also tweeted in January that the “president dude” was not inclusive and worried that Trump may ban celebrating the Chinese New Year in America: America was built on inclusiveness not exclusiveness.  —   Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) January 30, 2017,  Surprised the president dude didn’t ban celebrating Chinese New Year in America!!  —   Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) January 29, 2017,  The    second round draft choice by the Dallas Cowboys in 2008 insists that he doesn’t bring his political views to work. “We all have our beliefs. We accept people for who they are,” asserts Bennett. Apparently, Bennett who connected with Brady for five passes and drew a crucial pass interference call toward the end of overtime doesn’t plan on accepting President Trump “for who he is,” as Yahoo Sports pointed out.  Bennett is not the first to boycott a Super Bowl gathering with the sitting president. In 2015, after the Pats won Super Bowl 49 by beating the Seahawks, Tom Brady did not make it to the White House gala hosted by former president Barack Obama.",0
18739,“Rigged To Deny Trump”: Are They Stealing These States to Block Electoral Path to 270?,"Will the 2016 election be rigged?
That depends on what the definition of “is” is – and whether or not you count blatant media bias, operatives and instigators, shady quasi-voters, bizarre electronic voting “errors” and a heavy-handed advantage in the electoral college and the shifting demographics of a socialist state that promises much to certain groups.
With the GOP leadership turning its back on Trump, and the Democratic machine dedicated solely to providing for Her, it will be a difficult win for Trump, despite overwhelming enthusiasm at rallies across the entire country and lop-sided pro-Trump crowds that literally dwarf pro-Hillary gatherings of very few.
But as most everyone knows by now, it isn’t the popular vote that counts – but only the delegates awarded state-by-state to the electoral college… and that is a game that Hillary’s operatives are very good at playing.
Daily News Brief: The 2016 Election Is In The Process Of Being Stolen With Rigged Voting Machines 

There are several states – in particular – that are being surprisingly maneuvered for her advantage… and if successful, will block Trump from even coming close the presidency.
Texas Could Turn “Blue” For the First Time In 20 Years
This is the big enchilada, so to speak. For the first time in many decades, Texas is in play for Hillary and the Democrats. Texas has been as solidly “red” as any state in the union, but 2016 could be different.
With 38 electoral votes, the Lone Star State is the biggest prize on the map next to California, whose 55 electoral votes have gone to the Democrats since before history began. Since at least 2008, the Dems have been massaging their electioneering strategy to capitalize on shifting demographics – with plenty of Hispanics in the next generation of voters. On paper, Hillary should be able to play well to Hispanics with all the controversy over Trump’s immigration stances and talk of a border wall. Rumors of illegal immigrants be encouraged to vote could be a crucial factor, with polls in Texas close to neck and neck… it could go either way.

Of course, there is every reason to think that Team Hillary is not taking any chances.
As Michael Snyder and many others have reported , electronic voting machines have been mysteriously flipping votes for Hillary in several counties in Texas… and that doesn’t bode well for a massive electoral prize that is within range for her campaign:
Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning.
At least one county is making an emergency switch to paper ballots after irregularities were found with the electronic machines during early voting.
Meanwhile, Infowars confronted the head of Texas’ elections about his decision to violate voter laws and abandon a manual count of a random sampling of 1-3% of votes (which should theoretically reflect the larger voting trend, unless something is fishy). Without that count, there is less accountability than ever:

This is major issue, and Texas isn’t the only state… just the biggest.
2. Utah’s Independent Republican Could Actually Beat Trump 
OK, so Utah only has a grand total of 6 electoral college votes… and has never been a decisive swing state in a presidential election. But that is because the state has been so solidly “red.” However, this election is totally different.
A little known independent candidate named Evan McMullin has actually taken the lead in several recent polls in Utah, and is neck-and-neck with both Trump and Hillary in several other polls (at or around 30% apiece). Libertarian Gary Johnson is also playing (relatively) well at about 5% – possibly enough to swing further momentum away form Trump.
But Evan McMullin is the real surprise hit – in a state that is suddenly considered an important battleground in the election.

McMullin is a Mormon, which gives him a significant boost. He is officially tied to Better for America, which is basically a #NeverTrump operation – backed by neocons like William Kristol. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Evan McMullin has a pretty colorful and telling background : on top of being a former policy director for House Republicans, he’s also a former CIA operations officer; a member of the elite think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR); a former Goldman Sachs investment banker and a volunteer refugee resettlement officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Jordan.
Wow! I wonder if there could be an agenda there. Hillary probably won’t win Utah, but Trump may not either – and it could make a crucial difference if he is within striking distance of 270 electoral votes.
3. Florida Is a Must Win Swing State for Trump… But Current Polls Show Possible Hillary Win 
Oh boy… Florida all over again. With 29 electoral votes, it remains a major contender that is so often on the fence and swinging in the wind. It is considered essential for a Trump victory, and indeed for just about any successful Republican bid for the presidency.
Sure, we all know the polls are rigged, and may be oversampling Dems to look better for Hillary on paper – but nonetheless, that perception drives expectations.
If She can create a convincing win there, it could change the course of the election once again. Florida has consistently been the closest outcome – in 2008 and 2012 it went blue for Obama; in 2000 and 2004 it went red for Bush (and not without major controversy and some very shady recounting).
Her team is pushing heavily for early voting in Florida, and so far they claim an early voting advantage.
But campaign surrogate Roger Stone is now reporting that Hillary has met secretly with Broward County officials in Florida, and there is speculation that problems with the voting machines may soon be happening all over again.

Pay very close to what happens there, because of course, Florida could be THE deciding state (again). Right now polls are within 2 points , currently in favor of Trump by a very narrow margin.
4. Colorado Has Known Voting Fraud Issues – With Dead People on the Voter Rolls 
With 9 electoral votes, Colorado is currently swinging “blue” but could go either way. CBS4 and the Washington Times reported that an investigation was started by Colorado’s Secretary of State after multiple examples were found of deceased people registered and in the voter rolls:
“This is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,” Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. “Tonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.” 
[…] 
“This is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in Chicago, that kind of thing,” Mr. Maasssaid during a Thursday evening broadcast. “Tonight, that changes. We did find voter fraud in Colorado that essentially waters down your vote.” 
It’s not clear whether or not Colorado could make a difference in the outcome, but the results could prove suspect.
5. Hillary Is “Leading” In These Key Swing States 
While Trump is expected to win the crucial state of Ohio, and also North Carolina, Hillary is projected to take key states including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia and Arizona.
According to the Washington Post :
if Clinton can hold Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Colorado, then she only needs one more out of many swing states — New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, or Florida — barring any surprise Trump win in a blue-leaning state like Wisconsin. That is currently looking very plausible. 
While any of these could change in the actual outcome, it shows that Hillary has definitely maneuvered to win where it counts – not with the people, but with the electoral college.
The details are too numerous to follow here, and anything could happen.
6. You Know Voter Fraud Is Happening If the Media Claim It Isn’t 
What should be very telling to everyone is how loudly the major media – in concert – are trying to debunk Trump’s claims of voter fraud and insist that all is well when it is quite clear that there are major issues.

This is one claim that the system is very afraid of, because quite frankly, they have a great deal to hide.
There is more reason than ever for accountability, reporting on any irregularities and an insistence that the will of the people be respected – because the system is desperate to hold onto control at any cost.

18740,US Military Notifies Russia Of “Sustained Alert Status” Due To “Presidential Election Threat”,"
A very sobering Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the Federation has been officially notified by the United States North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) that their military forces are now on “ Sustained Alert Status ” due to unspecified threats directly related to their upcoming 8 November presidential election. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, under the protocol and procedures outlined in the New Start Treaty that came into force on 5 February 2011 between the Federation and the United States, one of the obligations of the signing parties to reduce the risk of war is a notification process to take place when “ aberrations/sudden changes ” (departure from normal) are made—and that occurred this past week when NORAD unexpectedly expanded its 17-21 October air defense exercises with Canada to now include the California region where just yesterday US warplanes conducted what they call “ security exercises ”.
As to the American’s “ explanation/reasons ” for expanding the use of their warplanes over the continental United States (CONUS) with no foreign threat being known, this report explains, the Pentagon explained as being a “ National Special Security Event ” due to unspecified threats being posed to the national leadership of the US government and directly related to their presidential election.
Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevtsova , however, and shockingly, writes in this report that the American government is currently undergoing a “ silent coup ” pitting forces loyal to President Obama against those aligned with Hillary Clinton—who was the former disgraced US Secretary of State and is facing an estimated 20 year prison sentence for obstruction justice and who, also, is being “ closed in upon ” by Obama’s Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) who have launched a staggering 5 different criminal investigations against her and everyone of her inner circle .
Deputy Minister Shevtsova further notes in this MoD report that the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton, and everyone associated with her, has been so exposed to the American public that President Obama’s greatest fear now is that even if she were able to be elected, she could singlehandedly destroy the Democratic Party for decades to come—an observation, curiously, supported by American experts who believe the same .
Equally to be as feared by the Obama regime as Hillary Clinton, this report continues, is her campaign chairman John Podesta who is described as being adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public , and who Wikileaks revealed yesterday gave the order to destroy all of Hillary Clinton’s emails that were under subpoena by the US Congress and that a US Federal Judge had, likewise, ordered to be returned to the US State Department.
With London’s Guardian News Service having gone through all of Podesta’s Wikileaks released emails , this report notes, even this far-leftist publication has been appalled at the level of corruption of Hillary Clinton and all who surround her—and who wrote yesterday that the level of criminality surrounding Hillary Clinton “ points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else ”.
As the six biggest US-based corporations supporting Hillary Clinton control some 90% of tens of thousands media outlets, including television channels, newspapers, magazines, radio stations and online editions (which means that the US media market is monopolized to a great extent and alternative outlets cannot be accessed in many towns), this report continues, the American people have awoken to the fact that their nation has fallen to 41 st out of 180 countries in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index to both their shame and amazement of what their criminal elites have done to them.
And in the American peoples “ response/reaction ” to the horrors that their Hillary Clinton supporting criminal elite class has put them through, this report notes, they are even now massively rejecting the manipulation of polling data designed to keep them from voting —and have, also, reacted in horror to YouTube, yesterday, censoring a Wall Street Journal video telling these people how they are being lied to and deceived.
With more empirical evidence showing Donald Trump is poised to win next weeks US presidential election in a landslide , and the Obama regime itself now turning against Hillary Clinton , this report grimly concludes, anyone believing that Hillary Clinton and her desperate criminal forces won’t strike back to retake control of America would be gravely mistaken—and the worst may be yet to come.

18742,"Life at migrant centers in Germany: RT talks to volunteers, refugees about their hopes and fears","Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:17 UTC © Pascal Rossignol / Reuters Some have faced criticism in their own country for aiding asylum seekers, while others are themselves migrants who have seen their accommodation centers burnt down. RT Russian talked to residents and volunteers at migrant centers in Germany. Miriam Düsterhöft, 27, studies social science at university and believes that working at one of the refugee centers in Düsseldorf, Germany, will be a good experience. Düsterhöft told RT Russian that she wants to help refugees to integrate into Europe. ""At first it was very difficult. There was a lack of essentials, it was hard to communicate with refugees. Many didn't make any effort to learn German,"" she said. One of the issues at the center was a lack of interpreters of Persian or Kurdish. There was a man who translated from Arabic for men, and a woman translating for female residents. ""[Kurdish and Persian] women do not communicate with men, they are afraid to speak about certain things. Even we [volunteers] don't know what they feel or need."" Asylum seekers have to spend at least six months at the center before authorities can grant them refugee status and provide them with accommodation. Sometimes they have to wait longer before receiving the status, or because the condition of the accommodation provided is much worse than that of the center, Düsterhöft said. Düsterhöft's style of clothing at the center differs greatly from what she wears in her everyday life. Here at the migrant center she wears long skirts and trousers, and covers her hands with sleeves. ""This is my decision - I have a lot of tattoos all over my body, and I don't want to confuse people who aren't accustomed to this. I don't think that it infringes on my rights."" ""No one has ever tried to rape me,"" she added. This isn't a random comment - asylum seekers have been accused of numerous sexual harassment incidents towards women and children in Europe since the start of 2016. Earlier in October, a female interpreter for a French journalist was raped near the notorious Calais 'Jungle' migrant camp. Reports also emerged that the woman's attackers were three Pashto-speaking male asylum seekers. Düsterhöft said she hasn't had any major conflicts with refugees. The most serious incident was when the father of one child asked not to draw animals or humans during classes because Islam forbids the depiction of people. ""We solved this issue and removed the controversial exercise,"" she said. 'There are bad people both among Europeans and migrants' The mother of 18-year-old student Fiona Braun, who is giving German lessons to refugees, says that her life hasn't changed with the arrival of asylum seekers. ""My daughter works with refugee children from Syria and Afghanistan in camps in Vienna and in Bratislava,"" Jana Olearnikova told RT Russian.

18743,Trump to Announce Carrier Plant Will Keep Jobs in U.S. - The New York Times,"From the earliest days of his campaign, Donald J. Trump made keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and the decision by Carrier, the big   company, to move over 2, 000 of them from Indiana to Mexico was a   talking point for him on the stump. On Thursday, Mr. Trump and Mike Pence, Indiana’s governor and the vice   plan to appear at Carrier’s Indianapolis factory to announce a deal with the company to keep roughly 1, 000 jobs in the state, according to officials with the transition team as well as Carrier. Mr. Trump will be   to alter the economic forces that have hammered the Rust Belt for decades, but forcing Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies, to reverse course is a powerful tactical strike that will hearten his followers even before he takes office. “I’m ready for him to come,” said Robin Maynard, a   veteran of Carrier who builds   furnaces and earns almost $24 an hour. “Now I can put my daughter through college without having to look for another job. ” It also signals that Mr. Trump is a different kind of Republican, willing to take on big business, at least in individual cases. And just as only a confirmed   like Richard Nixon could go to China, so only a businessman like Mr. Trump could take on corporate America without being called a Bernie   socialist. If Barack Obama had tried the same maneuver, he’d probably have drawn criticism for intervening in the free market. In exchange for keeping the factory running in Indianapolis, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence are expected to reiterate their campaign pledges to be friendlier to businesses by easing regulations and overhauling the corporate tax code, according to a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump. The state of Indiana also plans to give economic incentives to Carrier as part of the deal to stay, according to local officials. The message from Mr. Trump that captivated the Carrier workers  —   keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States after decades of losses to overseas factories and automation  —   resonated throughout the Rust Belt. That promise, plus his opposition to pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, were key reasons he was able to edge out Hillary Clinton in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Political symbolism aside, saving 1, 000 Carrier jobs doesn’t loom so large in an economy that’s created an average of 181, 000 jobs a month this year, noted Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who served as adviser in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Still, he confessed a grudging admiration for Mr. Trump’s political jujitsu. “If I weren’t so scared of the damage a Trump administration might do, I’d find it refreshing to see an administration fighting for factory jobs like this,” he said. “That said, no one should confuse what Trump is doing here with sustainable economic policy. ” Over the long term, and for less prominent firms, the temptation to move to cheaper locales for manufacturing will stay great, said Robert Reich, a prominent liberal Democrat who served as secretary of labor in the Clinton administration. “Memories are short but the economic fundamentals remain the same,” he said. “Wall Street is breathing down companies’ necks to cut costs, and the labor savings in Mexico is too great. ” Mr. Trump first announced he was talking to Carrier on Thanksgiving Day via Twitter, which the company quickly confirmed. The discussions have continued this week, and with a tentative deal in hand on Tuesday, transition officials scheduled Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Pence’s visit to Indianapolis. “I didn’t think it would be this quick,” Mr. Maynard said. While the standoff loomed large in the lives of its employees in Indiana, for United Technologies the forgone savings is tiny  —   equivalent to about 2 cents per share in earnings. “Every penny counts, but if we step back and I’m looking at earnings of $6. 60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the   listens to some of the company’s bigger concerns,” said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York. When Carrier announced in February that the two Indiana factories would be closing, it did offer benefits to employees facing layoffs, including paying for them to go back to school and retrain for other careers. Even with that, however, once the layoffs were to begin in   most of the workers would have had a hard time finding jobs that paid anywhere near the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran line workers earn. Carrier is best known for its   but it also sells a variety of other heating and cooling equipment for homes and businesses, like the gas furnaces and fan coils for electric furnaces made at the Indianapolis factory. The jobs in Indiana Mr. Trump has referred to are in two separate sites  —   the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, with 1, 400 employees, and a United Technologies factory in Huntington, Ind. with 700. While Carrier will forfeit some $65 million a year in savings the move was supposed to generate, that’s a small price to pay to avoid the public relations damage from moving the jobs as well as a possible threat to United Technologies’   military contracting business. Roughly 10 percent of United Technologies’ $56 billion in revenue comes from the federal government the Pentagon is its single largest customer. With $4 billion in profit last year, the company has the flexibility to find the savings elsewhere. Members of Congress have been pressing to punish big military contractors if they move jobs outside the United States. Many industrial companies face intense pressure from Wall Street to increase profits, even when the economy grows slowly  —   a major reason United Technologies decided to move. That won’t change after Mr. Trump takes office  —   especially when hourly pay in the Indianapolis plant is equivalent to what workers in Mexico make in a day. “This is a spot solution,” said Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. “If it goes through it helps some Carrier employees for a period of time, but it doesn’t address the loss of manufacturing jobs to technological change, which will continue. ”",0
18744,"Without Obama, Shinzo Abe’s Approach to U.S.-Japan Ties May Be Tested - The New York Times","TOKYO  —   Since becoming prime minister for the second time in 2012, Shinzo Abe has made it a centerpiece of his foreign policy to steer Japan closer to the United States. Even as Washington has lost ground in the region, with China expanding its presence in the South China Sea and North Korea defying efforts to restrain its nuclear development, Mr. Abe has stood by the Obama administration, holding it close. Yet as Mr. Abe visits Pearl Harbor on Tuesday with President Obama, in a symbolic capstone to the relationship between the two leaders, that approach may be tested more than ever. The   Partnership, the multinational trade deal that both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama championed, is in tatters now that   Donald J. Trump has promised to torpedo it. North Korea appears to be on the verge of a nuclear breakthrough. China has lately been more aggressive in both the East and South China Seas. And Mr. Trump brings other kinds of uncertainty, grumbling about Japanese trade barriers and the cost of United States military support, and raising the specter of a more confrontational approach to China that could have unpredictable results in the region. “Japan is in a kind of a crisis over what direction we can go,” said Kyoji Fukao, a professor of international economics at Hitotsubashi University. The alliance between Japan and the United States has endured since the end of World War II, but analysts say Mr. Abe, a conservative nationalist, and Mr. Obama, a liberal who had ambitions to change the world, have helped to make the partnership stronger than it has been for decades. “This is the strongest, most reliable and trusting relationship probably in the last 40 years at least,” said Takatoshi Ito, a professor of international finance and trade at Columbia University. “This has been a good four years. ” Given Mr. Abe’s nationalist leanings, he might not have seemed the most likely Japanese leader to embrace the United States, or a Democrat like Mr. Obama, so warmly. Yet since he took office four years ago, after an earlier stint as prime minister in   Mr. Abe has committed Japan to several policies favored by the Obama administration. Mr. Abe expanded Japan’s support of United States military bases despite fierce opposition in Okinawa, and pushed through controversial security legislation that allows Japan’s military, the Self Defense Forces, to participate in combat missions abroad. He offered nonmilitary aid to countries battling the Islamic State, even as ISIS militants killed a Japanese hostage. The clearest motivation for Mr. Abe was the need for a partner in defending against a rising China. “In the regional geopolitics, I think Japan and the U. S. are both pushed closer to each other by China,” Mr. Ito said. “For security, there is no one but the U. S. which can provide the security to Japan, so there is no question about it. ” Mr. Obama provided very clear promises of protection. In 2014, during a visit to Tokyo, he declared that a security treaty obligated the United States to defend Japan in its confrontation with China over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. It was the first time an American president had explicitly said so. Now Japan’s leaders are warily watching Mr. Trump’s approach to China. They may like that Mr. Trump is taking a more aggressive stance toward Beijing on issues like trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea, but there are also risks for Japan if that stance triggers a hostile response. “Standing tall    Beijing is of course welcome,” said Sheila A. Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. But “the potential for use of force or a much more bellicose U. S.  relationship would be an uncomfortable spot for Tokyo. ” Partly in hopes of providing another counterweight to China, Mr. Abe has worked for months to develop a relationship with Russia, trying to resolve a dispute over a set of islands that has prevented the signing of a peace treaty since World War II ended. But a recent summit meeting in Japan between Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and Mr. Abe ended with little progress. Perhaps an even bigger disappointment for Mr. Abe is Mr. Trump’s vow to pull the United States out of the   Partnership, on which both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama spent considerable political capital. For Mr. Abe, it was in part an excuse to push for changes in Japan’s agricultural industry, as well as an opportunity to gain   access for Japanese manufacturers to export markets in the United States and elsewhere. Now his only hope is to try to persuade Mr. Trump to resuscitate the deal. Mr. Abe briefly met Mr. Trump in New York in November, and he hopes to see Mr. Trump again in Washington shortly after the inauguration. Mr. Abe has said he will continue to push for trade deals with other countries, and he is also seeking international partners on other issues. He visited Cuba and talked with the former leader Fidel Castro before he died, asking for Mr. Castro’s help in reining in North Korea’s nuclear program. In October, Japan and Britain conducted their first joint military exercises as part of a move to establish closer security ties in the East and South China Seas. But the alliance with the United States remains the bedrock of Japan’s security, and none of its leaders are currently considering any other significant alternative. Given that, Mr. Abe and other Japanese officials will work hard to persuade Mr. Trump to maintain a strong partnership. Some analysts said that may be a matter of education as much as anything else. “We are not sure that he knows the concrete measures or details of U. S.  security relations,” said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo, speaking of Mr. Trump. “What Prime Minister Abe has to do is give him Lesson 101 on U. S.  relations,” Mr. Kubo said.",0

18746,Most cardiologists shocked to discover the true cause of heart attacks,"Peak Energy – by Dr. Thomas Levy 
For many years, truth be known, cardiologists have just believed that getting a heart attack was bad luck, blaming it on a bad family history, a poor diet, being overweight, or saying “I guess it was just your time, because you haven’t been doing anything wrong.” 
For the past century, scientific articles have continued to pour in showing that there are very many risk factors for heart disease, like elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and so on. There is no question that such risk factors are clearly associated with heart disease, and, when uncontrolled, appear to accelerate its development. But, there IS a missing link that we must discuss right now. ‘Preventative cardiology’ is becoming the new medicine for heart patients 
In recent years, cardiology now appears to have collectively realized and accepted that coronary atherosclerosis (arterial narrowing and blockages) never develop in the absence of inflammation in the coronary arterial wall, initially in the endothelium, its innermost layer. As doctors despise treating anything they feel they do not understand, this revelation has helped many of my cardiologist colleagues to feel comfortable that they are no longer treating just ‘unlucky’ individuals, and that they are no longer limited to just taking care of their patients after the heart attack has already occurred. 
Instead, the thought process is akin to: “Your coronary arteries are chronically inflamed, and we need to minimize that inflammation as best we can.” 
Yet, while the focus has now shifted to coronary artery inflammation, the conclusion is still that a heart attack victim is more unfortunate than anything else, but that there is now a name for that ‘misfortune’: inflammation. Nobody, it seems, is yet ready to ask why the elephant named inflammation is in the room to begin with. Focal coronary arterial scurvy causes the inflammation 
Most people, including healthcare practitioners, think of scurvy only as a severe vitamin C deficiency throughout the body that rarely occurs any longer in the modern world. And this is correct. However, scurvy also occurs when vitamin C is severely depleted in one tissue or organ while the rest of the body has ample amounts. 
This is known as focal scurvy – which often exists in individuals who appear to be otherwise completely healthy. And where there is focal scurvy, there is focal inflammation, as discussed below. 
Normally, vitamin C is present literally everywhere in the body, both inside and outside the cells. All organs contain it and need it to function correctly and optimally. A point that continues to be missed by many clinicians and even basic researchers is the following: 
Inflammation cannot exist where there is no vitamin C deficiency. Pathophysiologically, inflammation and vitamin C deficiency are the same. 
This is because inflammation results in nothing more than increased oxidative stress (prooxidation), and such increased oxidative stress cannot exist where enough vitamin C (antioxidant) is present at the same time. So, any factor that increases oxidative stress consumes a proportionate amount of vitamin C, and any decrease in the ongoing supply of vitamin C to an area of the body allows oxidative stress to go unquenched, and this allows the clinical and laboratory evidence of vitamin C deficiency (aka focal scurvy) to appear. This means that… 
Focal inflammation is a synonym for focal scurvy. 
And since all disease pathologies feature increased oxidative stress in the affected tissues and cells, it can be further stated that: 
All chronic diseases are states of focal scurvy in the affected tissues and organs. 
So, in the case of coronary atherosclerosis – we must ask an important question. Why is there always inflammation and a state of focal scurvy in the coronary arterial walls? 
The only common way for the coronary artery to become severely deficient in vitamin C is to have pathogenic microorganisms take root there and metabolically consume (oxidize) all, or nearly all, of the vitamin C normally present. When this is occurring chronically, the result is chronic inflammation. 
If there is a short-lived infection elsewhere in the body and only transiently releasing pathogens into the bloodstream, inflammation can come and go, and vitamin C levels can be restored. But when the pathogen supply in the blood is continuous, the inflammation remains and even vigorous vitamin C supplementation will typically not resolve that inflammation. That inflammation then becomes the disease, as the macrophages and other immune system agents enter the inflamed area of the coronary artery and try to chronically “cure” the incessant seeding of pathogens. 
The increased oxidative stress due to the release of reactive oxygen species from the white blood cells resulting from the chronic inflammation in the absence of the vitamin C is the initiator and primary propagator of the atherosclerotic process. Every cardiologist needs to understand the significance of gum disease 
For some years now, the cardiology and dental literature has shown that chronic periodontal disease (infected gums) is clearly “associated” with increased coronary artery disease. While this is true, it is finally becoming clear that this “association” is really cause-and-effect. That is to say, the oral pathogens directly cause the atherosclerosis. 
Multiple studies now reveal that the blood vessel walls and the atherosclerotic plaques contain the same array of pathogens that are found in the infected gums. In addition, a much higher concentration of these pathogens has been found to be present in the blood clots that acutely and completely block off the coronary artery and cause the heart attack. Yet the literature continues to assert only an “association” between these pathogens and coronary artery pathology. 
Sometimes simple logic just gets tossed out the window. 
How could a heart attack-causing blood clot accumulate a high concentration of organisms from blood that is supposed to be completely sterile when cultured? Of course, no researcher is going to resolve gum disease, document the disappearance of coronary inflammation, and then re-infect the gums to show the return of the inflammation. 
Without the use of clear-headed logic, the oral pathogen-coronary inflammation connection remains forever a mere “link or association,” and clinicians need not feel compelled to make oral examination and treatment a mandatory part of the treatment of any patient with suspected or documented coronary heart disease. 
The chronic infection of root canal-treated teeth is the source of the coronary inflammation for most heart attack patients, probably 70% of the time or so. Chronic gum disease probably accounts for another 20 to 25% of cases. The remainder comes from other unidentified sources chronically seeding pathogens into the blood, like infected tonsils or perhaps even a chronically constipated and pathogen-proliferating gut. A ‘take home’ message for every heart disease patient 
The point is that all coronary heart disease patients are not being correctly and completely treated if their mouths have not even been examined or considered in the evaluation and treatment of their condition. 
In point of fact, such patients are having the most important reasons for their heart disease being ignored or otherwise neglected. Oral pathogens are the reason for well over 90% of heart attacks, and probably less than 5% of cardiologists and other physicians even know to look for this causative factor. 
A heart attack patient is NOT just unlucky. Rather, the heart attack patient has an overwhelming likelihood of having a steady supply of oral pathogens and toxins coming from root canal-treated teeth and/or chronically infected gums. 
Bottom line, while nobody likes to get in the dental chair, avoiding the proper dental care and intervention can result in a much sicker and a much shorter life.

18747,Box Office: ’The Mummy’ Unravels as ’Wonder Woman’ Holds On to Top Spot,"Warner Bros. superhero tentpole Wonder Woman held on to the top spot at the box office while Universal’s Tom   The Mummy reboot failed to unwrap big gains domestically as Hollywood’s bleak summer continued this weekend. [Wonder Woman  —   starring Gal Gadot as the Amazonian   World War I peacekeeper  —   raked in $16 million Friday for an estimated $57. 2 million weekend total in its second week of release, according to Box Office Mojo. The   Patty   film, with a 93 percent “fresh” rating on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, fell just 45 percent in its second weekend for a   domestic total of $205 million. The film has fared even better overseas, with its international tally standing at $435 million.  Wonder Woman‘s success  —   (the 45 percent   drop is the one of the lowest ever for a superhero movie)  —  provides a   shot in the arm to DC’s   universe of superhero movies as Warners preps the launch of Justice League later this year. Meanwhile, Universal’s monster movie The Mummy debuted to a paltry estimated $32. 2 million   frame to come in second place for the weekend. The Tom   film, meant to launch Universal’s “Dark Universe” of   monster movies, reportedly cost $125 million to produce before marketing, meaning the film will have to perform exceptionally well overseas to turn a profit for the studio. For comparison, each of the three Brendan   Mummy films in the early 2000s opened higher than this latest iteration. Mummy did fare far better overseas, where Cruise’s name still carries a ton of star firepower. The film opened to an estimated $52. 2 million in China, a record for a   film in the country, on its way to an international total of $141. 8 million, the best international launch for any film in the actor’s career. Universal undoubtedly hoped for a better opening for Mummy, as it was meant to serve as the first film in its “Dark Universe” series. Upcoming entries in the series are reported to include a Bill   Bride of Frankenstein movie in 2019, and the Johnny   The Invisible Man. Dreamworks Animation’s Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie came in third place with an estimated $12. 3 million haul. The animated movie featuring the voices of Kevin Hart and Ed Helms has earned $44. 5 million domestically, according to Box Office Mojo, a solid if unremarkable result for a film that reportedly cost just $30 million to produce. Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales continued its underwhelming run at the box office with a   estimated take of $10. 7 million and a   finish, bringing its domestic total to around $135 million. Johnny Depp’s fifth outing as the buoyant Captain Jack Sparrow has delivered overseas, however, with an estimated global tally of close to $600 million. Disney’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 rounded out this weekend’s top five with an estimated $6. 2 million in domestic receipts. The James   superhero ensemble kicked off the summer season in early May with a $145 million debut weekend, and until Wonder Woman, was this summer’s only real box office hit. The film’s global haul stands at $828 million. Overall, the summer to date has been a disaster for studios, with only Wonder Woman and Guardians breaking out as bona fide hits. The season has suffered with a string of   bombs, including Mummy, the aforementioned Pirates sequel, the Ridley   sequel Alien: Covenant and Warner Bros.’ Charlie     King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Other   misfires included Paramount’s Baywatch reboot and the Amy   Hawn kidnap caper Snatched. According to Bloomberg, theater companies AMC and IMAX have seen their stock fall precipitously this year due in part to poor box office results. Cowen  Co. analyst Doug Creutz told the outlet that this summer’s offerings to date have collectively fallen $300 million short of expectations, and summer 2017 could beat out the summer of 2014 to become the worst summer at the box office since at least the  . Industry observers will be holding out hope for other scheduled   releases this summer, including next weekend’s Pixar animated sequel Cars 3, Michael Bay and Universal’s Transformers: The Last Knight, and Warner Bros’ Christopher   World War II epic Dunkirk. Other   movies will include Universal’s Despicable Me 3,   Pictures’  : Homecoming and Fox’s War for the Planet of the Apes. View this weekend’s full box office results at Box Office Mojo.

Cleveland, Ohio – Beyonce and Jay Z performed for “free” at the Get out the Vote concert last night for Hillary Clinton. However, sources revealed that the power couple was paid $62 Million to perform. 
According to sources closely connected with the power couple, Clinton and her campaign flew Beyonce and Jay Z out to a private meeting to discuss the election. With Hillary lacking the African-American voting numbers that Barack Obama had during his 2008 presidential, the Clinton campaign made a quick and desperate move in their final efforts to secure African-American votes. 
“Jay and Beyonce got a call a few weeks ago from Clinton. She invited them for a weekend stay at a luxury hotel to meet regarding the election. Before Jay Z or Beyonce could voice any concerns or ask questions, Hillary pulled out a check. Beyonce saw the check first and her eye lit up like Christmas lights. On the last day of the meeting, Hillary told said to everyone, including Jay Z and Beyonce, “We definitely got the black vote now.” MUST READ: Nvidia moves into your living room with a device not just for gaming

18749,Ana Rosa Quintana logra resolver un crimen antes que Susanna Griso,"Televisión Ana Rosa Quintana logra resolver un crimen antes que la Policía Nacional y que Susanna Griso EN LO QUE VA DE AÑO LA REINA DE LAS MAÑANAS YA HA CERRADO MÁS DEL DOBLE DE CASOS QUE LA POLICÍA televisión 
Tras semanas recolectando pruebas, realizando seguimientos y rastreando indicios hasta dar con los culpables de un crimen, Ana Rosa Quintana ha anunciado esta mañana que su programa conoce la identidad de los culpables, que los entrevistará a lo largo de esta misma semana y que posteriormente los entregará a la policía. “Y cuando salgan de la cárcel engrosarán la plantilla de colaboradores del programa”, ha anunciado Quintana. 
“Les van a caer treinta años, en mi programa”, asegura la presentadora. 
Este nuevo logro de Quintana vuelve a situarla por delante de Susanna Griso, de Antena 3, en número de investigaciones cerradas en lo que va de año. La intensa competencia que mantienen estas dos periodistas cada mañana por resolver los crímenes más violentos del territorio nacional ha hecho que las dos presentadoras superen desde hace tiempo a los cuerpos de seguridad del Estado en número de detenciones. 
“Yo tengo mi propio procedimiento, si tengo que apretarle las tuercas a un menda, se las aprieto, pero hay que limpiar las callees”, ha explicado Ana Rosa en su programa matinal justificando sus métodos poco ortodoxos para interrogar a los sospechosos. En lo que va de año, la reina de las mañanas ya ha cerrado más del doble de casos que la Policía Nacional. 
“Va por libre y a veces no sigue el reglamento pero, maldita sea, es la mejor”, reconoce Ignacio Cosidó, Director General de la Policía. 
Desde Telecinco han admitido que Ana Rosa suele respetar poco el reglamento de la cadena porque “se involucra a nivel personal” en cada crimen. Hasta en cinco ocasiones Paolo Vasile, director de Telecinco, le ha pedido que se apartara de algún caso porque estaba demasiado implicada. Según las fuentes, en esas ocasiones Ana Rosa responde de forma violenta arrojando la tarjeta del comedor de Telecinco y prometiendo atrapar al culpable “antes de que acabe la publicidad”. 
Por su parte, fuentes de Antena 3 explican que Susanna Griso tiene una forma de proceder más sutil, aunque no por ello menos efectiva. “Ana Rosa se recorre los peores tugurios de la ciudad mientras fuma y bebe golpeando a la gente para sacarles información, Griso es más metódica, es una investigadora más tipo CSI, se sienta en el plató y trata de juntar todas las piezas en su mente”, explica un experto en criminología.

That’s absurd. ”  During a discussion with economist Stephen Moore, Reich said, “Steve Moore, you said a moment ago that, actually, a lot of people are suffering a hardship under Obamacare, under the Affordable Care Act. I don’t know what you’re talking about. I mean, 20 million people, or 24 million, if you believe the Congressional Budget Office, would have lost their health insurance because of the former Republican plan. We don’t know how many millions are going to lose their health insurance now. Those subsidies, by the way, kept up with increases in premiums. Health insurance costs are going up all over the country, even for people who are not in Obamacare. That is a problem, but it’s a problem that is a generic problem right now. We’ve to get control of those health insurance costs. But how can you possibly say that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, actually was cruel or a burden to people? That’s absurd. ” Reich later added that Obamacare has flaws, but that it can be fixed. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
18753,Jill Stein Issues Last Warning: Do NOT Vote for Hillary or its Mushroom Clouds Everywhere,"
â€œGet ready for war with Russiaâ€ if Hillary Clinton is elected president, said progressive Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein.
â€œThis election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,â€ Stein warned, explaining that Clintonâ€™s trigger-happy militarism â€œis a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.â€
While Stein adamantly opposes a Trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are â€œarguably even more immediate and intense.â€
Stein blasted Clintonâ€™s â€œwarmongeringâ€ that â€œalmost singlehandedlyâ€ brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president.
â€œHillary brought us Libya almost singlehandedly,â€ Stein explained in a Thursday Fox Business interview. She continued:
And she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in Syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against Russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. Like it or not, Russia has the sanction of international law to be there. For us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia. Both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. This is the most dangerous momentâ€” according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.
Stein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton: â€œIn this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,â€ Stein said, adding:
Not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record â€Ś of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and sheâ€™s calling for a no-fly zone in Syria, which means weâ€™re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets electedâ€“declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So itâ€™s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.
â€œNo one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having Hillary in White House. In some ways, theyâ€™re arguably even more immediate and intense,â€ Stein said. â€œBut the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the worldâ€“this movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.â€
â€œItâ€™s very clear what kind of a trend weâ€™re on,â€ Stein explained:
This is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. â€Ś There is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff.
â€œWe must find and elect alternatives to the Wall Street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,â€ Stein wrote on Twitter.
Stein, who has previously described Clinton as â€œQueen of corruption,â€ attacked Clinton for her questionable ties to Qatar and Saudi Arabia:
During her interview with Stein, Fox Business host Kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to â€œsmotherâ€ Steinâ€™s â€œauthenticâ€ and â€œinterestingâ€ candidacy.
â€œIâ€™m surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourselfâ€” they were so obsessed with Bernie Sandersâ€” and youâ€™ve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and theyâ€™ve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,â€ Kennedy said.
Stein agreed and said that the corporate mediaâ€™s blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation â€œspeaks volumes.â€ She said, â€œMy campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. â€Ś Every day, there are more revelations how both â€Ś [Trump and Clinton] are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.â€ She added, â€œThe corporate media, the apologists for the Democrats and Republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system thatâ€™s throwing them under the bus.â€

18754,Bulgaria & Moldova Switch from Hillary's Euro-Atlantic Column,"Written by Mark Almond   November 13th was as unlucky for stalwart backers of the foreign policy-line embodied by Hillary Clinton just as 8th November was for her domestic supporters. In both Bulgaria and Moldova, the voters rejected candidates for president who had been openly endorsed by Washington and Brussels. Having witnessed how small states with tiny electorates but vital Electoral College votes dealt body-blows to Hillary Clinton's hopes of winning the US Presidency, it would be short-sighted and arrogant - as the Euro-Atlantic establishment has so often been - to dismiss voters in small East European states as irrelevant. Having presumed that Bulgaria was irretrievably anchored in the Euro-Atlantic power-structure by its accession to both NATO and the EU, the choice of an openly pro-Russian candidate for president of the country is a wake-up call to Brussels and Washington. Similarly, the Moldovan elite had seemed locked into an ""irreversible"" course as its premier put it to integration - better said subordination - to the Euro-Atlantic model. In both cases, the majority of citizens thought different. Until the implosion of the neo-con regime-change foreign policy embodied by Hillary Clinton and her attack-dog for Eastern Europe, Victoria Neuland, we could have been confident that the heavy-hands of Washington and Brussels would have pressured both Bulgaria and Moldova to reverse such results. Yet even cash inducements like the IMF's sudden dole of US $36 million to the Moldovan regime just six days before the poll could not buy enough support . Even more striking was the Bulgarian public's rejection of the pro-EU candidate who had boasted about how much EU aid to the poverty- stricken Balkan EU member was at stake. What ordinary Bulgarians and Moldovans know, and what the Euro-Atlantic elites and media never admit, is that EU funds have been a motor of the corruption suffocating their economies. Precisely because of the easy pickings EU and IMF cash provides to the ruling elites, they have no incentive to act in the majority's interests. Real reforms are tough to enact and make the people richer not the insiders in the political class. Until Trump's election, the USA and EU deployed their massive power and influence to making any vote against their policy-options seem futile despite popular recognition of how they had gutted the productive aspects of both the Bulgarian and the Moldovan economies. Sunday's elections in both countries may be straws in the wind. They are victories for the genuine people power of the ballot box, not the street-based populism of crowds favoured by Washington and Brussels to impose ""people power"" on the people. It is striking that the Bulgarian premier, Borisov, who is often criticised as ""authoritarian"" by state media in the EU like Deutsche Welle and the BBC as well as by Euronews, immediately resigned. He drew the democratic consequence of his own candidate's defeat. But the premier of Moldova, Filip, who has been boosted by Euronews etc. as a model European, immediately said the popular vote would have no effect on his policies! Even so, the election of advocates of better ties to Russia is a small geo-political earthquake in states NATO and the EU saw as securely-controlled bases for launching anti-Putin policies. No-one has died in these tremors in Bulgaria and Moldova. But the fact that the upheaval has been peaceful through the ballot-box leaves only violence as a viable way of reversing the will of the people. Both Bulgaria in 1997 and Moldova in 2009 saw violent Putsches from the street enthusiastically endorsed in Brussels and Washington as ""People Power"". If the kind of Soros-sponsored protests Americans themselves are now witnessing at home against Trump are switched on in the East European dissident states the counter-explosion could destabilise the whole EU-NATO project in the vast post-Communist region which had seemed willing to lick the West's hand no matter how often the West had imposed destructive poverty-promoting policies. But now it would be unwise to think that the East European dogs can be kicked with impunity. They could turn vicious as the French say and bite back. A change of course in Washington could re-earn the pro-American consensus squandered over the last twenty-five years by the cynical Euro-Atlantic consensus. But can Western elites swallow their pride and learn the lesson of popular alienation. Or will they sink into denial and double-down on the policies which have rendered them despised by ordinary folk who see through phony rhetoric about swallowing touch economic medicine for their own good. East Europeans know that playing the reform politician not the entrepreneur is the way to get rich in their societies. Sadly, a lot of people in the West are coming to a similar conclusion. So the Trump Effect has emboldened the ordinary voters of Eastern Europe to demand that their elite put the people first. Maybe the Donald didn't mean that to be the outflow of his victory in the USA, but that's how people there see it. If the rigid and impoverishing policies promoted by the US-EU consensus cannot be revised, then more results like those in Bulgaria and Moldova can be expected. What should worry the US-EU establishment is that elections are coming in countries which won't be so easy to ignore as small East European states. Next spring, the Dutch and the French vote. The anti-establishment tide in those two important EU and NATO states is running strongly. Years of rhetoric about reform and anti-corruption strategies across the New Europe of the old Soviet bloc coincided with rampant influence-peddling and bribe-taking. ""Drain the Swamp!"" was one of Trump's most effective slogans. Across Europe, it echoes powerfully precisely because of the hypocrisy and cynicism of domestic and Brussels-based elites who talked so loudly about their commitment to the right kind of anti-corruption strategies but, as East Europeans say, have their left hand cupped behind their backs.

18755,Hillary Emails Reveal She Knowingly Delayed Benghazi Rescue,"
Hillary Clinton refused to send help as the terrifying Benghazi attacks unfolded, according to messages allegedly hacked from her email server and distributed by Russian operatives.
RadarOnline has obtained a report about the allegedly hacked messages that was created by Italy’s foreign intelligence agency, or the Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna, after a meeting with their Russian counterparts on October 22. (These files were written in Italian, and then translated by a respected New York City professor of the language.)
One section of the report deals with September 2012 — the same month as the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, and three others. In an alleged message from Clinton to top aide Huma Abedin, the secretary made it clear she wasn’t going to rush to take action.
“Avoid that they appeal to the AUMF, lets give a political weight to the wait, take time,” the message reads. (The acronym AUMF most likely refers to an “authorization for the use of military force.”)
The text continues, “What has happened has happened, at Sigonella they are standing still, they have to remain firm.”
Sigonella almost certainly refers to Naval Air Station Sigonella, located in the Italian island region of Sicily. According to reports, a US Air Force source once claimed that attack jets were being armed and fueled at Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy on Sept. 11, 2012, or the night of the Benghazi attacks. The source has said the jets could have refueled at Sigonella, which is located some 400 miles from Benghazi, and helped stave off the slaughter.

18756,The Mirage of a Return to Manufacturing Greatness - The New York Times,"Half a century ago, harvesting California’s 2. 2 million tons of tomatoes for ketchup required as many as 45, 000 workers. In the 1960s, though, scientists and engineers at the University of California, Davis, developed an oblong tomato that lent itself to being   and an efficient mechanical harvester to do the job in one pass through a field. The battle to save jobs was on. How could a publicly funded university invest in research that cut farmworker jobs only to help   growers? That was the question raised in a lawsuit filed by a farmworker advocacy group against U. C. Davis in 1979. César Chavez’s United Farm Workers union made stopping mechanization its No. 1 legislative priority. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter’s agriculture secretary, Robert Bergland, declared that the federal government would no longer finance research that could lead to the “replacing of an adequate and willing work force with machines. ” These days, the battle to save American jobs has a different flavor. It echoes in Hillary Clinton’s promise “to win the global competition for manufacturing jobs and production. ” It lives in Donald Trump’s call to break Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against Chinese imports, and in Bernie Sanders’s rallying cry against trade agreements. Its outcome, however, will probably be similar. The freeze on research may have slowed the mechanization of California’s harvests, but by the year 2000, only 5, 000 harvest workers were employed in California to pick and sort what was by then a    crop of tomatoes. In America’s factories, jobs are inevitably disappearing, too. But despite the political rhetoric, the problem is not mainly globalization. Manufacturing jobs are on the decline in factories around the world. “The observation is uncontroversial,” said Joseph Stiglitz, the   economist at Columbia University. “Global employment in manufacturing is going down because productivity increases are exceeding increases in demand for manufactured products by a significant amount. ” The consequences of this dynamic are often misunderstood, not least by politicians offering slogans to fix them. No matter how high the tariffs Mr. Trump wants to raise to encircle the American economy, he will not be able to produce a manufacturing renaissance at home. Neither would changing tax rules to limit corporate flight from the United States, as Mrs. Clinton proposes. “The likelihood that we will get a manufacturing recovery is close to nil,” Professor Stiglitz said. “We are more likely to have a smaller share of a shrinking pie. ” Look at it this way: Over the course of the 20th century, farm employment in the United States dropped to 2 percent of the work force from 41 percent, even as output soared. Since 1950, manufacturing’s share has shrunk to 8. 5 percent of nonfarm jobs, from 24 percent. It still has a ways to go. The shrinking of manufacturing employment is global. In other words, strategies to restore manufacturing jobs in one country will amount to destroying them in another, in a worldwide   game. The loss of such jobs has created plenty of problems in the United States. For the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world, though, it adds up to a potential disaster. Japan’s long stagnation can be read as a consequence of a   development strategy that left the nation overly dependent on manufacturing. “They are focused on a   business,” said Bruce Greenwald, an expert on investment strategy at Columbia Business School. “They are not eliminating hours of work in manufacturing fast enough to keep pace with the reduction in work needed. ” The richest countries today started deindustrializing when they were already well off and benefited from fairly skilled and productive work forces that could make the transition into   service jobs, as increasingly affluent consumers devoted less of their incomes to physical goods and more to leisure, advanced health care and other services. Poorer countries have more limited options. If the demise of manufacturing jobs in the United States forced many workers into   retail jobs and the like, imagine the challenge in a country like India, where factory employment has already topped out, yet income per person is only one   of what it was in the United States at its peak. “Developing countries are suffering premature deindustrialization,” said Dani Rodrik, a leading expert on the international economy who teaches at Harvard’s Kennedy School. “Both employment and output deindustrialization is setting in at much lower levels of income. ” This is even happening in a manufacturing behemoth like China  —   which appears to have maxed out the industrial export strategy at a much lower income level than its successful Asian predecessors, like Japan and Taiwan. For poorer countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the decline of manufacturing as a bountiful source of jobs puts an end to the prime path to riches that the modern world has followed. Manufacturing, Professor Rodrik points out, has unique advantages. For one thing, it can quickly employ lots of unskilled workers. “Setting up a factory to make toys puts you on a productivity escalator in a way that traditional agriculture and services didn’t do,” he said. Moreover, production isn’t constrained by a small domestic market: Exports of goods can easily flow around the world, allowing industry room to grow and giving developing countries time to ride up the ladder of income, skills and sophistication. The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries don’t have these features. They employ few workers and offer little added value. They do not encourage acquiring skills, and they expose countries to violent swings in commodity prices.   services such as finance and programming do pay well. But these aren’t the service sectors most poor countries build. A majority of service jobs in most poor countries are generally limited to housework, mom and pop retail and the like. Since these sectors offer little productivity growth and are generally isolated from foreign competition, they cannot pull a nation out of poverty. The first large transition from agriculture to industry in the early 20th century  —   well lubricated by public spending on world wars  —   liberated workers from their chains far more effectively than Karl Marx’s revolution ever did. The current transition, from manufacturing to services, is more problematic. In poor countries, Mr. Rodrik says, workers may have to pare back their aspirations of development. Who knows “how will political systems manage?” he asks. In the United States, the political challenge is no less daunting. Low pay married to high profits in much of the service economy are contributing to a widening income chasm that is rending society in all sorts of ways. Used to the prosperity once delivered by manufacturing, American workers are rebelling against the changing tide. Note to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump: A grab at the world’s manufacturing jobs is the wrong answer. Walls will damage prosperity, not enhance it. Promises to recapture   greatness ring hollow. The United States, though, does have options: health care, education and clean energy, just to name a few. They present big economic and political challenges, of course  —   not least the enormous inefficiency of private American medicine and Republicans’ blanket opposition to more public spending. Yet just as the federal government once provided a critical push to move the economy from its agricultural past into its industrial future, so, too, could it help build a postindustrial tomorrow.",0
18759,Coulter Calls on Trump to Impose Temporary Ban on All Immigration - Breitbart,"Monday on Fox Business Network’s “Varney  Co. ,” conservative commentator Ann Coulter, author of “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” suggested rather than impose a ban on people from certain countries, President Donald Trump should enact a temporary ban on all immigration to the United States.  Coulter said if everyone were banned, that would eliminate the religious aspects that are preventing Trump from enacting his policy on immigration. “I mean, what Trump, for example, suggested in his immigration policy paper, the greatest document since the Magna Carta, was a temporary ban on all immigration,” Coulter said. “You have no religious problem then. Why doesn’t he go back to that? It’s both more aggressive  —   be very careful. Let in a few a year. We’re letting in 2 million people a year  —   illegal, legal, guest workers. Probably more than 2 million. And The New York Times writes, ‘Well, it’s just impossible to vet that many people coming in.’ Well, don’t let in that many people then. It’s not that hard. ” “And as for the detention, I would say yes, there are ways to be aggressive,” she continued. “I’d think in some ways I’d be more aggressive. But I don’t think it would raise as many hackles because it looks nothing like an internment. I mean, Europe as an easier time than we do. They don’t have a First Amendment. In Germany, it’s a crime to support the Nazi Party. Are you worried about the Nazis today? No, but we are worried about ISIS. We are worried about Islamic terrorism. It ought to be a crime not merely to communicate, but to advocate that ideology and they ought to be thrown out of the country. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
18760,James Comey: Loretta Lynch Tried to Influence Statements on Hillary Clinton Investigation,"Former FBI Director James Comey revealed that former President Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch tried to influence his statements on Hillary Clinton’s email investigation during the election. [“At one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which concerned and confused me,” Comey said.  Comey made his remarks during a Senate hearing, offering testimony about the ongoing investigation into Russia’s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election and the decision by former President Donald Trump to fire him. He acknowledged during the hearing that there were other reasons why he felt he had to make the statement about Clinton’s investigation, including “one significant” reason, which had to remain classified. He said that Lynch’s meeting on the tarmac with former president Bill Clinton during the campaign was the ultimate reason why he decided to make a public statement when the department decided not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. “In a ultimately conclusive way, that was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the Justice Department,” he said. Comey confessed that he followed Lynch’s advice, admitting that he could have resisted more. “I just said this isn’t a hill worth dying on and so I just said, ‘O. K.,” Comey said, but added that he was “concerned” that the Clinton campaign was referring to the investigation with the same language.",0
18761,Sean Spicer: No Evidence of Connection Between Trump Campaign and Russia - Breitbart,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer ripped into the media on Friday for continuing to ask questions about a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia, noting that there’s been no evidence of that. [“Everyone who’s been briefed on this subject, from Republican to Democrat to CIA  —   former Obama administration’s [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, [CIA Director John] Brennan, you name it  —   all of the people come back with the same conclusion  …    that there’s been no evidence,” he said at the White House press briefing.  Spicer said if anyone was trying to engage with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton. “It was Hillary Clinton, who was the architect of the last administration’s failed reset policy  —   she told Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. That was their goal: to strengthen Russia,” he said. “She used her office to make concession after concession, selling off   of our country’s uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting personal calls from Vladimir Putin. I think if there’s  —   really want to talk about a Russian connection and the substance, that’s where we should be looking,” he added. Spicer was referring to how in 2010,   of State Clinton was one of nine to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada. Around the same time, a Russian investment bank paid Bill Clinton $500, 000 to give a speech. “When you talk about connections to Russia, the only connection that anyone’s made with President Trump is multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and he’s  —   some of the  —   you know, he owns condos around the world and some of them were sold to some Russians and I think he sold a house to one several years back. That’s his connection,” he said. “So when you compare the two sides in terms of who’s actually engaging with Russia, trying to strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to interact with them, it is night and day between our actions and her actions,” he said. “And yet no one questioned what she was doing or how she was handling it. ” Critics of President Trump have argued that his campaign aides colluded with Russia to help him get elected. While intelligence officials have assessed that Russia tried to interfere in the U. S. elections in favor of Trump by hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton aide John Podesta and leaking embarrassing emails, there has been no evidence that Russia affected the outcome of the election or that there was collusion with Trump campaign officials. The FBI is investigating the matter, and the House and Senate intelligence committees are also investigating it. But Clapper told NBC News on March 5 that no evidence existed that showed any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “Not to my knowledge,” he said, when asked if any evidence existed. Clapper said there could have been information found since he left the government on January 20, but as of then, “We had no evidence of such collusion. ”",0
18762,Скандал вокруг Пак Кын Хе – специальный прокурор и первые обвинения | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Южная Корея Мы продолжаем информировать аудиторию о развитии скандала вокруг конфидантки президента РК , представляя сводку событий за неделю. 19 ноября в 46 городах и провинциях страны прошли массовые акции с требованием отставки Пак Кын Хе с поста президента РК. Наиболее крупные выступления общественности имели место в центре Сеула, где по подсчетам организаторов, на улицы вышли около шестисот тысяч человек. Как и в предыдущем подобном мероприятии, состоявшемся в прошлую субботу , в нынешних акциях принимали участие лидеры оппозиции и представители полутора тысяч гражданских организаций. Начиная со второй половины дня, по восьми разным маршрутам прошли демонстрации, участники которых к 18 часам собрались на площадях Кванхвамун и Чхонгечхон. Как и в прошлый раз, полиция выдвинула требование провести шествие на расстоянии не менее 200 метров от администрации президента. В остальных 45 городах и провинциях проходят мероприятия меньшего масштаба. По подсчётам организаторов, общее количество их участников составило 950 тыс.человек в то время как полиция с иным принципом оценки участия насчитала около 260 тысяч человек по всей стране. Таким образом, с одной стороны, движение распространяется по всей стране, с другой — активность в целом несколько снизилась – неделю назад столько же демонстрантов было только в Сеуле. Впрочем, это НЕ главные новости этой недели. К таковым в контексте скандала автор отнес бы иное – назначение специального прокурора и первый блок обвинений, предъявленных Чхве Сун Силь. 15 ноября в Национальное собрание РК было направлено прошение о проведении парламентского расследования скандала вокруг Чхве Сун Силь, а также был подготовлен законопроект о назначении специального прокурора. Под документом подписались 209 депутатов правящих и оппозиционных сил, хотя руководство правящей Сэнури не стало ставить свои подписи. Вопреки ожиданиям оппозиции о том, что процедура утверждения законопроекта будет задержана Сэнури, в том числе, руководством, которые выступали против, 17 ноября закон о назначении специального прокурора был принят — 196 депутатов за, 10 против, 14 воздержались. Закон предусматривает выдвижение на пост специального прокурора двух кандидатов по одному от каждой оппозиционной партии, после чего президент выберет кандидатуру. В состав команды специального прокурора будут включены 105 человек, в том числе 4 помощника, около 20 прикомандированных прокуроров и около 40 специальных следователей. Затем в течение 20 дней прокурор будет заниматься подготовкой к расследованию и через 70 дней должен будет завершить процедуру расследования и принять решение о возбуждении судебного иска против президента РК. Максимальный срок расследования составляет 120 дней. В первую очередь специальный прокурор будет расследовать утечку служебной документации администрации президента, в которой обвиняется ряд высших должностных лиц, включая секретаря президента по общим вопросам Ли Чжэ Мана личного секретаря президента Чон Хо Сона и секретаря по связям с общественностью Ан Бон Гына. Следствие попытается выяснить, действительно ли они причастны к передаче секретной документации Чхве Сун Силь, её старшей сестре Чхве Сун Дык и другим родственникам. Затем, речь идёт о деле против бывшего старшего советника по вопросам государственной политики Ан Чжон Бома. Сейчас он подозревается в причастности к сбору средств с крупных компаний в пользу фондов MIR и K-Sports. Специальный прокурор попытается выяснить, обещал ли он руководителям крупнейших предприятий страны в обмен на пожертвования «решение проблем», касающихся помилования руководителей компаний и одобрения законопроекта о реформировании рынка труда. Также прокурор будет расследовать вмешательство Чхве Сун Силь в государственные дела и назначение должностных лиц, уход от налогов, незаконное обогащение, а также обстоятельства приёма её дочери Чон Ю Ра в университет Ихва. Теперь по обвинениям. 20 ноября 2016 г. СМИ РК со ссылкой на прокуратуру объявили о том, что Пак Кын Хе была осведомлена о значительной части нарушений и преступлений, которые совершили два ее бывших помощника и давняя подруга, и могла находиться в сговоре с ними. Чхве же предъявили обвинения в том, что она оказывала давление на крупные компании, вынуждая их вносить средства в подконтрольные ей коммерческие фонды. Следствие установило, что 53 компании перевели на счета фондов Mir и K-Sports в общей сложности 77,5 млрд вон или более 65 млн долларов. Также известно, что 24 июля 2015 года президент пригласила 17 руководителей крупнейших компаний на официальный обед в свою резиденцию, где высказала пожелание создать фонд с целью поддержки распространения корейской культурной волны. Это были глава компании Hyundai Motors Чон Мон Гу, президент Hanhwa Group Ким Сын Ён, глава SK SUPEX Ким Чхан Гын, вице-президент Samsung Electronics Ли Чжэ Ён, глава группы LG Ку Бон Му, глава группы CJ Сон Гён Сик председатель группы SK Чхве Тхэ Вон и другие: все они вызваны на допрос. Обвинение в содействии преступной деятельности предъявлено и бывшему старшему секретарю президента по политическим вопросам Ан Чжон Бому. Бывший личный секретарь президента Чон Хо Сон также предстанет перед судом по обвинению в передаче Чхве Сун Силь для ознакомления документов администрации президента и правительства. Установлено, что до апреля этого года он передал Чхве Сун Силь около 180 документов, в том числе, 47 секретных. Они касались назначений министров и заместителей министров. Итого, лоббирование и доступ к ДСП доказаны, но вывод средств фондов на личные нужды и идеологическая правка речей — нет. Однако, если выяснится, что Чхве так или иначе влияла на порядок назначения чиновников, это станет серьезным ударом и поводом поминать Распутина не всуе. + есть обвинение самого президента в содействии тем, кто точно станет объектом уголовного преследования. Между тем, в соответствии с Конституцией, действующий глава государства не может быть подвергнут судебному преследованию, но его можно вызвать на допрос. Хотя прокуратура требовала провести допрос до 18 ноября, адвокат Ю Ён Ха, назначенный Пак Кын Хе, высказался о необходимости отложить расследование с участием президента на более позднее время. По его мнению, необходимо собрать больше улик, подтверждающих причастность президента к данному скандалу. Ю Ён Ха также добавил, что президент сохраняет готовность сотрудничать с прокуратурой, но на подготовку к допросу необходимо время. Поэтому было предложено перенести его дату. Кроме того, адвокат указал, что желательно выяснить все вопросы, интересующие прокуратуру, в ходе одного допроса. Давление оппозиции на президента на этом фоне продолжается. Так, встреча между президентом РК Пак Кын Хе и лидером оппозиционной Демократической партии Тобуро Чху Ми Э, которую планировалось провести 15 ноября, отменена по инициативе оппозиции. Сама Чху Ми Э написала в социальных сетях, что приложит все усилия для того, чтобы, следуя воле народа, освободить главу государства от должности, нормализовать систему государственного управления и провести демократизацию правительства. Председатель временного комитета Народной партии Пак Чи Вон также заявил о планах выработать меры по отстранению президента, а 42 южнокорейских эксперта в области внешней политики и воссоединения (правда, почти все – оппозиционеры) опубликовали заявление, требующее от президента РК Пак Кын Хе отказаться от внешнеполитической деятельности. В заявлении также говорится, что президент Пак Кын Хе вызвала хаос в политике воссоединения, дипломатии и государственной безопасности. Если это будет продолжаться, то неизбежен крах государства. Бывший министр по делам воссоединения РК Чон Сэ Хён сказал, что неучастие президента в саммите АТЭС в Перу означает, что она признала свою неспособность самостоятельно принимать решения по внешней политике. Правда, не то он, не то иной подписант говорил, что если Пак поедет на саммит, это покажет ее пренебрежение к воле народа и низкопоклонство перед внешними силами. Между тем, Ким Чжон Пхиль — ветеран корейской политики, который хорошо помнит и отца Пак — Пак Чжон Хи, отметил в своем интервью, что Пак «слишком упряма, чтобы уйти добровольно. Даже если бы все 50 миллионов корейцев вышли бы на демонстрацию протеста и потребовали ее отставки, она все равно сама не ушла бы». На этом фоне вбрасываются новые информационные поводы – вроде истории о том, что в качестве олимпийского талисмана Пак предлагала не тигра, а собаку, и противящийся этому человек был вынужден уйти со своего поста, к чему«наверняка причастна» Чхве; что, по словам Чху Ми Э, президент собирается пойти на введение военного положения (военные, правда, ничего об этом не слышали); что Пак получала анонимные косметические услуги под псевдонимом имени героини сериала. Что характерно, последнюю новость принес тот самый канал JTBC, который до того «обнаружил планшетный компьютер Чхве с правками президентских речей». Как будет развиваться ситуация, все еще покажет время, тем более, что назначение специального прокурора означает, что результат этого расследования в рамках соответствующего регламента будут объявлены через девяносто дней. Таким образом, если в ближайшее время не произойдет чего-то экстраординарного, можно сказать, что в сериале вокруг конфидантки президента наступает пауза, в рамках которой власти, как минимум, будут пытаться следить за тем, чтобы на объективный ход расследования не давили какие-нибудь массовые митинги. 21 ноября 2016 г. пришли последние новости. Заявление прокуратуры вызвало как жесткую реакцию самого президента, отказавшегося быть допрошенной (формально, ее право), так и реприманд со стороны администрации. Как заявил ее представитель Чон Ён Гук, в заявлении прокуратуры не учтены объективные свидетельства, а оно само основывается на домыслах и предположениях. Президент столкнулась с жёстким решением прокуратуры о ее виновности, вынесенном в ситуации неприемлемого политического давления, а также нарушения её конституционного права на справедливое расследование и суд. В администрации также подчеркнули, что готовы к активному содействию со следствием, которое будет проводиться специальным прокурором, чтобы доказать необоснованность предъявленных обвинений, но если нынешнее политическое давление, опирающееся на односторонние утверждения следственной группы, продолжится, это приведёт к хаосу в стране и отрицательным последствиям для всех. Оппозиция в ответ тоже «пошла на принцип» и предложила приступить к обсуждению возможности объявления импичмента. 21 ноября лидер Демократической партии Тобуро Чху Ми Э сообщила о намерении немедленно приступить к подготовке импичмента. По её словам, Конституционный суд должен определить, достаточно ли доказательств, собранных прокуратурой для объявления импичмента президенту. С аналогичным заявлением выступила другая оппозиционная Народная партия. Как заявил бывший лидер Демократической партии Мун Чжэ Ин, обвинения в адрес действующего президента – позор для страны и для объявления импичмента достаточно самого факта. Да, и позицию президента, и позицию оппозиции конструктивной не назовешь, а потому, вероятно, и впредь минимум раз в неделю автор будет держать аудиторию в курсе событий.

18763,Trump Backers Go to Court to Block Vote Recounts in 3 States - The New York Times,"LANSING, Mich.  —     Donald J. Trump and his allies have filed separate legal challenges in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in a suddenly robust effort to stop the presidential election recount efforts there. None of the challenges immediately derailed the recounts in those states, but they promised to complicate them with more legal wrangling by Mr. Trump, groups supportive of him, state officials and Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. Ms. Stein initiated the recounts and a successful   drive after suggesting that voting machines were susceptible to hacking. On Friday, Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit in the Michigan Court of Appeals in an attempt to block the recount there, which had not yet begun. “If the Bureau of Elections moves forward with the recount, it will waste the State’s scarce resources, create a logistical nightmare for counties across the State, and assure that Michigan’s Electoral College voters will not be counted,” the filing said. Bill Schuette, Michigan’s attorney general, filed a separate lawsuit in a bid to halt the recount, saying that it put the state’s voters at risk of “paying millions and potentially losing their voice in the Electoral College in the process. ” In his court filing, Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is widely mentioned as a possible candidate for governor in 2018, said, “This court cannot allow a dilatory and frivolous request for a recount by an aggrieved party to silence all Michigan votes for president. ’’ In Wisconsin, a lawsuit against the state Elections Commission was filed Thursday in Federal District Court by the Great America PAC, the Stop Hillary PAC and Ronald R. Johnson, a Wisconsin resident. The lawsuit said that the recount could “unjustifiably cast doubt” on Mr. Trump’s victory in that state. The plaintiffs argued that the recount, which began across the state’s 72 counties on Thursday morning, should be halted immediately, in part because there was a substantial chance that it cannot be accurately completed by  . Results must be certified before the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19. In 2011, a statewide recount took close to a month. A federal judge said Friday that he would not halt the recount, but allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Lawyers for Mr. Trump and his allies are also seeking to halt legal proceedings by Ms. Stein to contest the statewide election results in Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has participated only lightly, paying for lawyers to be present at recount sites. Still, the recounts have generated excitement among some of her supporters, hoping that the small margins in the three traditionally Democratic states might swing to Mrs. Clinton in a recount. But Edward B. Foley, director of the Election Law Project at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, said there was no comparison between this recount and the 2000 Florida impasse between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Then, he said, “it was quite plausible that Gore might prevail in a recount. ’’ The chance that these state recounts could reverse the outcome of the 2016 election, Mr. Foley said, was “essentially zero or infinitesimal. ” Ms. Stein, in a statement, said the challenges to the recounts were an effort to put “party politics above country. ” “Trump’s desperate attempts to silence voter demands for recounts raise a simple question: Why is Donald Trump afraid of these recounts?” she said. In Michigan, where the recount is still pending, the Board of State Canvassers on Friday heard a formal objection from Mr. Trump and his campaign to plans to recount that state’s 4. 8 million votes. Lawyers for Mr. Trump told the state board, which is made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, that it should not allow a new count, describing it as needless, too expensive and not required under Michigan law. Ms. Stein, who got 51, 463 votes in Michigan, hardly met the state’s standard as an “aggrieved” party, the lawyers argued. But a lawyer for Ms. Stein, Mark Brewer, said Mr. Trump’s campaign was making a “desperate attempt” to avoid a recount. Of the three states where recounts are contemplated, Michigan had the smallest gap between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton: 10, 704 votes. “I would remind everybody that the original source of the allegation that this election was rigged was Mr. Trump,” Mr. Brewer, a former chairman of Michigan’s Democratic Party, told the board. In the end, after several tense exchanges over the practical value and cost of a recount, the Board of State Canvassers split, 2 to 2, along party lines, meaning the recount objection failed. Barring a court order in Mr. Schuette’s case or some other legal development, Michigan, which has not seen a statewide recount in half a century, could begin a hand recount by Wednesday. In Pennsylvania, Ms. Stein’s recount campaign is operating along dual tracks, with its challenge of the statewide results proceeding along with petitions to recount specific voting districts. Lawrence J. Tabas, general counsel of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, said in an interview on Friday that Ms. Stein’s lawyers had fallen short of demonstrating that there was fraud or illegal action in the Nov. 8 election. “They know they have no claim,” he said. “This action by Jill Stein and her supporters  —   I couldn’t even call it a Hail Mary pass, because that would be insulting to the Hail Mary pass,” said Mr. Tabas, who along with other lawyers, submitted a lengthy court brief on Thursday. On Friday afternoon in Philadelphia, teams of observers were monitoring election workers as they rechecked counts on electronic voting machines used in 75 precincts, a small fraction of the nearly 1, 700 across the city. The groups  —   which included representatives from each of the parties and candidates  —   quietly made their way from machine to machine in a dimly lit warehouse in North Philadelphia where the city stores its 4, 000 machines. Philadelphia has been using the machines, which record votes on cartridges, since the early 2000s. The review mirrored the steps that automatically take places after elections, said Al Schmidt, a city commissioner and a Republican, who said he did not expect the vote tally to change. “We are doing the exact same thing that we did during the computation process,” he said. “We are just doing it once again. ” Rich Garella, 50, a Stein supporter who petitioned for the recount and was serving as a monitor on Friday, said the effort felt worthwhile, but he had hoped that election officials would approve a more rigorous forensic audit of the machines, which Ms. Stein had requested. “We as voters don’t really understand how these machines work,” Mr. Garella said. “We don’t understand how they are programmed. ” He predicted that one result of the recount effort, at least in Philadelphia, could be to shed light on the unseen part of the voting system. “What we may end up showing from this is just that we are not being allowed to see how our election works and to see that our votes are being counted properly,” he said.",0
18764,Pennsylvania Law Would Ban Naming Police Officers Involved in Shootings For 30 Days,"We Are Change 
Pennsylvania Law Would Ban Naming Police Officers Involved in Shootings For 30 Days The bill sailed through the legislature, still needs governor’s signature. 
Pennsylvania lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a new bill last week—heavily backed by state and national police unions, including the Fraternal Order of Police—which would forbid the public release of the names of officers involved in shootings of civilians for 30 days, or until an internal police investigation is completed. The penalty for violating the government-wide gag order would be a second misdemeanor charge, however, exemptions would be made for the Attorney General and district attorney’s offices.
The bill sailed through Pennsylvania’s House 151-32 and 39-9 in the Senate, with a significant amount of Philadelphia-area lawmakers voting against it, according to Philly.com . Gov. Tom Wolf (D) still needs to sign the bill to make it law, but he has made no public indication of whether or not he will do so.
The bill was introduced by Rep. Marina White (R) as a means of providing officers involved in shootings “basic protection from threats” After voting in favor of the bill, Rep. Dominic Costa (D) declared, “We are the protectors of our protectors.”
Last year, then-Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey changed the department’s long-standing policy of releasing officers’ names whenever it felt it was appropriate to limiting the delay to a maximum of 72 hours. Ramsey was quoted by NPR as saying, “I don’t think you can shoot someone and expect to remain anonymous…and I do think that we have a responsibility as a police agency that work[s] for the people to provide that information, unless there are some extenuating circumstances.” If the bill becomes law, it would supersede Philadelphia’s more transparent policy.
Writing of the proposed bill, the Cato Institute’s Jonathan Blanks noted:
Current Pennsylvania law is bad enough as it is. Authorities already have the discretion to release or withhold the names of officers involved in use-of-force incidents. Without a timetable for release of officers’ names, the process to get to the bottom of what happened can be a very lengthy one.
Transparency is also a problem for the Pennsylvania State Police , which makes public very little information about its officer involved shootings, nearly all of which are ruled justified.

18765,Donald Trump: Russia Investigation ’Greatest Witch Hunt’ in History,"President Donald Trump criticized the decision to appoint a special counsel to the probe investigating allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians during 2016 election. [“With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign  Obama Administration, there was never a special councel (sic) appointed!” Trump wrote on Twitter early Thursday morning.  Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed as a special counsel on the case by the Justice Department, in response to reports that Trump spoke with former FBI Director James Comey about letting his former National Security advisor go. Trump signaled his frustration with the process, again describing it as a “witch hunt. ” “This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!” he wrote.  Trump stated yesterday that the was eager to conclude the investigation. “As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know  —   there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,” he said in a statement.",0
18766,GRAPHIC: Three Killed in Drug Shootout Outside Ritzy Mexican Border State Bar,"MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon  —   Cartel gunmen killed three men and injured a fourth in an apparent hit outside a bar in one of the most exclusive suburbs in this city. [Early Thursday morning, a security detail transported a Mexican businessman, his wife and a group of other men to a local bar when unknown gunmen suddenly attacked. The gunmen began to rain gunfire on their victims, information released to Breitbart Texas by the Nuevo Leon government revealed.   The shooting took place in the Centrito Valle entertainment district of the upscale San Pedro neighborhood. The brief shooting killed three of the men and injured one of the bodyguards right outside a bar called La Unica.  Nuevo Leon public safety officials identified the three murder victims as    Jose Herrera Aispuro from the Mexican state of Sinaloa,    Michael Raciel Almela Martinez from Mexico State, and Carlos Sanchez Pliego Mier from the State of Queretaro. In the case of Sanchez Pliego authorities could not determine his exact age since the man appears to have various sets of identification documents indicating various ages.  At the crime scene, investigators noted that Herrera Aispuro wore a Rolex and had a large amount of Mexican currency in his possession. Mexican investigators revealed to Breitbart Texas that Herrera Aispuro is believed to have been an attorney working for operatives of the Beltran Leyva Cartel.  As Breitbart Texas has reported, Centrito Valle has been an area under the control of Beltran Leyva operatives who hold a monopoly over the street level drug distribution in the upscale sector. Breitbart Texas confirmed that last week, an accountant for the Beltran Leyva was also gunned down in Monterrey pointing to an apparent escalation of violence between rival cartels over the drug territories in Nuevo Leon. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by Tony Aranda, from Monterrey, Nuevo León. ",0

18768,Hillary Friend Bribed FBI Agent and His Wife,"Email 

WSJ The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email use. 
Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe’s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI. 
The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe’s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe’s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort",0
18769,"Trump, Brexit and the Collapse of the Liberal Order","
“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win!” Mahatma Gandhi, India’s legendary activist. It is now time for a NEW New World Order! A patriotic and conservative world order because we had enough of what we already experienced for years!
One of the most confounding aspects of Donald Trump’s election as 45th President of the United States is that in the space of a year – indeed less than a year – a man with zero political experience has destroyed two of the most entrenched political dynasties: Bush and Clinton.
Just pause on this for a moment, and place it in the context of someone who in response to his appearance on the political stage as a candidate for the Republican nomination was met with ridicule and scorn. Consequently, a mainstream media and liberal commentators for whom politics is an exclusive club, the preserve of a select group of blessed people who belong to the club as if by divine right, have just been delivered one almighty slap-down The sense of entitlement that emanated from the Clinton campaign during this election was astonishing to behold. Hillary Clinton emitted the demeanour of a woman approaching a coronation rather than an election, disdaining not only on Donald Trump but also his supporters, whom she infamously described as “deplorables”. This was her undoing.
One of the most salient consequences of the 2008 global economic crash, which ushered in the worst crisis within capitalism since the 1930s, has been the collapse of the political center ground and with it the dominance of the liberal order.
In this respect, it is just as Karl Marx opined in his Communist Manifesto:
“All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of lifeâ€Ś”
The analogy that best describes this process is a battlefield after the smoke has cleared to reveal the ideological right on one side and its left wing counterpart on the other, ready to go to war over the right to shape the future. And as Brexit in the UK and now Trump’s electoral victory in the US leaves no doubt, this is a struggle currently being won by the right.
This is not to suggest the struggle is completely over however. On the contrary, the political, social, economic and constitutional crisis ushered in by Brexit proves that there remains some distance to travel before the matter is settled in Britain, while Trump’s election will inevitably give rise to strong opposition in the streets, perhaps even sparking a much needed revival of the left across the US, which based on the success of the Sanders campaign is far from dead.
Focusing in on Donald Trump and based on statements he made in the course of his campaign, it is interesting to observe that among the many places where you will find the most grievously disappointed people in response to his victory, are NATO headquarters in Brussels and Daesh (also known as ISIL/ISIS) and Nusra headquarters in Syria. It is evidence of the hitherto insurmountable contradiction that has lain at the heart of Washington’s geopolitical priorities and strategy these past few years. Trump, in contrast, laid it out very simply when he said, “Russia is killing ISIS. Assad is killing ISIS. I think it would be a good idea to get along with Russia.”
This being said, the acid test is what he does rather than what he has said, which is why it remains far too soon to be complacent in welcoming a new dawn in Washington’s relations with Russia or the rest of the world. Trump also said some harsh things about China and Iran during his election campaign, which taken in conjunction with the fact that as president he immediately becomes the CEO of an empire that is no longer sustainable, requires us to exercise caution rather than celebration at this stage.

18770,Trump Nominates Ten Conservatives to be Federal Judges - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C. —  President Donald Trump unveiled a slate of ten judicial nominees to the federal courts on Monday who are mainstream conservatives, taking the next step to fulfill his campaign promise after his successful appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. [When it comes to judicial nominations, the president is best known for his   victory in his nomination and confirmation of Gorsuch. But even if Trump gets the expected opportunity to nominate two more justices during his first term, those three picks will be less than two percent of his judicial selections over the next four years.  Trump has already made one other judicial nomination: Judge Amul Thapar to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Thapar is currently a federal district judge (the trial court in the federal system) in Kentucky. But at this moment, there are 122 judicial vacancies in addition to the one Thapar will fill when he is confirmed. On Monday, Trump nominated ten additional picks to fill many of those seats, five for the federal appeals courts and four for the federal district courts (in addition to one for a specialized court, the Court of Federal Claims). Most of the public attention will go to the appellate nominees, because more than 99 percent of the time a decision from a federal appeals court is a final decision because the Supreme Court does not select it for review. The president’s nominees to the appeals courts are: Two of these five, Larsen and Stras, were on Trump’s List of 21 for the Supreme Court vacancy filled by Gorsuch. Most of them clerked for justices on the Supreme Court, and all have stellar records and are regarded as principled originalists who believe in interpreting the Constitution and other written laws according to their original public meaning. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, praised the list as “very impressive,” adding that these nominees “are natural prospects for federal judicial service at the Court of Appeals level. ” Carrie Severino, general counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network and a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, agreed. President Trump “is taking the next step in carrying out his campaign promise by appointing highly qualified and principled judges to the lower federal courts,” Severino said. “The nominees have stellar qualifications and a record of courageous commitment to the rule of law that will make them excellent additions to the federal bench,” she added. Ken Blackwell, a member of the American Civil Rights Union policy board who is also a former domestic policy advisor to Trump’s presidential transition team and former U. S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, gave his reaction, speaking exclusively with Breitbart News about the president’s selections. “President Trump is showing a courageous commitment to picking principled conservatives for the federal bench,” Blackwell said. “There are millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump because this was their   issue. President Trump is giving them one reason after another to celebrate!” “The fate of many of the issues most dear to these millions of Americans are in the hands of the courts, more than Congress, the White House, or statehouses,” Blackwell added. “From religious liberty, to the Second Amendment, to voter integrity, to securing our borders and national security, the makeup of the federal bench will shape the destiny of our nation. ” “President Trump, and those whom he has chosen to serve in his administration, like Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, are proving in spades that they understand this issue, and that it is a top priority for them,” Blackwell concluded. These nominations for lifetime appointments now go the U. S. Senate for confirmation. Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.",0
18771,FOX News Just Admitted It Made Up Story About Hillary Being “Indicted” For Foundation,"Comments 
The alt-right and other Trump supporters were flush with excitement yesterday as their online echo chamber resounded with stories that Hillary Clinton was about to be indicted on the basis of the newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer. Today, of course, we learned that this was nothing but a bold-faced lied. While many of the more obscure right -wing blogs named nothing but imaginary sources to support their outrageous claims , the most legitimate source of the false story was none other than Fox News. 
On November 2 Fox News’ Bret Baier claimed that, according to two anonymous sources within the FBI, the agency’s investigation of Clinton would “continue to likely an indictment.” The very next day reality forced him to walk back those claims, which he called “inartful,” acknowledging that “that’s not the process.” 
Nonetheless, Baier did not entirely disavow his ruse of an imminent Clinton indictment, maintaining that “there is confidence in the evidence.” Given that Clinton’s indictment has been impending for months in the right-wing universe one would think that these shameless schemers would have wised up to the fact that it’s not going to happen – and for good reason . Instead, every time there is the slightest mention of Clinton’s emails, no matter how vague and clearly inconsequential , the alt-right rumor mill kicks into overdrive on its vicious crusade to smear the potential first female president in any way possible. 
In reality, there is absolutely nothing so far to suggest that there is anything incriminating in the most recent batch of Clinton emails, and it has become increasingly clear that FBI Director James Comey’s announcement of the renewed investigation was nothing but a cynical and hypocritical political ploy. In part the announcement was designed to fuel a new Republican storyline that Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is under federal investigation. The demagogues making these claims conveniently ignore the fact that Trump is under investigation in no fewer than 75 cases , including the rape of a 13 year-old girl. 
Another disconcerting storyline in yesterday’s firestorm of right-wing rumors is the political interference of Trump supporters in the FBI. If Baier’s so-called anonymous sources really were FBI agents, it would represent yet another recent example of meddling in the presidential election by Trump supporters at the supposedly impartial agency. In any case, the endless lies and distortions of the right-wing pseudo-media, from Fox News down to the lowliest blog, are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.",0
18772,J. Edgar Comey,"  
I had intended to use this final column before the presidential election to explain at length why I cannot vote for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and plan to vote for Gary Johnson for president. In a nutshell, big government is our biggest problem. It thrives on more debt, more taxes, more regulations, more war, a secretive deep state and less personal freedom. Both Clinton and Trump would grow the government. Only Johnson would shrink it. 
One of the most dangerous tendencies of big government is the generation of a police state — wherein laws, rules and procedures are primarily written and can often be bent to aid law enforcement when it is encroaching on our personal freedoms. We saw a terrifying example of that last week when FBI Director James Comey behaved as if he were his most infamous predecessor, J. Edgar Hoover. 
Here is the back story. 
Late last week, in an effort to redeem himself from the consequences of having ignored a mountain of evidence of guilt against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last summer, Comey told Congress in a cryptic letter that the FBI would resume investigating her emails based upon the belief that more of them may be located in the laptop of disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner. Weiner is the alleged sexual predator who remains the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s closest aides. Abedin backed up all her emails onto the laptop that she and her husband shared. 
At the time he sent his Friday letter, Comey had not yet seen the contents of the Weiner laptop because the search warrant authorizing FBI agents to access its contents was not signed until Sunday. If he saw something incriminating before he wrote his letter, he saw it unlawfully; yet his duty was to bring what he saw to the Department of Justice, for which he works, not to hint about it publicly to Congress. 
Comey’s progress report to Congress is prohibited by the internal regulations of the DOJ and the FBI — and by the canons of legal ethics that regulate lawyers. Comey had no obligation to send the letter at any time; moreover, sending it last week was a direct violation of DOJ and FBI rules that prohibit all public announcements about candidates for public office within 60 days of Election Day. 
Comey told FBI staffers early this week that he sent the letter because he felt duty-bound to members of a congressional committee to whom he had given a promise that he would keep them informed of the status of the email investigation. That was a troublesome promise because its compliance violated other duties imposed upon Comey. Worse than making a promise and not keeping it is making a promise that should not be kept. 
The genesis of all this was Comey’s unprecedented news conference on July 5, at which he announced that no charges would be filed against Clinton because no prosecutor would take the case. That was not an announcement for him to make. The FBI’s job is to gather facts and present them to the DOJ, not to make legal evaluations. He made his announcement when he did to head off the behavior of some of his agents who were seeking Clinton’s medical records, unlawfully, from the National Security Agency to ascertain the gravity of her head injury — an injury she posited during her FBI interrogation as the reason for her professed memory loss. 
I have argued that Comey’s July 5 decision was dead wrong; there is a mountain of evidence with which to indict and convict Clinton on espionage charges. Yet it should have been presented to a grand jury — it was not — rather than at a news conference. The July 5 announcement was bizarre in that it not only exonerated Clinton but also described the quantity and quality of the evidence against her. This insulted the agents who worked on the case and produced the lowest collective FBI morale since Watergate. If Comey sent his Friday letter to address the problems he caused by his July 5 announcement, he did the wrong thing for the wrong reasons. 
But perhaps the gravest of Comey’s violations is that of the constitutional guarantee of due process. The essence of due process is notice and fairness. How exquisitely unfair of Comey to say, in effect, “We have something that warrants investigation of you, yet we don’t know its significance, so we can’t say what it is.” This is reminiscent of Franz Kafka’s “The Trial,” in which the lead character is being pursued for a year on unnamed charges, against which he cannot defend himself. 
In his play “A Man for All Seasons,” Robert Bolt shows Sir Thomas More arguing with William Roper, a colleague, who suggests that government lawbreaking can be justified for the greater good, particularly if the target is the devil (which Trump has called Clinton). More demolishes that argument in a few now iconic lines: “And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you — where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast — man’s laws, not God’s — and if you cut them down, and you’re just the man to do it, d’you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I’d give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety’s sake.” 
To my friends who have rejoiced in James Comey’s letter, please take warning that, as More accurately predicted, the tables can be turned. If there is any moral lesson in all this, it is that the history of human freedom consists of paying careful attention to constitutional guarantees and legal protections, no matter the reputation of the accused.

18773,Migrant Thug Beats 87-Year-Old To Bloody Pulp For Making 1 Simple Request,"Share This An 87-year-old man was beaten nearly to death after giving a ride to a migrant. 
A sweet 87-year-old man offered a young migrant a ride to the train station, hoping to show him a small act of kindness. However, as soon as they pulled up to his stop, the migrant thug attacked the elderly man, beating him to a bloody pulp and punching a hole in his eye after he made one simple request. 
An elderly Swede saw just how far tolerance and open-mindedness reaches with other cultures after giving a 27-year-old Colombian migrant a ride from Gnosjö to Gislaved. Graciously obliging the Hispanic migrant, the old man and his wife took him 20 minutes away to the local train station. Unfortunately, the pensioner made a nearly fatal mistake when they arrived at their destination. 
According to Fria Tider , the 87-year-old unnamed man pulled up to the station and politely told the migrant that they had arrived at his destination. Simply informing the foreigner that it was time to exit the vehicle apparently sent him into a rage, causing him to brutally beat the driver almost to death. 
Repeatedly punching him in the torso and head at least a dozen times, the migrant beat the old man so badly that he broke his rib and punched a hole in his right eye, damage that was so extensive that doctors worried he would go completely blind even after 3 weeks in the hospital. 
“He can no longer read newspapers or see on television,” according to the court report. “It is unclear if he will ever see again. Before the beating, he was alert and active in the community. Now, he needs the help of four times a day.” 
When police arrested the migrant, whose identity is protected by the liberal Swedish government, he told authorities that his victim had sparked the beating by calling him “little” and a “negro.” It wasn’t long before the thug admitted that he lied about the accusations and simply beat the sweet old man because he knew he’d get away with it. 
The convict laughed during his interrogation, telling police that he was amused that a man just over 5 feet tall could take down a feeble, elderly man a foot taller. “It is what it is,” the migrant heckled. “A man of 6 feet getting knocked out — me leveling a man of 6-feet is really laughable. I cut him down like a tree,” he added, telling police that it doesn’t matter if he’s convicted because “I’ll be on the loose. I will come out soon again. You can’t lock me up for very long,” according to Expressen . Left-leaning Swedish authorities protect the identity of the migrant thug, forcing the media to censor his face and the Colombian flag patch on his jacket. 
Sickeningly enough, the migrant thug was right. Thanks to the politically correct justice system, he received just over 2 years in prison for aggravated assault, a sentence that will likely either be appealed, overturned, or reduced with good behavior. In fact, his appeal is currently being heard by a higher court, which is considering reducing his sentence based because he was located on social media and forced to go into hiding because of his brutal crime. 
Unfortunately, this type of racially-motivated violence is nothing new to Europe. Just over a week ago, Mad World News reported that a group of 5 white men, 3 U.S. citizens and 2 Danes, were approached by 8 to 10 Muslim migrants who asked if they were Americans. When the 3 admitted that they are, the asylum seekers attacked all 5 of them, brutally beating and threatening to kill them with a knife. 
The victims received no help from the Danish government and have been ignored by local authorities. Even the central investigating police headquarters refused to take the case. 
As the elderly Swedish man discovered, it doesn’t matter if you extend tolerance and respect, many of these migrants see Westerners as inferior humans who must be forced to submit. This is exactly what a bleeding-heart liberal found out after volunteering at the Calais “Jungle” camp. 
Last week, Mad World News reported that a 38-year-old female interpreter was helping a male journalist make a documentary about the plight of migrants when a group of 3 Afghan asylum seekers attacked them at knifepoint. One of the migrants raped her while the others restrained the journalist and stole his equipment. 
Those who despise our culture, values, and laws won’t have a change of heart when we show them just how progressive and open-minded our society is. They know this, and it’s the very reason they hate us. In fact, they see our kindness as an opportunity to impose their oppressive and violent values on us without fear of being opposed. After all, we wouldn’t want to be considered racist, would we?",0

18778,"Wrestling Propelled Hastert’s Career, and Provided Opportunity for Abuse - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   When calls for his removal from office reverberated through the capital a decade ago, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert struggled to explain why he had not aggressively investigated allegations that a Florida lawmaker had sent flirtatious messages to a teenage boy who had served as a House page. At that perilous moment, an impassioned group of supporters stepped forward to speak up on Mr. Hastert’s behalf: wrestling coaches. “Denny Hastert is a good and honorable man  —   and one of wrestling’s own,” Leo Kocher, the wrestling coach at the University of Chicago, wrote in late 2006 in a letter distributed to high school and college coaches. “The wrestling community must reach as many people as it can through calling talk radio, letters to the editor, and any other way in which public opinion can be moved,” he wrote. “Denny Hastert is one of the finest people to ever hold membership in the wrestling community. ” Wrestling gave Mr. Hastert stature in his hometown, Yorkville, Ill. and propelled a political career that culminated in one of the most powerful jobs in Washington. But the sport he loved also gave him proximity and opportunity for what prosecutors say was a pattern of sexual abuse of boys while serving as their high school coach. Now, as a federal judge prepares to sentence Mr. Hastert next week on charges that he illegally made secret payments to cover up the misconduct  —   a former wrestler who said Mr. Hastert abused him decades ago is expected to speak at the hearing  —   the weight of his transgressions is falling hard on former colleagues and constituents. But it is the   wrestling community that is struggling most to come to terms with its sense of betrayal. “It is just hard to find the words it is just such an awful thing,” said Mike Moyer, executive director of the National Wrestling Coaches Association, who has known Mr. Hastert for nearly 20 years. “It runs so contrary to the dedicated support that Denny gave to the wrestling community over so many years. ” On Capitol Hill, Mr. Hastert was known as “Coach,” and one Republican aide attributed his rise to speaker in 1998 to an ability to “bring the team together in the locker room and motivate them to get things done. ” Mr. Hastert hired former wrestlers as top aides. For more than a decade, he used clout in Congress to fight Title IX, the landmark federal law that requires equitable opportunities for men and women to participate in college sports, arguing that it was hurting wrestling by forcing cutbacks. He used campaign funds to support wrestling causes. He intervened in a dozen cases to try to save college wrestling programs. “Who would have guessed that a wrestling coach from Kendall County in Illinois would be the   Republican speaker of the House of Representatives in all our nation’s history?” Mr. Hastert said, announcing his retirement from Congress in 2007 in front of the county courthouse in his hometown, where three decades earlier he and his state championship wrestling team had been honored with a parade. Mr. Hastert, who is 74 and suffered a stroke in November, has pleaded guilty to violating bank reporting requirements, but was not charged with abuse, for which statutes of limitation would have prohibited criminal charges. Prosecutors for the first time this month provided details of the abuse of at least four wrestling team members, one as young as 14, that they said occurred on training tables, in a locker room and in a hotel room. One of the wrestlers recalled how Mr. Hastert put a reclining chair in view of the showers in the locker room, where Mr. Hastert sat “while the boys showered. ” The “known acts,” the prosecutors said, consisted of “intentional touching of minors’ groin area and genitals or oral sex with a minor. ” His lawyer, Thomas Green, said Mr. Hastert acknowledged committing “transgressions” decades ago, for which, the lawyer said, Mr. Hastert was “profoundly sorry. ” Mr. Hastert first took up wrestling in high school, bulking up while carrying   feed bags from the farm supply business his father operated in rural Illinois. After graduating from Wheaton College, a nearby Christian liberal arts school where he was on the wrestling team, Mr. Hastert became a teacher and wrestling coach at Yorkville High School. He built the Yorkville Foxes into a powerhouse program that won 11 straight conference titles, produced eight Illinois state champion wrestlers and, in 1976, the Illinois team championship  —   an accomplishment Mr. Hastert has described as “among the finest moments of my life. ” “I love this sport and the kids I coached,” Mr. Hastert told a congressional committee years later. Local power brokers saw political appeal in his coaching success, encouraging him to run for the state legislature, and then Congress. Sometime after his arrival in Washington, Mr. Hastert named Bryan L. Harbin, one of his former wrestlers, to his staff. Mr. Harbin, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment, continued to serve as an aide to Hastert for most of his congressional tenure. As Mr. Hastert rose through the House Republican leadership, he also amassed substantial campaign funds, and he used some of that money to support the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and the wrestling program at Manchester College in Indiana, run by a longtime friend and fellow wrestler, Thomas S. Jarman, whom Mr. Hastert also later hired onto his congressional staff. Mr. Jarman did not respond to messages seeking comment. When the Republicans took control of the House in 1994, Mr. Hastert was named chief deputy whip. From his new position of power, he began a yearslong campaign against Title IX. Mr. Hastert wrote letters to the Department of Education, called for an investigation by the Government Accountability Office, and repeatedly introduced legislation to curb cutbacks to wrestling. “It really disturbs me when people claim that it is fine to cut opportunities for men to eradicate discrimination,” Mr. Hastert testified in May 1995 at a House hearing that he had helped set up to examine the impact of the 1972 law. The National Collegiate Athletic Association called Mr. Hastert’s 1998 legislative proposal an “unparalleled federal intrusion into the   and budgetary process of the nation’s colleges and universities. ” The provision, which would have required colleges to report annually if they had any plans to cut funding for any athletic team, was ultimately cut from the education bill. But Mr. Hastert did not give up. He joined an effort organized by the National Wrestling Coaches Association to challenge universities or colleges that cut funding for the sport, even appearing before the Pennsylvania state legislature in 2007 to push for more funding for wrestling programs there. By this point, Mr. Hastert, a hero to the sport, had been inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. While in Congress, Mr. Hastert also was an outspoken advocate for severe punishment of anyone convicted of abusing minors. He helped push legislation in 2006 that required states to expand sex offender registers, as he declared that “protecting our children from Internet predators and child exploitation enterprises are just as high a priority as securing our border from terrorists. ” The ties to wrestling continued even after Mr. Hastert left Congress. Two of his three staff members in the House Office of the Former Speaker  —   an office he set up in Yorkville funded by the federal government  —   were former wrestlers. Wheaton College opened the J. Dennis Hastert Center for Economics, Government, and Public Policy. Its director, starting in 2010, was Seth Norton, the former head wrestling coach at Wheaton College. Mr. Hastert also set up a consulting firm working with an Illinois businessman, David John, a former Wheaton College wrestler who had worked with Mr. Hastert to pressure the college president to reverse a plan to eliminate funding for the school’s wrestling program. The former speaker frequently attended a wrestling tournament that Mr. John ran at Wheaton College, and Mr. John also saw him at the national collegiate wrestling championship every March. “He absolutely loved being in that environment,” Mr. John said. In 2013, Mr. Hastert returned to the State Capitol in Springfield, delivering a valedictory on his career on the State House floor, where he also urged legislators there to pass a resolution condemning the decision by International Olympic Committee to drop wrestling as an Olympic sport after the 2016 games. “I can only look at the opportunity I had when I was a young man,” Mr. Hastert said, just before the Illinois House voted to pass the Olympic resolution. “I had a coach and an opportunity to perform. ” Since the allegations of abuse became public last year, former wrestling champions, coaches and parents of student wrestlers are still trying to reconcile the painful new images now associated with Mr. Hastert’s name. The Denny Hastert Yorkville Invitational annual wrestling tournament has already been renamed, as has the center at Wheaton College that was named after him. A campaign has started to have Mr. Hastert removed from the Wrestling Hall of Fame. Mr. Kocher, the University of Chicago coach, declined to comment when asked about his letter defending Mr. Hastert from a decade ago. But other coaches said the turn of events had caused tremendous sadness and confusion. Tony Houle, who was Mr. Hastert’s assistant wrestling coach at Yorkville High from 1975 until Mr. Hastert moved on to politics, said the entire situation was “mystifying” to him, in part because of how devoted to and focused on the sport Mr. Hastert always seemed to be. Larry Kristoff, a   Olympic wrestler and a former Southern Illinois University wrestling coach, who worked closely with Mr. Hastert for decades on wrestling causes, said he was similarly confused, and hurt, by what had happened. “I haven’t come to terms with it  —   I am not sure there is a way I ever can, really,” said Mr. Kristoff, 73. “Wrestling can get over a lot of things. One issue won’t tumble it. It is more the man himself  —   wrestling has been a part of his whole life. ” Federal prosecutors had a somewhat different take on the matter, saying that Mr. Hastert’s career is “marred by stunning hypocrisy. ” “While defendant achieved great success, reaping all the benefits that went with it,” Zachary T. Fardon, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, wrote in a court filing this month, “these boys struggled, and all are still struggling now with what defendant did to them. ”",0

18780,Al-Qaeda's Assault on Aleppo Continues Despite Lack of Progress,"Al-Qaeda's Assault on Aleppo Continues Despite Lack of Progress 
Rebels are doing a lot of dying but not taking much ground so far Print Originally appeared at The Moon of Alabama 
For four days now al-Qaeda in Syria (aka Jabhat al Nusra aka Fatah al-Sham) and assorted other ""rebel"" groups have tried to attack Aleppo from the west to break the siege on al-Qaeda associated groups in east-Aleppo. The New York Times in now openly admitting that CIA supported groups are acting under al-Qaeda's operational command. The piece though, which belonged on page one, was in the back of the paper. There is no public outcry over this disturbing fact. 
The attack on west-Aleppo had been talked about for over two weeks and the defenders are well prepared. waleppoattack.jpg 

As can be seen on the map above the areas al-Qaeda and its allies managed to capture so far are only small rural outskirts. Every attempt to attack actual city estate under roof was repelled by the defenders. Small infiltrations like shown in the map were immediately cleaned up. The marked area is back in the hands of the Syrian army. It is estimated that the several thousand attackers have so far lost more than 500 men. A 1,000 more are likely injured. Every attack has to be carried over mostly open land and is received by heavy artillery fire. Air attacks ravage their supply and preparation ares. 
The attackers launched over 20 suicide-vehicle bombs so far but only a few reached their targets and their damage was limited. Yesterday one suicide vehicle bomb, ready to be launched for a new attack, was hit by a missile from a Syrian helicopter and exploded at its preparation and launching position. Over 60 ""rebels"" were killed by it and their attack had to be call off. 
The good news is that the defense is holding. The bad news is that the al-Qaeda ""rebels"" received huge amounts of artillery missiles and launchers from their ""western"" and Gulf sponsors. Several hundred have been launched at the densely populated areas of west-Aleppo. More than a 100 civilians have been killed by them and several hundred civilians were wounded. Some of the missiles contained gas and people had to be taken to hospital with extreme breathing difficulties. The UN envoy condemned these attacks as ""possible war crimes"". 
The whole attack operation was launched under the direct supervision of al-Qaeda in Syria leader Abu Muhammad al-Golani. He was shown in pictures at the ""rebel"" headquarter of the attack discussing further operations. 
Despite any progress on their part the al-Qaeda forces seem far from giving up. More attacks to break the siege are expected. We can be sure that some of their surprises are still in store. But the defenders are ready and the Syrian army is said to prepare for a large counter operation which may include a serious effort to liberate east-Aleppo of the al-Qaeda occupation. 
Other fronts in Syria are relatively quiet. The Turks have been told by Russia to stop all air attacks within Syria. The message has been received. The Turkish plan to occupy Al Bab east of Aleppo is unlikely to happen as it would be out of range of the Turkey based artillery and have no air support. The U.S. would like to go to Raqqa but has no proxy ground force to do that. Some Obama officials are now arguing for more U.S. boots on the ground in Syria. Will Obama agree to that mission creep?",0

18782,"In ‘Brexit’ Vote, David Cameron Faces Problem of His Own Making - The New York Times","LONDON  —   David Cameron, the British prime minister, has no one to blame but himself. In 2013, besieged by the increasingly assertive   Union wing of his own Conservative Party, Mr. Cameron made a promise intended to keep a   peace among the Tories before the 2015 general election: If   he would hold an    referendum on continued British membership in the bloc. But what seemed then like a relatively   ploy to deal with a   political problem has metastasized into an issue that could badly damage Britain’s economy, influence the country’s direction for generations  —   and determine Mr. Cameron’s political fate. As the nation prepares to vote on Thursday, the betting markets are signaling that Britain will choose to remain in Europe, but polls suggest that the outcome is still too close to call. On Tuesday, speaking in front of No. 10 Downing Street, Mr. Cameron warned that a decision to leave would be an “irreversible” choice. Appealing to older voters, many of whom tend to favor leaving Europe, Mr. Cameron urged them to think about what they would bequeath to the next generation. “Above all it is about our economy,” he said. The bluff, ruddy Mr. Cameron is famously lucky, having pulled out   victories in numerous other scrapes. But in this case, many analysts say, he will be damaged goods even if he wins, with rivals circling to succeed him and Conservatives more divided than ever. If he loses, he will come under pressure to resign, and even if he hangs on for some portion of the four years left in his government’s term, whatever substantive legacy he might have built will be lost to what many consider to be a wholly unnecessary roll of the dice. Martin Wolf, the economic columnist of The Financial Times, wrote that “this referendum is, arguably, the most irresponsible act by a British government in my lifetime. ” Summarizing the nearly unanimous opinion of economists that a British exit  —   “Brexit”  —   would be followed by a major shock and permanent loss of growth, he concluded: “The outcome might well prove devastating. ” Mr. Cameron argues that the referendum had to be called to resolve the festering debate over Britain and the European Union. As in the Scottish referendum on independence in 2014, he says, this vote represents a “great festival of democracy” on a very difficult and divisive topic. But if the Scottish referendum turned nasty, and kept the United Kingdom together, this one has become poisonous, with Mr. Cameron’s own cabinet colleagues and supposed friends saying that he has eroded trust in politics, portraying him as a liar and acting like a government in waiting. It has been a campaign punctuated by numerous claims that have little relationship to the facts, with sharp tones of xenophobia, racism, nativism and Islamophobia. And it was marked tragically last Thursday by the assassination of a young Labour member of Parliament, Jo Cox, who fiercely supported remaining in the union. On Tuesday evening, some of that bitterness surfaced in a fiery television debate in which London’s new mayor, Sadiq Khan, who wants Britain to remain in the bloc, said that the campaign of his opponents “hasn’t been project fear, it’s been project hate as far as immigration is concerned. ” Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, said that Mr. Cameron “has made the case against himself, and he’s damaged either way. ” The prime minister presumably thought it would be an easy win for the “Remain” forces, Mr. Fielding added. “But it’s far tighter than anyone thought,” he said, “and rather than a salve on the Tory party, it’s made the fever worse. ” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, is slightly less harsh. “It’s really a binary legacy” for Mr. Cameron, he said. “It is either one that ends in almost complete failure or one that seems pretty respectable in electoral and policy terms. I can’t think of another prime minister who had so much riding on one decision. ” If the Remain campaign loses, “the chances of him staying on are pretty remote,” Professor Bale said. “He will go down as the person who miscalculated, taking us out of Europe almost by mistake, and then shuffled off the stage” in “a pretty ignominious exit. ” Even if Britain votes to stay in the bloc, Mr. Bale said, given Mr. Cameron’s small parliamentary majority, “the number of   euroskeptics and   he’ll be subject to defeats and blackmail until he steps down. ” There are those who support the contention that Mr. Cameron had to call this referendum in the face of Tory division and the rise of the U. K. Independence Party and its leader, Nigel Farage. UKIP was cutting into the Conservative vote by arguing, as the “Leave” campaign does now, that Britain could limit immigration and control its own borders only by leaving the European Union. Mr. Cameron, who had repeatedly pledged to get immigration down to the “tens of thousands”  —   even though last year net migration was some 330, 000 people  —   never had a persuasive answer to the immigration question. To pacify the growing number of   Union Tories, keep his leadership position and undermine UKIP, he promised this referendum if he won the 2015 election, which he did by a larger margin than expected. Even before the election, some, like Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House and a supporter of the Remain movement, argued that a referendum would come at some point, and that it would be more easily won under Mr. Cameron and the Tories. Charles Lewington, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, said there had to be a referendum. By 2013, he said, “there was tremendous pressure for an   referendum and not just from the old guard. ” Mr. Lewington cited growing concern from Conservative members of Parliament that they were at risk of losing their seats in districts where UKIP was strong. Given the panic in the party, he said, “I don’t think he could have avoided making an   manifesto commitment. ” But Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, is less sure. “Cameron didn’t need to do it,” Professor Travers said. Like Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister who organized a referendum on Europe in 1975, Mr. Cameron began the referendum as an exercise in “internal party discipline,” he said. It was called “for party reasons more than national ones,” he added. Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill’s grandson, a friend of Mr. Cameron’s and a Tory legislator, was more scathing about the failure of several Conservative leaders to confront, rather than appease, the   Tory euroskeptics. “If you have an Alsatian sitting in front of you, and it growls at you and bares its teeth, there are two ways of dealing with it,” Mr. Soames said in an interview with the British website Conservativehome. “You can pat it on the head, in which case it’ll bite you, or you can kick it really hard. ” “Successive prime ministers, and it’s not the present prime minister alone, have never understood that they have to take these people on,” Mr. Soames said. If the Remain side loses, both Mr. Cameron and his deputy, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, are likely to be gone within months, Mr. Lewington said. While all denying any ambition to replace Mr. Cameron, the sharks are in the water, led by Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and a prominent campaigner for leaving the European Union. But the winner of such contests in the Tory party is rarely the one who wields the knife, and while Mr. Johnson would seem to lead the race, his success is far from assured.",0
18783,Citigroup bank chose Obama’s 2008 cabinet – WikiLeaks,"  Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Citigroup bank chose Obama’s 2008 cabinet – WikiLeaks By VNN on October 31, 2016 The single biggest beneficiary was Citigroup, which was given $45 billion in cash in the form of a government stock purchase, plus a $306 billion government guarantee to back up its worthless mortgage-related assets. Obama’s cabinet – 2008 
WSWS.Org. 
One month before the presidential election of 2008, the giant Wall Street bank Citigroup submitted to the Obama campaign a list of its preferred candidates for cabinet positions in an Obama administration. This list corresponds almost exactly to the eventual composition of Barack Obama’s cabinet. 
The memorandum, revealed by WikiLeaks in a recent document release from the email account of John Podesta, who currently serves as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, was written by Michael Froman, who was then an executive with Citigroup and currently serves as US trade representative. The email is dated Oct. 6, 2008 and bears the subject line “Lists.” It went to Podesta a month before he was named chairman of President-Elect Obama’s transition team. Why is this Ex-Citigroup Executive Pushing TPP “Fast Track”? 
The email was sent at the height of the financial meltdown that erupted after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15 . Even as Citigroup and its Wall Street counterparts were dragging the US and world economy into its deepest crisis since the 1930s, they remained, as the email shows, the real power behind the façade of American democracy and its electoral process. 
Froman’s list proved remarkably prescient. As it proposed, Robert Gates, a Bush holdover, became secretary of Defense; Eric Holder became attorney general; Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security; Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff; Susan Rice, United Nations ambassador; Arne Duncan, secretary of Education; Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services; Peter Orszag, head of the Office of Management and Budget; Eric Shinseki, secretary of Veterans Affairs; and Melody Barnes, chief of the Domestic Policy Council. 
For the highly sensitive position of secretary of the Treasury, three possibilities were presented: Robert Rubin and Rubin’s close disciples Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner. Obama chose Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Geithner, along with Bush Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs CEO) Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, had played the leading role in organizing the Wall Street bailout. 
Rubin had served as Treasury secretary in the Bill Clinton administration from 1995 until 1999, when he was succeeded by Summers. In that capacity, Rubin and Summers oversaw the dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933), which had imposed a legal wall separating commercial banking from investment banking. Immediately after leaving Treasury, Rubin became a top executive at Citigroup, remaining there until 2009. 
A notable aspect of the Froman memo is its use of identity politics. Among the Citigroup executive’s lists of proposed hires to Podesta were a “Diversity List” including “African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level,” in Froman’s words, and “a similar document on women.” Froman also took diversity into account for his White House cabinet list, “probability-weighting the likelihood of appointing a diverse candidate for each position.” This list concluded with a table breaking down the 31 assignments by race and gender. 
Citigroup’s recommendations came just three days after then-President George W. Bush signed into law the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which allocated $700 billion in taxpayer money to rescue the largest Wall Street banks. 
The single biggest beneficiary was Citigroup, which was given $45 billion in cash in the form of a government stock purchase, plus a $306 billion government guarantee to back up its worthless mortgage-related assets. The President and Wall Street – 2008 
Then-presidential candidate Obama played a critical political role in shepherding the massively unpopular bank bailout through Congress. 
The September financial crash convinced decisive sections of the US corporate-financial elite that the Democratic candidate of “hope” and “change” would be better positioned to contain popular opposition to the bailout than his Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona. 
As president, Obama not only funneled trillions of dollars to the banks, he saw to it that not a single leading Wall Street executive faced prosecution for the orgy of speculation and swindling that led to the financial collapse and Great Recession, and he personally intervened to block legislation capping executive pay at bailed-out firms. 
The same furtive and corrupt process is underway in relation to a new U.S. administration. 
Froman’s email is one of many thousands released by WikiLeaks from the account of Podesta. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE’S “PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER” HACKED 
Those communications, such as the Froman email, which expose who really rules America, have been virtually ignored by the media. 
The pro-Democratic Party New Republic called attention to it in an article published Friday , but the story has received little if any further coverage. 
The media has instead focused on salacious details of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s sexual activities, designed, in part, to divert attention from the substance of the Clinton campaign-related emails being released by WikiLeaks and other sources. 
The New Republic drew attention to the Froman memo not because it opposes such machinations, but as a warning to the interests it represents that they must move now to influence the eventual composition of a Hillary Clinton administration. 
“If the 2008 Podesta emails are any indication, the next four years of public policy are being hashed out right now, behind closed doors,” wrote New Republic author David Dayen. “And if liberals want to have an impact on that process, waiting until after the election will be too late.”",0

18785,THE CLINTON/VATICAN/TEHRAN AXIS,"Robert Spencer 
Breitbart reported Saturday that among the many revealing and damning emails that WikiLeaks has revealed from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, one has “White House chief of staff Denis McDonough responding favorably to an email forwarded to him by Podesta from a leftwing ‘Catholic’ organization that said it was arranging meetings with Catholic prelates to urge them to press U.S. senators to vote for the Iran Treaty.” 
This plan was apparently hatched by Fred Rotondaro, chairman of the far-Left and Catholic-in-name-only Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good (CACG), as well as a senior fellow with Podesta’s Soros-funded “Islamophobia” propaganda organ, the Center for American Progress. 
Rotondaro wrote to Podesta and others in the Clinton camp: 
John, 
I thought you might be interested in this report from the CACG exec director Chris Hale on efforts to have the Catholic org community promote the Iran Treaty. There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter Faith orgs including the ability to reach some working class voters,

Hale wrote in his report: 
Our advertisement began running on National Catholic Reporter and Commonweal yesterday. Right now, when you click the advertisement, the link takes you to MoveOn’s 60 Day to Stop A War Take Action website. From there, you are able to dial into your Member of Congress and request them to support the Iran Deal. 
At some point today, that link will change to our own website, which will list all the groups’ names, simple talking points, and give people a chance to dial in three elected officials (their one US Representatives and two Senators). While the MoveOn site is very effective, ours will ensure that people calling into the offices identify as a person of faith, which is important in both our narrative creation (Catholics support the deal) and coalition building (the God Squad takes action).

18786,White House Strengthens DHS’ New Border Security Directives - Breitbart,"White House lawyers have strengthened two immigration enforcement memos from the Department of Homeland Security which end President Barack Obama’s    border policies. [The comprehensive border security reforms of Obama’s   policies were signed by DHS chief Gen. John Kelly on Feb. 17. After a review by White House lawyers, the memos were changed to give officials more leeway in enforcing immigration laws, and more authority to close a   “advance parole” amnesty created by Obama.  The final memos implement most of President Donald Trump’s popular promises to enforce the nation’s immigration laws, and to accelerate repatriation of criminal illegal immigrants  —   but are being loudly criticized by amnesty advocates. However, the memos also postpone action on his promise to end Obama’s 2012   for younger illegals, his promise to reform the   contract worker program that has now provide work permits for roughly 650, 000 foreign graduates in the United States, and his call for a reduction in the annual inflow of 1 million legal immigrants. The memos direct DHS officials to use an expedited repatriation process for illegals who have been in the United States for up to two years, to return   Mexicans home while their appeals for entry are adjudicated, and to prosecute illegal aliens who hire   to get their children into the United States. Under Obama, officials were only allowed to use the expedited repatriation process for illegals who arrived within the prior two weeks. Also at Obama’s direction,   were released into the United States while border officials considered the appeals for asylum, and border officials were required to partner with the   coyotes by delivering their cargo —  the foreign youths and children —  from the borders to their   parents residing throughout the United States. The Kelly memos also revive the 287( g) program, which helps state and local police force work with DHS agents to enforce the nation’s popular immigration laws. Obama shuttered the 287( g) program in 2014. The memos direct officials to hire an additional 15, 500 immigration officers, and to start building the border fence. The first memo, titled “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest” is six pages long and says that “personnel shall faithfully executive the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens. ” The second memo is focused on immigration enforcement far from the border. The second memo is 13 pages long and is titled “Implementing the President’s Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements Policies. ” Some changes were made to the memos after they were signed by Kelly. For example, the phrase “In my judgment, such [advance parole] authority should be exercised sparingly,” was added to the section in the border security memo that shuts down Obama’s backdoor “advance parole” amnesty process. The enforcement memo adds a section giving   officials more authority to enforce the law, saying “the Director of ICE, the Commissioner of CBP, and the Director of USCIS may, as they determine is appropriate, issue further guidance to allocate appropriate resources to prioritize enforcement activities within these   example, by prioritizing enforcement activities against removable aliens who are convicted felons or who are involved in gang activity or drug trafficking. ” The annual inflow of legal immigrants and contract workers adds roughly 2 million   workers to the labor supply each year, even though 4 million young Americans also begin looking for work each year. In contrast, illegal immigration adds only several hundred thousand workers to the estimated population of at least 11 million illegal aliens each year. The overall inflow of legal and illegal foreign workers transfers roughly $500 billion from employee’s pockets each year to employers and investors.

18787,The Sudden Rise of Lil Yachty - The New York Times,"After 18 years of trying to get noticed, the rapper and teenage eccentric Lil Yachty has been forced recently to practice blending in. It’s mostly the hair. On a recent Saturday, following a dayslong spate of promotional appearances and photo shoots, the    internet supernova, who found fame online and beyond this year with a series of catchy mixtapes and goofy viral moments, hoped to do a little shopping in the heart of Brooklyn. But before he could peacefully enter Kith, the streetwear store that specializes in sneakers and sugary cereal, Lil Yachty needed to hide his trademark accessory: his   skinny braids adorned with clear plastic beads. As his chauffeured S. U. V. approached the buzzing shop, the Atlanta rapper grabbed a knit cap from the head of a friend, who assented without a word, seemingly familiar with the routine. It worked. Locks tucked atop his head, Lil Yachty, whose face is usually obscured by the clacking tentacles, proved unrecognizable even to those who may have binged on his whimsical music videos or Instagram account. Like a millennial Clark Kent, he went unbothered in the maw of his target demographic, drawing stares only as he stacked five pairs of shoes and two art books (“Pharrell,” “KAWS”) by the register. As with the   spree, there was still some thrill in needing to go undercover. “At the beginning of this year, I used to walk through the local mall and say, ‘One day, I’m not going to be able to walk through this mall,’” Lil Yachty said later in the privacy of a Caribbean restaurant, his hair since released. “No way I could walk through the mall now. Unless I’m hiding. ” Last winter, the teenager born Miles McCollum, who had recently dropped out of college and had been arrested in a Florida mall for credit card fraud, was hoping to shake his anonymity. Rapping was a relatively new pastime (it still is) though striving for fame came naturally to a diligent student of social networks. “I always knew I was going to be something,” he said. “I didn’t know what. ” Now, at the end of a   2016, Lil Yachty seems more certain. “I’m not a rapper, I’m an artist,” he said. “And I’m more than an artist. I’m a brand. ” The stats back him up. In addition to releasing the popular “Lil Boat” and “Summer Songs 2” mixtapes, filled with his taffylike digital wails and cartoon melodies, and reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 with his    guest verse on D. R. A. M.’s “Broccoli,” Lil Yachty has modeled Kanye West’s Yeezy line at Madison Square Garden, starred in a Sprite commercial with LeBron James and teamed up with Nautica on a capsule collection for Urban Outfitters. An official debut album with Capitol Records is planned for early 2017. Yet even among the bevy of singular voices in the new Atlanta   scene, where male rappers can wear dresses and carry designer bags, moan about their feelings and dance with their hips, Lil Yachty is demonstrably odd, flaunting his indifference to rap traditionalism and aiming to remain somewhat wholesome: more schoolyard than trap house. “Rappers don’t have endorsements because of their images,” he said. “Endorsement money is huge. And I care about my character. ” He added: “I don’t rap about drinking or smoking, ever, because I don’t do it. I don’t rap about anything I don’t do. ” Instead, Lil Yachty preaches an   positivity fueled by timeless adolescent ambitions: chasing girls, looking cool and hanging out with friends. (Lil Yachty’s crew is known as the Sailing Team: “If you’re a fan of me, then you know my friends, because I push them just as hard. ”) His most menacing raps can feel playful, his sexuality disarmingly juvenile and his boasts betray his age: “Parents mad at my ass ’cause their kids sing my song in class,” he taunts while proclaiming himself the King of the Teens. “We are the youth!” goes another battle cry. As with his breakout viral hits “1 Night” and “Minnesota,” Lil Yachty’s music relies less on technical rapping than on simple melodies that invoke warped nursery rhymes, with bright, bubbly production and an affecting falsetto smoothed with  . Along with Kanye West and Kid Cudi, both of whom count as elder statesmen to someone born in 1997, his most direct influences include the   outre internet rappers Lil B and Soulja Boy, along with pop acts like Coldplay, Daft Punk and Fall Out Boy. While modeling for Nautica last month to his own personal playlist, Lil Yachty mimed air guitar to “Paradise City” by Guns N’ Roses and boogied to Elton John’s “Bennie and the Jets” when he wasn’t belting Chris Martin ballads. Between looks, he dined on his preferred menu of Domino’s pepperoni pizza, candy and cookies, head buried in his two Louis   iPhones. (One had a   message: “LETS BE RICH FOREVER. ”) At the same time, Lil Yachty’s stated indifference toward the catalogs of Tupac and the Notorious B. I. G. has made him a punching bag for rap purists, the poster child for a    new school dismissively dubbed “mumble rap. ” He’s leaned into that mantle, so online schadenfreude bubbles up every time Lil Yachty, say, bombs a freestyle over ’90s beats or fails miserably at dunking a basketball. “I ask myself all the time, ‘How do I always go viral? ’” Lil Yachty said with a grin. “I’m the face of the youth, the new sound. Nobody likes my truth. ” Except the youth, that is. “They relate to me because I’m so like them,” he said, “but on a global scale. ” Music, it turns out, was something of an afterthought, despite his deep roots in Southern rap. Though he was raised mostly by his mother in the Atlanta suburb Austell, his father, Shannon McCollum, lived in the city and worked as a photographer with local acts such as Outkast, Goodie Mob and Lil Jon. But hanging around stars as a child bolstered Lil Yachty’s sense of style and business acumen more than his sense of   history. “I would let him help direct photo shoots, and I would always show him my invoices so he could see what I made,” Mr. McCollum, 46, said. “I used to photograph Miles every week. By 3 or 4, he was so comfortable in front of a camera. ” An obsession with fashion followed. “Once, when he was about 7, we were picking up his friend, and Miles had on a pink polo shirt,” his father recalled. “The little boy got in the back seat and started laughing uncontrollably at Miles, calling him a girl. Miles just said, ‘You don’t know nothing about this, man. ’” In high school, influenced by the bright colors favored by Pharrell Williams and Tyler, the Creator, Lil Yachty would spend the money he earned working at McDonald’s or as an assistant to his father at thrift stores. “  cents, 50 cents, I just knew how to put it together,” he said. His mother even taught him to sew. His confidence and originality helped to win over his eventual manager, Coach K, an Atlanta stalwart who has worked with Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane and Migos. “It was like your first meeting with Marilyn Manson,” Coach K said of encountering Lil Yachty. “You’ve got this freakish look, but he’s not scared of who he is. He’s wearing it with pride. Instantly I said, ‘This is it. ’” Lil Yachty had already determined that packaging a mystique was his strong suit. After graduating from high school, he traveled repeatedly to New York and Los Angeles  —   his father’s day job at Delta gave him access to free flights  —   where he slept on couches and worked to ingratiate himself with   tastemakers like Ian Connor and Luka Sabbat. “I was simply trying to get people who had an audience to hang out with me, so that I could get that audience,” Lil Yachty said. “I was making music, but I wasn’t really pushing it yet. I knew exactly how it worked. ” He corrected himself. “I know exactly how it works. ” Still, even he has been surprised by the speed of his ascent. “It just feels like a dream,” he said, recalling that in January, he couldn’t make it past the door of Kanye’s studio. “I sat in the hallway for hours while ASAP Rocky was in there. They wouldn’t let me in. By August, I was working with him. ” Nautica, too, came calling only after a year of Lil Yachty’s attempting to get the maritime brand’s attention via social media. It was backstage among the V. I. P.s at Jay Z’s Made in America festival in September that Lil Yachty’s new reality started to sink in. “Obama’s daughters knew who I was,” he said. “They were huge fans. Jay Z said my name to me before I introduced myself. ” And yet, persona aside, a teenager can only be a teenager. At an Urban Outfitters    in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, among decidedly less dazzling guests, the rapper hid once again behind his hair and phone as overeager young fans offered him anything they could find to autograph: $5 bills, laptops, water bottles, purses, coats and, yes, eventually breasts. Not yet immune to such attention at close range, Lil Yachty could only giggle to himself, shaking his head as he mouthed the words to his own music.",0
18788,How New York Took Primary Day: Personally - The New York Times,"From fish markets in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to coffee shops in Chappaqua, New Yorkers made Tuesday’s election, like so many other things, all about themselves  —   their personal idiosyncrasies, their campaigns for social justice, their immigrant journeys and their settling of old political scores. Eager to expound on a contest with opinions that until now nobody had really asked for, they described their preferences at the ballot box with a combination of New York    emotion and parochialism. A Manhattan actor was eager to punish Bill Clinton for the sin of mocking Barack Obama eight years ago in South Carolina. (His choice: Bernie Sanders.) A retiree wanted to align herself with Ted Cruz because they shared so much. (“I’m Hispanic,” she explained. “I’m voting for Ted. ”) An immigrant from Britain tried to   tug the Republican Party to the left with a vote for John Kasich. “I’m not really a Republican,” the man, a    screenwriter named Mayuran Tiruchelvam, confided as he explained his electoral calculations outside a polling site on West 101st Street. “I want to ensure that the least socially conservative candidate is the nominee. ” Across the state, on a balmy April day conducive to higher voter turnout, millions of voters showed up for presidential primaries that bestowed an unfamiliar role on New York: potential kingmaker at a point when party nominations have usually been sewn up. “I can’t remember the last time the New York primary actually mattered,” said Bill Weeden, 75, a Manhattan Democrat who has voted religiously, and with little impact on the primary process, for decades. “This time, we count. ” The reality produced an unusually intensive campaign in which candidates from both parties lavished their time and attention on frequently overlooked upstate towns like Scotia and Syracuse. But much of the action on Tuesday unfolded in the southern half of the state, where the vast majority of New Yorkers live and where New York City streets were filled with crisscrossing caravans of candidates and their armies of volunteers. The five boroughs became a colorful canvass of campaign fliers and placards as supporters competed, like   real estate agents, to festoon lampposts and subway stairwells with their candidate’s name. In Manhattan, Broadway was a sea of baby blue “Bernie” signs. In the Bronx,   megaphones echoed with Hillary Clinton’s name. For many, dozens of interviews show, this is an oddly intimate campaign. The leading contenders are not the distant,    figures of the past they are recognizable New York characters who were born and raised here, in the case of Mr. Sanders and Donald J. Trump, or now call it home, as with Mrs. Clinton. For Laurie Matthews, 50, a lawyer in Chappaqua, a wealthy suburb to the city’s north, the political was very personal: Mrs. Clinton is a neighborhood fixture whom she bumps into at Starbucks. “Some say she’s very cold,” Ms. Matthews said, “but in this environment she’s very warm. ” Across the state, voters expressed anger and confusion over rules that forbade independents to vote in Tuesday’s primaries, foiling plans to cast ballots for the popular candidacies of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. In a small fish market on Lee Avenue, a commercial artery of the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Williamsburg, Emerich Tauber, 69, said he wanted to vote for Mr. Trump. The problem: He is a registered Democrat. “He’s crazy. But we need change,” Mr. Tauber said as he stood beside tubs of live carp. “He can do it. ” He dismissively waved off the Democrats. “The old guy  —   surely not,” he said, reducing Mr. Sanders, a senator, to a demographic.   and   with a candidate, guided many. The Vasconi family on Staten Island drove to the polls together and voted for Mr. Trump together. Danny Vasconi, 57, is a retired police officer, and his son, Nicholas, is a current member of the force. What bound them to Mr. Trump, they said, was his unflinching support for police officers, firefighters and military personnel. “I think having a president who supports our police is a major thing,” said Nicholas Vasconi, 24. Throughout New York City, individual voters kept finding ways to defy this year’s conventional wisdoms: that Jewish neighborhoods would uniformly vote Democratic that Republicans would find little support in boroughs like the Bronx and that black communities were widely skeptical of Mr. Sanders. “Bernie supports black people, plain and simple,” said Corey Smith, 30, a black hotel worker in the midst of a shave at the Gabaron Barber Shop on 116th Street in Harlem. Mr. Smith has an    son, and he said Mr. Sanders’s plan for free college tuition appealed to him. Besides, he added, he couldn’t get past Mrs. Clinton’s support of the 1994 crime bill. Outside the Mitchell Community Center in the Bronx, Edda Reyes, 74, a pastor’s daughter who moved to New York from Puerto Rico when she was 10, explained why she was voting for Mr. Cruz: a shared heritage and a disgust for his Republican rival Mr. Trump. She grew agitated at the mere mention of the New York businessman’s name. “He a racist,” she said, pointing to his plans to build a wall at the border between Mexico and the United States. During choir practice at her nearby church, that consensus is unmistakable, she said. “In the choir, nobody likes Trump. ” Of course, this being New York, consensus was elusive on Tuesday. And voluble arguments were inevitable. So it was that on West 72nd Street on Tuesday, two close friends, retirees and Democrats who had met through a Jewish men’s group, made the mistake of discussing how they had voted. Mark Fleischer, 79, favored Mrs. Clinton Abraham Hershow, 88, backed Mr. Sanders. “Sanders,” said Mr. Fleischer, “I can’t stand how he talks and we don’t need a socialist. That leaves me with Hillary, I guess. She’s experienced and I like her husband. ” Mr. Hershow shook his head emphatically. “I can’t stand someone who takes hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches,” he said, referring to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Fleischer cut him off. “How come?” he pressed his friend. “Good for her. ” “Look, look, the issue here is money and power,” Mr. Hershow shot back. “Just read Paul Krugman. ” Mr. Fleischer rolled his eyes. “You know what?” said Mr. Hershow. “We should avoid talking politics if we’re going to remain friends. ” On that they could agree, allowing Mr. Fleischer to move on to the next order of business. “Oh shut up!” he yelled at a man who sped by on a motorcycle.",0
18789,Scandalous Poll: 84% of Ukrainians want Putin as their president - Fort Russ,"Scandalous Poll: 84% of Ukrainians want Putin as their president November 13, 2016 - Fort Russ - Zavtra - translated by J. Arnoldski - The Ukrainian publication Nedelya.UA conducted a poll among its readers asking the following question: “Which politician would you entrust with the governance of your country?” The survey was participated in by 41,600 readers and showed the following figures: 84% (34,900) of Ukrainian respondents want to see Vladimir Putin as president of Ukraine. In second place with 5% (2,000) was Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Third place with 2% (820) was claimed by Xi Jinping and fourth, also with 2% (708) was leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The current president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, took 5th place with only 1% (538 votes). Further down the list were German Chancellor Angela Merkel (1%, 430 votes), the chairman of the French National Front Marine Le Pen (1%, 426 votes), Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev (1%, 318), and US President Barack Obama (1%, 244 votes). Notably enough, former Georgian president and until recently head of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, was not included on the list. According to doctor of economic sciences and director of the Institute for Problems of Globalization, Mikhail Delyakin, the results are not representative. The expert remarked: “Without a doubt, the figures are unrepresentative: not only Ukrainians could take part in the voting, and the audience of the site speaks Russian - there is no Ukrainian version. At the same time, it is hardly likely, for example, that the Russian readers of this Ukrainian site are supporters of Putin. They are most likely fans of Bandera.” “On the other hand, the main part of Ukraine (including Banderites) speaks Russian, not Ukrainian. This was exposed by Guinness, which conducted an innocent poll on the quality of vegetables and allowed respondents to choose between surveys in Ukrainian or Russian. 77% chose Russian. Since then, this share has declined, but it is still clearly more than half even taking into account the departure of Crimea, the DPR and LPR, and the fact that most educated and cultured, i.e., Russian-speaking Ukrainians have fled to every corner, and mainly Russia, from this ‘victorious democracy’ and the European Nazi course,” Delyagin pointed out. “Nevertheless, it might be that overall these figures reflect the real mood of those Ukrainians who have been brutalized by the complete nobody thieves and killers imposed upon them by the West as their leaders. For the same motives, the most respected political leader in Russia is Stalin. Respect for Putin even sometimes appears among Russophobes who think: ‘With such a leader, we would have long ago defeated those Moskals,” Delyagin continued. The economist concluded with the following commentary: “Of course, this does not mean that the destructive liberal socio-economic policies pursued in Russia by appointees like Medvedev and Navulinnaya are correct. However, against the general backdrop of the nobody leaders of the modern West and its satellites, Putin is really a symbol of reason and hope for a better future for all of humanity, not the rapidly dwindling ‘Golden Billion.’” Follow us on Facebook!

Moore's new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton is -- except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and he's dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. 
This film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the ""Elect her and then hold her accountable"" stuff. He says we have a responsibility to ""support her"" and ""get behind her,"" and that if after two years -- yes, TWO YEARS -- she hasn't lived up to a platform he's fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). 
Moore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars you've put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon   reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictions -- the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. 
Standing before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that ""coziness"" consists of, and he claims that she's more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. 
What? It wasn't one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. It's all the other wars before and since. She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. She is eager to antagonize Russia. She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. She supported President Bill Clinton's wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a ""No Fly"" zone. She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. 
That's just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? 
Moore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. ""I hope she did,"" screams Moore. ""That's who I want as Commander in Chief!"" Hee hee hee. - Advertisement - 
Then Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least ""universal"" healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clinton's focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that it's the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didn't create ""universal"" healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. 
Moore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clinton's progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. 
Mostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates ""that glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass."" Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Moore's inclusive comments throughout his performance: ""We're all Americans, right?"" 
Moore's fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the government -- executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). 
But when he runs for president, Moore says, he'll give everybody free drugs. - Advertisement - 
I'll tell you the Clinton ad I'd like to see. She's standing over a stove holding an egg. ""This is your brain,"" she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. ""This is your brain on partisanship."" hillary and bush",0
18791,"“If Trump Loses, I’m Grabbing My Musket”: Former Congressman Ready to Go Full Revolution","SHTF Plan – by Mac Slavo 
This election remains more heated than any other in modern history – and for many, it has become a call to arms, even if only metaphorically. 
Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies – Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example – and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote – the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence. 
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ‘pick up a musket’ if Trump loses the election. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election. 
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms – racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent. 
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement. 
via CNN : 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. […] 
Walsh … did respond to CNN’s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: “What exactly does that mean?” 
“It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,” he responded to Tapper. @jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back. 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
After a firestorm on social media, Walsh doubled down, stating on Twitter: I'm serious. I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS – just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about. 
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses – acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America. 
Could Hillary’s reported election victory – or Donald Trump’s defeat – signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or “rigged”? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election. 
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest. 
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment’s “selection” for president: 
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny. 
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. 
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre. 
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) – Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed. 
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) – Possible new acronym or term for “Martial Law”. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario. 
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military 
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end. 
How far will things go? 
And will things ever be reset without a new American Revolution?",0
18792,Cuba Confiscates Toys from Christians Looking to Celebrate Feast of Epiphany - Breitbart,"Cuban police stormed into the home of Leticia Ramos Herrería, a member of the Ladies in White dissident group, and confiscated toys the group had collected to distribute in celebration of the Christian feast day of Epiphany. [“Police executed an operation at the home of Leticia Ramos Herrería without her being present and took all the toys away that she had bought to distribute to more than 200 children this Three Kings’ Day,” according to Cuba’s dissident leader Martha Beatriz Roque, using another name common for the holiday.  “They took everything,” Berta Soler, the head of the Ladies in White group, lamented to Martí Noticias. The   Diario de Cuba adds that two of Ramo Herrería’s relatives, her son and brother, were beaten during the siege on her home. While Epiphany is a   holiday, Latin American Catholics and Spaniards hold special celebrations on January 6, the twelfth day of Christmas. The celebration is intended to observe the arrival of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. As the wise men brought gifts with them to the manger, it is traditional to give children toys as presents on this day. The Ladies in White are a group of mothers, daughters, sisters, and wives of Cuban prisoners of conscience. They are a Catholic group, and their main act of protest is to attend Catholic Mass on Sundays dressed in white, then silently march home holding photos of their loved ones, imprisoned for their opposition to Communism. They are not alone in openly celebrating Epiphany as a symbolic protest  —   the family of Danilo Maldonado Machado, an artist known more commonly as “El Sexto,” organized a party for local Havana children on Friday and shared cake and a piñata with them. Maldonado was arrested in November for publicly celebrating the death of dictator Fidel Castro on the streets of Havana. His mother says Cuban police have assaulted him on multiple occasions while in custody, denying him medication to control his asthma. Maldonado was moved to a maximum security prison after repeatedly shouting, “down with Castro,” from his prison cell. He has yet to be charged with a crime. As with most Catholic holidays, the Cuban Communist Party did away with Three Kings’ Day early in its   tenure. According to the Diario de Cuba, the Castro regime only reinstated a version of Three Kings’ Day in the 1990s: Children’s Day, a secular holiday in July meant to combat the influence of a resurgence in Christmas celebrations organized by the Spanish embassy in the country. Private acts of Christian celebration are still subject to censure, however, as in the case of the Ladies in White toy drive. In another instance of Christian oppression, a      man was arrested in 2015 for organizing an inflatable Santa Claus display in Havana. January 6 continues to be a day of celebration, however, and parents do attempt to purchase toys to give their children. Cuba boasts few toy stores, however, with limited supplies at exorbitant prices. An employee of one Cuban toy store estimated to Cubanet that toy prices typically triple shortly before the holiday. While many dissidents adhere to the Christian faith, the Vatican has largely done little to aid their work to liberate the island. Some priests have banned the Ladies in White from attending their Masses, while Pope Francis met with Fidel Castro before his death and called the nonagenarian’s overdue demise “sad news” in a condolence missive to dictator Raúl Castro.",0
18793,FS1’s Rob Parker: Patriots Should ’Whitewash’ the White House - Black Players Should Boycott - Breitbart,"On the Friday Fox Sports 1 “Undisputed” broadcast, contributor Rob Parker weighed in on the New England Patriots players visiting the White House April 19 to celebrate their Super Bowl LI victory over the Atlanta Falcons with President Donald Trump.  Parker called for a White House “whitewash,” saying all of the black Patriots players should boycott the visit. “I think there should be a whitewash at the White House, and I mean black players should boycott the visit,” Parker said. “When a guy shows you his cards and tells you what he thinks of you and your people and minorities in this country, take notice, because he’s telling you the truth. I think if you’re a black player and you’re going there just to take a photo op with the guy who has basically said and done the things that he’s done to this point, what would be the purpose of that?” Parker went on to applaud 2016 Patriots defensive lineman Chris Long, a white player, for not going but said the minority players are the ones who should be boycotting the visit.

18794,How Healthy Are You? G.O.P. Bill Would Help Employers Find Out - The New York Times,"A bill in Congress could make it harder for workers to keep employers from getting access to their personal medical and genetic information and raise the financial penalties for those who opt out of workplace wellness programs. House Republicans are proposing legislation aimed at making it easier for companies to gather genetic data from workers and their families, including their children, when they collect it as part of a voluntary wellness program. The bill, the Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would also significantly increase the financial costs faced by someone who does not join a company wellness program. The bill, which is under review by other House committees and has yet to be considered by the Senate, has already provoked fierce opposition from a wide range of consumer, health and privacy advocacy groups, as well as by House Democrats. Critics claim it undermines existing laws aimed at protecting an individual’s personal medical information from use by employer and others. “We strongly oppose any legislation that would allow employers to inquire about employees’ private genetic information or medical information unrelated to their ability to do their jobs, and to impose draconian penalties on employees who choose to keep that information private,” a group of advocates, including AARP, the American Diabetes Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Epilepsy Foundation, the March of Dimes and others wrote in a letter this week to Ms. Foxx. As wellness programs proliferate across the corporate landscape, workers are increasingly being asked by their companies to undergo health screenings and medical assessments. Employees can opt out of these programs, and personal information specific to a worker is not supposed to be shared directly with the company. The prohibition is aimed at preventing someone from being fired or otherwise discriminated against because of a serious medical condition. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has vigorously pursued legal action against some employers it claimed went too far and used these programs inappropriately, but the courts have largely been sympathetic to the employers’ arguments. Companies also complained that the regulations were confusing, and the commission issued final rules in May aimed at addressing some of their concerns. Companies defend the wellness programs, saying they keep workers healthier and help reduce insurance costs. But some studies have questioned the effectiveness of these initiatives. Critics argue that workers are essentially being coerced into giving up private medical information, such as their weight, their blood pressure and whether they are at particular risk for cancer. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers can entice a worker by offering as much as a 30 percent reduction in insurance payments. Although the financial incentives offered have typically been lower, an employee who refused to participate could lose as much as thousands of dollars in savings. The bill would also weaken the role of the E. E. O. C. in overseeing wellness programs and its ability to prevent violations of antidiscrimination laws established under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act. Employers would be generally governed by rules established by different agencies. The bill “is trying to streamline the regulatory scheme,” said Kathryn Wilber, a senior official at the American Benefits Council, which represents employers’ interests. She said that companies remain committed to protecting the privacy of this information and that employers take this responsibility “very, very seriously. ” Bethany Aronhalt, a spokeswoman for the House committee, said the goal was to address employers’ concerns rather than to drastically change the laws protecting workers. “We want to ensure working families can continue to benefit from these voluntary programs, and so did the Obama administration,” Ms. Aronhalt said. “This legislation will reaffirm existing law and provide regulatory clarity so that employers can have the certainty they need to help lower health care costs for their employees. ” Opponents contend that the bill would leave workers much more vulnerable because the rules under the antidiscrimination laws would not apply if someone volunteered personal health information under a wellness program. “It just takes away the workplace protection,” said Jennifer Mathis, the director of policy and legal advocacy of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. The E. E. O. C. does not comment on pending legislation, a spokeswoman said. The bill would significantly increase the amount of money at stake by allowing an employer to offer higher incentives, up to 30 percent of the cost to cover the whole family, as opposed to 30 percent of an individual’s coverage cost.",0
18795,Stockholm Suspect Was Denied Asylum and Told to Leave in ’16 - The New York Times,"STOCKHOLM  —   The Uzbek man arrested in the terrorism rampage in central Stockholm last week was an asylum seeker whose application was rejected and who in December was given four weeks to leave the country, the Swedish police said on Sunday. The suspect, 39, had shown “sympathy for extremist organizations,” the police said. He applied for permanent residency in 2014, and the Swedish Migration Agency denied his application in June 2016, officials said. The police tried to find him in February of this year to execute the exit order, but he had gone underground, becoming a wanted man, Jonas Hysing, the national strategic commander, said at a news conference on Sunday at the Stockholm police headquarters. “We know that he has shown sympathy for extremist organizations like I. S.,” Mr. Hysing said, referring to the Islamic State terrorist group. On Friday, the man was arrested on suspicion of driving a stolen beer truck that was used to mow down a crowd of people, killing four and injuring 15 others. On Sunday, the police released more information about the victims after informing their next of kin. The dead included two Swedish citizens, one Briton and one Belgian, said Jan Evensson, the strategic commander of the Stockholm police. The father of the British victim told the Swedish newspaper Expressen that his son, Chris Bevington, 41, a senior manager at the streaming music service Spotify, died in the attack. “We are devastated that our talented and thoughtful son Chris is dead,” said the father, John Bevington, according to Expressen. The founder of Spotify, Daniel Ek, who is Swedish, said in a statement posted on his Facebook page that Chris Bevington had worked at Spotify for five years. “There are no words for how missed he will be or for how sad we all are to have lost him like this,” Mr. Ek wrote, adding, “I am as deeply saddened and upset as all of you that something like this could happen in Sweden. ” The police have not provided any more information about the victims. A police spokesman, Kjell Lindgren, said a second person was being held on suspicion of participating in the attack. The assault, in a city known for its tolerance and openness, came after the Swedish Security Service, or Sapo, warned in March in its annual security report that a terrorist acting alone was likely to attack somewhere in the country within a year. Hans Brun, a security expert with the Swedish Defence University, said the police had worried about the possibility of such an assault. “Unfortunately, this type of   attack is something we have been discussing for years,” he said, adding that the police, Sapo and other government agencies had long been preparing, resulting in a   response on Friday. “They put Stockholm under lockdown quite quickly,” Mr. Brun said in a phone interview. “They shut down the subway. They found the perpetrator quickly and, obviously, had some reliable intelligence quite early on. ” The danger is not only that this type of attack is hard to prevent, he said, but also that there are so many people who are willing to do it. “Given the information that the Swedish Security Service has been providing in recent years, there are a couple of hundred people in Sweden who have the capability and the will to carry out these type of attacks,” he said. Since 2010, when Taimour   a disaffected Iraqi Swede, blew himself up on a side street just yards from where Friday’s attack took place, the threat level in Sweden has been three on a scale of five, where three indicates the possibility of an attack and five represents the most serious threat. Magnus Ranstorp, the head of terrorism research at the Swedish Defence University, said that while it was nearly impossible to deter these types of attacks, more could be done to deter potential terrorists. “You need legislation that bites and is effective,” he said. “And that may be solved by criminalizing associating with a terrorist organization. ” Sweden has tightened its laws in recent years to prevent terrorism, and more changes are planned, said Anders Ygeman, the nation’s interior minister. “We have taken the first step, criminalizing traveling to and fighting with a terrorist organization in another country or receiving terrorist training,” Mr. Ygeman said. “The next step is criminalizing participation that is not linked to killing  —   for example, being a chef for or supporting a terrorist organization in another way other than being a part of killing or making bombs. ” Mr. Ygeman said there was broad support in Sweden for this kind of law. As many as 300 people have gone from Sweden to Syria or Iraq to fight with the Islamic State, according to Sapo, and about half that number have returned. So far, there is nothing to indicate that the man in custody had been fighting alongside extremists, Mr. Ygeman said. But the Stockholm police said the man had been able to elude the authorities’ attempts to deport him by giving them an incorrect address.",0
18796,"Roger Ailes Fused TV With Politics, Changing Both - The New York Times","Roger Ailes has died at 77. This assesment of his career by our chief television critic was originally published in July 2016, following the departure of Mr. Ailes from Fox News. American democracy is meant to be  . Presidents win two terms, maximum. Supreme Court justices are one voice among nine (or, currently, eight) senators one in a hundred. To amass the kind of   power that allows you to shape politics and culture geologically, like a river carving out a canyon, you have to go elsewhere. Roger Ailes found that place. At Fox News  —   the outlet Mr. Ailes created, ran and drove like a bullet train for two decades  —   he was a unitary force. And he was not   until Thursday, when he stepped down over charges, which began with a lawsuit by the former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson, that he sexually harassed a series of women over the years. With Fox News, Mr. Ailes introduced a brash,     style that influences much of today’s media. But the closest comparison for him might be less CNN’s Ted Turner than someone like J. Edgar Hoover: a power behind the power, unelected but mighty, outliving administrations and the ebbs and flows of elections, ruling by force and fear. Mr. Ailes was a TV guy before he was a politics guy, and then he became a TV guy again. But he recognized, faster than others, that on some level TV and politics were the same thing. They fed off the same energy and animal spirits. It was Mr. Ailes, then the executive producer of “The Mike Douglas Show,” who persuaded Richard Nixon of the importance of television in the 1968 election. The candidate, who seemed blindsided in 1960 by the new medium, won the presidency through the first modern   campaign. Mr. Ailes became a media guru for Republicans, prodding voters’   centers of emotion and insecurity. For George H. W. Bush in 1988, he produced the sleazy and effective “Revolving Door” ad that tarred Michael Dukakis by association with murderers and rapists. In 1996, he signed on to start a cable news channel for the conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, as dispirited conservatives were looking down the barrel of a second Bill Clinton term. Fox News Channel, not Bob Dole or the Clinton impeachment case, would be conservatism’s next great weapon. Fox News Channel was a business opportunity rolled up in a political argument  —   conservatives’ belief that the news media were aligned against them. Its slogans, “We report, you decide” and “Fair and balanced,” were a wink and a promise. You decide to watch us, we’ll balance this situation out. Fox News gave Mr. Ailes an entire media outlet with which to abet and influence Republican politics, amplifying messages, sounding themes and picking winners. He ran Fox like a political operation, down to its messaging and   tactics against perceived enemies. Fox public relations worked and fought, in the words of the media columnist David Carr of The New York Times, like “a kind of rolling opposition research operation. ” There was a parlor game, among types who covered media, of reading furious missives from Fox to detect the   heat of Mr. Ailes’s personal voice. But Mr. Ailes also shaped TV news in the way that his   generation shaped politics. It was a revolution of tone, production style and manners as much as ideology. Politics and media of the midcentury,   era were shaped by norms of tone and content. You respected certain codes of gravitas. You practiced professional dispassion. You might chase ratings, but you recognized an interest in appearing like something other than entertainment. Even CNN, which shook up the broadcast news paradigm, featured stately battleships of dignity like Bernard Shaw. The idea of Fox News, journalistically and aesthetically, was: screw the norms. What if we just get right up in your face? Yes, a big part of that was political. The Fox model was bifurcated, with conservative hosts dominating prime time. Like the   in “The Blues Brothers” that had “both kinds” of music, “country and western,” it offered a rightist sampler running from Sean Hannity’s   Republicanism to Bill O’Reilly’s pugnacious East Coast populism. The daytime was structured like a standard news report, but it was coded  —   the tone, the choice of topics, the   looks of the anchors  —   that in a way told conservatives they were at home. Fox daytime “played it straight,” was the network’s line. But if you had half an ear, you could pick up the tune. Fox also changed the aesthetics of news, reflecting Mr. Ailes’s   instinct that messaging needs visceral pizazz. The graphics whooshed at you like a Blue Angels flyover. The soundtrack was percussive and martial. On Fox, the news was something to get pumped about, the mood always agitated  —   less Walter Cronkite, more Michael Bay. Fox’s format made a powerful political platform and a good ratings proposition. Traditional programs or stations lived or died on the news cycle. On Fox, there was always reason to watch, some provocation, some grievance, some P. C. liberal somewhere going too far again. After the   attacks, Fox topped the   ratings, and its competitors played  . CNN, in a series of identity crises, remade and remade itself. MSNBC went through a feeble,    phase as a   network, a Fox Jr. before becoming a wonky, progressive  . Other news media become more   more willing to accept the proposition that everyone has a point of view, and might as well embrace it. Fox didn’t cause that alone  —   talk radio came before, the multiplicity of online outlets after  —   but it provided one model. Fox News became a dressing room in which conservatism could try on new outfits. During the early Obama and Tea Party years, Glenn Beck burned brightly and briefly, with his   histrionics and a penchant for conspiracy theories that foreshadowed the current election cycle. And candidates lined up for appearances  —   what was called the “Fox primary. ” It was a revolving door of politicians who become contributors who become candidates: Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin. Now, as my colleague Jim Rutenberg noted, Mr. Ailes’s downfall comes as the Fox ethos has its apotheosis in the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, a being made of pure television. Fox News didn’t make Mr. Trump  . But it made the conditions that made him. Resentment politics, for instance. Mr. Ailes, and thus Fox, recognized that an aggrieved group needed constant grievance, even in victory. Take the “War on Christmas,” which was fought annually on Fox. It became a throwaway line for Mr. Trump  —   people would say “Merry Christmas” in his America, by God! But the spirit of the war on Christmas is everywhere in his campaign. It’s in the idea of the fallen majority  —   that your thing (religious, racial, whatever) used to be the main thing in America, it used to be honored, and now it’s overwhelmed and disrespected, but we are going to bring it back. “Anchor babies. ” The “Ground Zero mosque. ” Birtherism. All these themes were   on Fox, and embraced in the subculture of the Republican base, before Mr. Trump adopted them. Note by note, the channel built the instrument that Mr. Trump plays like a concert pianist. Beyond that, Fox bolstered the powerful idea, key to his campaign, that traditional gatekeepers and claims to expertise were illegitimate. “Fair and balanced,” after all, implied that no one else was balanced, and thus any other information could be dismissed. Newspapers, scientists, egghead    —   forget them. There was only Fox. This gave Mr. Trump, with his tendency to improvise his own facts, an assist  —   and, when he briefly went to war against Fox News and its anchor Megyn Kelly during the primary, a weapon. When he delegitimized Fox to his followers, there was no countervailing authority left. Now there was only Trump. Today Mr. Trump is at peace with Fox, because he won. And with Mr. Ailes gone, the populist   spirit we’ve come to associate with Fox News may pass to Trump. (Completing the    motif, Mr. Trump’s campaign is reported to be overtly modeling itself on the very 1968 “  ” campaign that Mr. Ailes helped win for Mr. Nixon.) Fox News after Mr. Ailes may remain a conservative destination. If nothing else, it still has a big audience. But Mr. Murdoch’s children don’t seem politically driven like Mr. Ailes, so the channel may never again be the same kind of singular, personally driven force. Of course, someone else’s media entity might be. There has been speculation, should Mr. Trump lose in November, that he might start his own media organization. And if he wins, he’ll be a media conglomerate in himself. One way or the other, for better or worse, he would be part of Mr. Ailes’s legacy.",0
18797,Lebanon Chooses Iran And Hezbollah Ally Michel Aoun As President,"USA Today reports: 
Aoun, 81, is an ally of Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political party backed by Iran that has helped Syrian President Bashar Assad survive a five-year civil war on Lebanon’s border. 
The vote for Aoun, by 83 of parliament’s 127 members, shows Iran-backed political factions shouldered past those aligned with Saudi Arabia, replacing Syria as Lebanon’s chief foreign power broker. 
Aoun’s “victory now is a victory for Hezbollah and that alliance, and certainly a kind of black eye for Saudi Arabia,” said Paul Salem, vice president for policy and research at the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C. 
Saad Hariri, a pro-Western and Saudi-oriented politician, formally endorsed Aoun last week after failing to garner enough support for the presidency. In return, Aoun is expected to appoint Hariri prime minister. 
“It’s a power-sharing system,” Salem said. “In a way, the status quo will continue.” 
U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby congratulated Lebanon on the election results. 
“This is a moment of opportunity, as Lebanon emerges from years of political impasse, to restore government functions and build a more stable and prosperous future for all Lebanese citizens,” he said in a statement. 
Asked later about Aoun’s support from Hezbollah, which the State Department has designated a terrorist organization, Kirby said: “Let’ see what decisions he makes, what kind of leadership he exudes as president.” 
The U.S. routinely assesses its foreign assistance programs “and we will do that with Lebanon going forward,” Kirby said at a press briefing. 
Aoun’s election drew immediate praise from a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei. 
The adviser, Ali Akbar Velayati, described the choice as a victory for Iran and its allies in Lebanon, because the Lebanese president is “a very significant ring in the chain of the Islamic resistance,” according to Iran’s government-owned Tasnim News Agency. 
Aoun, in his first speech after becoming president, pledged to fight corruption and protect Lebanon from the fires raging around it, referring to the Syrian civil war, according to the Associated Press. He also promised to liberate contested territory under “Israeli occupation,” according to Hezbollah’s Al Manar-TV, apparently referring to territory Israel considers part of the Golan Heights, which it conquered from Syria during the 1967 war.

Lebanon has been without a head of state since May 2014, when then-president Michel Suleiman’s six-year term expired. Since then, 45 sessions to elect a new leader have failed because of political infighting, the AP reported. Hezbollah leader Nasrallah and Michel Aoun",0

18799,"Tillerson, on Eve of Russia Trip, Takes Hard Line on Syria - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is taking a hard line against Russia on the eve of his first diplomatic trip to Moscow, calling the country “incompetent” for allowing Syria to hold on to chemical weapons and accusing Russia of trying to influence elections in Europe using the same methods it employed in the United States. Mr. Tillerson’s comments, made in interviews aired on Sunday, were far more critical of the Russian government than any public statements by President Trump, who has been an increasingly lonely voice for better ties with Russia. They seemed to reflect Mr. Tillerson’s expectation, which he has expressed privately to aides and members of Congress, that the American relationship with Russia is already reverting to the norm: one of friction, distrust and mutual efforts to undermine each other’s reach. “This was inevitable,” said Philip H. Gordon, a former Middle East coordinator at the National Security Council who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Trump’s early let’   initiative was incompatible with our interests, and you knew it would end with tears. ” The Russians’ behavior has not changed, Mr. Gordon added, and they “are using every means they can  —   cyber, economic arrangements, intimidation  —   to reinsert themselves around the Middle East and Europe. ” Mr. Tillerson made it clear he agreed with that view, sweeping past Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence, despite the conclusion of American intelligence agencies, that there was no evidence of Russian interference in last year’s election. The meddling “undermines any hope of improving relations,” Mr. Tillerson said on ABC’s “This Week,” “not just with the United States, but it’s pretty evident that they’re taking similar tactics into electoral processes throughout Europe. ” Such tough talk will make Mr. Tillerson’s job even harder when he arrives Tuesday for the first visit to Moscow by a top Trump administration official. While he must offer sharp warnings to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and to President Vladimir V. Putin, if they meet  —   it was unclear whether such a meeting had been quietly arranged  —   he must also find a way forward with them to counter the Islamic State and then deal with the Syrian president, Bashar  . Yet as Mr. Tillerson arrived in Italy to meet with foreign ministers before going to Moscow, the administration was sending conflicting signals about its policy on Syria and the extent to which it would hold the country’s patron Russia responsible for continued violence. Mr. Tillerson and the new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” said the American attack last week on a Syrian air base was intended solely to halt future chemical attacks, not to destabilize or overthrow the Assad government. “What’s significant about the strike is not that it was meant to take out the Syrian regime’s capacity or ability to commit mass murder of its own people,” said General McMaster, who is new to the Sunday television circuit, “but it was to be a very strong signal to Assad and his sponsors that the United States cannot stand idly by as he is murdering innocent civilians. ” Neither man would commit to further military action in Syria even if Mr. Assad continued to kill civilians in large numbers by conventional means rather than with the chemical weapons that prompted Mr. Trump to reverse his stance on intervention. Instead, Mr. Tillerson said that defeating the Islamic State remained the first priority. Only then, he said, would he turn to a   process leading to elections, so that “the Syrian people can decide the fate of Assad. ” But the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, suggested that such a process was doomed as long as Mr. Assad was in power. “We know there’s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime,” she said on CNN. “If you look at his actions, if you look at the situation, it’s going to be hard to see a government that’s peaceful and stable with Assad. ” That statement stood in contrast not only to Mr. Tillerson’s comments but also to Ms. Haley’s own remarks a week ago  —   before Mr. Assad carried out his latest chemical weapons attack on civilians  —   in which she insisted that his departure from office was not a diplomatic priority for the United States. Still, the overall tone of suspicion and condemnation of Russia’s actions in Syria indicated that Mr. Trump’s top national security advisers were nudging him back to a more traditional Russia policy. During his days as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson received a friendship award from Mr. Putin, and he is aware of the suspicions surrounding those ties and has gone the furthest in the administration in separating himself from the Russian leader. The challenges have only multiplied in recent days. The Russians, angry about the attack on the air base, have threatened to cut off a communication line that the American and Russian militaries have used to notify each other about air operations in Syria. And the attack has forced Mr. Putin into a tighter relationship with Mr. Assad, perhaps tighter than the Russian leader wants. Ms. Haley, who, like Mr. Tillerson, is new to diplomacy, has also apparently concluded that a hard line toward Russia is the safest course. The contrast between her remarks and Mr. Trump’s warm words for Mr. Putin on the campaign trail  —   as well as his refusal to acknowledge Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election  —   has been striking. The Trump administration’s Syria policy has been difficult to parse. Mr. Tillerson, in his first television appearances since taking office, seemed to describe two different strategic objectives: halting chemical attacks and ultimately negotiating a  . But he made it clear that he had no intention of backing a military intervention that would overthrow Mr. Assad. That suggested that as long as the dictator used conventional means to kill his own people  —   barrel bombs instead of sarin gas  —   the United States would keep its distance. “I think what the United States and our allies want to do is to enable the Syrian people to make that determination” about Mr. Assad’s fate, Mr. Tillerson said on CBS’s “Face the Nation”  —   a line that was often used by his predecessor in the Obama administration, John Kerry. “You know, we’ve seen what violent regime change looks like in Libya and the kind of chaos that can be unleashed. ” Those remarks indicate that Mr. Trump does not yet have a grander strategy for Syria. Longtime Middle East experts said that might be a good thing. “I for one am glad he does not have a fully   strategy on Syria, because if he did, he’d probably get it wrong,” said Ryan C. Crocker, perhaps the most experienced American career diplomat in the region, and dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas AM University. “There are too many variables, too many unknowns,” he said, among them the expectation of American allies, including Saudi Arabia, that Mr. Trump should emphasize getting rid of Mr. Assad over defeating the Islamic State.",0
18800,New Sheriff in Town: The First 100 Days at the Sessions DOJ - Breitbart,"Under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the first 100 days at the Department of Justice have seen perhaps the most straightforward and earnest efforts to bring the promises of the Trump movement to fruition. [Stepping into leadership at a DOJ managed for eight years by Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, Sessions has had an uphill battle to implement the key tenets of law and order that so many Americans have long craved and which President Donald Trump promised as a candidate: an end of the lawless hypocrisy on the southern border and in the internal enforcement of our immigration laws, especially in state a jurisdictions that openly flaunt federal law and proclaim themselves “sanctuaries” a firm commitment to get a handle on rising violent crime, especially in our most dangerous inner cities and steadfast support of our law enforcement officers at a time when they face danger and disparagement from inside the government and without.  Attorney General Sessions was confirmed by the Senate on February 9, 2017, three weeks into the new administration. One of the very first national politicians to endorse candidate Trump, he was the fifth cabinet member to take his seat, but not before a smooth yet contentious confirmation process yielded one of the most awkwardly worded and forced political slogans of recent memory. “Nevertheless, she persisted,” the   line goes, a reference to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s ( ) explanation of his use of Senate rules to prevent Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) reading a   old letter from Coretta Scott King to imply racist motives to then Senator Sessions. The use was later criticized by Ms. King’s niece. The fireworks on the Senate floor were quickly followed up in the White House. On his first day as Attorney General, Sessions stood by President Trump’s side as he signed no fewer than four executive orders pertaining to the Justice Department. Without doubt, cracking down on illegal aliens and the resultant lawlessness on the border and in our immigration system has been the greatest focus of Sessions’ attentions in his tenure at DOJ. Merely the signal of will from the new administration has already brought extraordinary results. March of 2017 saw the lowest number of illegals caught on the border in 17 years, a 72 percent reduction in apprehensions from the last month of the Obama administration. Rhetoric was repeatedly backed up with action on the Attorney General’s part. In early March, the DOJ shifted 50 immigration judges to detention center along the border and in illegal alien heavy cities. The were set to work in   shifts to help clear the massive backlog of deportation cases. This proved to be merely a prelude to much more substantial reform. On the morning of April 11, 2017, the Attorney General toured the southern border with officers of U. S Customs and Border Protection. Addressing them and the nation, he proclaimed, “For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era. ” “The catch and release practices of old are over,” Sessions continued, announced that 125 additional immigration judges would be hired on expedited basis. They would be needed because from this point on all adults apprehended at the border were to be detained by federal authorities. A new set of guidelines was sent to every federal prosecutor in the country. Those who illegally enter the United States a second time will now face felony prosecution as a matter of course, as well those who illegal enter after having been deported, and transporting or harboring three or more illegal aliens. Charges of aggravated identity theft are to be levied on those caught with fraudulent documentation. These measures are designed to work in tandem with a similar ramping up at the Department of Homeland Security, where 10, 000 additional ICE officers have been authorized and are in the process of being hired. Attorney General Sessions made a point of making joint appearances with DHS Secretary John Kelley, presenting a united front to bring order to the border. The two cabinet officials noted increased arrests, more deportations of criminals, and other operations contributing to the apparent decrease in illegal border crossings. While President Trump has, so far, not seen it fit to reverse Obama’s Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals executive order, granting amnesty to those who came illegal as children and register with the federal government, the Attorney General has made it clear that the law remains the law. Asked by Fox News in April about the deportation of certain   DREAMer (after the never enacted DREAM act) Sessions was unequivocal, “The policy is that if people are here unlawfully, they’re subject to being deported. Our priority is clear. Our priority is to end the lawlessness at the border. ” From the very beginning of his tenure, Attorney General Sessions has tried to bring jurisdictions who refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement back to legal normality, even if it means cutting their federal funds to convince them to do so. Sessions has done this in the face of steadfast refusal to cooperate by some of nation’s most powerful local leaders. For example, Chicago, under the leadership of Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, went so far as to issue a new type of identification available to illegal alien without the city keeping records in response to fears the administration might be able to force the “sanctuary” to give up information on immigration status. Sessions made a point of calling out a California prosecutor who appears to, as a matter of policy, be reducing charges to avoid triggering “violent felon” deportation requirements. The most troubling resistance, however, came this final week of the first 100 days, as a federal court in San Francisco blocked enforcement of President Trump’s executive order commanding Sessions to cut off federal funds from recalcitrant jurisdictions. At the moment, as the administration has released no comprehensive plan as to what funds are subject to suspension, it is unclear what effect this temporary order will have. It will, however, prevent the use of that executive order’s authority while a lawsuit from a number of California sanctuary jurisdictions makes its way through the courts. Sessions has not taken this tactic to continue flaunting federal immigration law lightly. In a statement Wednesday, the Attorney General was very clear as to how he saw the lawsuit: At the heart of this immigration debate is disagreement over whether illegally entering this country is a crime.  Our duly enacted laws answer that question. Nevertheless, actions that have always been understood to be squarely within the powers of the President, regardless of the Administration, have now been enjoined.  The Department of Justice cannot accept such a result, and as the President has made clear, we will continue to litigate this case to vindicate the rule of law. Separate from the wider pledge to cut the flow of federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, Sessions has used his independent authority to bring pressure to bear. After weeks of threatening action, the Department of Justice sent letters to nine of the states and cities who most vigorously stifle immigration enforcement, demanding they show compliance by June 30 or forfeit their DOJ Bryne Grants for law enforcement. As these grants already have requirements to follow federal law attached to them, these letters may be unaffected by the ongoing court fracas over President Trump’s executive order. The mayhem of our inner cities in the waning years of the Obama administration was no less troubling than the chaos on the border. On the day Sessions took office, an executive order established a task force for tackling the violent crime increase seen in certain cities. Sessions has spoken on numerous occasions on his support for a return to “broken windows” policing and taking local law enforcement’s side in their effort to wrestle their crime rates back down to the historic lows seen only a few years ago. Some of the violence is fueled by what the justice department calls “transnational criminal organizations,” brutal gangs like   and   networks like the Mexican drug cartels. At a meeting of the Attorney General’s Organized Crime Council, Sessions made clear his department would have “zero tolerence” for gang violence as it brings an executive order targeting these organizations for deportation and dismantling into reality. On several occasions, Sessions has highlighted his continued support for the type of rigorous policing that came under intense fire in the last administration. To many Americans, the   DOJ’s failure to keep crime in check and the border under control was compounded by the perceived failure to adequately support law enforcement officers and their in this trying time. Black Lives Matter and other   groups brought   rhetoric to the forefront of the public discourse and politicized violence against the police made headlines throughout 2014, 2015 and 2016. The Justice Department responded by launching investigations into police brutality, bias, and misconduct, making it anything but clear that American law enforcement had their unequivocal support. Spearheaded by Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta’s Civil Rights Division, the Obama administration responded to riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland by launching federal investigations into those cities’ and others like   Chicago’s, police departments. The results were predictable. A “Ferguson Effect,” where officers were reluctant to make the routine stops necessary to keep crime under control for fear of being sanctioned for misconduct contributed to a shocking rise in violent crime in the very communities supposedly protected by federal oversight of police. Initially dismissed as a   conspiracy theory, the Ferguson Effect has since been supported by a survey of police officers and by a National Institute of Justice study funded by the Obama DOJ. When Attorney General Sessions took the reigns at DOJ, there was an immediate shift in tone. “Please know that you have the full support of our Department,” Sessisons told a meeting of police chiefs in April. He went on to call out the former administration’s treatment of police: In recent years, as you know, law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the crimes and unacceptable deeds of a few bad actors. Amid this intense criticism, morale has gone down, while the number of officers killed in the line of duty has gone up. Attorney General Sessions has done what is in his power to try and reverse the damage done to Law Enforcement relations. He ordered a complete review of all   investigations into local law enforcement. He has even sought to scale back the consent decree reached to install federal monitoring of Baltimore’s Police Department in the waning days of the Obama administration. When the federal judge in the case refused to reopen the issue, Sessions issued a public statement criticizing the whole endeavor, saying, “There are clear departures from many proven principles of good policing that we fear will result in more crime. ” Wednesday saw the first of Attorney General Sessions’   subordinates take office: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Over the coming weeks, it is expected that serious progress will be made on nominating and confirming permanent occupants for the dozens of political positions at the Department of Justice, including the over 90 U. S. Attorneys who lead federal criminal prosecutions. The key victories of the first 100 days were accomplished by the Attorney General without any of them in place. As his team assembles around him, Attorney General Sessions looks to be better able to direct the legal policy of the United States government to restore his vision of law and order.",0

The researchers succeeded in installing five GPS tags on two full-grown sea lionesses and three cubs on the national park’s territory. 
""It was not an easy task as these animals are very timid. They had to be knocked out using tranquillizers so that they could be tagged,"" Veledinsky said. 
However, right after the animals woke up, scientists started receiving the data on their movement. In one case, a few days after being tagged, a sea lionesses and her cub travelled several hundred kilometers from the Commander Islands through the Pacific Ocean to Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula. All of the sea lions’ movements are depicted on a map via a computer program. 
""Researchers will be able to follow the sea lions for approximately one year. The tags placed on the animals’ heads will fall off when they begin to shed their fur. That said, the tags are glued to their fur with a specific paste,"" Veledinsky explained. 10 UNESCO treasures in Russia on one map 
One of the main goals of this research is to garner scientific data on the winter habitats of the sea lions populating the Commander Islands as their number has been falling. In the 1960s and 1970s up to 12,000 sea lions used to spend the winter on the islands, while in summer there were 2,000 to 5,000 animals there. Now there are no more than 600 sea lions. The new data will enable the creation of more safe conditions in the sea lions’ rookeries. There are four rookeries where sea lionesses bear cubs on the Commander Islands, which is encompassed by the national park. Besides that, there are also three rookeries where cubs are not born.

18805,Hillary Clinton Is Getting Surprisingly Little Extra Lift From Blacks and Hispanics - The New York Times,"The conventional wisdom holds that sweeping demographic shifts propelled Barack Obama to the presidency. So here’s a simple question: Why haven’t these demographics swept Hillary Clinton to a big polling lead and a smooth glide to victory? Donald J. Trump, after all, has alienated just about every growing demographic group and every category that helped push Mr. Obama to victory. The biggest reason is that demographic change was an overrated contribution to Mr. Obama’s victory, and it will help Mrs. Clinton only at the margins this year. Analysts have conflated all of the effect of higher turnout and percentage of support among nonwhite voters with demographic shifts. In truth, the turnout and support were far more powerful components. Mrs. Clinton is not poised to match the gains Mr. Obama made among nonwhite voters over previous Democratic nominees. That brings the pace of Democratic gains down to the slow crawl of demographic change. The traditional demographic story is fairly simple: Between 2000 and 2012, the white,   share of voters plummeted. According to the census, white,   voters represented just 74 percent of the electorate in 2012  —   down from 81 percent in 2000. The shift was, indeed, driven by demographic change. The white,   share of adult citizens  —   roughly the pool of people eligible to vote  —   fell by roughly the same amount over the same period. The white,   share of adult citizens who are eligible voters has continued to fall  —   probably down to around 68 percent, although the census information is not yet up to date. The growing diversity of the electorate has undoubtedly helped the Democrats. However, many people look at these numbers and assume that the preponderance of Democratic gains over the last decade can be attributed to these shifts. That is not so. In fact, John Kerry would have probably lost the 2004 election even if eligible voters had been just as diverse as they were in 2012. Conversely, Mr. Obama would have probably won his two elections even if the last decade of demographic shifts had never happened. How? Because Democratic gains come from three largely distinct sources: demographics, support and turnout. Demographic trends did help Democrat nominees, a little. But they were helped just as much by favorable turnout trends  —   the huge surge in black turnout, in particular  —   and by favorable trends in support. Mr. Obama did much better than Mr. Kerry among Hispanic voters, among black voters and even among white voters outside the South and Appalachia. On balance, these other factors  —   support and turnout  —   not only outweighed demographic shifts as drivers of growing Democratic strength, but they also made demographic shifts more powerful. Demographic change, for instance, wouldn’t have done Mr. Kerry nearly as much good as it did Mr. Obama because Mr. Kerry didn’t do as well among Hispanic and Asian voters  —   the main drivers of demographic shifts. Here’s one way to look at it: Between 2004 and 2012, the Democratic margin among Hispanic voters roughly doubled, from 18 percentage points to 38 points, according to The Upshot’s estimates, which are based on   polls, census data and the actual results. But over the same period, the number of Hispanic voters increased by just 20 percent, a far smaller contribution to Democratic strength. The impact of turnout and support over demographic shifts was even greater in the battleground states. Many of the key Northern battleground states  —   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin  —   saw    changes in the composition of the electorate. In these states, Mr. Obama nonetheless ran ahead of Mr. Kerry by energizing black voters and doing better among white voters as well. Even the states with   “demographic shifts”  —   like North Carolina and Colorado  —   actually had   demographic shifts. And many of the biggest demographic shifts occurred in the Sun Belt states where Democrats talked about being competitive, like Georgia and Arizona, even Texas, but really weren’t. Demographic shifts in these areas were often canceled out by considerable losses among white voters over the same period. My view is that this is somewhat coincidental. Many of the red states with growing nonwhite populations also have the sort of older, Southern, less educated and more religious white populations that have trended toward the Republicans, even in states with far less demographic change and far fewer nonwhite voters (Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Missouri). The states with rapid demographic change but fewer Southern white voters  —   like California or New Jersey  —   did not see the same weakening in Democratic strength. Yes, demographic shifts will continue to slowly help Democrats. But Mrs. Clinton isn’t getting the same leaps in support and turnout among nonwhite voters that let Mr. Obama grow the Democratic coalition as much as he did. On average, Mrs. Clinton leads among Hispanic voters by almost the exact same amount that Mr. Obama did in   polls in 2012. This is lost in many articles that   the most shockingly   results. The results that don’t show her doing so well  —   like a Pew poll showing her leading by 50 to 26  —   are dismissed, even though the same pollsters four years ago showed Mr. Obama faring about as well as he ultimately did.’ ”Another reason Mrs. Clinton’s relative weakness among nonwhite voters has been overlooked is that analysts and journalists have tended to focus on how Mr. Trump is doing worse than Mr. Romney (Mr. Trump has only 15 percent support among Hispanics compared with Mr. Romney’s 27 percent in the exit polls). But they leave out that Mrs. Clinton, by the same measure, is doing worse than Mr. Obama to the same extent.” ’A final problem is that a handful of polls specifically targeting Latino voters tend to show Mrs. Clinton ahead by a larger margin than other surveys do. These pollsters argue that they’re a more accurate reflection of the Latino electorate. Whether this is true is beside the point: The methodology employed by these surveys has always yielded stronger results for Democrats than other surveys, including the exit polls.’ ”As a result, comparing these polls with the exit polls tends to show Democrats gaining when, in fact, they may not be at all. Mr. Obama, for instance, led the final Latino Decisions poll by a margin of 75 percent to 23 percent, about the same as Mrs. Clinton’s current   lead in a recent survey.” ’Why isn’t Mrs. Clinton doing better than Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters? Part of her problem, I suspect, is that Hispanic voters are disproportionately young, and she has had a tough time rallying the support of young voters. It is also possible that she is struggling among less educated   or   Hispanic voters who may vote more similarly to less educated white voters. Mrs. Clinton isn’t doing better than Mr. Obama among black voters, either. While several polls have suggested that Mr. Trump is winning a vanishingly small share of that vote, the polls showed something similar in 2012. Then,   polls showed Mr. Obama beating Mr. Romney by an even greater margin than the polls currently show Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama held a   percent lead among likely black voters (92 to 3 among registered voters). Most of the analysis that shows Mrs. Clinton faring better depends on a comparison with the exit polls, which showed Mr. Romney winning 6 percent of the black vote. My view is that the   polls were probably right, and that Mr. Obama won black voters by an even greater margin than the exit polls found. The exit polls are not good at measuring clustered groups, as the exit pollsters have long acknowledged. But regardless of which measure most accurately depicts the electorate, the    comparison is the sounder one. It shows more stability than change. Mrs. Clinton is also in danger of losing at least some of the favorable shifts in turnout between 2004 and 2012, which benefited Mr. Obama. Black turnout may not exceed white turnout again, either because black turnout fades a bit, or because white turnout increases. I’m agnostic on this question: It is very difficult to project turnout with that kind of precision. But there’s more room for Mrs. Clinton to fall here than to make additional gains. The bottom line is that Mrs. Clinton is unlikely to benefit from the same jump in black turnout and support that Mr. Obama had. Similarly, she is unlikely to repeat the same jump in support from Hispanic voters. It is possible she won’t see any gains among these groups at all. Democratic gains from nonwhite voters have greatly slowed, to the marginal gains from demographic shifts alone. The end result: According to The Upshot’s estimates, Mrs. Clinton’s gains from demographic change could be as small as a single percentage point.",0
18806,"Apple Developer Conference: A More Open Siri, and Other Upgrades - The New York Times","SAN FRANCISCO  —   When Steven P. Jobs ran Apple, the company’s devices were distinguished by their polished software and famous iTunes store. Today, critics and even loyal fans are taking shots at Apple’s buggy software and Apple Music, its new streaming music service. With its hardware sales now slowing, Apple is under pressure to fix its software and online services, which have become increasingly important to consumers. So at its annual conference for software developers on Monday, the iPhone maker tried to demonstrate that it was still a purveyor of   software and services. Brian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel attended Apple’s conference keynote in San Francisco and analyzed what matters about the announcements that Apple made. Apple announced: ■ Improvements in the Apple Watch operating system. ■ Changes in the operating system for Apple TV, called tvOS. ■ A rebranding of its Mac operating system. ■ An expansion of Apple Pay. ■ Opening up Siri to developers. ■ Improvements in photos and maps. ■ Subscriptions through Apple News. ■ Opening up its messaging service to developers ■ A new interface for Apple Music. Here were the main points: Farhad: Apple divided its presentation into four segments focused on each of its computer operating systems  —   one each for iPhone, the Mac, the Apple Watch and Apple TV. That segmentation suggests Apple’s worldview. This is a company that still sees the tech world as defined by separate physical devices. Sure, it will integrate these devices through some   features (including some new ones it showed today) but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them. That is a startlingly different  —   and, really, a kind of    —   view of tech, especially compared to the view that Google presented at its recent developer conference. In Google’s view, the internet is the central operating system  —   it’s the place where all your data and tech intelligence reside. The next era of the tech industry will be defined by which of these worldviews becomes dominant Brian: One big takeaway was that Apple has a lot of catching up to do in online services. Most of Apple’s noteworthy announcements on Monday matched features already offered by other internet companies, namely Amazon and Google. Following the footsteps of Amazon’s Echo smart speaker, Apple expanded Siri, its voice assistant, by allowing   app developers to take advantage of voice controls. After Google’s Photos app won fanfare with its automatic organization features, Apple announced that its photos app would have some smarter organization tools, too, like the ability to stitch photos automatically into video montages called Memories. In addition, Apple added some smarts to its Maps service, like the ability to find nearby points of interest such as gas stations  —   a feature long supported by Google’s Waze mapping service. Apple executives have repeatedly said the company doesn’t strive to be first: It prides itself on coming up with better solutions later. (The iPhone, for example, came out much later than previous smartphones.) The question is, does it pay for Apple to be late in improving its online services, which only get smarter over time? Farhad: Though lots of developers create apps for the iPhone, Apple has long been careful about how much access it gives developers to crucial parts of its operating system. That seems to be changing. This presentation was marked by much greater access  —   Apple now allows   developers to create new experiences in Apple Maps, to interact with Siri, to get access to its Messages service and to get access to the lock screen and phone interface. Similar access has been available to developers on Google’s Android operating system. Now Apple seems to be going out of its way to cater to developers, too. Brian: Apple announced a new version of its operating system, Watch OS, powering Apple Watch. Notably, Apple started the keynote with Apple Watch, which signifies the increasing importance of the gadget, the first   piece of hardware introduced by Apple under the leadership of its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook. Vindu: Apple repositioned the watch as more of a health monitor, putting the activity tracker in a more prominent place and encouraging competitive sharing of workouts with friends. Brian: The new fitness features of the Apple Watch place the product in more direct competition with Fitbit, the largest wearables maker. Brian: Eddy Cue, head of Apple’s software and services, announced improvements in the operating system powering Apple TV, called tvOS. That includes a feature called single  : People have complained about how long it takes to log into individual services like Hulu, Netflix and Showtime. Now, users will be able to sign into all network apps with a single universal login. Apple essentially believes the future of the television screen will be driven by apps.   apps could make the big screen smarter than the interface of standard cable boxes. Vindu: Over all, the improvements in Apple TV are modest. But some tighter integration with live TV networks does set up Apple to possibly become a TV provider for   as more channels offer their services over the internet. Brian: Apple rebranded its Mac operating system, which was called OS X for 15 years. It will now be called MacOS, bringing it in line with the branding schemes of Apple’s other software products (tvOS, WatchOS, iOS). With its new Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, Apple is putting the clout of its Mac operating system behind the Apple Watch. Users wearing the Apple Watch will be able to unlock their Macs without entering a user name or password. Apple also expanded Siri, its voice assistant, to become available in the Mac operating system. The move is a response to Google, which recently said it would expand its   virtual assistant to many products, including a chat app called Allo and a smart speaker called Home. Vindu: Apple is trying to make Apple Pay more useful for retailers. The company said Apple Pay, its payment service, is coming to the web for the first time, with dozens of retailers already lined up to use it. However, it may not be easy enough to use to succeed in transforming online checkouts, where other services like PayPal have failed. Buying a product using Apple Pay on a Mac still requires you to authenticate the purchase by putting your finger on your iPhone  —   an extra step and extra device to pull out. Brian: Apple unveiled a big upgrade for Siri, allowing outside app developers to take advantage of voice controls. Now Siri can do things like summon an Uber car, send a message through a chat app like WhatsApp or send someone cash with apps like Square Cash. The move helps Apple play   with Amazon, which already lets   developers add capabilities to its smart speaker, Echo. Google also has said it plans to allow outside developers to make their apps and services work with its smart speaker, Home, due for release this fall. Farhad: This opening up of Siri is an improvement, but Apple was unclear about how expansive this system will be. How many apps will be able to use Siri? What functions will Siri be able to handle for them? Can Siri handle very sophisticated requests, like ones that depend on multiple apps  —   for instance, “Call an Uber five minutes before my next meeting”? Apple hasn’t specified. Given that voice is becoming an increasingly important interface for the next generation of computing, Apple’s progress here could be a key benchmark for its future. Vindu: Good news for publishers: Apple News, which has 50 million monthly active users, will let people subscribe to get every article from their favorite publications, including those with pay walls like The Wall Street Journal. Apple News has been a bit of a stepchild, with publishers largely focusing their efforts on Facebook, Twitter and Google’s AMP to speed up the display of articles on the mobile web. Will this get news organizations on board? Vindu: Apple is challenging Facebook Messenger, one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, by opening up its Messages service to outside developers. Facebook has made a big play to establish Messenger as a place to conduct all kinds of activities, from ordering an Uber car to watching videos. Apple is now matching that, but with the full array of developers that use iOS instead of the handful that have chosen to work with Facebook. (It won’t hurt the appeal to users that Apple is making emoji triple their previous size and automatically suggesting emoji replacements for words in messages.) Vindu: Apple said it had 15 million subscribers to Apple Music, but the streaming music service has gotten off to a slow start. Apple said it had learned from the experience so far and unveiled a redesign of Apple Music that simplifies navigation and makes it easier to find your favorite music. But with more popular apps like Spotify soon able to tap Siri, it’s unclear whether the changes will be enough to dislodge competitors. Apple’s   iTunes software for buying and organizing music saw no upgrades.",0
18808,Supreme Court Won’t Hear Appeal From Texas on Voter ID Case - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court rejected on Monday an appeal from Texas officials seeking to restore the state’s strict voter ID law. As is the court’s custom, its brief order in the case, Abbott v. Veasey, No.   gave no reasons for turning down the appeal. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued an unusual statement explaining that the Supreme Court remains free to consider the case after further proceedings in the lower courts. The Texas law, enacted in 2011, requires voters seeking to cast their ballots at the polls to present photo identification, like a Texas driver’s or gun license, a military ID or a passport. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the law is racially discriminatory. The Texas law was at first blocked under Section 5 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which required some states and localities with a history of discrimination to obtain federal permission before changing voting procedures. After the Supreme Court effectively struck down Section 5 in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder, an Alabama case, Texas officials announced that they would start enforcing the ID law. After a   trial in 2014, Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Federal District Court in Corpus Christi struck down the law on Oct. 9 in a   opinion. She said that it had been adopted “with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and that its effect was to disenfranchise “a disproportionate number of   and Hispanics. ” In 2015, a   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, vacated part of the ruling concerning the law’s purpose but affirmed the part concerning its effect. Last July, the full Fifth Circuit largely adopted the panel’s distinctions and reasoning, and it returned the case to the trial court to consider an appropriate remedy. Texas officials nonetheless asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court’s ruling immediately. The people and groups challenging the law, the officials said, “presented no evidence that the law resulted in diminished minority political participation or prevented even a single person from voting. ” The challengers responded that about 600, 000 registered voters in Texas, or about 5 percent of all registered voters in the state, lacked the required forms of ID. The law, they said, “disproportionately affects minority voters at a statistically significant rate. ” On Monday, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the case would be better suited for Supreme Court review after the lower courts completed their work. Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general, said he was disappointed that the court “did not immediately take our case. ” “Chief Justice Roberts made it very clear that the case will be an even stronger posture for Supreme Court review after further proceedings in lower courts,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement. “Texas enacted a common sense voter ID law to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and we will continue to fight for the law. ” J. Gerald Hebert of the Campaign Legal Center, which represents voters challenging the law, said he was pleased that “the justices recognize that this case does not merit review at this time. ” “Texas, which ranks poorly in voter participation, should work to ensure that every eligible voter in the state is able to cast a ballot going forward,” Mr. Hebert said in a statement.",0
18809,Paul Ryan Under Fire as Health Care Is Delayed Again,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s ( ) leadership was called into question by new voices Thursday night as hopes expire of passing a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare before President Donald Trump’s first 100 days end on Saturday. [At a meeting on the Hill late Thursday night, the speaker and his House Republican leadership team decided to further delay the vote. With what appeared to be the acquiescence of conservatives in the Freedom Caucus and   like Club for Growth and FreedomWorks, who took much of the blame for the failure of the first attempt to pass the American Health Care Act (AHCA) in March, hopes were buoyed that passage was imminent. Instead, according to Politico, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) told reporters as he left the meeting, “We are not voting on health care tomorrow. We’re still educating members. ”  Syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham joined Fox News’s Hannity to vent her frustration with House Republicans. “This is another loss for Paul Ryan,” she told host Sean Hannity: Paul Ryan was given this assignment to quarterback this legislation through the House. It wasn’t easy. It was going to be difficult. You have a lot of different factions, different people, different values, different personalities, but this is something you had to do. If you can’t get health care done, and done right, eight years after saying you were gonna do it   …     I don’t even know what to say about that. What does that say about your ability to lead at a critical time for our economy? Ingraham then hinted she may be at the end of her patience with Speaker Ryan’s leadership. “I’m not gonna sugarcoat this. This is an embarrassment that this couldn’t get done,” she fumed. “You’ve got to get better communications. You have to know your caucus. Otherwise, just give it to someone who can do it. That’s all I can say”: Hannity’s next guest, fellow Fox host Lou Dobbs, went even further in his condemnation of Ryan’s handling of healthcare legislation. “Laura, bless her heart, is trying to be nice to Paul Ryan,” he said. “I think the man is absolutely a disaster. He’s become nothing less than a caricature as House speaker. He’s inept, and the conference, if they don’t get rid of him, we’re going to watch this nonsense go on in perpetuity. ” Dobbs explained that, in his view, President Trump was doing all he could to move his political agenda along and that House GOP leadership had to be held responsible for the sluggish pace on legislative priorities. He then explicitly called for Speaker Ryan’s ouster and replacement by Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) chairman of the   Freedom Caucus, or his predecessor in that position, Rep. Jim Jordan ( ): Paul Ryan is not a conservative, never has been. His leadership team is a mixed bag of conservatives [and] moderates. The Freedom Caucus are traditional conservatives and great Americans, all of them.   …     You and I both know Mark [Meadows] and Jim Jordan   …     for the great Republicans they are. I think either one of those two would make such a terrific speaker. Dobbs’s suggestion would not be the first time Paul Ryan and the Freedom Caucus found themselves in contention. Members of the Freedom Caucus themselves have called Ryan’s continuation as speaker of the House into question. The entire Freedom Caucus leadership also refused to endorse Ryan in his 2016 primary challenge from the right by businessman Paul Nehlen, although they did assent to Ryan’s speakership the previous year. Ingraham and Dobbs’s comments add to a growing chorus of voices on the right of the Republican Party calling for Ryan to relinquish the speaker’s mace in the wake of the failure to see through the key GOP platform plank of repealing and replacing Obamacare.",0
18810,Election Day Questions,"  Recipient Email => 
Dear Mexican: Why is it that even though we Latinos have similar backgrounds (Indian-Spanish) across America , there is a lack of unity among us here in the USA ? We could be a powerhouse during election times, and definitely obtain a more friendlier immigration deal. 
El Peruano 
Dear Cholo: I usually only answer preguntas about Mexicans, but I’ll make an exception here because of Election Day. And it hierve down to this: Who wants to be united? Latinos certainly don’t. Nowhere except Cuba is a country of the same political thought—and look how good it’s working out for them. Although the Mexican’s politics are Marxist of the Grouch variety, I’m also of the escuela that we need Latino conservatives, anarchists, vendidos , progressives, libertarians, Zapatistas, sinarquistas (ok, maybe not them)—all political thoughts. Such diversity keeps us in balance, teaches us about democracy, and will make us stronger as gabachos continue to align themselves into puritanical camps of caca . Let us squabble away—oh, and #fucktrump. In America , the candidates for president spend millions of dollars in other peoples’ money for a job that could never pay that money back. Is it the same for Mexican candidates, or does it even matter, since those fucking Mexicans can never get the elections right anyway? 
Conservative, but #fucktrump 
Dear Gabacho: For most of the 20th century, Mexican presidents came from the PRI, and their method of picking a new leader was simple: el dedazo . The finger—not flipping the pájaro , but a symbolic pointing of the finger toward someone. Yeah, that’s totally corrupt—but at least we don’t spend billions of dollars like fucking gabachos who can never get their elections right anyway, you know? Oh, and #fucktrump. 

GET OUT EL VOTO !: Gentle cabrones , the Mexican doesn’t endorse candidates not named Alfred E. Neumann (source of the greatest quote EVER: “English is a language in which double negatives are a no-no!”), but I can tell you who NOT to vote for: Donald Trump, and anyone supporting the pendejo . He represents the greatest threat to raza since NAFTA, an agreement he claims to hate but only says that to gain gabachos votes to toss Mexicans across the Rio Grande with a deportation cannon. Hillary Clinton is nowhere near the perfect candidate, and the Mexican won’t be voting for her because she’s the beneficiary of the Democratic Party own dedazo system—but even a candidate as terrible as her is un chingo better than Trump. If you vote for her, no hate on my part—just tell her to hold her tacos right. 
More importantly, vote in your local elections, and RESEARCH. Don’t just vote for the people with the paisa name—sometimes, our own people are worse to Mexicans than any Trumpbot. And if you can’t vote because you’re undocumented? Volunteer for those politicos who are striving for amnesty and who oppose walls. May you celebrate Election Day with one giant fiesta instead of tragos amargos . Oh, and #fucktrump.

18811,A.N.C.’s Combative Response to Election Losses Startles South Africa - The New York Times,"JOHANNESBURG  —   When South African voters last month handed the African National Congress its   losses, seemingly chastened party leaders said they would engage in “introspection. ” They promised to reach out to South Africans disillusioned by the A. N. C. ’s apparent transformation from a celebrated liberation movement with cherished ideals to a corrupt party interested in   and  . But in the weeks since the Aug. 3 municipal elections, the A. N. C, which remains in power at the national level, has brushed aside calls from inside and outside the party to replace the   president, Jacob Zuma, before the end of his term in 2019. Instead of introspection, Mr. Zuma and his allies have moved aggressively to tighten their grip on the state’s coffers, surprising opponents and allies alike with their undisguised moves. With little explanation, Mr. Zuma announced that he would directly oversee the state enterprises that have long been the source of public corruption. And his allies have renewed their attacks on Mr. Zuma’s finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who has built a reputation for probity and has tried to uproot malfeasance in government even one of the A. N. C. ’s closest allies, the South African Communist Party, has described the moves against the minister as intended to “weaken Treasury’s struggle against corruption. ” “This is further confirming the people’s suspicions about the A. N. C. ,” said Sasabona Manganye, the chairman of the Sefako Makgatho branch of the A. N. C. in Johannesburg, which has called on Mr. Zuma and the party’s top leaders to resign. “Unfortunately, the biggest loser out of all of this is the A. N. C,” he said. “If the A. N. C. leaves Zuma to remain president until 2019,” he added, “we should just accept that Zuma will be the last president that the A. N. C. had. ” The party’s reaction to the rebuke of voters has deepened doubts that, 22 years after winning power after the end of apartheid, it can fully transform itself from a liberation movement to a   political party. Will it suffer the fate of Africa’s other liberation movements, which, years after abandoning their original ideals, have clung to power through patronage, coercion or even force? The liberation movements that helped free much of southern Africa decades ago are still in power  —   in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and Angola. Like the A. N. C. they have used their liberation credentials to maintain their grip on power and to fend off rivals. But their records in government have been mixed at best, or, in the case of Zimbabwe, deeply tarnished. “We’re in the lingering days of these liberation movements,” said Roger Southall, a professor emeritus at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and an expert on liberation movements. “They’re not suddenly going to lose power,” he added. “They’ll go on organizationally. But they’ve certainly lost their shine, the hopes that they were embodied with, and, in South Africa, that process has been hugely accelerated by the Zuma presidency. ” Many African nations gained their independence in the 1960s after former colonial rulers withdrew from the continent. But the liberation movements took up armed struggle against colonial powers or white settlers, in that way gaining greater moral authority. In the constellation of liberation movements, none shone brighter than the A. N. C. and its most famous leader, Nelson Mandela. To liberation movement leaders like Mr. Zuma, who said last year that the A. N. C. “comes first,” even before the nation, nothing remains more vital than the movement. Many leaders have described their movement in religious terms, including Mr. Zuma, who until last month often said that the A. N. C. would rule “until Jesus comes. ” The qualities that were prized in liberation leaders and movements have often proved detrimental in government. “The A. N. C. is now being forced to change into a political party,” said Rekgotsofetse Chikane, a university student leader and A. N. C. member who is the son of a famous party leader, the Rev. Frank Chikane. “Even though it’s a political party in name, it is still a liberation movement through its actions  —   the way it thinks about how it’s going to deliver services, the way it builds its rhetoric and the way it defends itself. ” Because of its past as a liberation movement, the younger Mr. Chikane said, the A. N. C. practices a “centralized democracy” in which leaders simply give commands and are not used to a    with other party members or with voters. Given the strength of South Africa’s democratic institutions compared with those of its neighbors in the region, Mr. Chikane said he was optimistic that the party would successfully transform itself. But he said it would be an arduous process because many in the party, shocked by last month’s elections, were focused simply on retaining power through two more presidential elections, or through 2024. “Those who’ve been pillaging the state in one way or another will pillage as much as possible until the last possible moment, so that when the game is over, they will be set for the rest of their lives,” Mr. Chikane said. “That’s what we’re going to see with parastatals,” he added, referring to state enterprises. In Zimbabwe, the same liberation movement and leader remain in power 36 years after the end of white minority rule. In the first years after liberation, decades before Zimbabwe degraded into a kleptocracy, President Robert Mugabe and his   party were celebrated around the world, including by Western governments, as embodying the hopes of a new Africa. Over the weekend, Mr. Mugabe accused the West of continuing to plot to replace southern Africa’s liberation movements with “pliant puppet regimes. ” Zimbabwe’s economy is in free fall government workers, who make up most of the 10 percent of Zimbabweans fortunate enough to be employed in the formal sector, are being paid weeks late because of the government’s severe cash shortage. The fierce struggle to succeed Mr. Mugabe, increasingly frail at 92, has dominated the capital, Harare, in recent months. Zimbabwe’s political elites have focused their attacks on rivals’ liberation credentials  —   exhuming events that occurred generations ago. Joice Mujuru, a liberation hero known by her nom de guerre, Spill Blood, served as Mr. Mugabe’s vice president for a decade until she was expelled from the governing party in 2014.   officials, who once lauded her wartime heroics, have been calling her a fraud since she created her own party this year. They say that the act of heroism for which Ms. Mujuru became famous  —     shooting down an enemy helicopter  —   was a fabrication. In turn, Ms. Mujuru and her allies have said that Mr. Mugabe  —   an intellectual who was imprisoned for years before becoming one of the liberation movement’s political leaders  —   was not a war veteran. He did not see combat, they said, and did not even have a nom de guerre. “  and the A. N. C. will never change because their support is based on the history of their liberation struggles,” said Margaret Dongo, a former   politician who is now allied with Ms. Mujuru. “That’s their trump card. ” Ms. Dongo, who also fought during the war of liberation and was known as Tichaona Muhondo, or We Shall See in the War, led the latest riposte against Mr. Mugabe and his liberation credentials. The    has reinforced the popular impression that the country’s politicians make up a class out of touch with the nation’s problems. “People are concerned about the    issues of this country and not how this and that became a hero or turned into a villain,” said Richmond Gumbo, a student who was reading newspapers in the library of the University of Zimbabwe in Harare recently. He added, “Leaders need to bow down to the needs, the basic needs of the people, and not to brag about how they fought in the liberation war over 36 years ago. ”",0
18812,China Moves a Step Forward in Its Quest for Food Security - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   The Chinese government wants to make sure its food supply is reliable and safe as it works to feed a rapidly growing middle class. So it was a coup on Wednesday when a Chinese company won approval to take over one of the world’s largest suppliers of seeds and pesticides. By clearing the deal with European Union regulators, China National Chemical Corporation is close to the $43 billion takeover of Syngenta, the Swiss farm chemical and seed company. It would be the largest Chinese takeover of a foreign company and is one of three proposed mergers in a    international race seeking greater influence over the world’s food supply. “China has been trying to develop its own seed industry  —   and agricultural chemicals as well  —   for decades, and the progress has been slow,” said Fred Gale, a senior economist at the United States Department of Agriculture. “This is an attempt to upgrade productivity. ” The deal between China National Chemical Corporation, a   company known as ChemChina, and Syngenta comes as trade relations between China and the West have become increasingly tense. The situation has been made worse by President Trump’s sharp talk on the issue. President Trump hosts the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at his    resort in Florida on Thursday, and trade is certain to be on the agenda. Already, Mr. Trump has said that largely because of trade issues, the meeting would “be a very difficult one. ” Syngenta’s clearance from the European Union is part of an international competition that includes Dow Chemicals and DuPont, who are still working to close their merger. Though best known as chemical companies, Dow and DuPont, both based in the United States, also have huge agricultural businesses. Bayer AG, the German industrial conglomerate, is also trying to complete its multibillion takeover of Monsanto. That deal would give Bayer control of the company most closely associated with the rise of genetically modified foods. And ChemChina’s takeover of Syngenta would give Beijing more influence over many of the seeds and chemicals it needs to feed its swelling population. If all three deals are completed, they would reshape the global agricultural chemical business, reducing competition in the industry. It is an important play for China, which has struggled to maintain and upgrade its food supply in recent years. China hopes to better feed its increasingly affluent population, but several food scandals have made Chinese citizens suspicious of domestic supply chains. Those scandals have fueled anxiety about genetically modified food, even as China wants to use the science to increase production. Although China has poured money into research, it still bans cultivation of genetically modified food for human consumption, and knowledge about genetically modified organisms is limited. The ChemChina deal could bolster China’s efforts to become a major player in genetically modified food. But Mr. Gale said Chinese consumers would probably remain wary. “The general public has become very suspicious of seeds,” he said. “That will be an obstacle to Syngenta becoming a pipeline for G. M. O. seeds in the China market. ” ChemChina will have to sell prized assets to take control of Syngenta. To appease European officials, it must sell substantial parts of its European businesses that make pesticides and substances that stimulate or slow plant growth. “It is important for European farmers and ultimately consumers that there will be effective competition in pesticide markets, also after ChemChina’s acquisition of Syngenta,” Margrethe Vestager, the European Union commissioner in charge of competition policy, said in a statement. “ChemChina has offered significant remedies, which fully address our competition concerns. ” The European Union granted its approval a day after ChemChina received the   from the United States Federal Trade Commission. The F. T. C. ’s approval hinged on ChemChina selling parts of a subsidiary’s business in the United States to an agricultural chemical company based in California. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which focuses on national security issues and was also regarded as a significant potential obstacle, cleared the deal in August. The ChemChina deal for Syngenta is part of a spate of consolidation in the agricultural chemical industry globally, as companies have tried to meet the challenge of falling crop prices. Their efforts to win new customers are being made more difficult by consumer resistance. Widespread suspicion of genetically modified foods in Europe means that protests against Monsanto can draw thousands, and several European countries ban their cultivation. The approval of antitrust agencies would be seen as promising for others seeking deals, said Dale Stafford, the head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas at Bain  Company, a business consultancy. “This sends a strong signal that even though there needs to be concessions, with the right strategic deals, they can happen,” Mr. Stafford said. The ability to complete another agricultural chemicals deal, however, could be diminished by the huge deals that have been done. “As markets get more concentrated, the impact on competition gets amplified,” said Elai Katz, who leads the antitrust practice at the law firm Cahill Gordon  Reindel. This could make it harder to get deals past agencies or to find buyers for divestitures. In recent years, Chinese companies have been on an acquisition binge, buying major strategic assets like copper mines and oil deposits, and investing in flashier, if less economically or geopolitically important, deals for marquee names like the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan. Lately, there have been signs that the shopping spree might be ending. China has tightened limits on how much money it is allowing past its borders, and that has threatened purchases that some Chinese officials have criticized as frivolous. Far fewer overseas acquisitions by Chinese companies have been announced this year than by this time a year ago. The value of these deals has also fallen to about $31 billion this year compared with $87 billion at the same point last year, according to Dealogic, the financial data company. American and European companies alike have criticized China’s ambitious plan to build up its own technology industries, which the overseas businesses worry could create global competitors and potentially weaken their business in the big Chinese market. And in the United States, takeover watchdogs have blocked several deals that they say could affect national security, while some lawmakers are calling for even tighter reviews. Yet Chinese companies have shown a willingness to be aggressive when it matters. And for China, food matters. “On one hand they want to have the best technology, but at the same time they don’t want their markets to be dominated by international companies like Monsanto, Dupont or Bayer,” Mr. Gale said. “So that’s the fastest way to do it, buy the technology. That seems to be China’s strategy now. ”",0
18813,"In Las Vegas, Rising Murders Strain a Police Force Used to Solving Them - The New York Times","LAS VEGAS  —   In the seven months since Heriberto Diaz Marcial was shot and killed walking home from his job as a casino porter on the Vegas Strip, church volunteers have knocked on hundreds of doors in his neighborhood and handed out fliers seeking information. The police released blurry security footage of a gray sedan tied to his three killers. His wife, Maria Diaz, has gone on television to plead for help. “I just want answers,” Ms. Diaz said as she sat in her living room, where a memorial poster from his   at the Paris Las Vegas hotel is still tucked beside the TV. “I want to see them face to face. I want to ask them, was it worth it?” But so far, nothing. Detectives in Las Vegas pride themselves on having one of the country’s better track records for solving homicides, clearing nearly eight in every 10 cases while many other   departments struggle to solve half of their murders. But like other big cities across the nation, Las Vegas is in the midst of a dramatic rise in homicides. The rising murder rate is now testing whether the 19 homicide detectives at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department can keep solving those crimes as new calls pour in, from parks awash in heroin, from streets where gang allies are quick to draw their guns, and from poor neighborhoods that lie just blocks from the shimmering casinos of the Strip. The nation’s murder rate, which has declined sharply for the last 20 years, rose by nearly 11 percent in 2015, the largest   jump in nearly 50 years. But there are still far fewer murders than in the 1990s, and criminologists believe that many large cities are in a period in which they will see steep, and unpredictable, rises and falls in homicides, but that murder rates across the country will remain fairly constant. A few cities were responsible for much of the increase, according to F. B. I. figures. In Las Vegas, the victims are a mix of   whites and Latinos who have been killed during robberies, gang shootings, drug disputes and domestic violence incidents. For homicide detectives here, the most disturbing factor may be that much of the killing is being committed by teenagers and men in their early 20s, many of whom do not understand the consequences of engaging in violence. Recently, a    arrested after a double homicide, asked investigators if he was going to be released so he could start a new job. In another recent shooting, one    boy killed another    boy amid a barrage of 80 bullets during a gun battle that encompassed three crime scenes. The police are also finding more guns on the street  —   the percent of homicides killed by guns has increased this year to 72 percent, from 66 percent last year. “You find out there was a minor altercation and someone pulled out a gun,” said Lt. Daniel McGrath, who heads the Police Department’s homicide section. “They are so quick to resort to violence that it goes from profanity to shooting. ” As homicides here have swelled to 125 so far this year  —   a 27 percent increase over 2015  —   detectives have watched caseloads grow to five or six apiece, and have become accustomed to phones ringing at 3 a. m. bringing more bad news. “I’ve got a lot of tired people,” Lieutenant McGrath said. The pace of the killings has been relentless, even for veteran detectives, who have seen the number creep steadily upward, from 84 in 2012, and are spending more of their time at crime scenes. April was especially violent, with 24 homicides, the most in any month in the city’s history. While the pace has slowed somewhat, the count this year may surpass the 157 killed in 2006. The city’s worst year was 1996, when 167 people were murdered. The homicide clearance rate for Las Vegas remains a point of satisfaction for investigators even as they are swamped with cases. Last week, the unit added two detectives to bring the total to 21, in order to help with the caseload, Lieutenant McGrath said. And Las Vegas is still far better than most cities at clearing homicides  —   which generally means that a suspect has been arrested or identified. In Chicago, for instance, detectives solve about 30 percent of their cases, and Philadelphia and Baltimore investigators clear about 50 percent. But clearance rates can swing drastically. Detroit, for instance, solved only about 9 percent of its murders in 2012, but now reports a clearance rate of more than 60 percent. Clearance data, like all crime numbers, are   by police departments, which arrive at them in various ways. For instance, while some agencies include the solving of cold case murders to bolster their annual clearance rates, Las Vegas says it counts only cases solved in the year the crimes were committed. Higher murder rates do not necessarily mean more unsolved cases. Criminal research has shown that resolving a case hinges largely on how quickly officers get to a murder scene, how many detectives work the case, and how motivated investigators are to solve it. When a killing happens in Las Vegas’s more violent neighborhoods, volunteer teams allied with the police head to the scene and to hospitals and funerals to urge people not to answer blood with blood. Weeks later, they knock on doors with community policing units to urge witnesses to come forward and help find the killer. “The root of this problem is poverty and drugs,” said Lekisha Hayes, who runs the Stars community development program in her central Las Vegas neighborhood of Cambridge Square. “Drugs are so much more powerful than a gang. People are hungry. It’s hard times. ” But for victims’ families, the math of murder is simple and unforgiving: More deaths across the Police Department’s jurisdiction of about 1. 5 million people mean more open cases, more unanswered questions, more fears about killers still uncaught. And more families like the Diazes left in limbo. The Diazes worked at the same casino on the Strip, Maria at cafes and gift shops on the day shift, and Heriberto cleaning casino floors at night. Their opposing shifts meant they spent most days apart, but she would take him a coffee and he would come to her shop and tap on the counter to let her know he was there. He did not care for the Spanish language’s bouquet of affectionate nicknames, so she was surprised when he called her “mija” shortly before he was killed. Ms. Diaz passes the spot where her husband was killed, just seven houses from her front door, each day as she takes her son and daughter to school. She thinks about his last thoughts, and whether she could be doing something to unravel the mystery of his murder. His cellphone was stolen in the attack, she said, and she has kept paying the bills for seven months, just in case someone uses it and provides a potential clue for the police. She said she called the number for the first time last week, but it went straight to voice mail. Ms. Diaz said she and her son and daughter, Eduardo, 17, and Monic, 12, have been unnerved by the gunshots, ambulance sirens and yells of drunks that animate the night around their blue stucco home in northeast Las Vegas, perpetually strung with Christmas lights. Eduardo found a bullet that had pierced the garage door a few months ago. On the other side of town, in Amber Santee’s garden apartment, memorial candles are clustered on the kitchen counter dried rose petals from her father’s funeral sit in a glass vase and newspapers mentioning his unsolved April murder are piled on the kitchen table. “This is my life now,” Ms. Santee, 28, said. The night her father, Mark, was killed in April, he was the lone security guard working a    p. m. shift at a luxury apartment complex being built on the   west side of Las Vegas. He traded text messages with Ms. Santee, cheering her on as she got ready for chemistry and statistics finals. For years, Mr. Santee, 48, had been just shy of an associate degree, and worked a series of hourly security and factory jobs. “Keep on pushing for the gold Am! !!” he wrote at 6:41 p. m. By about 10:30 p. m. Ms. Santee said, he was dead. The police believe Mr. Santee may have been trying to stop a robbery when he was shot several times in the head. In the months after his death, public attention swelled and faded as Ms. Santee agonized over troubling details of his murder. The crosses she planted outside the Elysian apartments to mark his death were torn down recently when rock gardens were put in. But Ms. Santee said she had faith her father’s killers would be caught. “We just have to wait,” she said.",0
18814,Провал за провалом: В США похитили списки шпионов-нелегалов,"0 комментариев 3 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как сообщает Associated Press со ссылкой на документы судебных органов, ""секретная информация, украденная бывшим подрядчиком Агентства национальной безопасности, включает в себя имена тайных сотрудников разведки"". 
По данным Российской газеты, защита 51-летнего Гарольда Томаса Мартина III Глен Берни будет просить федерального судью в пятницу рассмотреть вопрос об освобождении его клиента из-под стражи на том основании, что следствие по этому делу продолжается. 
Судья Дэвид Кпперзайт отклонил подобную просьбу на прошлой неделе, согласившись с прокуратурой, что освобождение Мартина представляет риск, якобы потому, что ""враги Соединенных Штатов хотели бы узнать больше о секретной информации, найденной в его доме"". 
Защита Мартина настаивает на версии, что бывший лейтенант ВМС США просто ""увлекся"", взяв документы на дом в надежде усовершенствовать свои навыки и стать более опытным специалистом в своем деле. 
Адвокаты говорят, что их клиент ""любит свою семью и свою страну"", и что нет никаких доказательств того, что он поделился информацией с иностранным государством или намеревался сделать это. 
Фирма Booz Allen Hamilton, где он работал, уволила Мартина, как только узнала о его аресте, и заявила в четверг, что наняла бывшего директора ФБР Роберта Мюллера, чтобы пересмотреть свою практику безопасности. 
Как сообщает Reuters, Гарольд Томас Мартин работал в той же компании Booz Allen Hamilton, что и Эдвард Сноуден. Напомним, Сноуден в 2013 году передавший в прессу разоблачительные материалы о действиях спецслужб США. 
По словам помощника генерального прокурора США по национальной безопасности Джона Карлина, ""возможна ситуация, когда ""во второй раз за три года сотрудник сумел похитить у АНБ строго засекреченную информацию, нанеся серьезный ущерб"". 
Сообщается, что изначально Мартин отрицал свою вину, но позже на допросе в ФБР признался в краже секретных данных. 
Ранее электронная версия The New York Times сообщила, что сотрудники Федерального бюро расследований (ФБР) арестовали подрядчика Агентства национальной безопасности (АНБ) по подозрению в краже и раскрытии ""строго секретных кодов, разработанных для взлома сетей правительств других государств"", в том числе России.

18815,6 Highlights From the Ruling on Trump’s Immigration Order - The New York Times,"A   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Thursday unanimously upheld a Federal District Court judge’s decision to temporarily block the Trump administration from carrying out its executive order on immigration. The executive order would bar entry into the United States of citizens from seven   countries. Here are some highlights from the ruling: The court summarizes what the case is about at this stage. Its job is not to look squarely at whether the executive order is lawful, but rather at whether the standards have been met to temporarily block the government from enforcing it while the broader legal questions are more fully considered. The judges unanimously decided to keep blocking the order. The Trump administration had argued that the appeals court should reject the lawsuit without scrutinizing any of its legal merits, because the two states that filed it had no standing to sue. The appeals court disagreed, primarily because of the impact the travel ban would have on public universities. The Trump administration has argued that the judiciary should stay out of the case. The appeals court strongly disagrees as a matter of constitutional first principles. Several days after Mr. Trump issued his executive order, the administration partially pulled back with a directive from his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, saying it would not apply to green card holders. The judges are dubious about the credibility of what the executive branch says is happening. This is the core of the ruling. The court thinks it is likely that the executive order will eventually be struck down as an unconstitutional violation of people’s due process rights. In deciding whether to let the executive order be enforced while the arguments are more fully litigated, the courts have to weigh the potential injury to the people who would be affected by the travel ban against the potential injury to society of blocking the order in the interim. Because the Trump administration offered no evidence suggesting that the prior system was inadequate for screening visitors from the seven countries, the court ruled against the government.",0
18816,"Brutal Force at Rikers Island Continues at an ‘Alarming Rate,’ Report Says - The New York Times","Guards at Rikers Island continue to use brutal force against inmates at an “alarming rate,” punching them in the head, slamming them into walls and then lying about it, according to a report submitted on Monday by a federal monitor overseeing reforms at the jail complex. Inmates are dragged and kicked while handcuffed, as well as doused with pepper spray when routine verbal commands and   techniques would suffice, according to the report. The report, the third published by an independent monitoring team since a federal judge gave approval in 2015 to a sweeping settlement agreement meant to clean up Rikers, paints a pessimistic portrait of conditions at the jails. The number of fights among inmates has spiked, particularly among the youngest. In the last three months of 2016, officers sustained more injuries than inmates did. “While the reforms required by the consent judgment are far too new to have resulted in significant decreases in inmate violence, the rates of violence were not expected to increase,” the report said. The report is sure to support calls to close Rikers. Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio backed a plan to replace the complex with smaller jails, although he stopped short of saying that one should be placed in each of New York’s five boroughs. But the mayor estimated that it would be at least a decade before the nine jails on the island are closed for good. The city has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to improve conditions at Rikers, hiring new officers, bolstering training and expanding programs for inmates. “We have incessantly changed the situation,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference on Monday. “Different approach to recruiting officers. Different approach to training officers. We’re increasing the number of officers, largely to reduce situations where conflicts arise because there isn’t enough personnel present to keep the situation under control. ” And still the violence continues. The report, which covers Aug. 1 to Dec. 31, 2016, documented 305 altercations that involved a strike to the head, a technique that is to be used as a last resort. While some of the strikes were necessary, according to the report, “many were utilized to punish, discipline or retaliate against an inmate. ” The report recounts an inmate who sustained 10 discrete head injuries during a confrontation with seven correction officers. Contrary to the officers’ claims, investigators found no evidence that the inmate had tried to strike a guard. There were 30 injuries classified as serious during the five months covered by the report, and nearly 700 lesser injuries. When officers use excessive force, the report found, they sometimes collude to falsify documents as a way to cover up the truth. In one case, an officer asserted that an inmate had attacked him, causing him to suffer “severe pain. ” A video showed that the inmate’s elbow “made contact with the officer’s upper body” then the officer punched him in the head. The disciplinary process remains dysfunctional, the report found. Internal Affairs investigators are often biased, favoring officers and failing to pursue discipline even when a guard’s wrongdoing is clear. The monitors described a Rikers captain who was caught on video slamming an inmate into a wall. An investigator concluded that there was no evidence the captain intended “harm. ” “Too often, even where objective evidence of wrongdoing is clearly apparent, the department failed to pursue adequate discipline,” the report said. The monitors praised the Department of Correction for moving quickly to install surveillance cameras, which can help to minimize violence. By Jan. 31, the department had installed 6, 681 cameras 8, 000 are required by the settlement. But officers have failed to properly use   cameras during confrontations with inmates. Devices were turned away or never switched on. Joseph Ponte, the correction commissioner, said his department “is moving quickly to fix the issues the monitor identifies,” adding that progress was being felt. Serious injuries in confrontations between guards and inmates declined significantly in 2016. And according to department data from 2017, the use of force by guards had reached the lowest level in years in the two jails that house the youngest inmates. Mary Lynne Werlwas, the director of the Prisoners’ Rights Project at Legal Aid and a lead attorney in the   suit that led to the settlement, called the report’s findings “deeply disappointing. ” “Progress requires a fundamental shift in the culture of impunity for misconduct and mismanagement,” Ms. Werlwas said. “It is that culture that will remain long after Rikers Island is shuttered if it is not faced squarely and robustly right now. ”",0

18818,"Money Laundering Scheme Exposed: 14 Pro-Clinton Super PACs, Nonprofits Implicated"," 
There’s a reason David Brock, founder of the liberal group Media Matters for America, chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super PACs and nonprofits.
Professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts. Brock wants his unregistered solicitor, the Bonner Group, to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason.
David Brock is laundering money 
 
Related Stories Consumers Need Protection From New Consumer Protection Bureau Rule Here’s What The Markets Are Telling Us… Exposed: Profiteers Of Governing – And These Are The Ones Who Got Caught! Brock has seven nonprofits, three super PACs, one 527 committee, one LLC, one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in Washington .
Uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations.
The Bonner Group, his professional solicitor, works off a commission. Every time money gets passed around, Bonner receives a 12.5 percent cut.
 
Follow the money 
Nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants.
But they aren’t required to disclose who gives them cash grants.
This weak system of one-way verification is being abused by Brock. He’s been cycling money between his organizations for years, and the Bonner Group’s 12.5 percent commission gets triggered after every pass.
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias Hannity Proposes A Sendoff For Obama In The Event Of A Trump Presidency In 2014, Media Matters for America raised more than $10 million.
The Bonner Group was credited for raising these funds. Media Matters paid it a $1.1 million commission.

That same year, Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock’s Franklin Education Forum , an organization that shares office space with Media Matters.

In 2014, the Franklin Education Forum reported $994,000 in total contributions, and 93.6 percent of that total came from Media Matters.
Surprisingly, though, the Franklin Education Forum gave full credit to Bonner for raising that money. It paid the fundraiser a $124,250 commission in 2014.

Notice what happened? 
Brock’s Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock’s Franklin Education Forum. Brock’s Franklin Education Forum credited the Bonner Group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. Brock paid the Bonner Group a $124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant … from himself! It doesn’t stop there 
After the Franklin Education Forum retained $869,750, it sent a $816,224 cash grant to Brock’s Franklin Forum . 

Note: The Franklin Education Forum is a 501(c)3, and The Franklin Forum is a 501(c)4. They are not the same company. 
The Franklin Forum 501(c)4 paid Bonner a commission in 2013 , so it’s safe to assume the fundraiser received a $102,028 commission in 2014. Unfortunately, it’s hard to tell for sure. It still hasn’t filed its taxes for 2014!
Let’s recap 
Say, for example, you donate $1,062,857 to Media Matters for America. This is how David Brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014:
Media Matters would receive your $1,062,857 donation. The Bonner Group would earn a $132,857 commission. Media Matters would retain $930,000. Next, Media Matters would give what’s left of your entire donation , $930,000, to the Franklin Education Forum. The Bonner Group would “earn” a $116,250 commission. The Franklin Education Forum would retain $813,750. The Franklin Education Forum would then forward the remaining $813,750 to The Franklin Forum. The Bonner Group would “earn” a $101,718 commission. The Franklin Forum would retain $712,031. In the end, Brock’s solicitor would have pocketed $350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. That’s a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.
As bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what Brock did in 2014.
How can we be sure this is intentional? 
Brock is the chairman for each of these organizations. How could he not know what’s going on?
He’s a hands-on chairman. According to their tax returns, Brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizations:
Media Matters: 31.50 hours per week Franklin Education Forum: three hours per week The Franklin Forum: one hour per week Furthermore, The New York Times reports that Brock shares a summer rental in the Hamptons with Mary Pat Bonner, the president of the Bonner Group.
Brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. These transfers are intentional. He vacations with his solicitor. Case closed.
Still not convinced? 
Brock didn’t even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. They all share the same number.

What if …? 
We even located the Bonner Group’s solicitation agreement with Media Matters on Florida’s Gift Givers’ Guide . Clarification on the commission can be found on page 2:

In English: Contractually, Brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. In spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.
Note: Yes, we are making the assumption that all of Brock’s organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the Bonner Group. Given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel it’s safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. 
This barely scratches the surface 
Utilizing public-facing tax returns, along with records submitted to the Federal Election Commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in Brock’s office:

Summary 
This is all from just one year! No further commentary required.
We understand this may be hard to believe. We first came across this in July, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.
All of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. Check for yourself — we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in Brock’s office. These data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. 
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.
We’ve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. But there aren’t any loopholes. David Brock has something to hide. Just last month, The Daily Caller reported the following:
“Brock’s former long-time live-in boyfriend William Grey (whom Brock has thanked in several of his books) threatened to go to the IRS with damaging information about how Brock was running his Media Matters empire. What did Brock do? He paid Grey $850,000 to keep quiet. Brock reportedly had to sell his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, to come up with the money. This certainly seems to indicate that Brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.”
Adding to this, Fox News reported the following:
“Grey accused Brock of ‘financial malfeasance’ and threatened to undermine Brock’s fundraising efforts.
“‘Next step is I contact all your donors and the IRS,’ Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. ‘This is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.'”
We believe that the information presented in this article is what has Brock so terrified. We feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that David Brock is laundering money through his Media Matters conglomerate.

18819,Immigrants Head to Washington to Rally While Obama Is Still There - The New York Times,"Nine busloads of immigrant activists from Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island will depart before dawn for the trip to Washington, intent on making their voices heard. They will be blasting protest playlists while carrying posters and flags, from the familiar rainbow to the worn colors of Haiti. But they are not going to the better known Women’s March on Washington, planned for Jan. 21, the day after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. Instead, they are headed to the nation’s capital on Saturday for a more modest rally focused on the rights of immigrants, called We Are Here to Stay and scheduled to start at 11 a. m. at the Metropolitan A. M. E. Church. For these groups, there was a practical, if not urgent, reason to hold the rally on Jan. 14: Barack Obama will still be president. “As an organizer, the 14th is a date that I feel safe mobilizing people to Washington,” said Natalia Aristizabal, of Make the Road New York, one of the rally’s sponsors. “We don’t know what’s going to happen after the inauguration. ” National and local organizers said they were concerned about the possibility of undocumented protesters being arrested during the new administration, especially since Mr. Trump said he planned to deport the two million to three million undocumented immigrants that he said had criminal convictions. Cristina Jiménez, the executive director of United We Dream, the national organization promoting the interests of undocumented youth known as dreamers, called the threat to immigrant communities “imminent” and added: “To be quite frank, we fear the worst. ” That is not to say that immigrants will be avoiding the women’s march. Some organizations, like United We Dream and the New York Immigration Coalition, are partners in both, and there is other overlap. New York’s   Association, which is led by Linda Sarsour, is also a sponsor of the Women’s March, of which Ms. Sarsour is one of the main organizers. Part of the mission statement of the Women’s March calls on “immigrants of all statuses” to attend, but that event has a broader platform that includes issues of pay equity, reproductive rights and safety from domestic violence. Organizers of the immigrant rally said that their protest aims to highlight the disparate groups who make up their movement, and who represent the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. “It’s of the immigrant community, of people of color, it’s broader than people who are first generation,” said Muzna Ansari, 28, the immigrant policy manager for the New York Immigration Coalition. A child of Indian immigrants, she is Muslim. “It’s a moment of connection, too. There are black immigrants who we don’t talk about. ” Ninaj Raoul, a founder and executive director of Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees, said she had seen the immigration rights movement focus on the   Latino community since the 2012 election. But black immigrants, who are far less likely to be undocumented, have pressing issues of their own, she said. “Now more than ever it’s important for the Haitian voice to be heard in this movement,” Ms. Raoul said. “Not just for the incoming government, where we have so many reasons to be worried, but for the current government because of the actions they’ve taken on Haitian immigrants. ” Over the last several months more than 80 Haitian immigrants have walked into her Brooklyn office seeking help, she said, anguished by the shifting American policy that has left them separated from family members. And those living in the city because of temporary protection granted after their country’s 2010 earthquake do not know how long that will last. Migrants from Haiti have flooded the southern border of Mexico since last spring, many making dangerous journeys through nine countries after fleeing South America. In September, the Obama administration detained Haitians at the U. S.  border arriving without visas and ordered deportations. Some pregnant women and mothers with children were given a temporary humanitarian reprieve to stay, but their husbands were deported. After Hurricane Matthew struck in early October, the administration delayed deporting Haitians, but then resumed deportations in November. For Haitians who have been living in the United States with temporary protection granted after the earthquake, that status that is set to expire in July. Ms. Raoul said that because Hurricane Matthew damaged food supplies, those Haitians did not know if they could return. So Haitian immigrants are going to Washington to appeal to Mr. Obama while they still can. They want him to take executive action to grant Haitian migrants at the southern border permission to temporarily enter the United States on humanitarian grounds, and to extend the temporary protections for another 18 months. Ms. Raoul plans to bring 10 Haitian immigrants, and their country’s flag, to Washington. They will take the bus from Sunset Park with 55 young people representing Atlas: D. I. Y. which serves undocumented immigrant youth in the neighborhood. Michelina Ferrara, the deputy director of Atlas, plans to blast her “revolutionary playlist,” with RB and   artists, both on the bus speakers and from her fanny pack. For those not traveling to Washington on Jan. 14, immigrant actions are also planned in 50 other cities. The New York Immigrant Coalition will be kicking off a statewide campaign called This is Our New York with events in Union Square Hempstead, on Long Island and the Hudson Valley. By then, Kathia Gutierrez, 48, will be in Washington with her daughter, Kathya, 29. They arrived 16 years ago from Bolivia. Kathya works as a nanny, saving money for college she can work legally because of President Obama’s program giving certain rights to undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children by their parents. Kathia, her mother, is an activist for Make the Road New York and is going to Washington to deliver a message for   Trump: “Look out for the youth. ” They will be joined by others fighting for their own subset of immigrant rights, including Alexis Pampillón, 44, an Argentine immigrant who identifies as gender nonconforming he and 20 others members of Make the Road’s L. G. B. T. Q. rights group will be leaving from Queens. Make the Road’s members, drawn from places including Bridgeport, Conn. Elizabeth, N. J. and Pennsylvania, will fill eight buses. Not all will fit into the church in Washington, which has a capacity of about 2, 500. More than 3, 000 protesters are expected, organizers said. Some, said Ms. Aristizabal of Make the Road, will stand outside with signs in Spanish and English: “Aquí Estamos y no Nos Vamos,” and “We are Here to Stay. ” That slogan is familiar, she said, adding, “But it has never been so much of a declaration of defiance. ”",0

Proposed pipeline routes through the Middle East to gas markets in Europe. The purple line is the Western-supported Qatar-Turkey pipeline. All of the nations it passes through — Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey (all highlighted in red) — have agreed to it … except Syria. The red line is the “Islamic Pipeline” from Iran through Iraq into Syria. See text below for further explanation. (Source: MintPress News ; click to enlarge) 
Summary first: We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. 
I’m not sure most Americans have figured out what’s happening in Syria, because so much of what we hear is confusing to us, and really, we know so little of the context for it. Is it an insurgency against a brutal ruler? Is it a group of insurgencies struggling for power in a nearly failed state? Is it a proxy war expressing the territorial and ideological interests of the U.S., Russia, Turkey and Iran? 
Or something else? 
According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. it is something else — a war between competing national interests to build, or not build, a pipeline to the Mediterranean so natural gas can be exported to Europe. Inconveniently for Syria, that nation lies along an obvious pipeline route. 
Which makes it another war between interests for money — something not very hard to understand at all. 
Here’s Kennedy’s argument via EcoWatch. This is a long piece, well worth a full read, but I’ll try to present just the relevant sections here. 
The Historical Context: Decades of CIA-Sponsored Coups and Counter-Coups in Syria 
Kennedy’s introductory section contains an excellent examination of the history of U.S. involvement in Syria starting in the 1950s with the Cold War machinations of the Eisenhower-appointed Dulles brothers, John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State, and Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA. Together, they effectively ruled U.S. foreign policy. 
Kennedy writes (my emphasis): 
Syria: Another Pipeline War 
… America’s unsavory record of violent interventions in Syria—obscure to the American people yet well known to Syrians —sowed fertile ground for the violent Islamic Jihadism that now complicates any effective response by our government to address the challenge of ISIS. So long as the American public and policymakers are unaware of this past, further interventions are likely to only compound the crisis. Moreover, our enemies delight in our ignorance. 
… [W]e need to look at history from the Syrians’ perspective and particularly the seeds of the current conflict. Long before our 2003 occupation of Iraq triggered the Sunni uprising that has now morphed into the Islamic State, the CIA had nurtured violent Jihadism as a Cold War weapon and freighted U.S./Syrian relationships with toxic baggage. 
During the 1950’s, President Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers rebuffed Soviet treaty proposals to leave the Middle East a cold war neutral zone and let Arabs rule Arabia. Instead, they mounted a clandestine war against Arab Nationalism—which CIA Director Allan [sic] Dulles equated with communism—particularly when Arab self-rule threatened oil concessions. They pumped secret American military aid to tyrants in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon favoring puppets with conservative Jihadist ideologies which they regarded as a reliable antidote to Soviet Marxism. At a White House meeting between the CIA’s Director of Plans, Frank Wisner, and Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, in September of 1957, Eisenhower advised the agency, “We should do everything possible to stress the ‘holy war’ aspect.” 
The CIA began its active meddling in Syria in 1949 —barely a year after the agency’s creation. Syrian patriots had declared war on the Nazis, expelled their Vichy French colonial rulers and crafted a fragile secularist democracy based on the American model. But in March of 1949, Syria’s democratically elected president, Shukri-al-Kuwaiti, hesitated to approve the Trans Arabian Pipeline, an American project intended to connect the oil fields of Saudi Arabia to the ports of Lebanon via Syria. In his book, Legacy of Ashes , CIA historian Tim Weiner recounts that in retaliation, the CIA engineered a coup , replacing al-Kuwaiti with the CIA’s handpicked dictator , a convicted swindler named Husni al-Za’im. Al-Za’im barely had time to dissolve parliament and approve the American pipeline before his countrymen deposed him , 14 weeks into his regime. 
Kennedy then details the history of coups and counter-coups in and against Syria, and concludes this section with this: 
Thanks in large part to Allan Dulles and the CIA, whose foreign policy intrigues were often directly at odds with the stated policies of our nation, the idealistic path outlined in the Atlantic Charter was the road not taken. In 1957, my grandfather, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, sat on a secret committee charged with investigating CIA’s clandestine mischief in the Mid-East . The so called “Bruce Lovett Report,” to which he was a signatory, described CIA coup plots in Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, all common knowledge on the Arab street, but virtually unknown to the American people who believed, at face value, their government’s denials. 
The report blamed the CIA for the rampant anti-Americanism that was then mysteriously taking root “in the many countries in the world today.”… A parade of Iranian and Syrian dictators, including Bashar al-Assad and his father , have invoked the history of the CIA’s bloody coups as a pretext for their authoritarian rule, repressive tactics and their need for a strong Russian alliance. These stories are therefore well known to the people of Syria and Iran who naturally interpret talk of U.S. intervention in the context of that history. 
While the compliant American press parrots the narrative that our military support for the Syrian insurgency is purely humanitarian, many Syrians see the present crisis as just another proxy war over pipelines and geopolitics. Before rushing deeper into the conflagration, it would be wise for us to consider the abundant facts supporting that perspective. 
So much for our supposed interest in “humanitarian” intervention in Syria. From a Syrian point of view, it has never been thus. It has been about pipelines since 1949, and they understand that, even if we don’t. 
The Current Conflagration 
Kennedy then turns to the present, or the near-present. Refer to the map above as you read: 
A Pipeline War 
In [the Syrians’] view, our war against Bashar Assad did not begin with the peaceful civil protests of the Arab Spring in 2011. Instead it began in 2000 when Qatar proposed to construct a $10 billion, 1,500km pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey . 
Qatar shares with Iran, the South Pars/North Dome gas field, the world’s richest natural gas repository. The international trade embargo, until recently, prohibited Iran from selling gas abroad and ensured that Qatar’s gas could only reach European markets if it is liquefied and shipped by sea, a route that restricts volume and dramatically raises costs. 
The EU, which gets 30 percent of its gas from Russia, was equally hungry for the pipeline which would have given its members cheap energy and relief from Vladimir Putin’s stifling economic and political leverage. Turkey, Russia’s second largest gas customer, was particularly anxious to end its reliance on its ancient rival and to position itself as the lucrative transect hub for Asian fuels to EU markets. The Qatari pipeline would have benefited Saudi Arabia’s conservative Sunni Monarchy by giving them a foothold in Shia dominated Syria. 
The Saudi’s geopolitical goal is to contain the economic and political power of the Kingdom’s principal rival, Iran , a Shiite state, and close ally of Bashar Assad. The Saudi monarchy viewed the U.S. sponsored Shia takeover in Iraq as a demotion to its regional power and was already engaged in a proxy war against Tehran in Yemen, highlighted by the Saudi genocide against the Iranian backed Houthi tribe. 
Which puts the Qatari pipeline squarely opposite to Russia’s national interest — natural gas (methane) sales to Europe. 
Of course, the Russians, who sell 70 percent of their gas exports to Europe, viewed the Qatar/Turkey pipeline as an existential threat. In Putin’s view, the Qatar pipeline is a NATO plot to change the status quo, deprive Russia of its only foothold in the Middle East, strangle the Russian economy and end Russian leverage in the European energy market. In 2009, Assad announced that he would refuse to sign the agreement to allow the pipeline to run through Syria “to protect the interests of our Russian ally.” 
That was likely the last straw vis-à-vis the U.S. Which brings us to another pipeline, the so-called “Islamic Pipeline” (see map above): 
“Assad further enraged the Gulf’s Sunni monarchs by endorsing a Russian approved “Islamic pipeline” running from Iran’s side of the gas field through Syria and to the ports of Lebanon. The Islamic pipeline would make Shia Iran instead of Sunni Qatar, the principal supplier to the European energy market and dramatically increase Tehran’s influence in the Mid-East and the world. Israel also was understandably determined to derail the Islamic pipeline which would enrich Iran and Syria and presumably strengthen their proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. 
Another, competing pipeline which would run through Syrian territory, but this time carrying Iranian gas instead of Qatari gas. Thus the demonizing of Assad as evil in the mold of Saddam Hussein, instead of just a run-of-the-mill Middle East autocrat, as bad as some but better than others. Kennedy includes a good section on the history of the al-Assad family’s rule of Syria, including this information from top reporters Sy Hersh and Robert Parry: 
According to Hersh, “He certainly wasn’t beheading people every Wednesday like the Saudis do in Mecca.” Another veteran journalist, Bob Parry, echoes that assessment. “No one in the region has clean hands but in the realms of torture, mass killings, civil liberties and supporting terrorism, Assad is much better than the Saudis.” 
In September 2013, the Sunni states involved in the Qatar-Turkey pipeline were so determined to remove Syrian opposition to the pipeline that they offered, via John Kerry, to carry the whole cost of an U.S. invasion to topple al-Assad. 
Kerry reiterated the offer to Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL27): “With respect to Arab countries offering to bear the costs of [an American invasion] to topple Assad, the answer is profoundly Yes, they have. The offer is on the table.” 
Obama’s response: 
Despite pressure from Republicans, Barrack Obama balked at hiring out young Americans to die as mercenaries for a pipeline conglomerate . Obama wisely ignored Republican clamoring to put ground troops in Syria or to funnel more funding to “moderate insurgents.” But by late 2011, Republican pressure and our Sunni allies had pushed the American government into the fray. 
The rest is a history of provocation and over-reaction — a great deal of both — and chaos and death in Syria. Kennedy provides much detail here, at one point adding: 
[Syria’s] moderates are fleeing a war that is not their war . They simply want to escape being crushed between the anvil of Assad’s Russian backed tyranny and the vicious Jihadi Sunni hammer that we had a hand in wielding in a global battle over competing pipelines . You can’t blame the Syrian people for not widely embracing a blueprint for their nation minted in either Washington or Moscow. The super powers have left no options for an idealistic future that moderate Syrians might consider fighting for. And no one wants to die for a pipeline. 
I’ll leave it there, but again, do read the entire piece if you want to truly understand what’s going on in Syria, and what is about to go on. 
Bottom Line 
Bottom line, it’s as Kennedy said: “No one wants to die for a pipeline”… but many do and will. 
I’ll offer three thoughts. One , if we weren’t so determined to be deeply dependent on fossil fuels, this would be their war, not ours. Two , we are deeply dependent on fossil fuels because of the political machinations of the oil companies, their CEOs, and the banks and hedge funds who fund them, all of whom pay our government officials — via campaign contributions and the revolving door — to prolong that dependence. We’re here because the holders of big oil money want us here. 
And three , keep all this in mind during the term of the next president. It will help you make sense of the phony warrior- cum -humanitarian arguments we’re almost certain to be subjected to. 
We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase.",0
18821,Voting is the Problem. Here’s the Solution.,"CorbettReport.com November 8, 2016 
In Douglas Adams’ So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish , there is a scene where a spaceship lands on earth and a robot emerges from the craft, proclaiming that “I come in peace” and exhorting the earthlings to “take me to your Lizard.” The story’s protagonist, Arthur Dent, has this strange request explained to him by his friend, Ford Prefect, an experienced galactic hitchhiker: 
“It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see…” 
“You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?” 
“No,” said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, “nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.” 
“Odd,” said Arthur, “I thought you said it was a democracy.” 
“I did,” said ford. “It is.” 
“So,” said Arthur, hoping he wasn’t sounding ridiculously obtuse, “why don’t the people get rid of the lizards?” 
“It honestly doesn’t occur to them,” said Ford. “They’ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they’ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.” 
“You mean they actually vote for the lizards?” 
“Oh yes,” said Ford with a shrug, “of course.” 
“But,” said Arthur, going for the big one again, “why?” 
“Because if they didn’t vote for a lizard,” said Ford, “the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?” 
“What?” 
“I said,” said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, “have you got any gin?” 
“I’ll look. Tell me about the lizards.” 
Ford shrugged again. 
“Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,” he said. “They’re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone’s got to say it.” 
If only this was a joke. But here we are, on the verge of a contest between the two least respected, most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history. And some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them. 
If there is any solace at all in this year’s selection cycle it is that, as The Corbett Report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception, there is absolutely nothing at stake here; the presidential figureheads are mere puppets, false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military, economic and diplomatic machinery of the US-led world empire. 
Do you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years, hoping against hope that the public doesn’t use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power, dashing decades (or centuries) of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens? Just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions, let me answer that one for you: No. No they do not. 
But don’t take my word for it. Take Emma Goldman. As she’s been reputed to have said (and if she didn’t, feel free to tell other people that I said it): “If voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal.” 
Or take H.L Mencken, who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped : 
The state—or, to make the matter more concrete, the government—consists of a gang of men exactly like you and me. They have, taking one with another, no special talent for the business of government; they have only a talent for getting and holding office. Their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they can’t get, and to promise to give it to them. Nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing. The tenth time it is made good by looting A to satisfy B. In other words, government is a broker in pillage, and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods. 
Or take Lysander Spooner, who wrote : 
The principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority, practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men, as to which of them shall be masters, and which of them slaves; a contest, that – however bloody – can, in the nature of things, never be finally closed, so long as man refuses to be a slave. 
Or Wendy McElroy, who reminds us that: 
Voting is not an act of political freedom. It is an act of political conformity. Those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence. They are screaming in the politician’s ear: “You do not represent me. This is not a process in which my voice matters. I do not believe you.” 
Yes, voting is worse than a dead end. It’s less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache. It’s more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table. It is evil, immoral and contemptible. It is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved, too. 
But, as I pointed out in yesterday’s conversation with Larken Rose, if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesn’t matter anyway and will not change anything at all. It will not even “register as a protest” as some would like to believe, since the elections are rigged and the votes aren’t counted. 
So if you are so inclined, knock yourself out. Cast a ballot. But instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless, meaningless and immoral act, can we at least agree to use the next 1460 days to do something actually productive? I leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase “actually productive,” but if you’d allow me to offer some humble suggestions: 
Find, join or create a community organization or freedom cell with a focus on fostering economic connections and social ties with people in your geographical area. 
Find, join or create a community currency , community trading program or community exchange to foster agoristic connection between yourself and others in your area. 
Commit to spending a certain amount of time each week spreading awareness about the banking oligarchy , false flag terrorism , GMO crops , or any subject you feel strongly about, either offline or online, using the work of others or by starting your own blog, newsletter or community meet up group. 
Learn about gardening , canning, appliance repair, 3D printing , monetary theory , or any subject that you think will be handy in the event of a government collapse (or even if the government doesn’t collapse). 
Read more books. Spend less time arguing with people online and more time making friends at the local coffee shop. Learn a new skill and teach it to someone else. 
In short, do all of the million things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the phony baloney political charade exemplified by national selection day. Because if all you ever do is tick a box in a voting booth and sit back to see who wins the rigged sporting event, you probably believe the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to you.",0

18823,A Latina Disney Movie Princess? The Wait Isn’t Over - The New York Times,"I’m not part of Disney’s target audience for its latest princess movie, “Moana,” but I don’t care. I’ve been excited about this film since Dwayne Johnson previewed it last year at the D23 Expo for all things Disney. As much as the new   Miranda music sounds promising, what’s really exciting is the chance to see a Disney princess who doesn’t look like those we have already. I was already aging out of the children’s movie demographic when my mom took us to see Robert Rodriguez’s “Spy Kids” in 2001. Yes, it was a silly story: Children turn into spies to save their   agent parents. But my sister and I became obsessed. The suave   father was played by Antonio Banderas with a pronounced Spanish accent. The children were named Carmen and Juni (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) and the implication was that they were   or   Americans. As a daughter of Cuban immigrants who once struggled with her accent, I had never seen characters who looked or sounded like us as the heroes of their own story. “Spy Kids” is still one of the few positive examples I hold onto, 15 years later. I’m not alone. There are many nonwhite women and girls who don’t see movie characters who look the way they do, and the omission can affect their  . That’s why the issue of diversity in movies for young people is just as important as pushing for inclusion across Hollywood, both behind, and in front of, the camera. So much of nonwhite representation in cinema is trivial at best, stereotypical at worst  —   the wisecracking sidekick or the background player stuck there as a token. I remembered feeling that something was amiss about Tito the Chihuahua in Disney’s “Oliver   Company” (1988). Why did the only dog with a Mexican accent (voiced by Cheech Marin, who has a less embarrassing part in “Spy Kids”) have to   cars? I wanted to see more of the mechanic tomboy Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors) in “Atlantis: The Lost Empire” (2001) and wished I could forget that “Cars” (2006) has a barely visible lowrider named Ramone (Mr. Marin, again) that happens to be the only vehicle in Radiator Springs with hydraulics. I forgot that “The Emperor’s New Groove” (2000) was set in the Inca Empire, because none of the main voice actors (David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton) sounded as if they spoke our language. Yet one of the   videos in our home was “The Three Caballeros,” a Disney animated guide to South America from 1944. Donald Duck is the American protagonist, joined by the Mexican rooster Panchito (Joaquin Garay) and the Brazilian parrot José (José Oliveira) on a   tour of Latin America. More than just a Technicolor spectacle (akin to “Fantasia,” in terms of trippy animated musical sequences) “The Three Caballeros” was a cultural explainer that didn’t entirely reduce our stories to cheap tropes. As an indirect product of the Good Neighbor Policy, by which the United States invested in South American ties, the movie had incentive to avoid negative portrayals. When it came to Disney princess movies, my sister and I had very different experiences. It was always easier to find a princess who looked the way I do, because I was born with much paler skin than anyone in our family. My younger sister, Cristina, didn’t decide to be Jasmine from “Aladdin” during playtime friends assigned her the character. Back then, that was the animated figure that looked closest to her, and she didn’t have many others to choose from. Luckily, the Disney renaissance of the 1990s gave us many more diverse heroines to treasure. Cristina adored Pocahontas’s free spirit and modeled herself on the strong Mulan. But they often weren’t the main princesses featured in Disney advertising or merchandise. And once their movies faded from store shelves, so would the dolls and the rest of their products. In those days, the newer princesses weren’t stocked   like those of the classic era: Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora from “Sleeping Beauty. ” In this sense, “Moana” is another step in the right direction. Native Hawaiians are entering a rarefied pop culture circle, inclusion in a movie that will reach viewers around the world. Considering how women, and especially women of color, are rarely shown as leaders onscreen, this is no small victory. The evolving arc of Disney princesses  —   from the damsel in distress Snow White in 1937 to the entrepreneurial dreamer Tiana in “The Princess and the Frog” in 2009  —   gives hope that we’ll see more animated stories starring young female characters who look as if they could be from anywhere around the world. Then again, no tickets have been sold to a Disney movie starring a Latina princess. She doesn’t exist yet. The company started a TV show, “Elena of Avalor,” about such a character, but that series lacks the production values and marketing heft of a   movie. It seems like a halfhearted concession to Latinas  —   half a Disney princess  —   but it’s more than other girls still waiting to see themselves on the big screen have received. There are many still waiting for a “Moana” to call their own, a movie to pass on to their children that speaks to them about their culture. My sister ended up working for a few months this year as a performer at one of Disney’s theme parks. After several frustrating auditions, she was told she was too dark to play any character not covered in fur. She tried out to greet guests as Elena of Avalor, and she received the same answer: too dark. (She ended up playing characters while fully covered in costumes.) Not even as an adult does she fit in Disney’s kingdom. But I’m hoping that those days are numbered, and that she and other women and girls like her will never have to feel as if they didn’t belong in the Happiest Place on Earth.",0
18824,NATO Confirms Major Troop Buildup In Eastern Europe,"( ANTIWAR ) A day after reports NATO was soliciting even more ground troops for their deployment into Eastern Europe, officials are reporting “progress” in recruiting more troops from more member nations to participate in the deployment, intended to be around 40,000 troops along the Baltic states, near Russia’s border. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg claimed to have been “ very inspired ” by the response of nations he sought troops from, after yesterday’s report Quote: d diplomats as saying the deployment was meant to both “confront” Russia and to undercut Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s complaints NATO isn’t participating enough in its own defense.
The new participants in the deployment include Albania, Slovenia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Croatia, Belgium, and Norway. The size of individual deployments from different nations is unclear, but there will be four battalions, and the US is expected to provide the majority.
With all these troops headed to the Baltic coast, reports out of Russia’s media suggest that they are planning some new warship deployments into their Baltic Fleet, with an eye toward enhancing their targeting capacity along the shore.",0
18825,Pa. lawmakers approve ban on naming officers in shootings,"Philly.com – by Angela Couloumbis 
HARRISBURG – As cities nationwide grapple with fatal police shootings, many involving unarmed black men, Pennsylvania’s legislature on Thursday passed and sent to Gov. Wolf a contentious measure that would block public officials from immediately releasing the names of officers involved in such incidents. 
The measure, sponsored by State Rep. Martina White (R., Phila.) and approved by the GOP-controlled legislature, stoked sharp opinions. 
Supporters say the bill, supported by local police unions, is necessary to protect officers and their families after such incidents. 
“We are the protectors of our protectors,” said one proponent, State Rep. Dom Costa (D., Allegheny), a former Pittsburgh police chief. 
Opponents said the bill flies in the face of transparency, which they believe is critical in police-involved shootings. 
“Do not undermine the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color,” Rep. Margo Davidson (D., Delaware) said in a floor debate. “This legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion.” 
Wolf has not said whether he will sign the bill. Civil libertarians said a law could be the first of its kind in the United States. 
State law now lets local officials determine when to publicly identify an officer who has used force. 
Under the legislation, public officials would be barred from releasing the name of an officer involved in a shooting until 30 days after the incident, or after an official investigation into it ends. Violators could be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor. 
The Attorney General’s Office and district attorneys would be exempt. 
The law would supersede current policy in Philadelphia, where the Police Department typically discloses names of officers involved in shootings within 72 hours if there are no credible threats to those officers. A department spokesman on Thursday would say only that if the bill became law, Philadelphia police would follow it. 
The Pittsburgh Police Department generally does not identify officers involved in shootings unless they are charged with a crime. Officer Robert Swartzwelder, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 1 there, called the proposal fair. 
“There’s an obligation by society to protect its police officers as well,” he said. “The police put their lives on the line to protect the public, and they don’t lose their rights because they put on a badge.” 
Elizabeth Pittinger, executive director of the Pittsburgh Citizen Police Review Board, a city-funded independent watchdog, called the bill chilling. “Gagging a public official from disclosing a police officer’s identity and then criminalizing a public official’s accountability to the public is outrageous,” she said. 
Critics also complained that Republican legislators pushed through a controversial measure on their last expected voting day without a full airing. 
White’s bill was approved, 151-32, with many Philadelphia-area lawmakers against it. In the Senate, it passed 39-9. 
The legislature has enough votes to override a Wolf veto, but would have to take the unusual step of reconvening for votes after Election Day to do so.",0
18826,A Way Forward to Liberation for all Peoples: A New Paradigm For True Human Diversity and Freedom!,"30 Views Share: 
Dr. David Duke offers a New Paradigm for Humanity. Read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of Human Rights. A recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its Human diversity, independence and freedom. The right of every people to preserve its culture, traditions, art forms and characteristics of society. 
A path to peace and harmonious nations and societies. Why we must resist Globalist destruction of freedom, Globalist forms of economic and financial slavery, and Globalist, Zionist wars. 
In the power of its reason, love and understanding, this declaration of Human Diversity and Freedom can be the moral engine to saving our European heritage and truly the rights of every people on Earth! The Foundation of Human Freedom 
I believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of Human diversity. I cherish not only the value of every form of life on Earth in what we call biodiversity, but also respect and honor the diversity of Mankind. I believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of Humanity, its own heritage and culture. That every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent. 
Human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different. Humanity is not one, it is many. Destroying the variety, diversity and freedom of a diverse Humanity is a destruction of Humanity itself. 
Not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art, music, culture, religion, societal structure and government, leads to Human conflict and often to violence and Human suffering on a horrific scale. 
Much of the world’s conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different, but because they are not allowed to be different! because Globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires. They want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real Human diversity. Human differences in values, cultures, economies, religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the Globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers. Human Diversity is natural 
Human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years. Whether we celebrate Human diversity as the handiwork of Nature or in a religious sense as the creation of God, we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the Earth. 
We believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of Humanity, that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture, to nurture its particular expressions of art, music, literature, philosophies, architecture, religion, diet, traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for Mankind. 
We believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent, and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation. And we reject the Globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy Human diversity. Every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom 
We believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image, its own nature and spirit. 
For example, the people of Tibet have the Human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage, culture and tradition of that nation, as should all peoples. Today the Tibetan people are threatened by massive non-Tibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of Tibetan people in their own homeland. The loss of the unique people and culture of Tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of Humanity. What is true for Tibet and the Tibetan people is true for every people on Earth. We believe that the people of Tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders, and an inherent Human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character, and its freedom and independence. 
Nations more similar in their cultural, ethnic, religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural, ethnic or religious divisions. 
We also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy, peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society. 
If one looks honestly at the world, he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict, hatreds, wars, genocide and other horrific Human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict, often accompanied by religious conflict. And when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite. 
It is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict, you must endeavor to give every people the Human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and, that every group respect the right of every other group to do this. 
We believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supra-national states and globalist denial of the reality of Human diversity and denial of the natural Human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage, traditions, culture and values. One size does not fit all. 
Instead of recognizing this reality, the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of Humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation. Instead of accepting the reality of Human nature and truly the diversity of all life, including Human life, the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations. Massive immigration of diverse peoples into another people’s living space produces conflict not harmony 
We believe that massive forced immigration of non-indigenous people into other people’s lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people. 
And this leads to civil repression, conflict, hatreds, violence. One does not have to look much further than the Palestinian Nakba, or the massive immigration into Tibet as examples of this universal truth, but this reality is just as true in Europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states. 
Look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive, unwanted immigration. 
A world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom. 
A multicultural state does not contribute to Human diversity. It does not contribute to Human happiness, peace and harmony. It more often than not lessens Human love and Human rights. No matter what the high motive, it produces more disharmony than harmony, more discord than accord. 
Just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space, and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish, so it is true for every people of Humanity. 
Every people needs a living space and eco-cultural system in which it can thrive. Ignoring this reality leads to conflict. Diverse Human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against Humanity. 
United Nations studies show ethnic, cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in Human suffering, numbering hundreds of millions of dead, injured, and dispossessed Human beings. 
This urge to diversity has always been in Mankind, and always will be. Not to recognize this elemental part of mankind’s Nature is the progenitor of conflict. 
In fact, with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free, ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression. 
Nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring Human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted. Trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide 
The global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the world’s populations, tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and Human expression . 
They attempt to change Human nature, but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide. 
Better to recognize Human nature, and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect. 
It is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the Human right of every people to exist and thrive. However, those who seek their own people’s freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people. And any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts. 
It is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of Humanity and avoid as much Human conflict as possible, than to try to destroy Human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity. Even if the destruction of people’s is based on a utopian vision, because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate. Attempts to control, exploit or harm any people is a crime against Humanity 
We must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people. We must adopt a clear Human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against Humanity. 
We support Human freedom and we support Human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society, but we do not support supremacism, control or repression of any other people. Efforts to control or exploit is a crime against Humanity. 
As a person of European descent I see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly European peopled nations that are today called the West. I see that this globalism not only damages and harms the world’s diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people. And I have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity. 
This is a life-changing lesson that I have learned in my own life. As a very young man I joined a non-violent Klan organization in my community. Like so many young people across the world, I longed to identify with my own people, to defend the heritage that I love and that I believed was threatened. 
But still as a young man I left the organization because I came to realize I have no moral right to speak about Human rights for my own people unless I embrace the idea of the same Human rights for every people, and further, that we must be committed to securing Human rights, not with war, not with violence, not with Human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals. 
I believe that the vast majority of the earth’s people believe in the principles I set forth here. In my own life I further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own people’s heritage and rights that I have for mine. 
I realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all Humanity, can one morally campaign for your own people’s fundamental rights. Defending the Diversity of Humanity is a defense of Humanity itself 
There is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage. In fact defending and preserving the diversity of Humanity is defense of Humanity itself. 
But, it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all. 
In that context and only with that understanding, can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social, religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of Humanity. 
Nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage, culture, religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of Humanity and their societal harmony. 
It is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of so-called multiculturalism. And if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples, cultures and religions lead, just look to what happened in the war-ravaged now dismembered nation once called Yugoslavia, look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in Tibet, look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the Mideast. 
Group differences run deep. Even though the Muslim Qur’an repeatedly teaches Muslim unity, still some extremist elements of Shiites and Sunnis blow up the children of each other in the other’s holy places of worship. Nor did the admonitions of Jesus Christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop Irish Catholics and Scottish-derived Protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents. 
Although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another people’s lands, we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strife-torn communities, regions and nations. Models of self rule and societal harmony 
And just as a majority has the Human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values, so minorities must be accorded their Human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence, or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots. 
This is Human freedom and this is Human rights on the most fundamental level. Those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression. 
Autonomy within nations, such as the German language speaking South Tyrol region of North Italy and the Italian, French and German-speaking Cantons of Switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language, heritage, ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric. 
Nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people. 
Even European nations divided by slight differences in history, identity, genetics and culture, seek this freedom. The artificially created nation of Czechoslovakia was composed of Czechs and Slovaks held together by 50 years of intense totalitarian physical suppression, propaganda and conditioning. 
When the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. 
They did this with mutual respect and not war, and without horrific crimes against Humanity. 
Contrast that to the artificially created state of Yugoslavia created in name of empire, and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime. When Communism fell, people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples. As a result, a long war and brutality and massive crimes against Humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict. 
How much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions. Take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old Yugoslavia, the Serbians and the Croatians. Even though Serbians may have dominated the government of Yugoslavia, to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity. 
So even the Serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled. People now warmly embrace the right of Serbians and Croatians to be themselves and rule themselves. Globalism is a continuation of Yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale 
Ironically, the Serbians and the Croatians and indeed all of us, face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of Serbia and Croatia, their currencies, controlled by New York and London rather than by their own people, and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by Hollywood and New York rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values. 
And in the height of insanity, the Globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both Serbia and Croatia of massive numbers of non-European immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than Serbs and Croats. A prescription for future Human conflict. The rights of both majorities and minorities 
There are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage, with only minor differences among their inhabitants. 
But, nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite, and propagandized that Humanity is one and not many go against the people’s will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population. 
This process is almost always against the democratic will of the nation’s inhabitants as history repeatedly shows. And then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase, the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech, free association, and all kinds of Human liberty, even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority. 
A powerful example is how the American government has now made it illegal to display a Christian Christmas motif on public ground, even in an overwhelmingly Christian cultural nation. America supposedly created by e pluribus unum (out of the many, one) is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics. 
The most powerful lobby in American politics by far is, for instance, the Jewish Lobby, comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the American people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism. Jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of Christian Christmas traditions. 
The political landscape of America is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow, except of course the European American majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions, such as Christmas are destroyed. Of course, it goes far beyond Christmas. Americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration. The rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed 
On the international level it must be recognized as a crime against Humanity for any imperial state to occupy another people’s lands for exploitation of its labor or resources. Where autonomy or independent regions are not possible, a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions, schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit. 
It is time to stand for freedom for all peoples. It is time to stand up to Globalist destruction of biodiversity, destruction of Human diversity, destruction of the earth’s indigenous cultures, artistic expressions, lifestyles, traditions and independence. Zionist Globalism is actually supremacism 
The globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of Humanity. They want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth. 
They seek to destroy the Human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us, and market the same brands of junk movies, media and music. They want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it, that not only destroys the planet’s ecosystems, but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and other ills. 
They want to control the value of the currency in your pocket, and force you and your nation under a corrupt Zionist-controlled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt. 
They want to put you and all of us under a soulless, Globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation. 
And these globalists want war, perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people. 
They grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics, and they seek to stamp out Human diversity and seek to regiment all of Humanity to their New World Order all while the New York centered Globalist media supports Israel as a quote “Jewish State”, and supports Zionist control of the International Banks and the Globalist media. So in reality, Zionist-Driven Globalism is actually form of Jewish supremacism. 
Globalism is Imperialism on a global level, and the greatest threat to human freedom, diversity and independence in all of world history. Yes to Freedom, yes to Diversity and Independence 
But, my dear friends all over the world, in my homeland of America and that of my brethren in Europe, but among all freedom loving people across the globe, millions of us say no to globalism. 
We say yes to freedom, yes to Human diversity and independence. 
We say no to globalist wars such as the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, the planned war on Iran, horrific wars that are part of the Zionist, Globalist agenda. 
We say no to the Zionist dominated Globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars. 
We say yes to a free Internet and the freedom of people create their own media, literature, music and art forms. No longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the Globalist elite. 
We say no to Globalism, yes to Human freedom, yes to Human diversity, yes to world of peace and prosperity. 
We say yes to every people’s striving to preserve their way of life, their particular heritage, their particular expression of Humanity. 
Whether we are Kurds, or Pakistanis, or Iranians or Palestinians. Whether we are Chinese, or Japanese, or Africans or Indians or of European heritage, we say no to globalism. 
We say yes to Human Freedom and Global Diversity. We say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny. 
We say no to the Global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out Human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power. We say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life, yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth. 
We are Humanity. We are many. 
Because we honor our own heritage and traditions, we honor every heritage and tradition. 
Because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on Earth. 
Because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s. 
Just as most Europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures, we refuse to support the Globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world. 
Because we love peace, we refuse to support their Zionist-driven globalist wars. A New Paradigm of Human Rights 
This is a new affirmation of Human rights, a new paradigm. It is the Human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom. 
It is found where people yearn for Human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in Nature. 
The Globalists have global economic, media political and military power. But we represent the true desires of Humanity for freedom. 
We represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people, and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions. Human Diversity, Freedom and Independence 
We must resist rule of the Globalists over us with a Global coalition of mutually free peoples. 
We are rising in every nation. 
Our Paradigm for Human Freedom and Diversity is growing among people all over the world. 
The Globalists cannot rule over us without our consent. They cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of Human freedom and diversity, not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all Mankind, good for all people on this planet. 
The principles we stand for we hold, for our own people and for every people on the face the Earth. 
This is the world I am committed to, the Humanity I am committed to, the nation in my own land that I am committed to. 
I hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for Humanity, a new commitment to Human freedom and diversity.

18827,Kris Kobach Enters Kansas Governor Race to End ‘Insane’ Policies like Charging American Students Three Times as Much as Illegals,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach discussed his gubernatorial campaign with SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily. [Kobach said taxation would be a core issue in his campaign.  LISTEN: “Some people may know Kansas. We did cut our income taxes quite a bit and reduced to zero the taxes on LLCs and S corporations a few years ago,” he said. “But a coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans in the legislature just raised those taxes back up, doing so on the theory that they had to, to balance the budget. ” “I think that Kansas doesn’t have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. We should have been cutting the budget,” he contended. On immigration, Kobach said Kansas is “a fairly conservative state, but our legislature hasn’t been conservative, and we’ve kind of become the sanctuary state of the Midwest. ” “We’re not formally a sanctuary state, but we do nothing to discourage illegal immigration,” he elaborated. “We give aliens   tuition. I want to stop that. ” Kobach noted Kansas is “one of the very few states west of the Mississippi that does not have term limits,” which he saw as vital to fighting corruption. “As a result, our legislators, some of them form entire careers in the state legislature. I’d like to see us have term limits for the legislature, as well as for the entire list of statewide offices,” he said. Kobach wryly conceded, “The left is not excited that I’m running” when Boyle noted the panoply of   groups denouncing his candidacy for governor. Boyle noted the left was fearful that Kobach really would put a stop to “unbelievable” policies like giving discounted   tuition rates to illegal immigrants. “It’s insane,” Kobach agreed. “I mean, think about it: You’ve got someone who lives in a neighboring state, say Missouri. A kid grows up there, wants to go to Kansas University or Kansas State, pays three times as much in tuition as an illegal alien. It makes no sense whatsoever. It’s against federal law. Congress was trying to stop this way back in the nineties they passed a law saying no state could do it, but several states did anyway. ” “We’re going to try to stop that. I think you just need a governor who will come in and say, ‘Look, I’m not budging. We’re going to do it, and we’re going to do it now, or we’re going to do it later, but we’re going to do it while I’m governor,’” he said, promising to “draw some lines in the sand and not let anyone cross them. ” Kobach laid out three major points in his   agenda. “One I already mentioned was term limits. Try to push term limits through. Now, that’s going to be a heavy lift since we don’t have the popular initiative. We’re going to have to push it through the legislature, and you know most politicians don’t like limiting their own terms in legislatures,” he said. “Second is pass a statute stopping the revolving door,” he continued. “Right now in Kansas, you can retire from the legislature, and then the next day, you can start lobbying your former colleagues. We’ll put time limits on how soon you can become a lobbyist in Kansas. You can become a lobbyist somewhere else if you want, but not in Kansas. ” Kobach said his third goal would be to achieve political transparency by replacing “Republicans in Name Only” who tend to side with Democrats. “We really have this problem very badly in Kansas,” he explained. “If you look at the numbers, our legislature in the Senate is 32 to 8  —   32 Republicans to 8 Democrats. Similar lopsided numbers in the House, over a   majority Republican. But many of those Republicans are truly RINOs  —   Republicans in Name Only. They vote with the Democrats all the time. When they go home, they talk like Republicans. They might even use the word ‘conservative’ to describe themselves. But then, they come in and become a completely different person when they are in the state legislature. ” “One of the things the governor has to do is actually call people out by name and say, ‘Look, I need this person’s vote’ and try to get the public aware of who these people are who are breaching the public trust,” said Kobach.  “If their district wants to elect someone who is liberal and votes with the Democrats, so be it. But there is a real deception going on. You see it in states like Kansas, where there are districts across the western part of our state which will not elect a Democrat, period. So what the Democrats do is, they just run as Republicans,” he said. Kobach agreed with Boyle that voters are tired of politicians who say one thing and do another. “I think they’re also tired of the politician who talks like everything he says is carefully polished and has gone through three focus groups,” Kobach added. “The thing that people loved about Trump is that he’s speaking from the gut. They could tell that this is what the guy really thinks. His speech wasn’t prepared and screened and reviewed by others, a bunch of     baloney, but is actually a guy telling us what he thinks. I think that’s important. ” “Nobody can do it like President Trump does it, but that’s kind of the way I have spoken to my constituents as secretary of state: ‘Here, this is what I’m going to do. I’m not going to beat around the bush. If you don’t like it, don’t vote for me,’” he said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

As the Halloween season draws near, stories of strange experiences and supernatural hauntings ride high, and popular interest in haunted houses, phantom beings, other things deemed “paranormal” abound. 
So far as the serious study of apparitions goes, opinions about the concept of “ghosts” remains varied, manifesting in a number of different folkloric motifs since humankind’s earliest days. Ghosts are most often represented in cultural traditions as being spirits of the deceased, and thus, legends often conjoin ghosts with death and the afterlife. In equal measure, traditions pertaining to belief in ghosts often view them as the stuff of terror, or perhaps even as harbingers of things–often terrible–yet to come. 
This attitude, and the “fear” associated with belief in ghosts, has especially been the case with ghost stories in America. We have little doubt that thanks can be attributed to tales of popular hauntings the likes of The Amityville Horror to account for much of this. Such stories, though supposedly based in some element of fact (which is often debatable, upon further review) are further vilified on the big screen, making them the lasting stuff of horror cinema. 
The attitudes and, more frankly, the biases that begin to emerge toward our ideas about ghosts in relation to cultural standards become all-too apparent, once consideration beyond these lasting stereotypes is given. In William Butler Yeats’ The Celtic Twilight, the famed poet retold a number of ghostly legends recounted to him by the people of Ireland; particularly an older gentleman Yeats identifies as an acquaintance named “Paddy Flynn.” 
In the chapter on “Village Ghosts,” Yeats describes the Irish belief that to have a ghost living within one’s home is actually good luck; a stark contrast when paired alongside the modern “horror stories” of the last few decades: 
“The house ghost is usually a harmless and well-meaning creature. It is put up with as long as possible. It brings good luck to those who live with it. I remember two children who slept with their mother and sister and brothers in one small room. in the room was also a ghost. They sold herrings in the Dublin streets, and did not mind the ghost much, because they knew they would always sell their fish easily while they slept in the ‘ha’nted’ room.” 
“Harmless” and “well-meaning” usually aren’t the first terms that spring to mind in relation to ghost stories today. Yeats does, however, go on to describe that some of the ghosts of Ireland were viewed as harbingers, appearing before the death of another, or in the very most classic sense, returning to fulfill “unfinished business” of some sort: 
“I have some acquaintances among the ghost-seers of western villages. The Connacht tales are very different from those of Leinster. These spirits have a gloomy, matter-of-fact way with them. They come to announce a death, to fulfill some obligation, to revenge a wrong, to pay their bills even—as did a fisherman’s daughter the other day—and then hasten to their rest.” 
Yeats further noted that, “it is demons, and not ghosts, that transform themselves into white cats or black dogs,” the latter evoking the popular image of the “Black Shuck” of the British Isles, although the mention of a white cat representing a demon seems to contrast starkly with the traditions about black cats as the ‘familiars’ of witches. 
On the subject of animals, and their relationship with the unexplained, some time ago I received an email from one of my followers, who shared his own story of what he perceived may have been an encounter with the ghost of a cat: 
“I have a friend near Barnardsville NC who used to have a black cat. The cat was old and eventually died in the house. One day, after having drunk a cup of coffee, I was standing at the sink, rinsing the coffee cup, and out of the corner of my eye I saw her black cat (then deceased already) charging my ankles, like a kitten would. I called to my friend and told her that her cat had just attacked my ankles. She started laughing and assured me that her cat was dead (which I knew). I told her that, perhaps, her cat didn’t know she was dead, yet.” 
Somewhat in keeping with this idea of animal specters, Yeats went on to discuss in The Celtic Twilight how some traditions in Ireland hold that ghosts, believed to be the spirits of dead people, may return in the form of various animals: 
“In the surrounding villages they adopt strange disguises. A dead old gentleman steals the cabbages of his own garden in the shape of a large rabbit. A wicked sea-captain stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall, in the shape of a snipe, making the most horrible noises. He was only dislodged when the wall was broken down; then out of the sold plaster the snipe rushed away whistling.” 
Nearby on the Isle of Man, which lays between Ireland and England, there is a strange bit of folklore about a family named Irving who had been “haunted” by a voice which emanated from within the walls. This occurred during the 1930s, and the case was even investigated by the famous ghost researcher Harry Price around the time of the disturbance. The strange twist to the story had been that the “voice” claimed it had belonged to a mongoose, which had travelled as a stowaway from India and had been trained to speak by its master. The supposed creature even claimed a name, calling itself “Gef.” 
Some commentators have offered that, rather than a ghost, the affair might have been imagined by young Voirrey Irving, the apparent target of the poltergeist, though perhaps inspired by Rudyard Kipling’s story Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, first published in 1894. Skeptic Joe Nickel has made the case that Voirrey had actually been attempting ventriloquism– perhaps poorly in some instances–as one account detailed by a news reporter indicates that Voirrey had been caught making the “mongoose” noises herself. 
To this, her father intervened and attempted to make the case for Voirrey’s innocence, steering the reporter’s attention away from the girl in what appeared to be obvious collusion by members of the Irving family in a hoax. Regardless, could the strange “Gef” affair have nonetheless been inspired by those earlier legends of “ghosts” spectrally morphing into animal forms, and like the ghost of the old sea captain in snipe’s garb, haunting the walls of his former residence? “Hamlet and his father’s ghost,” by Henry Fuseli 
One might argue, based even on any peripheral survey the likes of which we’ve undertaken here, that the “fear” of the ghostly experience is probably more likely the raw juxtaposition of the unordinary against the consensus reality of the everyday. But moving beyond our generally accepted attitudes about the supernatural, and our fear of it, also leads us to more basic questions, which include the most fundamental of them all: “what is a ghost?” Even simpler, perhaps we must ask with equal sincerity, “is there anything of real substance to the idea that ghosts exist?” 
In short, perhaps the cultural standards that “the ghost of legend” is identified against have colored people’s attitudes about them. In turn, popular portrayal of ghosts almost inevitably come to represent to a culture of “fear” having been built around them in most parts of the world. Hence, although ghosts remain a fun and “scary” motif (especially around Halloween), one might question whether it is really the ghost itself that frightens us so badly… or, could instead be our age-old prejudices against the unknown that are the true source of fear?",0

18830,Elon Musk to Completely Revolutionize the Energy Industry with New Tesla Solar Roof,"Home / Be The Change / Elon Musk to Completely Revolutionize the Energy Industry with New Tesla Solar Roof Elon Musk to Completely Revolutionize the Energy Industry with New Tesla Solar Roof Jay Syrmopoulos October 31, 2016 Leave a comment 
Los Angeles, CA – While the battle over the future of energy plays out in places like Standing Rock, where the Native Americans are fighting to protect their water sources from the environmental dangers associated with oil pipelines, Elon Musk was doing his part by unveiling a revolutionary new clean energy technology – the Tesla Solar Roof. 
While people typically perceive Tesla as an electric-car company, the actual goal of Elon Musk’s company has been to accelerate the large-scale adoption of sustainable energy. 
This past week, Musk made good on the company’s vision by unveiling the Tesla Solar Roof, made of textured glass tiles with integrated solar cells that are nearly indistinguishable from conventional tiling. In concert, he also announced an upgraded model of the company’s energy-storing Powerwall. 
The Powerwall 2 is a battery for homes and small businesses that stores the sun’s energy and delivers clean, reliable electricity, even when the sun isn’t shining. 
According to a report by Wired : 
A couple hundred invited guests, mostly Tesla owners, ooh-ed and ahh-ed as Musk revealed that a row of suburban American houses on Wisteria Lane—the old set of Desperate Housewives—were all, in fact, topped with solar roofs. Each house’s old roofing material had been stripped away, and replaced with one of four new styles of solar tile. From the street, it was virtually impossible to tell; the roofs retained a variety of traditional looks, from textured slate shingle to terra cotta tile. 
Musk said the secret to the tiles’ appearance is a special coating that becomes more or less see-through depending on your viewing angle. He described it as a series of micro louvers that work like a privacy screen on a laptop, and said the company is working with 3M on the tech. The effect is dramatic in person. From shallow angles, the tiles appear nontransparent. But as your viewing angle approaches 90 degrees, the underlying solar cell becomes more and more visible. The result is a tile that permits the passage of sunlight from overhead, but still looks opaque to anyone at ground level. 
During the presentation, Musk revealed the durability of the glass tile by showing drop tests that showed the tiles to be tougher than commonly used roofing materials, such as slate or clay. 
“It’s never going to wear out, it’s made of quartz, it has a quasi-infinite lifetime,” Musk said. “We need to make solar panels as appealing as electric cars have become,” added Musk. “It needs to be beautiful, affordable, and seamlessly integrated. If all of those things are true, why would you go any other direction?” 
The solar roof is designed to be used in concert with the Tesla Powerwall 2.0, which Musk also unveiled at his Los Angeles presentation. The new version of the Powerwall will cost $5,500 for 14kWh of storage and 7kWh peak power draw, which is enough to power a four-bedroom home for one day. No details on pricing, availability, or the installation process for the solar roof was announced. 
Musk envisions a day when people can walk into a Tesla store and buy an entire energy system, which includes a solar roof/panels, a Powerwall battery for energy storage and an electric car. 
The reality is that Musk is creating a system that could eventually replace the entire traditional electrical grid, and allow for true off-grid energy independence. The idea is that you can generate and store energy by day, which then lights up your house at night – without any pollution or environmental damage. 
“In order to make his vision move forward, Musk is using design with a big D,” Andy Ogden, Chair of the Industrial Design Department at ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California told Wired. “He’s thinking about an overall strategy, in how these things interact and support each other, so there’s some synergy.” 
Ogden believes that Musk’s plan has the potential to work. “If he can make it easier, and less expensive and more attractive for roofs to be solar, then that will drive the uptake of battery systems” 
This latest revolution in the energy industry comes as Musk’s merger with SolarCity (the largest provider of solar power systems in the country), which is run by Musk’s cousin and of which Musk is already the majority stockholder, will be voted on by shareholders on November 17. Musk’s recent announcement of the new Tesla solar tiles would seemingly be a perfect fit with the Solar City brand. 
Thanks to Elon Musk the future of clean energy has never looked brighter. 
Please share this amazing story about the coming energy revolution! Share",0
18831,"FAKE NEWS: CNN Claims GOP Trying to Remove ’$200,000 Tax’ on Firearm Suppressors - Breitbart","During a January 14 report on Republican efforts to reduce restrictions on firearm suppressors, CNN said one of the GOP’s goals is to eliminate the “$200, 000 tax” on the devices. [CNN intimated that the GOP wants to get rid of the “lengthy background check” associated with suppressors as well.  In fact, the tax is $200 dollars —  not $200, 000 —  and the background check is one of the only current requirements that the GOP plans to keep in place for suppressors. What they want to get rid of is the bureaucracy of the purchase, whereby   citizens are required to be photographed, fingerprinted, and then to register their suppressor with the government. And yes, the GOP also wants to get rid of the $200 tax. CNN referenced the tax correctly later in the segment, but the mention of a “$200, 000 tax” was how they launched it. Representatives Jeff Duncan (  ) and John Carter (  ) introduced legislation on January 9 that will accomplish all these things. Their bill is the Hearing Protection Act and it is focused on the hearing benefits shooters and outdoorsmen receive from suppressed firearms. CNN’s Victor Blackwell addressed the Hearing Protection Act and said opponents of suppressors see any hearing benefits claims as a “facade. ” He then showed movie clips from Casino Royale and No Country for Old Men and a narrator said, “A gun silencer, shooting enthusiasts call it a suppressor. It’s an assassin’s must have in movies. ” The narrator says that opponents of the Hearing Protection Act say the real goal is “about militarizing weapons, not about hearing,” and that suppressor ownership “will allow mass shooters to kill stealthily. ” In reporting this way, CNN shows the Democrats’ hand —  as far as opposition to suppressors is concerned. They plan to fight against them the same way they fight against   stocks, flash hiders, and collapsible stocks via “assault weapons” bans. And they will try to shame   lawmakers into inaction by suggesting that suppressors make it possible to attack innocents without detection. Americans who are paying attention will quickly realize that the people making these arguments need to quit forming their opinions on suppressors from Hollywood films.

18833,Who Is Sebastian Gorka? A Trump Adviser Comes Out of the Shadows - The New York Times,"Since President Trump appointed Sebastian Gorka last month as a deputy assistant, Mr. Gorka has been an increasingly visible defender of the administration. He has spoken out in favor of the targeted travel ban, which spurred mass protests and was then blocked by federal courts. He suggested in a recent interview with The Hill that the CNN anchor Jake Tapper was sexist for aggressively questioning the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. He has also insisted that media reports of turmoil in the White House bear “almost no resemblance to reality. ” Mr. Gorka came out swinging again on Thursday, after Mr. Trump’s contentious news conference in which he excoriated the media. Asked by Evan Davis of the BBC to assess Mr. Trump’s appearance, Mr. Gorka repeatedly declared the president’s performance “fabulous. ” “It’s only weird to journalists like yourself, who are biased,” he said. Who is he? Here’s what we know: Mr. Gorka is an American citizen who was born in Britain to Hungarian parents. He earned a Ph. D. in political science from Corvinus University of Budapest and has made his living as a national security expert with a focus on Islamist extremism. He wrote a   book, published last year, called “Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War. ” In his Breitbart articles, he has criticized foreign policy under the Obama administration and trumpeted the threat of the Islamic State group. Mr. Gorka, 46, is a former editor for the   media outlet Breitbart News and a friend of Stephen Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman who is now a powerful assistant to Mr. Trump. Until recently, Mr. Gorka was not well known to Washington policy makers. But his increasing visibility has brought headlines, some less welcome than others. He has appeared in a number of television and radio interviews as a representative of the Trump administration and a member of a White House team called the Strategic Initiatives Group. The Daily Beast called it a think tank within the White House that was set up by Mr. Bannon and the president’s    and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. The group’s formation raised red flags, said Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the director of strategy and statecraft at the Center for a New American Security. The National Security Council has traditionally played a decisive role in foreign policy decisions, she said. “Now we have the Strategic Initiatives Group and the National Security Council both working on issues of national security and strategy. So my question on Sebastian, ultimately, is: Who is he reporting to? Is he reporting to the National Security Council? Or is this a direct line to Bannon?” Mr. Gorka said he could not comment for this article without clearance from the White House. But after multiple calls and emails since Tuesday, neither he nor the White House has answered questions about his position or the role of the initiatives group. This month, Mr. Gorka told CNN that the group would bring private industry expertise to bear on a range of issues, including cybersecurity, veterans affairs and the modernization of government technological systems. “That is very different from what the National Security Council is doing every day under the sterling leadership of General Flynn,” he added, referring to Michael T. Flynn, then the national security adviser, who would resign 12 days later. Ms. Smith said she was not personally familiar with Mr. Gorka, though she had crossed paths with him during the early 2000s. “I don’t know what to believe about this guy, but given his experience at Breitbart and what I had heard years ago, it does appear to me that he takes some rather extreme views,” she said. Mr. Gorka dismissed such criticisms during a Wednesday interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News and brushed aside some of the more controversial reports buzzing around him. “I think we’re doing our job very well  —   don’t you, Sean?  —   if this is the best they can do,” he said. He referred to reports, like one from Fusion, that said he had exaggerated his role as an expert witness in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of helping to carry out the Boston bombing of 2013. Mr. Gorka told Mr. Hannity he still had invoices for the expert report he submitted for the case. “I may not have taken the stand, but I was an expert on the Boston bombing trial,” he said. As for the speculations about  Nazi sympathies, they go back to one of Mr. Trump’s inauguration balls, when Mr. Gorka  —   appearing in photos and a video interview with Mr. Hannity  —   wore a medal that could be interpreted as a nod to Miklos Horthy, a Hungarian leader who entered into a strained alliance with Nazi Germany in the early years of World War II. In a video posted by Breitbart on Tuesday, Mr. Gorka said the medal belonged to his father, who he said had suffered “under both the Nazis and the Communists” in Hungary, having lived through World War II and survived torture under the   government that later came to power. Mr. Gorka was charged with a misdemeanor after he took  a handgun into Reagan National Airport in Virginia last year. In a statement quoted by Breitbart, he said that on his way to the airport, he had “grabbed the wrong bag, one I had just used” at a gun range. He added that he was allowed to board his flight, and that the weapon was confiscated. The charge was dropped early this month. Though his appointment to the White House occurred only recently, Mr. Gorka has been in touch with Mr. Trump at least since 2015. He wrote last year that he had submitted some policy papers to the presidential candidate and had met with him twice to discuss national security issues. Federal election commission filings indicate that the Trump campaign paid $8, 000 to Mr. Gorka for policy consulting in 2015. It is difficult to predict the impact Mr. Gorka could have on foreign policy in the White House, Ms. Smith said, especially since he is apparently working under the shadowy aegis of Mr. Bannon. “We’ve got a situation where both outsiders and certain members of the government are confused about who is serving as the lead on foreign policy decisions,” she said. “And because we are not clear about Steve Bannon’s role, it raises a lot of concern because of his personal views, and also his lack of experience. ”",0
18834,Facebook to Change News Feed to Focus on Friends and Family - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   For years, Facebook has courted publishers of all sizes, asking them to depend more and more on the social media giant to expand their audiences. Now, Facebook has a new message for publishers: Tamp down your expectations. Facebook said on Wednesday that it planned to make a series of changes to its news feed algorithm so that it will more favorably promote content posted by the friends and family of users. The side effect of those changes, the company said, is that content posted by publishers will show up less prominently in news feeds, resulting in significantly less traffic to the hundreds of news media sites that have come to rely on Facebook. The move underscores the     that Facebook undertakes to maintain interest in its news feed, the company’s marquee feature that is seen by more than 1. 65 billion users every month. It is also a reminder that while Facebook is vastly important to the   growth of news media companies, from older outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post to upstarts like BuzzFeed, Vice and Vox Media, publishers rank lower on Facebook’s list of priorities. “There is now an expectation, in general, on the part of publishers that platforms will change, and that they won’t necessarily be informed how they will change,” said Emily Bell, director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “This completely highlights how ownership of the user is a central tension between news producers and platforms. ” The changes will affect all types of content posted by publishers, including links, videos, live videos and photos. Facebook said it expected a drop in reach and referral traffic for publishers whose audience comes primarily to content posted by the publisher’s official Facebook page. Facebook plans to start making the changes as soon as this week. It will have less of an impact, however, if most of a publisher’s traffic comes from individual users sharing and commenting on their stories and videos. As has long been the case, publisher content that your friends interact with will appear higher in the feed compared to posts shared directly by a publisher. Over the last few years, publishers struggling to attract readership and draw online advertising dollars have come to view Facebook and its users as a good way to gain new audiences and lucrative revenue streams. That has resulted in closer partnerships between Facebook and publishers experimenting with new media products tailored specifically for the social media site. Last year, for example, Facebook debuted Instant Articles, a product that allowed publishers to post articles directly to the social media site. Both Facebook and publishers described the move as a better, faster reading experience for users. Facebook is also paying a number of publishers, including The Times, to create broadcasts for Facebook Live, the company’s new   video product. Those features will also be affected by the algorithm change. Publishers have little choice but to deal with the changes that Facebook makes, given the dependent relationship news media companies have with the social network. Some 44 percent of adults in the United States regularly read news content on the site, according to a 2016 study by the Pew Research Center. And more than 40 percent of referral traffic to news sites comes from Facebook, according to data from Parse. ly, a digital publishing analytics company. Publishers value the referral traffic they get from Facebook, but they increasingly fear that readers will remain on the social media site for news content rather than visit the publishers’ own properties. There is also concern that some of Facebook’s products allow it to control not just the user experience but also own much of the revenue and user data. At a time when the relationship between publishers and Facebook is already tense, any change that   news content is likely to deepen concern. And Facebook’s move will be just another reminder that publishers do not have direct access to their online audiences on social platforms. Many publishers were hesitant to talk about what Facebook’s latest algorithm change might mean for them. Melissa Bell, vice president of growth at Vox Media, said Facebook’s decision was not surprising. “I think it’s a characteristic of Facebook that we’ve always understood,” she said. “Facebook, at the end of the day, is a place where people want to share things that matter to them, whether it’s a news story or their child walking. ” She said Vox Media still expected to continue experimenting with Facebook’s different tools. Other news media executives were waiting to see how the changes played out. “I think we’ll simply have to watch it,” said Kinsey Wilson, executive vice president for product and technology at The New York Times. He added that he did not expect the move would result in a big strategy shift for the Times. But Facebook’s news feed tweaks could be more damaging to smaller publishers that rely on the site to help raise their profile. Rob Toledo, editor and   of Exstreamist. com, a site about streaming services that he said gets roughly 500, 000 monthly page views, has already started looking to other platforms like Twitter because his site’s Facebook page is not adding to his audience in a significant way. Still, Mr. Toledo said, the algorithm change was frustrating and could halve the number of Facebook users his site reached. “It’s almost not worth it for small publishers,” he said. Facebook has a history of unilaterally changing how material from its partners is posted on its service. Zynga, a once powerful online game developer and former close partner of Facebook, saw a sharp downturn after Facebook made a set of changes on how its   content appeared on the social network. Zynga was also hurt by other shifts in computing, as users moved en masse from desktop computers to mobile devices. In 2011, in one of Facebook’s earliest experiences with media publishers, The Washington Post, among others, created   social reader tools, a way to more easily read and share stories on Facebook. But when the products began aggressively sending Facebook users updates on what their friends had read, Facebook made a series of changes that effectively killed the apps. Last year, the company announced that it would adjust the news feed in response to users who were “worried about missing important updates from the friends they care about”  —   a change that some publishers believed resulted in decreased readership. This time, in a set of “values” the company made public in a post on Wednesday, Facebook made clear that showcasing content posted by friends and family was its top priority. “The growth and competition in the publisher ecosystem is really, really strong,” Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for the news feed at Facebook, said in a recent interview with reporters. “We’re worried that a lot of people using Facebook are not able to connect to friends and family as well because of that. ”",0

18836,The 'Pit' in Mom's Stomach Turns to Anger When She Learns Why Her Son Isn't on the School Bus,"Share on Twitter 
Nearly every day, Kathleen Hotard walks down her driveway to meet her son as he gets off the bus. Though he's only five years old, Kenneth has been taking the bus home from school for almost two years. 
So when Hotard didn't see her son at the bus stop after school, she was afraid. When she learned why he wasn't there, that fear quickly turned to anger. Image Credit: Screenshot/WWL-TV 
As WWL-TV News reports, Hotard had gone to the bus stop on Monday and waited for her son to appear. When he didn't, the worried mother immediately thought about the terrible things that could have happened. She tells WWL-TV: 
“The driver opened the doors and my child was not on the bus. The driver informed me he was not there and that she didn't know where he was but that he had not gotten on the bus that day. You get this pit in your stomach because you don't know where your child is. You don't know if they're okay or if they're crying for you.” 
Learning why her son hadn't gotten on the bus didn't make things better. Upset that the other children were throwing spitballs that sometimes hit him, Kenneth had told his teacher he had a note from his mother giving him permission to walk home from school. 
Unfortunately, there was no note, but the school failed to confirm that fact with Hotard. She tells WWL-TV: 
“I was informed my child had lied and said he had a parental note to walk home. I confirmed I never wrote a note, and they confirmed they never saw a note. He said he had misplaced it.” 
After learning that a substitute teacher had taken Kenneth at his word with no follow-up, Hotard is now demanding action from the school. Though she says that she is angry with her son for lying, she also wonders why the school didn't check with her before allowing her son to walk home alone. 
As for Kenneth, a call to the police from a concerned citizen helped find him. He was found about a half mile from school, heading in the wrong direction down a busy road. He admitted that he got “kind of” lost trying to get home. 
The school superintendent has apologized and promised to investigate what went wrong. Hotard hopes that this will be followed by safeguards that will prevent the same thing from happening again. She tells WWL-TV: 
“I don’t want any other parent to ever have to feel what I felt. I don’t want any other child to be on a side of a road by themselves scared.” ",0
18837,"Guardians of a Vast Lake, and a Refuge for Humanity - The New York Times","Thousands of years ago, every lake was like Great Bear Lake. So pure you could lower a cup into the water and drink it. So beautiful that people composed love songs to it. So mysterious that many believed it was alive. Today, of the 10 largest lakes in the world, it is the last one that remains essentially primeval. Great Bear Lake straddles the Arctic Circle in the remote Northwest Territories of Canada. At just over 12, 000 square miles, the lake is the eighth largest in the world. It is bigger than Belgium and deeper than Lake Superior, and it is covered in ice and snow most of the year. The surrounding area is wilderness too  —   a sprawling land of untouched boreal forest and tundra, rivers and mountains. The only human settlement on its shores is the town of Deline, population 503. This isolated community is mostly Sahtuto’ine, meaning the Bear Lake People. They are as connected to the lake as the name implies, and for practical, cultural, historic and even prophetic reasons, they are determined to keep it pristine. Their efforts paid off in 2016. In March, the Great Bear Lake watershed was declared a Unesco Biosphere Reserve. Called the Tsá Tué Biosphere Reserve, it is the largest in North America, and the first in the world to be led by an indigenous community. Several months later, the Canadian government granted Deline   ensuring local control in areas like language and education. It is the first time that an aboriginal government in Canada will represent everyone in the community, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. Taken together, the Unesco and   announcements reinforce Deline’s ability to control what happens to Great Bear Lake. David Livingstone, now retired after decades of working on environmental issues for the Canadian government in the far north, helped Deline apply for Unesco designation. To the Sahtuto’ine, Great Bear Lake is “not just a body of water it’s fundamental to their culture,” he said. “The folks in Deline consider the lake to be a living thing. ” Great Bear Lake is important to Mr. Livingstone as well. “It is the last great lake of its size and quality on the planet,” he said. “It’s like the Mona Lisa  —   a world treasure. ” I had spent an hour or two in Deline back in 2014, as an American diplomat posted to Canada. It was July and the lake was   endless and flat to the horizon. During my   tour, it was the sole time I needed a translator, because many Deline elders speak only their own language, North Slavey. This past November, I returned to Deline to learn more about the community’s relationship with the lake, to witness the interplay of culture, language, wilderness and isolation that makes this area so distinct. It was late afternoon when the small plane dipped through a thick,   cloud layer and I saw boreal forest  —   part of a vast biome that stretches across northern North America and Eurasia  —   as far as the eye could see. The plane descended toward a slender strip covered in white, Deline’s single runway. It was a short drive from the airport to the hotel where I was staying, the   Grey Goose Lodge. For such a tiny community, Deline has more tourist infrastructure than I expected, including a small handicrafts store in the hotel and an ambition to welcome the growing number of tourists who travel to Canada’s north for a winter and wilderness experience. The evening I arrived, I met with Morris Neyelle, a member of the new governing council, the K’aowedo Ke, as well as Danny Gaudet, a local businessman who was Deline’s lead negotiator for  . Sworn in on Sept. 1, the new Deline Got’ine Government is responsible for delivering an array of local programs and services. Mr. Neyelle, 65, tall and   switches easily between English and North Slavey. He said   allowed the residents of Deline to preserve their way of life and to use these traditions to tackle modern problems. In the past, Mr. Gaudet added, people would look only to the national and provincial government for help. Now, Deline would decide what was best for its people. This included making their own decisions about economic development, such as elevating cultural tourism through the   Destination Deline program. “Just on tourism alone, we think we can probably put everyone to work in this town,” Mr. Gaudet said. Protecting the lake, however, is not just about   and increased tourism. For the Sahtuto’ine, Mr. Neyelle and Mr. Gaudet explained, the lake was a powerful force in the world: a place critical to the survival of the human species. This belief is based on the prophecies of a Sahtuto’ine elder named Eht’se Ayah, who died in 1940. Some believe Mr. Ayah’s prophecies are literal, others believe they are allegory. Mr. Ayah foretold that in the future, people from the south would come to Great Bear Lake because it would be one of the few places left with water to drink and fish to eat. He said so many boats would come that you could walk from one to another without entering the water. Simply put, Great Bear Lake would be a last refuge for humanity. Mr. Gaudet said the predictions were a big reason the new government pushed to have authority over everyone in the area, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. If “hundreds of thousands of people” come because of the prophecies and because “we have the freshest water in the world,” he said, then “you have to live under our rules. ” People in Deline told me that the weather had been changing in recent years, and that the summer season was getting longer. The lake is taking longer to freeze, and it’s melting earlier. Mr. Neyelle said climate change added a note of urgency to the prophecies they may come true sooner than expected. “Maybe we’re in that era now where everything is changing,” he said, and people from the south “are going to come. ” Late that evening, I walked along Deline’s main street and tried to imagine hundreds of thousands of people coming to the area. It was hard to do. The night sky was overcast, and the temperature had dipped to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius). Specks of ice from the   of Great Bear Lake filled the air. The flecks caused outdoor lights to reflect upward, creating optical illusions called light pillars that made it seem as if each light had become a searchlight aimed at the sky. I walked off the road and into a thicket of boreal forest. Hoarfrost from the lake clung to every surface of the trees and bushes. It covered even the undersides of spruce needles. I was hundreds of feet from the shoreline, yet Great Bear Lake was everywhere  —   in the air, on the ground and in the trees. At 8 the next morning, I awoke to darkness. From November until January, Deline gets less than five hours of sun each day, although it makes up for that between May and July, when it gets over 22 hours daily. Eventually, I saw a glimmer of predawn on the horizon, but it was not until 10:30 a. m. that the first rays of sun peeked out. I walked outside and headed toward the church for Sunday Mass. The round,   structure was in town, on the shore of Great Bear Lake. Chunks and shards of ice lay heaped on the shoreline, while farther out, the surface of the lake was   alternately skimmed white with snow or glistening with ice that froze overnight. A wedge of open water was visible just offshore. It looked turbulent, straining and frothing where it encountered the surface ice, as if it were determined not to freeze. Deline is predominantly Roman Catholic. Inside the church, I witnessed the community’s focus on preserving North Slavey. An elder was leading the congregation in the rosary. His call was in North Slavey, and the response was in a mix of Slavey and English. During the Mass, the Gospel and the homily were in English, followed by an    translation into North Slavey. The language is spoken everywhere  —   in church, on the streets and at home  —   as part of a concerted effort to keep it alive. The 2011 Canadian census counted only 225 people who identified the language as their mother tongue. But North Slavey is an official language of the Deline Got’ine Government and of the Northwest Territories. For the moment, North Slavey is not on the verge of extinction. It belongs to a family of North American indigenous languages that includes Apache and Navajo. Children in Deline’s primary school are taught the language this year, an elder began to teach North Slavey to high school students. Mr. Neyelle said the new government wanted to make acquiring and passing on the language a priority because it believed speaking North Slavey was crucial to preserving the culture. “Slavey is ours,” he said. “That’s where our powers lay. ” He said his descriptions in Slavey had more depth and color than those in English, even though he was fluent in both. Teenagers I spoke to echoed this thought. They said jokes were funnier in Slavey. After Mass, I walked over to Great Bear Lake, curious about the little skein of open water I had seen hours earlier. To my surprise, it had disappeared. Thinking I was turned around, I kept searching, but saw only the reflective surface of new ice and beyond that, a large field of older,   ice. Mr. Neyelle confirmed that the water had frozen over during the time I was in church. He was not surprised it had happened so quickly. Sometimes, he said, you could actually see ice creeping across open water. His description made it seem like a fox or wolf stalking its prey. We drove to Ski Hill, a gathering place for the community perched on top of a cleared rise near town. The sun had been up for three hours, but already it was getting dark. Several pickup trucks were parked close together, next to a recently built hut with a blazing fire pit in the middle. Children were sledding (despite the name of the hill, no one actually skis there) and some of the adults were   a new snowmobile with a powerful engine. Strips of lake trout along with moose meat and hot dogs cooked on top of barrel grills. The atmosphere was festive, perhaps because it seemed as if Great Bear Lake was finally freezing over. This meant access to the entire lake, better fishing and, eventually, an ice road that would temporarily connect Deline to the outside world. Or perhaps it was festive because these were friends gathering on a Sunday to enjoy the sunset, grilled food and conversation in North Slavey and in English. It reminded me that despite the groundbreaking nature of Deline’s   and Unesco status, it was still a small town. The type of town where the phone directory is a piece of paper taped to the wall. One elder I met there was Charlie Neyelle, 72, Morris Neyelle’s older brother and the elders’ representative on the K’aowedo Ke. Charlie Neyelle is a spiritual and mental health guide for the community, and pushed for   and preservation of Great Bear Lake. I asked him a question I had posed to many people during my time in Deline: What does Great Bear Lake mean to you? In response, Mr. Neyelle told me the   story, about a Sahtuto’ine ancestor who lived around Great Bear Lake, in an area called Caribou Point. One day the fisherman set out four hooks. When the fisherman returned to check on them, a lake trout had broken one of the lines and taken the hook. This bothered the fisherman, because in those days, hooks were extremely valuable. So that night, he transformed himself into a losch, also known as burbot, a freshwater version of cod. The fisherman swam down to the middle of the lake to look for the hook and heard a booming sound. There, at the bottom, he saw a gigantic beating heart. All the species of fish  —   trout, whitefish, pickerel, herring, suckers  —   faced the heart, surrounding and protecting it. He swam back to shore after seeing this, and the following morning when he went to check on his three hooks, he found three trout. One of them had the hook he had lost the day before dangling from its mouth. When the fisherman saw the   he realized Great Bear Lake was alive, Mr. Neyelle said. “The lake gives life to the universal: grass, insects, willow, everything. ” Some in Deline believe that the   at the bottom of the lake gives life to all of the lakes, oceans and rivers in the world. For the Sahtuto’ine, this belief underscores not only why Great Bear Lake must be protected, but also why its protection is of global importance. Toward the end of our conversation, Mr. Neyelle also mentioned Eht’se Ayah’s prophecy. “When there is no food or water all around the world, many will come to Great Bear Lake,” he said. “It will be one of the last places that has both. ” No matter how many times I heard this apocalyptic prediction, it was jarring to hear, especially when inserted into conversations about Great Bear Lake’s beauty and providence. The regular evocation of this prophecy reminded me of what happened on the other side of the lake in the 1940s, in Port Radium. The site of a large uranium ore mine, it was the most significant industrial development in Great Bear Lake’s history. During World War II, uranium from Port Radium was sent to the United States for the war effort, where it provided much of the material for the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although it stopped producing uranium in 1960 and is now abandoned, Port Radium was at its peak larger than Deline. Irene Kodakin was born near Port Radium in 1952, when the mine was still in operation. Now living in Deline, she describes Port Radium as a thriving community of aboriginal and nonaboriginal workers brought to work in the mines. Ms. Kodakin has happy memories of her childhood, in stark contrast to her experience in a residential school in Inuvik, a town more than 400 miles away. For much of the 20th century, the Canadian government forced many aboriginal children into these schools, with the goal of assimilating them into Canadian culture. “They would put their hand in our mouths and just press our bottom lips to our teeth until it bleeds” if you speak Slavey, she said. When she returned home, she could no longer speak North Slavey. Her older sister had to translate when Ms. Kodakin spoke to her own father. A generation of Sahtuto’ine lived and worked at Port Radium. Although it was known at the time that exposure to uranium was dangerous, this warning did not reach them. Long after the mine closed, Sahtuto’ine who had been in Port Radium began to die of various cancers. Ms. Kodakin’s father, George Kodakin, who had become a respected    chief in Deline, died of cancer at age 64. Ms. Kodakin’s older sister, aunts and uncles also died of it, and she believes the mine was the cause. Ms. Kodakin’s belief is shared by many in the community, including Gina Beyha, a coordinator for the Unesco Biosphere Reserve who was a nurse in Deline for 15 years. While researching links between cancer and Port Radium, Ms. Beyha and others discovered that uranium taken from the sacred Great Bear Lake was most likely used in the bombs that detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many people, especially the elders, were aghast, Ms. Beyha said. In 1998, Deline sent a delegation to Japan for the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony. It was a gesture of atonement as well as a way to start healing, particularly for the widows of men who had worked at Port Radium, who made traditional gifts that the delegation presented to the Japanese. During my time in Deline, the legacies of Port Radium and the residential schools were among many reasons people gave for protecting Great Bear Lake and for negotiating  . The others: to preserve Sahtuto’ine culture, to develop tourism, to honor elders and ancestors, and to prepare for the realization of Eht’se Ayah’s prophecies. After a week of talking with many Deline residents, these reasons all seemed tightly connected and at the core of the community’s identity. Those not living on Great Bear Lake, however, gave another reason that was perhaps the simplest of all. The lake, like the Mona Lisa, is magnificent. It draws the gaze as an ocean does. The slate blue ice and white snow merge seamlessly into the sky so that when you leave the shoreline, with brittle tiles of ice cracking underfoot, it feels like stepping into a cloud. And in the brief moments when the wind dies down, the silence is as deep and enormous as the lake itself. During my last days in the area, I went exploring with a Deline resident, Leeroy Andre, his wife, Diane, and his    daughter, Whitney. We would leave at sunrise and plunge into the boreal forest, following trails and old seismic lines. In the distance lay the frozen sheet of Great Bear Lake, and beyond, thick rolls of mist rose toward the sun, evidence of open water at the edge of the horizon. In North Slavey, this mist is called  . It is a land of ptarmigan and marten, musk ox, caribou, moose, wolf and bear. One day, after we had been out four hours, we came across a huge abandoned beaver lodge at least six feet high and twice as long. Around then, despite my wearing several layers, a parka and other gear, the cold started after me. It crept up from the ground onto my snowmobile. It cracked the rubber of my boots and shouldered inside. If I concentrated, I could feel ice crystals forming in my toes. When we started moving again, the cold took on the shape of a blanket and patiently tried to cover my shoulders and back. At sunset, the moon appeared like a slender comma above the trees, glowing in the   sky. We drove through marshmallow mounds: berry bushes covered in snow and hoarfrost for most of the year before they emerge in the summer and grow leaves and berries as fast as they can. Dark came quickly, and we sped across yet another small lake connected to Great Bear Lake. The snowmobile’s headlight illuminated a blizzard of snowflakes as shiny as diamonds, as if the land were showing what true wealth looked like. The northern lights appeared like a hallucination across the   sky. For hours they moved in slow motion above me, as the land seemed to recede and I faced the cosmos. If a recent scientific theory proves correct, somewhere out in space is the origin of the earth’s water, which fills Great Bear Lake and gives us life. This connected with something I was told when I first arrived in Deline. To the Sahtuto’ine, Great Bear Lake is not just a lake. They are part of it and it is part of them. No longer does this seem like a belief unique to their culture  —   it sounds like a universal truth. The water from Great Bear Lake flows in our veins, too.",0
18838,Israel tells France it will not join talks aimed at reviving peace process,"November 8, 2016 Israel tells France it will not join talks aimed at reviving peace process 
Israel has formally notified France that it will not participate in a peace conference later this year that Paris had hoped might rejuvenate moribund talks with Palestinians over a two-state solution. 
Rejecting the initiative, Israel cited the talks as a distraction from the goal of direct negotiations with the Palestinians – despite the fact there have been no such negotiations since the collapse of the US-mediated peace process in 2014. 
Israel had long indicated it had no intention of participating in the conference. The formal rejection was delivered at a meeting in Jerusalem with the French envoy Pierre Vimont. 
“[They] told the French envoy in a clear and unequivocal manner that Israel’s position to promote the peace process and reach an agreement will only come through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority,” said a statement from the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.",0
18839,"Torn Over Donald Trump and Cut Off by Culture Wars, Evangelicals Despair - The New York Times","GRIMES, Iowa  —   Betty and Dick Odgaard used to own the tiny church next door to their home. They had built it over 13 years into an art gallery, bistro, flower shop and framing service. They even rented out the chapel, with its bright stained glass windows, for social events. But three years ago, the Odgaards refused to rent the quaint site to two gay men for a wedding, saying it would violate their religious beliefs about marriage. The men filed a civil rights complaint, and the Odgaards settled, paying a penalty because it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. After the controversy, regular customers stopped coming. Friends and family members stopped speaking to them. The Odgaards were vilified as bigots and haters. But it was not long before the Odgaards found themselves cast as heroes as well. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, then a Republican candidate for president, visited the Odgaards’ business and videotaped a sympathetic interview with them. They joined a troupe of business owners upheld as Christian martyrs in the nation’s culture wars: the cake baker, the florist and the photographers who stood up for their religious beliefs and lost legal battles. They received a standing ovation at a Cruz rally and signed on as “religious liberty ambassadors” in his campaign. Now, a year later, the Odgaards and other conservative evangelicals interviewed in central Iowa say they feel as if they have been abandoned. Many say that they have no genuine champion in the presidential race and that the country has turned its back on them. Americans are leaving church,   marriage is the law of the land, and the country has moved on to debating transgender rights. While other Americans are anxious about the economy, jobs and terrorism, conservative Christians say they fear for the nation’s very soul. Some worry that the nation has strayed so far that God’s punishment is imminent. So, in a year when many voters see nothing but bad choices, many evangelicals feel deeply torn. Long part of a reliable Republican voting bloc, many are appalled to find Donald J. Trump their only alternative to Hillary Clinton. They say he has taken positions all over the map on   couples and abortion and does not have the character to be president. Others are still bewildered that Mr. Trump defeated not only Mr. Cruz  —   a pastor’s son who made “religious liberty” a signature issue  —   but also half a dozen other conservative Christian contenders they would have gladly supported. Nevertheless, polls show that the vast majority of evangelicals are now coalescing around Mr. Trump, largely out of fear that a President Clinton will appoint liberal Supreme Court justices. The change in America seemed to happen so quickly that it felt like whiplash, the Odgaards said. One day, they felt comfortably situated in the American majority, as Christians with shared beliefs in God, family and the Bible. They had never even imagined that two people of the same sex could marry. Overnight, it seemed, they discovered that even in   Iowa they were outnumbered, isolated and unpopular. Everyone they knew seemed to have a gay relative or friend. Mr. Odgaard’s daughter from his first marriage disavowed her father’s actions on Facebook, and his gay second cousin will not speak to him. Even their own Mennonite congregation put out a statement saying that while the denomination opposes gay marriage, “not every congregation” or Mennonite does. Mrs. Odgaard, 64, the daughter of a Mennonite minister, was devastated. “It all flipped, so fast,” said Mr. Odgaard, a patrician    who favors khakis and boat shoes. “Suddenly, we were in the minority. That was kind of a scary feeling. It makes you wonder where the Christians went. ” The beginning of the end of the Odgaards’ familiar life came Aug. 3, 2013, when Lee Stafford and Jared Ellars arrived at the Odgaards’ gallery, Görtz Haus. The couple were in a panic because the hotel they had booked for their wedding had gone bankrupt two months before the date, and they had already sent the invitations out. Mr. Odgaard spent about 45 minutes showing them the property and figuring out seating, flowers and how many guests needed   meals. It was only when Mr. Odgaard asked if it was a   wedding that his tone changed, they said. “I’ll remember these words for the rest of my life,” said Mr. Ellars, 35, a database administrator. “He looked at us and he said, ‘I can’t take your money, and we don’t do anything for free. ’” The couple, together for 13 years, say they never wanted the Odgaards to go out of business. They say they wanted them to stop discriminating against gay people and never put another gay couple through the rejection they experienced. The case was settled in arbitration, and the Odgaards had to pay $5, 000 to Mr. Stafford and Mr. Ellars, which they donated to an   program for gay students. Their wedding was held in a barn, officiated by a minister with the Disciples of Christ church that Mr. Stafford attends. To this day, Mr. Stafford, who is 43 and a business systems analyst, is troubled that the debate over religious liberty appears to be “so ” he said. “Their religious beliefs say they don’t approve of gay marriage, but my religious beliefs say that we can,” he said. “Why does their religion trump mine?” About a year ago, the Odgaards sold Görtz Haus to Harvest Bible Chapel, a church   that had been meeting in rented quarters. Its senior pastor, Ryan Jorgenson, 36, leads Sunday services in sneakers and jeans. He was trained and sent to Des Moines three years ago by a   network of conservative evangelical churches based in Elgin, Ill. that believe the Bible is God’s inerrant word. Mr. Jorgenson jumped at buying the Odgaards’ picturesque property on the busiest street in Grimes, a suburb of Des Moines. He converted the lower floor, where the flower shop once stood, into a children’s ministry, and installed soundproofing to insulate the children’s ruckus downstairs from the electric guitars and drums of the church’s worship band upstairs. He liked the symbolism of converting a landmark site that had represented a defeat for conservative Christians into an outpost for preaching “God’s word, without apology,” he said. The church now draws up to 300 on a weekend, and is already outgrowing the space. On a recent weekday, the secretary sat working on a stool in a hall closet. The staff was planning a conference to teach Christians how to evangelize to atheists, agnostics and Mormons. It is necessary to train believers to hold their own, the pastor said, because “mainstream biblical Christianity is less and less mainstream. ” On Sundays, he notices that half of his neighbors do not even go to church. He expects that more and more Christians will, like the Odgaards, suffer “persecution” for their beliefs. He regularly visits the Capitol in Des Moines to pray with and lobby legislators with the Family Leader, a conservative Iowa group. Mr. Jorgenson was among many Iowa pastors who publicly supported Mr. Cruz, though not from the pulpit, and he is not sure if he will vote for Mr. Trump in November, even though Mr. Cruz has now said he will vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Jorgenson would not even consider voting for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and said he did not know anyone in his church who would. But asked how much hope he had that Mr. Trump would protect the religious liberty of conservative Christians, Mr. Jorgenson held his two fingers a   apart. “My hope is not ultimately in the government,” he said. “I am not of this world. Jesus is going to come back. He’s going to bring the perfect government. Until then, we live in a world of sin. ” Melissa and Tom Berkheimer started attending Mr. Jorgenson’s church after hearing him interviewed on Christian radio. They had become frustrated that their minister “watered down” his sermons and never said a word about   marriage even after the Iowa Supreme Court legalized it in 2009. She is an accountant, he a chemist, and they met in a Christian chat room. They had something in common, aside from their faith: Mr. Berkheimer is   and Mrs. Berkheimer had lived in Japan, and her children from her first marriage are  . Over dinner at a steakhouse recently, the Berkheimers said they had nothing against gay people  —   a refrain the Odgaards also repeatedly sounded. “My brother was a homosexual,” Mrs. Berkheimer said. Her brother became a   Christian before he died of complications from AIDS many years ago, and she named her son after him, she said. She said she became seriously alarmed about the nation in the past year as Congress failed to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood after an   group released videos taken surreptitiously of the organization. The Berkheimers are in the “Never Trump” camp. “I’m worried for America if we don’t turn away from abortion,” said Mrs. Berkheimer, who is 48. “I think our country is going to be punished, with a nuclear weapon. I don’t think you can mock God forever. ” She quickly added that she was worried she would sound crazy saying such things. “The Truth” 99. 3 FM, a Christian station that features daily clips of Mr. Jorgenson’s sermons, broadcasts from a drab office building in a shopping center in Des Moines. In a studio on the sixth floor, the host of a daily afternoon talk show, J. Michael McKoy, known as Mac, sat at a broad table recently facing his three  . Leaning into the microphone, he asked his listeners, “Do you boycott businesses that go against your walk with Jesus?” Should Christians boycott Target for announcing that transgender people could use the restrooms of their choice, he asked, or Ikea for a winsome ad featuring gay families? Callers’ reactions were mixed. A woman said Target “only cares about political correctness. ” A man pointed out, “Even gay parents need furniture. ” Mr. McKoy steered the conversation to the Odgaards. He had quietly played a part in their story: When Mrs. Odgaard was in the depths of despair over a boycott of Görtz Haus, she often called Mr. McKoy, and he prayed with her. He introduced the Odgaards to Mr. Jorgenson, the young pastor looking for a permanent place for his church. On air, the radio hosts suggested that the Odgaards’ story showed that Americans were developing a double standard on the notion of tolerance. “I just wish that this tolerance went across the board for Christian businesses,” said one host, Frank Thomas Holzhauser, who on air calls himself Frank (the Verse) Thomas  —   a nod to his facility with Scripture. When the show ended, the hosts debated the election. Only Mr. Holzhauser said he was certain he would vote for Mr. Trump, but he admitted it had caused him to lose some friends who “can’t stomach Trump. ” The others said they had not decided how they would vote. None had supported Mr. Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Mr. McKoy and Chris Rohloff had supported Senator Marco Rubio, Mr. Holzhauser had favored Ben Carson, and Bob Monserrate had backed Mr. Cruz. Mr. Rohloff said he had thought that Mr. Trump was finished last year, the moment he said at a candidates’ forum in Iowa that he had never asked God for forgiveness. “Everyone in the room just went, ‘Are you kidding me?’ Even if you’ve never done it, you should at least know the right answer,” Mr. Rohloff said. “That’s a fundamental thing for Christians. ” But by late September, Mr. McKoy said in a telephone interview that he and his   had decided to vote Trump: “It’s the lesser of two evils. And I don’t know by how much. ” Some evangelicals in Iowa said Christians who praised Mr. Trump were giving Christianity a bad name. They blamed evangelicals in the South or “Nascar Christians” who go to church only when car races are not on. Some Republicans are working to lift evangelicals’ enthusiasm. Before Mr. Trump’s arrival at Senator Joni Ernst’s annual Roast and Ride in an arena at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines last month, Steve Scheffler was working a crowd of bikers and farmers sitting on hay bales near the stage. Mr. Scheffler, the president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, used a line borrowed from the conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly: “If you’re looking for a perfect candidate, you will not find Jesus Christ’s name on the ballot. ” He sounded exasperated with Christians who disparaged Mr. Trump. “I hope the good Lord shows more grace to me as a sinner than these people show to Donald Trump,” he said. On a recent Sunday, the Odgaards walked into the church and sat in the rear, where Mrs. Odgaard, an artist whose paintings once filled the space, used to design frames for customers. The seats  —   stackable banquet chairs that the Odgaards had bought for their wedding business  —   were nearly full of mostly young worshipers. They rested their coffee cups on the hardwood floor that the Odgaards had stripped of carpet and sanded when they bought the place, spending a week on their knees. One Sunday in church, the memories were so raw that Mrs. Odgaard said she began to cry and left for home. “It’s like losing a child,” Mr. Odgaard said. Mr. Jorgenson asked the congregation to stand, and the worship band struck up a catchy song called “I’m Going Free (Jailbreak),” played with a hoedown lilt. The lyrics were projected onto a screen placed under faded windows that Mrs. Odgaard had painted long ago to resemble stained glass. While the worshipers clapped and pumped fists in the air, the Odgaards gamely sang along: “Jesus is my liberty. I’m going free. ” Church members were invited to stay afterward for a quarterly meeting. Dylan Knudsen, a   made a major announcement. Harvest Bible Chapel had just been approved for a loan to buy the Odgaards’ tidy red brick house next door. The Odgaards were about to move to another town. But they planned to keep attending Harvest Bible Chapel, Mr. Knudsen said. There was brief applause. “Please thank them,” Mr. Knudsen said, “for their sacrificial role. ”",0

After spending the last few weeks throwing roadblocks in the path of   Donald Trump and his transition team, Obama nonetheless claimed in his remarks to the members of the military in attendance that “We’ve got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there’s continuity. ” Along with the AP, CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller also marked the ceremony with a Tweet to his followers.

18844,"After Backlash, DeVos Backpedals on Remarks on Historically Black Colleges - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Facing a fierce backlash after she called historically black colleges and universities “real pioneers” of school choice, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, spent Tuesday afternoon backtracking on the controversial statement and highlighting the institutions’ roots in racism and segregation. Ms. DeVos, in a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday and in remarks at a luncheon with presidents from some of the schools, repeatedly acknowledged that the schools were not created simply to give   students more choices but because black students across the country were not allowed into segregated white schools. The controversy is the latest gaffe for Ms. DeVos, who has had a rough start. Since Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote to confirm her, Ms. DeVos has fled from a small group of protesters who temporarily blocked her from entering a school, been criticized by a middle school’s administrators for saying their teachers were in “receive mode,” and suffered through the embarrassment of the Education Department misspelling the name of the civil rights icon W. E. B. Du Bois in an official tweet. The latest controversy began on Monday evening when Ms. DeVos released a statement shortly after meeting with several presidents of historically black colleges and universities. In it, Ms. DeVos began by praising the schools for making “tangible, structural reforms” that allowed students, often underserved, to reach their full potential. “They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,” she said in the statement. “They saw that the system wasn’t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. ” Historically black colleges and universities “are real pioneers when it comes to school choice,” the statement continued. “They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. ” On Twitter, hundreds of angry users accused her of ignoring the fact that many of the schools were founded because black students were not allowed to attend segregated white schools, not because education pioneers wanted to give   more options in higher education. Many accused her of using the nation’s history of segregation to advance a contemporary political agenda. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said the comment was “tone deaf. ” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, called the statement “totally nuts. ” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was biting. On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. DeVos seemed to backpedal on her statement at a luncheon for the school presidents at the Library of Congress. “Bucking that status quo, and providing an alternative option to students denied the right to attend a quality school is the legacy of HBCUs,” she said, according to prepared remarks released by her office. “But your history was born, not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism, and in the aftermath of the Civil War. ” She added that historically black colleges and universities “remain at the forefront of opening doors that had previously been closed to so many,” and that the schools “made higher education accessible to students who otherwise would have been denied the opportunity. ” Ms. DeVos later published several tweets repeating those sentiments in an effort to clear up her earlier comments. Still, Ms. DeVos in her speech referred to Mary McLeod Bethune, a famous civil rights activist and educator, as a leader who “is less well known than others in the HBCU legacy. ” Ms. DeVos said Ms. Bethune, who founded   University in Daytona, Fla. inspired her because she recognized that traditional school “systemically failed to provide   access to a quality education  —   or, sadly, more often to any education at all. ” Ms. DeVos, an aggressive backer of publicly funded vouchers that public school students could use for private school tuition, also used her speech before the presidents of several historically black colleges and universities to highlight school choice programs. She pointed out that her friend and a black woman attending the luncheon, Denisha Merriweather, had been raised by a single mother in poverty, failed the third grade twice, but is now scheduled to graduate in May with a master’s degree because a family member intervened in her life “with the assistance of a school choice program in Florida. ” Ms. DeVos also mentioned an executive order signed by President Trump on Tuesday afternoon dealing with historically black colleges and universities. A White House official said the order was designed to more closely coordinate the White House with efforts to increase funding to the schools and to encourage more private groups and organizations to work with the schools.",0

18846,Mattis to NATO: Pay More or U.S. Will ’Moderate Its Commitment’,"Defense Secretary James Mattis on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to NATO while meeting with member nations for the first time in Brussels: Pay more, or the U. S. will “moderate its commitment” to the organization. [“I owe it to you all to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States, and to state the fair demand from my country’s people in concrete terms,” he said during a   meeting, according to remarks provided to reporters traveling with him. “America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to the alliance, each of your capitals needs to show its support for our common defense. ”  During his presidential campaign, President Donald Trump had repeatedly called on NATO members to pay more for their   in Europe. Only five of 28 member nations had met a requirement to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense: the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, and Greece. NATO members France and Germany currently spend 1. 78 percent and 1. 19 percent respectively, according to the NATO figures. According to the Washington Post, Mattis recalled that when he was NATO’s supreme allied commander of transformation from November 2007 to September 2009,   Secretary Robert Gates warned NATO nations that America “would lose their patience for carrying a disproportionate burden” of the defense of allies. Mattis said that impatience is now a “governmental reality. ” “No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of Western values,” he added. “Americans cannot care more for your children’s security than you do. Disregard for military readiness demonstrates a lack of respect for ourselves, for the alliance and for the freedoms we inherited, which are now clearly threatened. ” The meeting comes ahead of a visit to NATO by Vice President Michael Pence on Monday. Before the   meeting, Mattis called NATO a “fundamental bedrock. ” “The alliance remains a fundamental bedrock for the United States and for all the   community,” he said. During his confirmation hearing, Mattis called the alliance “the most successful military alliance, probably in modern history, maybe ever. ” His first calls to foreign counterparts included NATO members, as well as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. But he also said in responses provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee in advance of the hearing, “member states must share the burden of common defense, and meet or exceed the commitment to reach the two percent defense spending goal that their leaders set at the NATO summit in 2014. ”",0
18847,The First Big Company to Say It’s Serving the Legal Marijuana Trade? Microsoft. - The New York Times,"As state after state has legalized marijuana in one way or another, big names in corporate America have stayed away entirely. Marijuana, after all, is still illegal, according to the federal government. But Microsoft is breaking the corporate taboo on pot this week by announcing a partnership to begin offering software that tracks marijuana plants from “seed to sale,” as the pot industry puts it. The software  —   a new product in Microsoft’s cloud computing business  —   is meant to help states that have legalized the medical or recreational use of marijuana keep tabs on sales and commerce, ensuring that they remain in the daylight of legality. But until now, even that boring part of the pot world was too controversial for mainstream companies. It is apparent now, though, that the legalization train is not slowing down: This fall, at least five states, including the biggest of them all  —   California  —   will vote on whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use. So far, only a handful of smaller banks are willing to offer accounts to companies that grow or sell marijuana, and Microsoft will not be touching that part of the business. But the company’s entry into the government compliance side of the business suggests the beginning of a legitimate infrastructure for an industry that has been growing fast and attracting lots of attention, both good and bad. “We do think there will be significant growth,” said Kimberly Nelson, the executive director of state and local government solutions at Microsoft. “As the industry is regulated, there will be more transactions, and we believe there will be more sophisticated requirements and tools down the road. ” Microsoft’s baby step into the business came through an announcement on Thursday that it was teaming up with a Los Angeles   Kind, that built the software the tech giant will begin marketing. Kind  —   one of many small companies trying to take the marijuana business mainstream  —   offers a range of products, including A. T. M.  kiosks that facilitate marijuana sales, working through some of the   banks that are comfortable with such customers. Microsoft will not be getting anywhere near these kiosks or the actual plants. Rather, it will be working with Kind’s “government solutions” division, offering software only to state and local governments that are trying to build compliance systems. But for the young and eager legalized weed industry, Microsoft’s willingness to attach its name to any part of the business is a big step forward. “Nobody has really come out of the closet, if you will,” said Matthew A. Karnes, the founder of Green Wave Advisors, which provides data and analysis of the marijuana business. “It’s very telling that a company of this caliber is taking the risk of coming out and engaging with a company that is focused on the cannabis business. ” David Dinenberg, the founder and chief executive of Kind, said it had taken a long time  —   and a lot of courting of   companies  —   to persuade the first one to get on board. “Every business that works in the cannabis space, we all clamor for legitimacy,” said Mr. Dinenberg, a former real estate developer in Philadelphia who moved to California to start Kind. “I would like to think that this is the first of many dominoes to fall. ” It’s hard to know if other corporate giants have provided their services in more quiet ways to cannabis purveyors. New York State, for instance, has said it is working with Oracle to track medicinal marijuana patients. But there appears to be little precedent for a big company advertising its work in the space. It is still possible  —   though considered unlikely  —   that the federal government could decide to crack down on the legalization movement in the states. The partnership with Kind is yet another bold step for Microsoft as its looks to replace the revenue from its fading desktop software business. On Monday, it announced that it was buying LinkedIn. Microsoft has put a lot of emphasis on its cloud business, Azure. The Kind software will be one of eight pieces of preferred software that Microsoft will offer to users of Azure Government  —   and the only one related to marijuana. The conflict between state and federal laws on marijuana has given a somewhat improvisational nature to the cannabis industry. Stores that sell pot have been particularly hobbled by the unwillingness of banks to deal with the money flowing through the industry. Many dispensaries have been forced to rely on cash for all transactions, or looked to   like Kind, with its kiosks that take payments inside dispensaries. Governments, too, have generally been relying on smaller   to help develop technology that can track marijuana plants and sales. A Florida software company, BioTrackTHC, is helping Washington State, New Mexico and Illinois monitor the marijuana trade inside their states. Kind has no state contracts. But it has already applied, with Microsoft, to provide its software to Puerto Rico, which legalized marijuana for medical purposes earlier this year.   states have now legalized marijuana in some form or another, with Pennsylvania and Ohio the most recent. The biggest business opportunity, though, will come from states that allow recreational use of the drug, as Colorado, Oregon and Washington already do. This fall, five states  —   including, most significantly, California  —   will vote on whether to join that club. Mr. Karnes, the analyst, said he expected legal marijuana sales to jump to $6. 5 billion this year, from $4. 8 billion last year. He says that number could climb to $25 billion by the year 2020 if California voters approve the recreational measure this year, as is widely expected. The opening up of the market in California is already leading to a scramble for the big money that is likely to follow, and Microsoft will now be well placed to get in on the action. Ms. Nelson of Microsoft said that initially her company would be marketing the Kind software at conferences for government employees, but it could eventually also be attending the cannabis events where Kind is already a regular presence. “This is an entirely new field for us,” she said. “We would have to figure out which conference might be the premier conference in this space. That’s not outside the realm of possibility. ”",0
18848,"Former Anthem-Protestor Brandon Marshall: Time for Kaepernick to Get Signed, Better Than Every Quarterback in Free Agency - Breitbart","Players that protest together stick together. [Current Denver Bronco and former college teammate of Colin Kaepernick, Brandon Marshall, made a show of Twitter support for Kaepernick on Thursday, saying it’s time for a team to sign his college buddy. Why? Because he’s better than everyone else who has already signed:  It’s time my Brother @Kaepernick7 gets signed. He’s better than every QB that got signed in Free agency,  —   Brandon Marshall (@BMarshh54) April 14, 2017,  To recap, Marshall played with Kaepernick at the University of Nevada, and took a knee in solidarity with the former 49er QB for the first three months of the 2016 season. Marshall then began losing endorsements, and soon after, ended his protest. Now, he joins several other NFL players in either questioning why Kaepernick doesn’t have a job, or calling for NFL teams to step up and sign him. To date, here’s the list of QBs who have signed deals with new teams this offseason: Mike Glennon, Geno Smith, Josh McCown, Brian Hoyer, Nick Foles, Chase Daniel, Aaron Murray and Matt Barkley. Is Colin Kaepernick a better quarterback than all of those players? Yes. But of course, it’s not that simple. The protest movement that the former 49er QB launched last year remains a real concern to NFL teams, as evidenced by the Bleacher Report story last month where an anonymous AFC general manager said, “[S]ome teams fear the backlash from fans after getting him. They think there might be protests or [President Donald] Trump will tweet about the team. ” Then there are reports that Kaepernick has asked for a contract that gives him between nine and ten million dollars a year, a contract the   quarterback probably would have scoffed at three years ago. But now, after three years of regression, aging, the fact that he’s never added elements to his game, and a ton of political baggage, he seems like way too much risk in exchange for far too little reward. So, in truth, Kaepernick has no one to blame but himself for why he’s still unemployed. However, true to their millennial nature, the players supporting Kaepernick absolve him of any personal responsibility for his actions, even given the fact that he has put himself in this position. Instead, they shift focus to the teams as if there’s some great mystery or conspiracy behind why he doesn’t have a job, suggesting that a player should have the right to offend cops, veterans, and millions of ordinary American citizens while demanding unrealistic amounts of money and allowing his skill level to deteriorate, and still have a guaranteed job. How shocking that the generation which gave us safety pins and safe spaces would behave this way. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
18849,Why Fighting Is Good For Men And Boys,"What would you do if you saw two boys of 6 years wrestling? Their shirts off, red and sweaty, they have a large group of peers around them, cheering, eyes wide and knuckles white. Would you stop them or give the young scraps some advice? Do you see a violent squabble or boys acting on natural impulses which will better equip them to defend their family and neighbours later in life? The answer you give is, in large part, dependent on your gender; so, the fact that this scenario would make an increasingly large number of men upset is a sign of a collapsing civilization. But, nil desperandum , Western civilization has the solution!
Mere horseplay!
As an early years professional, I saw education academics acknowledging the data—boys need ‘rough and tumble’ play for their mental and physical wellbeing! But they have no way of encouraging this in institutions where boys are immediately reprimanded for making finger-pistols at each other. Without saying it directly, they thought that the majority female teaching staff for younger age ranges were pushing our boys’ natural urge to fight like lion-cubs underground. What’s more, the boys were made to feel bad about themselves and their very nature.
Their solution? They suggested that more men be encouraged to teach younger children and engage in rough play with them. Until the late 1800’s, education was male dominated and boys spent a lot of time with male mentors. But, of course, there has been no effort to bring back that environment. Instead, a compromise between boys being boys and boys being fairy princesses was achieved—playing superheroes.
As though female teachers are going to tone down the disapproval as the boys shoot lasers and magic at each other. The treacherous political class present only feeble attempts to manage the symptoms of our societal masculinity problem; like sticking some tape over the burst pipe of our hemorrhaging testosterone as cultural marxism continues to swing the pick-axe of nth-wave feminism at it. So, it’s high time we took a few swings back.
But, first, we need to teach our lads how to fight. At the age of 6 or 7, Viking children were taught the martial art of Glima. This was not just father and son play-fighting; boys and occasionally girls already wrestle with friends and family up to that age. This was more systematic, a group activity.
The Greeks also taught their boys how to wrestle because our other ancestors could see the big picture. The Hoplites, for example, were individualistic free men of all ages who voluntarily came together to practise combat; this not only strengthened their communities but also allowed these farmers to fend off the Persian Empire. Yet, today, even isolated expressions of violence in computer games are questioned by SJW’s. Nevertheless, all the signs are there—our boys are yearning for the same activities practised by their forefathers.

At college, I started a unofficial fight club—men only. This based in large part on the book and movie of the same name, in which the narrator’s Nietzschean alter ego, Tyler Durden, describes the bubbling frustration inside the ever-increasing number of 30-somethings coming together for underground fights: ‘We’re a generation of men raised by women.’ Naturally, half the guys in my year were participating within a week. But, our young boys should be taught how to fight openly and without shame to avoid hidden expressions of violence and maybe even some mass-shootings by angry, loner teens. When they are young, it is the perfect time to teach them.
Young lads have no intention of seriously injurying their friends; it’s just good fun and produces healthier attitudes towards violence and confidence in self-defence and the defence of one’s community. Furthermore, a recent study has shown that fighting helps to strengthen peer relationships, meaning less bullying and segregation. It is interesting to compare the codes of honour of ancient Greek wrestling etc. with those we intuit as wrestling children.
No intentional hitting or kicking No gouging the eyes or biting No going for the balls! That’s precisely how I used to wrestle with my brothers and friends as a pup; it was just obvious. If someone took things ‘too far’, they were ostracised from the fun, at least until they calmed down and apologised. If someone got hurt, we stopped, checked whether they were just being a pussy or needed to get themselves mended; we kept calm and carried on.
‘We’re a generation of men raised by women.’ – Tyler Durden
The data are screaming that men haven’t changed, especially our need to practise fighting. We still have the same natural impulses but their suppression, no, their demonisation has made our men weak and submissive. So much so, many are self-deprecating betas who believe masculinity is toxic, full of white guilt and ashamed of Western civilization. We have everything to be proud of and need to encourage our boys’ fighting spirit so they grow some balls, some confidence in themselves and their kin. That’s the spirit which has kept our enemies, foreign and domestic at bay for thousands of years and will do the same to cultural Marxism, malevolent immigrants and anyone else who wants to have a go. If we want to turn scrapping boys into men first and gentlemen second, we need to organise some fights, not break them up.

18850,How We Can Win The Propaganda War,"It’s now been over a week since the most glorious victory ever recorded in the war against rapacious globalism and lunatic Cultural Marxism—the election of Donald Trump to the Presidency of the United States. Like many of you, I was outside with my fellow tribesmen ( the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in February ) until about 4 A.M. on Election Day. As you may expect, it was a joyous occasion that I’ll never forget.

Yet, as I remarked at the time, while this was a glorious victory, a decisive one that ended the campaign, the war would continue. I had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory, to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity we’ve been dealing with that’s accelerated in the past few years. However, as has quickly become apparent, the Cultural Marxists, SJW’s, and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful self-reflection anytime soon. Instead, they’re doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on November 8th.
Predictably, there have been “protests” and some riots. Incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported. Just as predictably, most of these “protests” are professionally organized , with George Soros likely pulling at least a few of the strings. Learning nothing, the regressive leftists taking to the streets, complete with their Year Zero pathology, think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people, because they’re on a mission to purify society. Anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated. 
I came across one of these “protests” a few days ago. It was generic and small, basic bitch shit, really. But recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords. Their intensity will dissipate with time. The safety-pin wearing, safe-space occupying, neon-haired freaks aren’t the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map. The bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days.
The recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over Donald Trump’s selection of Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist. The media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack, lambasting Bannon and Breitbart , which he ran, as having connections to the “alt-right,” which in turn, they say, is “associated with white nationalism.” To reinforce this pairing, the media ran with a couple of the most controversial Breitbart headlines.
If you recognize this tactic, it’s because the media A/B tested this against Roosh in February. They took the “ How to Stop Rape ” headline, said that it proved that Roosh was “pro-rape,” and then repeated endlessly.
This is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately. Scott Adams calls this word-thinking :
Rational People: Use data and reason to arrive at truth. (This group is mostly imaginary.)
Word-Thinkers: Use labels, word definitions, and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking. This group is 99% of the world.
Persuaders: Use simplicity, repetition, emotion, habit, aspirations, visual communication, and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves. This group is about 1% of the population and effectively control the word-thinkers of the world.
He further describes the phenomenon of word-thinking :
Word-thinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent, it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias. Nuance is lost. Context is lost. All that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained.
And this is what the media is doing. They did it with Roosh and are now doing their damndest to do it to Bannon, no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take President Trump down.
Because the term “alt-right” is relatively fresh, it’s vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous, dark terms possible, which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and “white nationalism” as possible. Remember, with word-thinking, nuance and context are lost.
And now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to, the self-anointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway. Now that the ambiguous and ominous-sounding “alt-right” has been attempted to be extensively defined, the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it (even if they really don’t). Given this pretext, the purges and censorship have begun, with numerous prominent Twitter accounts being suspended. Agree with these accounts or not (I often don’t), it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented. If you’re just a little bit politically unorthodox, you’re now at heightened risk of being slapped with the “alt-right” label (even if you’re on record as not identifying with it) and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have.
But banning individuals is only stage one. Stage two is the recent drive by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others to censor what they call “fake news.” The media has been on a blitz against these “fake news” articles, completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the Rolling Stone rape hoax to the ends of the world, “fact checks” Donald Trump’s comment that Hillary Clinton “acid washed” her private email server, selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in “Black Lives Matter” are entirely peaceful when they aren’t , and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the Democratic National Committee while writing about the campaign.
No, this is not the Onion.
While this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter, we must nevertheless still take it seriously. There have already been reports of shadow bans on Twitter with prominent figures such as Mike Cernovich and Scott Adams, and it’s far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as Return Of Kings , which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign. All the while, the media continues to nitpick, inflate, and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming Trump administration. Narrative warfare is far from over.
What Can We Do? Fortunately, we have a master persuader in Donald Trump to lead the way, but we at the grassroots, the grunts in the trenches, if you will, must continue our efforts.
First, we need to begin to de-hypnotize those that can be. Scott Adams had some thoughts on that , but here are the crucial points:
1. The basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms “alt-right” and “fake news” with all sorts of bad things.
2. Take away that pairing and you’ve made significant inroads.
I’ve A/B tested this sort of thing numerous times. Remember Mike Cernovich’s maxim that “conflict is attention and attention is influence.” Here are a few pointers.
1. Just like with women, frame control is paramount. The inevitable tactic that they’ll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their “side.” Fortunately, our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence. Refocus the frame on those. Make them own their own worst elements.
2. Appeal to vanity. Most people like to think of themselves as “rational.” Tell them that their word-thinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills. I did this with a girl after the first debate, explaining to her that because “the movie in her head pictured a ‘Mexican’ in a certain way,” her critical thinking skills turned off, and that what Trump said about “the Mexican judge” would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like “German.” It’s a long story, but her face was a picture. Tell them that they’re seeing things not based on reality, but on the movies playing in their heads, triggered by a certain word. Then watch the cognitive dissonance come.
On the broader level, here’s what we can do:
1. Continue on as usual. Continue to make a cultural impact. Get those websites, books, movies, and so on out there. Echoing what one member of the forum said: “politics is air cover, culture is the ground war.” They can try to censor “fake news” all they want, but we are too numerous to control if we don’t cooperate. It’s now time to redouble our efforts.
2. Don’t talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if they’re acting hostile to you. They’ll use any excuse to ban you. Law 36: Disdain Things You Cannot Have, Ignoring them is the Best Revenge.
3. Begin to build new networks. Gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly.
4. I will echo what many others have said on the forum. MAKE FUN OF THEM. They’re a prime target for humor. Believe me when I say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media.

This is a time of great opportunity, but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making. They’re doing everything they can to censor us and de-legitimize Trump. That’s the next focus of the campaign. We must de-legitimize them in turn.
But take heart that we’re now in the ascendant. Otherwise they wouldn’t be making these moves. I recall when I first visited Return Of Kings and the forum nearly four years ago, there was a general malaise in the atmosphere. Day after day, it seemed, we were suffering another defeat. No longer.
What a ride it’s been.

The “modern day marvel.” The machines are taking over The candidates in the current campaign – or any campaign – are all promising to “bring back good jobs” to “create good jobs.” When asked how they would do that, they are all a little light on details.About a year ago, Joe Biden was in Michigan to celebrate the opening of a new manufacturing plant that made “small metal clamps” used in all kinds of industries to hold wiring, hoses. Etc. in place. The largest market is the auto industry but they are sold to hundreds of other manufacturers. Depending on size, shape, and material, these parts sell for a few pennies or less. You have to make a lot of these parts to have any substantial billing numbers.This new plant is fully automated and runs 24/7/365 with just 14 people. Joe was quite happy saying “manufacturing is returning to America.”However, there is a backstory. That plant had been around for years. It had employed 600 people on two shifts. Then, the Chinese began to undercut the pricing, and the plant was no longer profitable and closed. Two years later, it reopened as a fully automated plant and regained the business because it could now manufacture cheaper than the Chinese.There are several stories inside the main story.The first story is about the initial plant closing. Anytime 600 people lose their jobs, you know that some employee ended up losing their home, that some cars were reprocessed, that some college kid had to quit school, etc. Retailers got hit. Utilities at the plant were no longer needed. Suppliers got hit too.More at [ My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance."" 09",0
18852,Exclusive: Siege of Islamabad,"By Brig Asif H. Raja on October 31, 2016 
Asif Haroon Raja 
Editor’s note: Both BG Raja and Imran Khan are VT followers and personal friends of the Senior Editor. This is a vital untold story. IK isn’t returning emails and it would be nice to hear his side. Our bureau chief in Islamabad, Raja Mujtaba, has been gone for two years now, a huge loss for VT. 

Imran Khan (IK) and his partner Sheikh Rashid pursuing politics of agitation since mid-2014 are once again on a rampage and are determined to lock down Islamabad (Isbd) and seize power by force. Their tantrums have shot up the political temperature to a boiling point and has intensified uncertainty and insecurity. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Pervez Khattak along with PTI workers is exultantly moving in a convoy from Peshawar to reach Bani Gala and participate in the already declared November 2, D-Day for the final showdown with the government (govt) at D-chowk. He has puerilely given an ethnic color to his march by playing the Pashtun card. He and his convey has been greeted by the Punjab Police with tear gas shells at Attock Bridge and Hazro interchange. The PML-Q, PAT and PSP have pledged support to IK but from a distance. The PPP is gearing up to add fuel to fire. Maulana Fazlur Rahman led JUI-F has stood up in support of the beleaguered PML-N and has warned PTI that its march to Isbd will be contested. ANP, NP, QWP and MQM (P) sympathies are also with the ruling party. 
The fires of agitation lit by the PTI has spread to other cities as well. Containerization has taken the life of one army officer and one child and is causing great inconvenience to the dwellers of twin cities. Media is playing its usual negative role to keep the pot sizzling. One-seater Sheikh Rashid is being glorified and so is the bellicosity of IK, while govt’s defensive acts are demeaned. Anchors and analysts are busy upping the ante and none seem to be interested in defusing the volatile situation. Hate campaign against NS and his family by the social media has touched new heights of slander. Political wrangling and filibustering is further damaging the image of Pakistan in the world and the cause of Kashmir. 
The master planners sitting in London, Washington, Tel Aviv and New Delhi are keeping their fingers crossed and are excitedly watching the gathering storm and hoping that the govt machinery in Isbd will be paralyzed and will force Nawaz Sharif (NS) to resign, or the Army to intervene and take over. India is incessantly throwing logs into the fire by heating up the LoC, while RAW-NDS are continuing with their covert operations in selected zones. Their major interest is to disrupt work on CPEC. 
Followers of IK are bubbling with enthusiasm and have gone hyper. Some were caught carrying weapons, ammunition, tear gas shells and bullet proof jackets. Most are carrying batons and young girls are equally aggressive. PTI’s armed Tiger Force has been tasked to battle with the Police/FC if stopped. They are already seeing their charismatic leader wearing the crown and with Aladdin lamp in his hand removing all the chronic ailments of Pakistan in a flash. They are convinced that once he seizes power, milk and honey will start flowing in the rivers of Pakistan and miseries of the downtrodden will be alleviated. One reason of their euphoria is the apparent estrangement of the Army leadership over the security leak scandal. Their joys knew no bounds when Information Minister Pervez Rashid was sacked. It was seen as the beginning of the demise of NS Empire. It has further energized the PTI workers and they seem fully charged up to execute the orders of their Captain to lock down the capital city on November 2. IK has taken it as a last ditch battle. For him it is a do or die battle. He is once again expectantly looking towards Gen Raheel Sharif to raise his finger. 
Undoubtedly the security leak has suddenly become a bigger challenge for the govt than the IK threat. A high powered committee comprising of members from ISI, MI and IB will carry out in-depth investigation to trace out the culprits responsible for feeding the story and that too in twisted form to the Dawn newspaper, who were behind it, what was the motive, apportion blame and prescribe punishment. It is to be seen where the trail ends. Absence of the author of the controversial story Cyril Almeida will make things difficult for the investigators. 
Unlike its defensive stance to the 2014 sit-in, which had lingered on for 126 days without any outcome, this time the govt is in a defiant mood and is flexing its muscles to go to any length to defeat the sinister plans of the invaders. Containers have been placed on all entry points of Isbd and along Peshawar-Isbd road and along Bani Gala road. Large contingents of the police and paramilitary troops have been deployed while the army has been alerted to be prepared to defend Isbd under Article 245. At the moment, the entire leadership of PTI have got stranded in IK residence at Bani Gala. NS has addressed two public meetings in KP and his tone and tenor gave no sign of nervousness. Rather he was quite confident to win next elections in 2018 on the strength of his achievements and dismal performance of PTI in KP and PPP in Sindh. The govt side is of the view that there is no reason for IK to agitate when the Supreme Court has accepted his petition and NS has been summoned on account of Panama scandal. They say, PTI youth wing violated the curfew imposed under Section 144 CrPC and also defied Isbd High Court restraining order not to create mayhem. 
Pervez Rashid was in bad books of IK and his colleagues due to his counter jibes whenever IK lambasted NS. But he was not the most sought target. His unceremonious exit or an in-house change doesn’t fulfil the ambition of IK to become the PM. He desires that NS should be booted out or he quits voluntarily irrespective of the fact that his name does not appear in the list of account holders in Off Shore Company. He has no idea what is in store for him if NS is forced to throw in his towel. In all likelihood, the ruckus in the aftermath of NS departure will drown IK’s ambitions. It cannot be denied that NS is still the most popular leader and he has many feathers in his cap. His 3 rd time premature boot out will make him a political martyr and will not be taken lightly by his fans in Punjab. Baluchistan govt and JUI-F would also not welcome his ouster particularly when he had presented him and his family for accountability and the matter was with the courts. 
The situation will become ripe for chaos which outside powers have all along been trying to foment. The Army may have to grudgingly step in to restore semblance of order. In the wake of tense geo-political environment, terrorism, acute polarization, feudal mindset, partisanship, parochialism and secular-Islamic divide, it will not be possible for the Army to restore order and hold elections within three months as prescribed in the constitution. Supposedly, if elections do take place within 3 months, PML-N will surely win the race and perhaps PTI may lose KP as well. 
Elections without reforms will otherwise be an exercise in futility. The Army will perforce have to stretch its rule to 3-5 years if not more to be able to take Operation Zarb-e-Azb, Rangers operation in Karachi, FC operation in Baluchistan and ongoing combing operation to their logical ends; to implement the National Action Plan in letter and spirit, and to complete the vital project of CPEC. Additionally it will have to carry out following reforms for a better morrow and for enabling environment for true democracy to flourish: 1. Electoral, political, police, bureaucracy, judicial, education, media reforms. 2. Breaking the nexus between crime, politics, terrorism and corruption. 3. Effective accountability system. 4. Cleansing the Aegean Stables. 
All this will be possible only when there is strict martial law and politicians of all hues are kept at bay. Will this arrangement be acceptable to IK? If he is prepared to wait for 5 years, why not hold on for 1 ½ years and contest the 2018 elections and win the coveted crown!! Moreover, what is the guarantee that the Army will be able to put everything right since it was not able to do so in the past? Things may become messier. Memory of our people is very short lived. Soon they will forget the ills of NS and his good deeds will be recalled with fondness and the Army will be put on the mat with a vengeance as had happened during the four military rules. True to their tradition, anti-Pakistan foreign powers will be behind the anti-Army campaign. Political destabilization suit the conspirators since it makes it easier for them to exert pressure and dictate terms. It is indeed most unfortunate that our politicians are fighting for power among each other, while the media and so-called educated lot are supporting their favorite political leaders and feel no qualm in passing lecherous and insulting remarks against their opponents. Preferably, all our guns should be collectively firing at our enemies who are bent upon breaking up Pakistan.

18853,Ted Cruz-John Kasich Alliance Against Donald Trump Quickly Weakens - The New York Times,"The temporary alliance between Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, formed to deny Donald J. Trump the Republican presidential nomination, was already fraying almost to the point of irrelevance on Monday, only hours after it was announced to great fanfare. With the pact, the two candidates agreed to cede forthcoming primary contests to each other. Mr. Kasich would, most crucially, stand down in Indiana’s primary on May 3 to give Mr. Cruz a better chance to defeat Mr. Trump there, while Mr. Cruz would leave Oregon and New Mexico to Mr. Kasich. It appeared to be a measure of last resort, but initially it seemed like a breakthrough. Mr. Cruz trumpeted what he called the “big news” in Indiana, a state that appears pivotal to stopping Mr. Trump from winning a majority of delegates. “John Kasich has decided to pull out of Indiana to give us a    contest with Donald Trump,” he said. But at his own campaign stop in Philadelphia on Monday, Mr. Kasich tamped down Mr. Cruz’s triumphalism. Voters in Indiana, Mr. Kasich said, “ought to vote for me,” even if he would not be campaigning publicly there. He added, “I don’t see this as any big deal. ” Under the best of circumstances, the arrangement between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich would seem to be a long shot  —   more of an expedient to stop Mr. Trump from taking a big step toward winning the nomination next week in Indiana than a permanent joining of forces. Far from forming any kind of unity ticket, Mr. Trump’s surviving challengers have both vowed to triumph in an open convention in Cleveland, and they remain irreconcilable on key matters of policy. Their agreement dealt only with three states, leaving an open question as to how directly they might compete with each other everywhere else. Even in Indiana, emerging as the most important state, the   pact appeared something less than decisive. While Mr. Kasich’s campaign canceled his public appearances in the state, the governor was still slated to visit Indianapolis on Tuesday for a   event at the Columbia Club. And he still had meetings scheduled with a series of Indiana Republicans, including Gov. Mike Pence, according to a leading Republican in the state. Mr. Cruz’s campaign privately advised supporters on Sunday not to endorse tactical voting, whereby his supporters might switch their allegiance to Mr. Kasich in states where the Ohio governor is running stronger against Mr. Trump. “We never tell voters who to vote for,” read the suggested Cruz talking point. “We’re simply letting folks know where we will be focusing our time and resources. ” Mr. Trump, who has taunted his opponents throughout the race for their Keystone Kops approach to undermining his campaign, seemed to relish the continuing strain between his remaining rivals. On Twitter, he mocked “Lyin’ Ted Cruz” and “1 for 38 Kasich,” referring to the latter’s dismal winning record in the Republican race, for being unable to beat him on their own. “So they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Shows weakness!” At a campaign rally in Rhode Island, Mr. Trump boasted that his opponents were united against him, and said he welcomed their “collusion. ” “Actually I was happy,” he said, “because it shows how weak they are. ” Allies of both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich did not exactly disagree with that assessment, and acknowledged that the prospect of imminent disaster in Indiana had been the impetus to reach their deal, such as it is. Still, aides to Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich seem acutely aware that they risk turning off voters who find the arrangement unseemly. Even before his rivals’ agreement, Mr. Trump had complained repeatedly that the nominating process was “rigged” against him. With Mr. Trump expected to win all five of the East Coast states that vote on Tuesday, the next opportunity to slow his campaign will come a week later in Indiana. Republicans believe he must be stopped there if they are to deny him the nomination. “Indiana is a   for Ted Cruz, and it’s a   for anybody who doesn’t think Donald Trump should be the nominee,” said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative group opposed to Mr. Trump and supportive of Mr. Cruz. The group is airing an ad in Indiana urging voters to vote for Mr. Cruz, not Mr. Kasich, to stop Mr. Trump, and officials said they intended to keep it on the air despite the agreement. On Monday, Trusted Leadership PAC, a group supporting Mr. Cruz, said it also planned to keep a previously announced attack ad against Mr. Kasich on the air in Indiana. The group added, though, that it had shelved advertising plans in New Mexico and Oregon. Charles R. Black Jr. an adviser to Mr. Kasich, said it would be helpful to his candidate  —   and “a big blow to Trump”  —   for Mr. Cruz to win Indiana. The point of announcing the deal, Mr. Black said, was to indicate to outside “super PACs” where the campaigns and candidates were marshaling their resources. Mr. Black played down the degree to which voters would cast their ballots strategically, switching allegiance between candidates to thwart Mr. Trump. “Either the guy gets to 1, 237 or he doesn’t,” he said. “Voters don’t focus on this tactical, inside baseball stuff. ” For months, rivals of the Republican   have claimed that he has succeeded only because the   vote has been spread among so many alternative candidates. That argument appeared to falter in New York last week, when Mr. Trump won 60 percent of the vote and captured nearly all of the state’s delegates. Now that each of them has been granted a cleaner shot against Mr. Trump  —   in different states, and at different moments over the next few weeks  —   Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich will have no easy excuse if Mr. Trump continues to prevail. While Mr. Cruz faces the more immediate test in Indiana, Mr. Kasich will have to make swift use of his free hand in Oregon. Though the state’s primary date is May 17, the election there is conducted by mail, and voters will begin to receive their ballots this week. Ron Saxton, a prominent Kasich supporter in Oregon, said the deal “puts more pressure” on Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz to perform strongly against Mr. Trump. But Mr. Saxton, a former Republican candidate for governor, said there was catching up to do in his state. “None of the three G. O. P. campaigns have any real Oregon visibility yet, just the national press,” Mr. Saxton wrote in an email. “Since Cruz’s name remains on the ballot, my guess is that he’ll get close to the same votes he’d get if he hadn’t ‘withdrawn.’ Is he going to actively encourage his supporters to vote for Kasich?” On Monday, both candidates swatted away questions about whether the deal was something of an underhanded ploy. Mr. Cruz said the agreement was aimed at empowering   voters against the   denying that the effort to stop Mr. Trump was subverting the will of the people. “This is entirely about the will of the people,” he said. “This is about winning the votes of the Hoosier State. ” Mr. Kasich, in Pennsylvania, grew quickly agitated at the suggestion that his deal with Mr. Cruz reflected desperation. “Me? No, I’m not desperate  —   are you?” he asked a reporter. “Are you desperate?”",0

18855,Clinton Foundation CEO Goes Missing After Trump’s Top Money Guru Found Dead,"
Another astonishing Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs (GUVM) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) reported this morning that former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman, who last week applied for “urgent and immediate” political asylum at the Russian Embassy in New York City, failed to keep his scheduled interview yesterday—with speculation being made by Federation intelligence analysts that his having gone missing is “directly related” to the mysterious and sudden death of Donald Trump’s top money guru E. Lee Hennessee. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Mr. Braverman was scheduled to return to the Russian Embassy in New York City yesterday for an in-depth interview related to the request he made last week for “urgent and immediate” political asylum in Russia—and as we had previously reported, sent shockwaves through the Kremlin as some Federation intelligence analysts believed his request was for the purpose of “protection by publicity” due to his fears that the Clinton Crime Family wanted him killed.
Fears that he was being targeted for death by the Clinton Crime Family, specifically Hillary Clinton, this report continues, was due to Mr. Braverman’s past association with the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization that he headed as CEO after being installed there by Chelsea Clinton who discovered for herself the massive corruption of this supposed to be charity.
With the American press widely reporting (though skeptically) Mr. Braverman’s asylum request (“a simple “here I am” could quiet the waters – but there has been none”), however, this report notes, Federation intelligence analysts contributing to this report note that not only did he fail to keep yesterday’s interview date at the Russian Embassy in New York City, he has yet to publically deny his actions, and since 12 October has failed to even update his Twitter page account.
To why Mr. Braverman has gone silent and missing, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is attributing to yet another Clinton Crime Family related mysterious death—this one being Donald Trump’s longtime billionaire money guru E. Lee Hennessee, age 64, found dead this past week in her Trump Plaza home, located in West Palm Beach, Florida—with one media account suggesting it was related to a domestic harm case involving her husband and longtime business partner, and another saying she died of a stroke—but with no autopsy having yet been performed.
Donald Trump’s money guru E. Lee Hennessee, this report explains, was one of the most powerful women financiers on Wall Street whose company, Hennessee Group LLC, achieved a staggering 2,132% increase of profits between 1987-2015 and was co-run by her husband Charles Gradante.
As to why Hillary Clinton feared and hated E. Lee Hennessee, this report says, is due to her having created for Donald Trump an “extraordinary/unique” investment portfolio that, in essence, has allowed him to run his revolutionary presidential campaign entirely debt free costing him virtually nothing as for every dollar he spent, he was able to gain back two more—thus making it the first US presidential election run in history to turn a profit.
With what is infamously called the Clinton Body Count rapidly increasing through this US presidential election cycle, this report concludes, there now appears to be a breaking of support of Hillary Clinton among America’s elites, with even the Chicago Tribune this past week saying Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside as the American political system is breaking down and their warning that it’s been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they’re properly frightened—and is most assuredly going to get worse with the shocking revelation that the FBI has now discovered a staggering 650,000 Hillary Clinton secret emails on the computer of her top aide Huma Abedin’s disgraced pedophile husband Anthony Weiner.

18856,Eamon Dunphy & George Hook Enter 12th Hour Of ‘Who’s More Controversial’ Debate,"0 Add Comment 
A CHANCE encounter between two of Ireland’s leading provocateurs and opinion-havers, Eamon Dunphy and George Hook, has resulted in a stand off which now enters its 12th hour. 
Bumping into each other as they both sought to post a letter, presumably of complaint, at their local postbox, Dunphy and Hook found themselves politely disagreeing on who is the more controversial figure. 
This polite exchange remained reasonable for just 2.46 seconds before both men began trading exaggerated claims and quips, in an effort to both convey they were the proud owners of the Nation’s most contrary opinions. 
“No. No. No! You merely despise children’s joyful faces when they eat ice-cream. I hate the little shits with every essence of my being. They’re clumsy, careless, they’re a cod, a fraud,” Dunphy barked at Hook after the Newstalk radio host and rugby pundit suggested children were just the worst. 
In a desperate bid to one up his contrary counterpart, Hook’s eyes frantically searched the street around him for something to give out about. 
“Cars, too noisy. Roads! Some have potholes. The sky, too bloody high for my liking. Dunphy, I bloody hate that crevasse-faced tosser,” Hook bellowed as he commented on one thing after another, trying to cement his reputation as a controversial champion of Ireland. 
The pair were then forcibly removed from the street by passers by who couldn’t take much more of their droning, placing them in a room together, which has been rented especially for the broadcasters for the next month. 
With the stalemate continuing into its 12th hour both men are aware they could secure victory by mentioning how Hitler made the trains run on time, but neither seem ready to share the opinion just yet.",0
18857,Brock Osweiler and Texans Knock the Battered Raiders Out of the Playoffs - The New York Times,"HOUSTON  —   Follow our live N. F. L. playoffs coverage here. Brock Osweiler redeemed himself after last month’s benching. Jadeveon Clowney established himself as a postseason force. And the Houston Texans got their first playoff victory since the 2012 season, beating the Oakland Raiders,   on Saturday. Osweiler threw for a touchdown and ran for another to lead the Texans to the win, in the   round. Clowney, erasing doubts that he deserved to be the top pick in the 2014 draft, got his first career interception, on the Raiders’ second drive. Osweiler, who got his job back last week after Tom Savage sustained a concussion, finished with only 168 passing yards but played his best game of the season. “It just goes back to having confidence in my teammates,” said Osweiler, who had never played in a playoff game, having been benched by the Denver Broncos last postseason in favor of Peyton Manning. “Believing in what you see, and just rip it. Cut it loose, and don’t have any hesitation. ” Houston ( ) and its   defense, led by Clowney and Whitney Mercilus, advanced to face either the Kansas City Chiefs or the New England Patriots in the divisional round. Clowney was roundly criticized in his first two   seasons before his star turn this season as he helped make up for the loss of J. J. Watt, who was placed on injured reserve in September. “Things didn’t go well earlier in my career, but I’m on the right track now,” Clowney said. The Raiders were making their first trip to the playoffs since the 2002 season, when they went to the Super Bowl, but it ended with a thud behind the struggles of their   quarterback, the rookie Connor Cook. He threw for 161 yards, with one touchdown and three interceptions. “It was his first start, on the road, in a playoff game, against the No.   defense,” Raiders Coach Jack Del Rio said. “It was a tough draw for him. We had hopes that we would be able to do enough around him so he wouldn’t have to do as much. ” Cook became the first quarterback in N. F. L. history to make his first start in a playoff game. The usual starter, Derek Carr, a contender for the Most Valuable Player Award, broke his leg two weeks ago, and Matt McGloin injured his shoulder last weekend. The Raiders were also missing their star left tackle, Donald Penn, whose streak of 160 straight starts ended because of a knee injury. The Raiders ( ) got touchdowns from Latavius Murray and Andre Holmes, but cornerback David Amerson said things would have been different if the team had fewer injuries. “I’ve got all the faith in Connor or Matt  —   any backups we’ve got,” he said. “But they know, at full strength, ain’t nobody in the league touching us, man. We’re going to take this loss on the chin, and we’re going to come back, for sure. ” Houston led by 13 at halftime after touchdowns by DeAndre Hopkins and Lamar Miller, who scored a play after Clowney’s interception. Houston increased its lead to   on a   run by Osweiler early in the fourth quarter.",0
18858,Venezuela: Maduro Claims Opposition Is ’Murdering Their Own Protesters’ - Breitbart,"Venezuela’s socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro claimed on national television Saturday that the nation’s   opposition was “murdering its own protesters,” listing individuals killed by Venezuelan soldiers and Chavista gangs and blaming the leadership of the opposition for staging the deaths to garner support for their cause. [Maduro did not present any evidence to justify his claim.  “These protests today are only in one percent of the nation,” Maduro claimed on state television. “They are more violent than ever, you have all seen cases where they have murdered their own protesters. ” He listed three cases of alleged staged murders, two shot to death and a third allegedly electrocuted. “If it weren’t for Julio Borges and the MUD none of these tragedies would have happened,” he alleged.  Borges is the president of the National Assembly, the federal legislative body, and a party leader in the coalition known as the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD). He has personally been the victim of state violence, beaten by a Chavista gang (colectivo) near the entrance of the National Assembly building in 2016. The gang succeeded in breaking his nose. Maduro also blamed Borges personally in a separate video segment for allegedly sending a gang to kidnap a bus driver. Maduro did not explain who kidnapped the driver or why, but by Monday, Venezuelan state television was showcasing a photo opportunity with Maduro and the driver, identified as Leonardo Leconte, on its online front page. At least 39 people have been killed in this most recent wave of   protests, which began in March following an attempt by the Supreme Court to nullify the   National Assembly and establish itself as the chief lawmaking body. The Venezuelan newspaper El Universal lists among them two of the most recent cases that align with the descriptions Maduro used in his remarks: Miguel Fernando Castillo Bracho, 27, and Anderson Dugarte, 38, who were both shot to death. The odds of opposition members being responsible for these shootings are barely existent, however, because of Venezuela’s strict   laws. The opposition is almost completely unarmed, as the private ownership of firearms is banned. Only criminal gangs and colectivos, some of whom operate as official paramilitaries, have the firearms used in these circumstances. In 2014, Maduro opened “disarmament centers” to pressure the few remaining civilians possessing weapons to return them. Three years later, Maduro promised a firearm to every Chavista who swore to use them against the opposition, setting a goal of distributing one million firearms to “militiamen” working for the government. Many other protester deaths cannot be explained as deeds of the opposition. Among the most notable are the protesters the military has killed on Maduro’s orders. In one particularly gruesome incident caught on video, soldiers ran unarmed protesters over using large armored vehicles, killing at least three. Others among the 39 died without even meaning to protest, among them    Ricarda González, who died asphyxiated by tear gas in her home. Only the military has access to tear gas and has used it liberally against protesters. Maduro’s claim that the opposition is killing their own people recalls propaganda tactics used by its allies in the Middle East. The government of Iran, a longtime Chavista ally, has been particularly bold in denying violence that investigators have traced back to them. In 2015, when Uruguayan officials accused the Iranian government of using employees at its embassy to plant explosives near the Israeli embassy in Montevideo, Iranian officials accused Israel of bombing its own embassy to “create Iranophobia and tarnish the Islamic Republic’s international image. ” “Tehran has said in the past that Tel Aviv has ordered attacks against its own embassies in India and Georgia in order to damage Iran’s image in the host countries,” the Iranian government said at the time. Similarly, another ally of Tehran’s, Syria’s Bashar   has accused Syrian rebels of attacking its own to frame his government for assorted human rights abuses. Following a Syrian government chemical weapons attack on civilians in April, Assad said the United States and Syrian rebels “fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack [a U. S. airstrike against the Syrian air force]. ” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",0

In the Haven, as this ship within a ship is called, about 275 elite guests enjoy not only a concierge and   butler service, but also a private pool, sun deck and restaurant, creating an oasis free from the crowds elsewhere on the Norwegian Escape. If Haven passengers venture out of their aerie to see a show, a flash of their gold key card gets them the best seats in the house. When the ship returns to port, they disembark before everyone else. “It was always the intention to make the Haven somewhat obscure so it wasn’t in the face of the masses,” said Kevin Sheehan, Norwegian’s former chief executive, who helped design the Escape with the hope of attracting a richer clientele. “That segment of the population wants to be surrounded by people with similar characteristics. ” With disparities in wealth greater than at any time since the Gilded Age, the gap is widening between the highly affluent  —   who find themselves behind the velvet ropes of today’s economy  —   and everyone else. It represents a degree of economic and social stratification unseen in America since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, J. P. Morgan and the rigidly separated classes on the Titanic a century ago. What is different today, though, is that companies have become much more adept at identifying their top customers and knowing which psychological buttons to push. The goal is to create extravagance and exclusivity for the select few, even if it stirs up resentment elsewhere. In fact, research has shown, a little envy can be good for the bottom line. When   travelers switch planes in Atlanta, New York and other cities, Delta ferries them between terminals in a Porsche, what the airline calls a “   service. ” Last month, Walt Disney World began offering   access to visitors who want to avoid the crowds. In other words, you basically get the Magic Kingdom to yourself. When Royal Caribbean ships call at Labadee, the cruise line’s private resort in Haiti, elite guests get their own special beach club away from fellow travelers  —   an enclave within an enclave. “We are living much more cloistered lives in terms of class,” said Thomas Sander, who directs a project on civic engagement at the Kennedy School at Harvard. “We are doing a much worse job of living out the egalitarian dream that has been our hallmark. ” Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, estimates that the top 1 percent of American households now controls 42 percent of the nation’s wealth, up from less than 30 percent two decades ago. The top 0. 1 percent accounts for 22 percent, nearly double the 1995 proportion. But even as income inequality and the wealth gap stoke the discontent that has emerged as a powerful force in this year’s presidential election, for American business it represents something else entirely. From cruise ship operators and casinos to amusement parks and airlines, the rise of the 1 percent spells opportunity and profit. Today, ever greater resources are being invested in winning market share at the very top of the pyramid, sometimes at the cost of diminished service for the rest of the public. While   incomes are stagnating, the period since the end of the Great Recession has been a boom time for the very rich and the businesses that cater to them. From 2010 to 2014, the number of American households with at least $1 million in financial assets jumped by nearly   to just under seven million, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group. For the $1   cohort, estimated wealth grew by 7. 2 percent annually from 2010 to 2014, eight times the pace of gains for families with less than $1 million. “You go where the money is,” said Steven Fazzari, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis. “This is where companies are innovating and where there is demand. ” In many ways, the rise of the velvet rope reverses the great democratization of travel and leisure, and other elements of American life, in the   War II era. As the Jet Set gave way to budget airlines, in places like airports and theme parks even the wealthiest often rubbed shoulders with hoi polloi. These days, whether the provider is a private company or a public agency, special treatment for the very rich isn’t personal, it’s business. Late last year, public officials in Los Angeles agreed to lease a separate facility at LAX to a private firm that would serve celebrities or anyone else willing to pay $1, 800 to skip the traffic jams and lines at the main terminals. Of course, it could be more extreme, and in the past it was. The Titanic, in the early 20th century, separated the different classes of travelers with metal gates. In the 19th century, French railways refrained from putting roofs on   wagons so that passengers who could afford more expensive   seats would not hesitate to spend a few extra francs. What is new is just how far big American companies are now willing to go to pamper the biggest spenders. For example, as   guests boarded Norwegian’s Breakaway ship in New York recently, cramming into a handful of elevators, there was ample room in one bank. But it was   to anyone but Haven guests going to the top decks. Not far away, in the ship’s theater, red velvet ropes cordoned off a section up front for Haven passengers. At SeaWorld, a family of four can jump to the front of the line and score the best seats for rides and shows for an extra $80, in addition to the basic $320 admission. For people in the market for something more exclusive, there is Discovery Cove, next door to SeaWorld’s traditional park in Orlando. Forget merely swimming with the dolphins. Today, parents can relax at a cabana and beach of their own, while their budding marine biologists spend the day with a trainer, feed the park’s birds, otters, nurse sharks and other creatures and, of course, frolic with the dolphins as well. There are no lines to cut here: Daily attendance is capped at 1, 300. A day at Discovery Cove can easily cost $1, 000 for a family of four. Next year, Crystal Cruises will begin an airborne version of one of its luxury ships: a customized Boeing 777 that ferries passengers on   or   trips around the world. In theory, according to Steve Tadelis, a professor of economics at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley, “when an industry is able to create a richer line of products for people looking to spend their money, that makes everybody happier. But getting it right in reality is very, very hard. ” As companies separate their clientele, a debate has developed over just how obvious the distinctions should be. Some experts, like David Clarke, who works with leisure industry giants as a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers, say that it is best to be open about what amounts to a   caste system. “It’s about transparency,” he said. “What customers hate is when you’re trying to hide stuff and are not being honest with them. ” Many companies, though, have discovered that offering ordinary customers just a whiff of the rarefied air can actually enhance the bottom line, even if it stirs a certain amount of envy and resentment. As coach passengers pile into giant 747s and A380s, for example, “a glimpse of a shower or private suite creates a marker in people’s minds,” said Alex Dichter, a director at McKinsey who works with major airlines. “A lot of brands use products like these as an aspirational tool, and class segregation can create something to which people can aspire. ” While choices for the rich are expanding, poorer Americans are benefiting less from product innovation, according to new research by Xavier Jaravel, a graduate student in economics at Harvard. Whether they are selling fancy cookware, natural cheeses or single malt Scotch, purveyors of goods aimed at the wealthy are competing more and offering new products. Downscale items like canned meat or tobacco aren’t drawing as many new entrants into the market. There is also increasing demand from the most affluent shoppers. Spending by the top 5 percent of earners rose nearly 35 percent from 2003 to 2012 after adjusting for inflation, according to a study by Mr. Fazzari and Barry Z. Cynamon of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. For everyone else, spending grew less than 10 percent. And with the rise of the Internet and big data, companies can pinpoint and favor these wealthiest customers in ways unimaginable even a decade ago. “At the high end, we can get into real psychographics and know who spends more time at the concierge or goes skiing in February,” said Bjorn Hanson, who teaches courses on tourism and hospitality management at New York University. For companies trying to entice moneyed customers, that means identifying and anticipating what they want. “The premium customer doesn’t want to be asked questions,” said Mr. Clarke of PricewaterhouseCoopers. “They don’t want friction. They want things to happen through osmosis. ” But for people at the lower end of the market, as well as in the middle, plenty of friction remains. The   is that the amount of hassle is precisely calibrated to just how much you are willing to pay. “At the low end, people’s expectations have fundamentally changed,” Mr. Clarke said. “Because it’s a fraction of the cost, people say, ‘I’m willing to take some discomfort because my wallet is staying full. ’” Executives describe the virtues of elite segmentation with a directness that might well serve as fodder for supporters of Occupy Wall Street or Senator Bernie Sanders. At its debut in 2006, the Haven was swamped by tourists from regular quarters who paid $200 to upgrade to one of its 40 or so rooms, Mr. Sheehan recalled. So he ordered an immediate halt to the upgrades, which undercut profit margins and undermined the Haven’s main selling point, exclusivity. “We needed to fill the Haven by getting the right people on the ship,” said Mr. Sheehan, who stepped down as chief executive last year. “When the masses overwhelmed the group in the Haven, they didn’t have the experience they were looking for. ” Mr. Sheehan’s focus on wealthier travelers proved prescient. Norwegian’s stock has surged. And as the company designed new vessels in recent years, the Haven became more defined  —   with its own pool, lounge, bar and restaurant  —   and more isolated from the rest of the ship. With the launch of the   Epic in 2010, “a guest could enter the key card for access, and never leave,” said Andy Stuart, Norwegian’s president. And by last year, when the even newer Escape sailed on its maiden voyage, the Haven’s 95 staterooms were located so high up in the forward part of the ship that even guests in comparatively expensive staterooms might remain unaware of its existence. Depending on the season, a room in the Haven might cost a couple $10, 000 for a weeklong cruise vs. $3, 000 for an ordinary stateroom elsewhere on the ship. While the Haven is hidden, or at least camouflaged, on Norwegian’s cruise ships, its archrival Royal Caribbean, by contrast, makes no secret of what is available to passengers who pay the most. Its Royal Suite class isn’t a ship within a ship, but it serves much the same function with one significant difference: Regular passengers can push their noses up against the glass, literally. On Royal Caribbean’s new ship Anthem, diners must first walk past the frosted glass windows of Coastal Kitchen, reserved for suite occupants, before they can crowd around the buffet tables of the    Windjammer Café. There are no chafing dishes in sight at the Coastal Kitchen, where the order of the day is white table cloths and   service. The atmosphere is as calm and leisurely as Windjammer is hectic, although suite guests are free to dine at the latter if they like. Royal Caribbean’s business approach contrasts strikingly with Norwegian’s. While Norwegian executives decided to mostly hide the Haven from view, Royal Caribbean went with transparency. “It’s the American way,” said Michael Bayley, president of Royal Caribbean. “I think society is prepared to accept that if you pay more for certain elements, then you deserve them. ” Mr. Bayley and Royal Caribbean’s chairman, Richard Fain, say they ultimately decided against the     concept after studying the Haven. “That’s not the mojo or the culture of Royal Caribbean,” Mr. Bayley said. “The idea of segregating people into a class system is  . But if you live on Central Park, you are going to pay more. That’s how the system works. ” As has been the case elsewhere in the leisure industry in recent years, Royal Caribbean has become more comfortable with heightening the contrast between the treatment meted out to ordinary passengers and the level of service reserved for the top tier. Royal Caribbean has always considered the psychology of its guests when it designs new ships or introduces new amenities, said Adam Goldstein, the company’s chief operating officer, but there has been a shift in passenger expectations in recent years. “For a long time there was an acceptance that outside the door of your room, you were on an equal footing,” he said. “We didn’t attempt to have any differentiation in how services were delivered. ” Since the late 1990s, however, “there has been a huge evolution, maybe a revolution in attitudes,” Mr. Goldstein said. In addition to larger rooms or softer sheets, big spenders want to be coddled nowadays. “They are looking for constant validation that they are a   customer,” he said. For example, room service requests from Royal Suite occupants are automatically routed to a number different from the one used by regular passengers, who get slower, less personalized service. With a week in a top Royal Suite costing upward of $30, 000, compared with $4, 000 for an ordinary cabin, the focus is on “very affluent travelers, and we have no trouble filling these rooms,” Mr. Bayley said. In May, the company will roll out its Royal Genie program  —   essentially a personal servant for the highest spenders on board. Royal Genies will research their guests’ preferences even before they come aboard and come up with surprises like   drinks with their favorite vodka or Scotch. Even though this kind of pampering might be good for business, and delight those on the right side of the velvet rope, the gap between the privileged and the rest may ultimately leave everyone feeling uneasy, said Barry J. Nalebuff, a professor of management at Yale. “If I’m in the back of the plane, I want to hiss at the people in first class,” said Mr. Nalebuff, who has advised many Fortune 100 companies. “If I’m up front, I cringe as people walk by. ”",0
18860,BREAKING: New Video Exposes Clinton “Pay to Play” and Voter Fraud,"Pinterest 
Today, Project Veritas released the fourth video in their “Rigging the Election” series, titled, “ Rigging the Election – Video IV: $20K Wire Transfer From Belize Returned .” In it, Democracy Partners founder Robert Creamer, who visited the White House 342 times during President Obama’s time there — 45 times with Obama himself — and has since resigned from his position, is on tape talking about shady, offshore donations. 
At the beginning of the video, Creamer admits how close he is to the White House: “I’ve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago […] Every morning, I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by campaign headquarters […] I do a lot of work with the White House.” 
MRC TV reported about the video that unearthed major donations from offshore accounts in Belize that were “mysteriously returned”: 
O’Keefe then claims the Clinton campaign violated Federal Election Campaign (FEC) coordination laws. He alleges they sent a fake possible donor, named Charles Roth III, to speak with members of Americans United for Change (AUFC), another organization working with the Clinton campaign, to see how they would go about helping a “donor” who wanted to stop Donald Trump from winning the presidency. 
“Roth” spoke to Creamer about donating $20,000, and also inquired about how to affect Trump campaign events. 
According to Creamer, who responded to Roth: “Now, Trump events is fine and frankly I spent most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean that’s what I do, that’s what I do for the Clinton campaign…so that’s interesting as well.” 
Creamer then instructed Roth to send a check to AUFC — the group that O’Keefe reported Creamer was a general consultant for. Creamer admitted that he was a consultant for AUFC, but conveniently, after the first two Project Veritas videos were releaed, Creamer’s name was scrubbed from their site. 
Project Veritas dug even deeper into the corruption after AUFC confirmed that they got the $20,000 donation check from Roth via the offshore Belize account. To do so, Project Veritas sent another undercover journalist to intern with Democracy Partners and work with Creamer. 
Scott Foval, who we met in the previous “Rigged Election” series videos, is now the former national field director for AUFC and spoke to who he believed was a representative for Roth: “If he wants to get dirty, we can get dirty.” 
Much more was unearthed in the video — including Cesar Vargas, an illegal alien and founder of the Dream Action Coalition — who talked about conducting voter fraud in a meeting with Foval. 
“What’s the goal of the campaign right,” Vargas asked and added, “Yeah and for me I totally get it, this is illegal, this is something that can be done.” 
Project Veritas created a fictitious “money man” for Roth named Michael Carlson to see what these Democrat operatives would do with the promise of more money dangled in front of them. Creamer spoke to Carlson on the phone about a fictitious, wealthy client living in Syria that wanted to come to the U.S. Creamer told Carlson: 
I just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay? On the first…Well, I’ll just talk to…the guy I’m going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. It’s the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm that’s pretty well connected. 
Now, where did the $20,000 go? MRC-TV reported: 
The shocker of why the $20,000 was mysteriously returned led back to the direction of Woodhouse [AUFC President Brad Woodhouse]. O’Keefe claims that once Woodhouse learned of the future release of the undercover videos, the money was wire returned back to the offshore account in Belize with Woodhouse claiming suspicion of a foreign donation. 
Make sure to watch the entire Project Veritas video so you can see the corruption for yourself — including a pay-to-pay situation involving Creamer who was caught admitting that a donation could buy a meeting with Clinton.",0

18863,Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump Try to Bridge Some Gaps While Avoiding Others - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Despite sharp differences on immigration, refugees, trade and climate change, President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada struck a cordial tone on Monday in their first meeting, alternating between attempting to bridge those gaps and steering clear of them. Mr. Trump has called for a halt to the admission of refugees, saying that terrorists might slip into the United States among them, while Mr. Trudeau has held out Canada as a haven for refugees, particularly people who have fled the war in Syria, publicly hugging newly arrived families. When asked at a White House news conference whether he now sees the northern American border with Canada as insecure, Mr. Trump skirted the question, speaking instead of his administration’s efforts to deport criminals from the United States. In the same vein, Mr. Trudeau declined to say whether he agreed with the president’s executive order restricting immigration. “The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,” he said. Maintaining the country’s close political and economic links with the United States was top of the Canadian leader’s agenda before his visit to Washington. Mr. Trudeau had forged an unusually close relationship with former President Barack Obama, but many of Mr. Trump’s policies, particularly his protectionist stance on trade and his call for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, are chilling for Canadians. They count on trade with the United States for about 25 percent of their country’s gross domestic product. “It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds with the United States,” said Mr. Trudeau, who has expressed a cautious openness to renegotiating the trade pact. Mr. Trump’s complaints about trade have focused primarily on Mexico, another partner in the North American agreement, and China, which he has accused of taking advantage of the United States. He did not answer a question about whether he sees Canada as a fair trader, but suggested that he does not foresee deep changes in that relationship, which he called “outstanding. ” “We’ll be tweaking it,” he said. “It’s a much less severe situation than what’s taking place on the southern border. ” He said the two leaders had spoken privately about “doing some   things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster. ” They issued a joint statement pledging to continue border security programs that began under Mr. Obama, and reaffirming their commitment to NATO, an alliance that Mr. Trump had previously questioned. In presentation and speech, Mr. Trump, a bombastic Republican, and Mr. Trudeau, a more   Liberal who is 25 years younger, are poles apart. But the prime minister has carefully avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump and his policies. After the American election, he reorganized his cabinet to better deal with the change of power in Washington and swiftly sent emissaries to meet with Mr. Trump’s advisers. The meeting was the first test of the Canadian leader’s effort to foster a good working relationship. Mr. Trump greeted Mr. Trudeau warmly, a reception similar to the president’s greeting last week to Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister. The leaders shook hands heartily when Mr. Trudeau arrived at the White House, patting each other on the shoulder with their free hands. Mr. Trudeau appears determined to maintain friendly relations with Mr. Trump despite their differences, while signaling to Canadians who are wary of their powerful neighbor that Canada still charts its own course. “We continue our policy of openness to immigration and refugees without compromising security,” the prime minister said. “There have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that’s always been done firmly and respectfully. ” Mr. Trudeau presented the president with a framed photograph taken in the 1980s, showing Mr. Trump speaking at the head of a table of people including Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a former Liberal prime minister of Canada and the current prime minister’s father. The cabinet ministers who traveled with Mr. Trudeau on Monday had prepared for meetings with their American counterparts by emphasizing the importance of the   relationship to Canadians. Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, had reminded Trump administration officials that trade between the countries is roughly in balance, and that Canada is the largest buyer of American exports from 35 states. “The combination of Canada being smaller and the United States being bigger and the relationship largely being   means a lot of Americans don’t spend a lot of time thinking about Canada,” Ms. Freeland said in a recent interview. “Americans are not always fully aware of the economic significance of the relationship. ” Canadian business leaders expressed some relief after their prime minister’s meeting with Mr. Trump. “On the whole, this was a good day,” said John Manley, the president and chief executive of the Business Council of Canada, which represents 150 large Canadian corporations. “There’s still lots of things to be anxious about, but I think the tone and the substance were all very positive. ” Some of those anxieties stem from uncertainty over what small changes to the United   trade relationship could mean for some sectors of the economy. There had been concerns after Mr. Trump’s election that he might go after the Canadian auto industry, a major employer in Ontario, which exports most of its production to the United States. Flavio Volpe, the president of the Auto Parts Manufacturers’ Association, a trade group, said that it was important for his members to hear Mr. Trump’s message that he is not planning to dramatically remake the United States’ trade relationship to Canada. The two leaders also met on Monday with several women who are chief executives of companies from both countries to announce that Canada and the United States would set up a   council to advance women into executive roles, and to encourage entrepreneurship.",0
18864,Clinton Says ‘Personal Beef’ by Putin Led to Hacking Attacks - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that the hacking attacks carried out by Russia against her campaign and the Democratic National Committee were intended “to undermine our democracy” and were ordered by Vladimir V. Putin “because he has a personal beef against me. ” Speaking to a group of donors in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Putin, the Russian president, had never forgiven her for the accusation she made in 2011, when she was secretary of state, that parliamentary elections his country held that year were rigged. “Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,” Mrs. Clinton said. It is the first time Mrs. Clinton has publicly addressed the impact of the hacks since the intelligence community concluded that they were specifically aimed at harming her campaign. “Make no mistake, as the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign,” Mrs. Clinton told the group, which collectively poured roughly $1 billion into her effort. “This is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation. ” In her remarks, she endorsed the proposal of a bipartisan group of senators to investigate the hacking and said the inquiry should be modeled on the commission set up after the Sept. 11 attacks. “The public deserves to know exactly what happened, and why, in order for us to prevent future attacks on our systems, including our electoral system,” she said. Mrs. Clinton said the hacking was one of two “unprecedented” events that led to her defeat. The other was the release of a letter by James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, shortly before the election disclosing new questions about emails handled by her private server. The letter, she said, cost her close races in several battleground states. “  voters made their decisions in the final days breaking against me because of the F. B. I. letter from Director Comey,” she said. Mrs. Clinton first talked about the impact of Mr. Comey’s letters in a conference call with donors a few days after the election. Since the election she has kept a low profile, mostly appearing on social media in photographs by   who have spotted her walking her dogs near her home in Chappaqua, N. Y.",0
18865,The War on Drugs is a Racket,"Photo by Cannabis Culture | CC BY 2.0 O n a recent segment of Democracy Now, Tess Borden made an impassioned plea for the U.S. – both federal and state governments — to end the criminal prosecution of those possessing or using illegal drugs. 
Quoting from a new report from the ACLU and Human Rights Watch (HRW), “ Every 25 Seconds: The Human Toll of Criminalizing Drug Use in the United States ,” Borden observed, “Every 25 seconds someone is arrested for possessing drugs for their own use, amounting to 1.25 million arrests per year.” She reminded her audience, “These numbers tell a tale of ruined lives, destroyed families, and communities suffering under a suffocating police presence.” 
The study is an impressive piece of rigorous research and analysis as well as a statement of moral conviction: it’s a political call to decriminalize all personal drug use. It paints a devastating portrait of not simply the nation’s failed anti-drug policy, but reveals it to be a mean-spirited, moralistic – and racist — program of social repression. 
Among the study’s key findings are: 
• Yes, every 25 seconds someone in the U.S. is arrested for the simple act of possessing drugs for their personal use. 
• Sadly, more than 1.25 million people are arrested each year for drug possession – this is more than for any other crime. 
• More than one of every nine arrests by state law enforcement is for drug possession — four times more people are arrested for possessing drugs as for selling them. 
• There are at least 137,000 men and women imprisoned for drug possession — 48,000 in state pens and 89,000 in local jails (most in pretrial detention). 
• This population consists predominantly of inner-city dwellers – African-American and Hispanic and largely youthful offenders. 
• In 42 states, possession of small amounts of most illicit drugs other than marijuana is either always or sometimes a felony offense; only eight states and the District of Columbia make possession of small amounts a misdemeanor. 
• State rates of arrest for drug possession range from 700 per 100,000 people in Maryland to 77 per 100,000 in Vermont. 
A bust every 25 seconds adds up. As the study reminds readers, “tens of thousands [of people] are convicted, cycle through jails and prisons, and spend extended periods on probation and parole, often burdened with crippling debt from court-imposed fines and fees.” 
The study makes clear that the war-on-drugs is a punitive, vindictive form of policing, criminal justice and imprisonment. It’s easy to be tough on those involved in mostly a victimless crime, drug use. Cops pick the easiest target, notably inner-city minority youth (i.e., “Stop and Frisk”) and, increasingly, rural white youth; prosecutors show off how tough they are by “throwing the book” at some hapless soul; and judges get easily re-elected for being tough on drug criminals, especially people of color and repeat offenders. 
The study makes clear that the war-on-drugs is a failure in terms of public policy and the toll it takes on those suffocated by the drug war effort. Unfortunately, the study suffers from not pushing its inherent argument one critical step further – acknowledging that the police-court-jail system that manages the drug war is a racket, the domestic corollary to the military-industrial complex that Pres. Dwight Eisenhower identified a half-century ago. 
*** 
A lmost a century ago, the U.S. adopted the 18 th Amendment establishing abstinence as the law of the land. Prohibition was inforce for 13 years and was a failure, flaunted by many and leading to wide-scale corruption of law enforcement and politicians. It was formally terminated with the adoption of the 21 st Amendment in 1933 as the Depression mounted. Now, nearly a century after Prohibition was proven a failure, we may be witnessing the end to the criminalization of personal drug use. 
In the wake of the failure of Prohibition, the U.S. Congress enacted the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937, effectively criminalized marijuana use. Three decades later, in 1971, Pres. Richard Nixon formally launched the “war on drugs,” transforming a relatively obscure local – and very private – issue into a national concern. He dramatically increased the size and presence of federal drug control agencies; he promoted mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants; he also placed marijuana in Schedule One, the most restrictive category of drugs; and he called for a national commission to study the drug problem and recommend appropriate policies. 
In 1972, Nixon’s drug-policy commission — the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, the Shafer Commission — unanimously recommended decriminalizing the possession and distribution of marijuana for personal use. Nixon furiously rejected its recommendations. And the war-on-drugs has barreled on for the last four decades. 
As the Watergate scandal undermined Nixon’s presidency, New York Governor, Nelson Rockefeller launched his presidential campaign in 1973 with a call to toughen the state’s drug laws. He upped the war against drugs, calling for mandatory prison sentences of 15 years to life for drug dealers and addicts — even those caught with small amounts of marijuana, cocaine or heroin. In the wake of Nixon’s resignation, Rockefeller became Vice President and his signature effort was to implement his war on drugs as a national campaign. 
The punitive anti-drug policy was further strengthened by Pres. Ronald Reagan, leading to a massive increase in incarceration rates. The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) estimates that in 1980, “50,000 people were incarcerated for violating nonviolent drug law but by 1997 the number increased to over 400,000 people.” In 1981, Nancy Reagan proclaimed a new era in the anti-drug wars, championing “ Just Say No .” 
The DPA also notes that during the mid- to late-1980s, the nation experienced a near-hysterical rage over the alleged threat of illegal drugs. It points out that public opinion polls in 1985 found only about 2-6 percent of Americans saw drug abuse as the nation’s “number one problem”; however, by September 1989 two-thirds of those polled (64%) considered drugs as the nation’s leading problem. It adds, “Within less than a year [1990], however, the figure plummeted to less than 10 percent, as the media lost interest.” 
A quarter-century later, the drug scene has changed. During the ‘50s-‘70s, hipsters and hippies, white and black, smoking the evil weed. In the ‘80s, a “crack cocaine scare” gripped the nation following the adoption of the infamous Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986); the Act made penalties 100 times harsher for crack than for powder cocaine convictions and 85 percent of those jailed for crack cocaine offenses were black, despite the fact that the majority of users were white. 
Americans love to get high. In 2013, the “legal” drug of choice was alcohol, where nearly three-fifths (58%) were drinkers and nearly a quarter (24%) binge drinkers. The use of tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes, cigars) among whites is still over one-quarter (28%). An estimated 25 million Americans were using illicit drugs, about 9.4 percent of the population aged 12 or older; this is up to from the 2002-09 rate of 7.9 percent. The drugs used were marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants and prescription-type psychotherapeutics. 
Marijuana was Americans favorite means of getting high, accounting for four-fifths (81%) of illicit drug users, about 20 million users per month. Among full-time college students, whites have the highest rate of illegal drug use at 25 percent. 
Methamphetamine (“meth”) was once the drug of choice among white males (e.g., outlaw motorcycle gangs and blue-collar guys) and remains so, but is losing its appeal. In the ‘90s at the height of its popularity, the Open Society estimates there were only one million meth users. Today, its use has spread to white women and Hispanics. Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health reported that between 2002-2005 and 2008-2011 there was a 75 percent jump in heroin usage among “Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.” 
T he new drugs of choice among Americans are psychotherapeutic drugs and heroine. A 2010 report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that, during 2009, 2.4 million individuals used psycho drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants and sedatives used for nonmedical purposes. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, “Adolescent girls and women older than 35 years have significantly greater rates of abuse and dependence on psychotherapeutic drugs than men.”
More troubling, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), overdoses (i.e., “drug poisoning”) are “the number one cause of injury-related death in the United States, with 43,982 deaths occurring in 2013.” It found, based on data from 28 states, that the “death rate for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 through 2012.” Drilling down, it found there were 8,257 heroine deaths, most involving men aged 25–44 years. 
*** 
No one knows how much money has been spent to fight the failed war-on-drugs. According to a DPA estimate , “Over the past four decades, federal and state governments have poured over $1 trillion into drug war spending and relied on taxpayers to foot the bill.” It adds: “Money funneled into drug enforcement has meant less funding for more serious crime and has left essential education, health, social service and public safety programs struggling to operate on meager funding.” 
The Drug War Facts website provides a detailed breakdown on annual federal spending on the war-on-drugs for 2013-’17. It estimates for Fiscal Year 2016, the federal government will spend $30.6 billion. A third source, the Drug War Clock , estimates that federal spending is about 60 percent of that spent by states (i.e., $49 billion); total spending for the false war-on-drugs at about $75 billion. 
The expenditures associated with the war-on-drugs are, like the military-industrial complex, a vast slush fund with costs covering a very wide assortment of federal, state and local – both government and private — services and fees. Among these expenditures are: 
• Costs of policing, from the border guards to the cop-on-the-block; 
• Costs of prosecutors, courts and defense attorneys; 
• Costs for prisons, jails and probation. 
These areas of expenditures do not itemize the directs costs for employment, facilities and upkeep (e.g., food, medical) let alone the profits garnered by private corporations to operate the vast infrastructure required to wage the war-on-drugs. 
Nor do these expenditures included the $1 trillion that Americans spent on illegal substances between 2000 and 2010. In a 2012 study for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Rand estimated the market for four illicit drugs — cocaine (including crack), heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine (meth) – at $100 billion for only one year, 2010. It noted, “This figure has been stable over the decade, but there have been important shifts in the drugs being purchased.” 
With a $100 billion in illegal drug money sloshing through the economy each year, one can only wonder how much of it goes to corruption pay-offs, to law enforcement officials who look the other way. As experienced during Prohibition, the enormous cash generated by the illegal drug trade leads to endemic corruption. 
Finally, as the ACLU and HRW study painfully makes clear, many, many peoples’ lives are destroyed for the possession on illegal drugs. Unfortunately, it doesn’t mention the way questionable law-enforcement officials, like the notorious Brooklyn NYPD detective Louis Scarcella and former DA Charles Hynes, exploited drug busts to further their careers. (New York has paid more than $100 million to wrongfully convicted victims of their arrests and prosecutions.) 
Its time to embrace the ACLU and HRW’s call to end the criminal prosecution of those who possess or use an “illegal” substance. Like alcohol, its needs to integrated into the market economy and, like alcohol, effectively regulated in terms of quality and age-of-use. Sadly, like the military-industrial complex, to many corporations, unions and people with influence have too much invested in the war-on-drugs to see it end.

18866,"Postelection Harassment, Case by Case - The New York Times","Vandalism, offensive jokes, even criminal assault  —   reports of   harassment have spiked since Donald J. Trump’s victory in the presidential race. Few of the perpetrators have been caught, but here is a look at five cases in which people have been directly accused. Some apologized. One denied being responsible. Another said his actions had been misconstrued. When Isabel Manu started sending her classmate María Sanchez internet memes that mocked Mr. Trump’s plans to crack down on immigration, Ms. Sanchez, whose parents had come to the United States illegally from Mexico, tried to shake it off: “It was just a little funny, like ha, O. K. awkward funny. ” Ms. Manu tried to turn up the humor after Mr. Trump was elected president. She failed. Using clothing and shoes, she built a wall in Ms. Sanchez’s dorm room at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Mo. and left a note saying, “Trump won so here is a little preview of what’s to come. ” Tearful and disturbed, Ms. Sanchez posted a photograph on Twitter that was shared more than 50, 000 times. “I was angry,” she said. “I threw the stuff, and I tore the paper. ” Ms. Sanchez, along with campus security officers, confronted Ms. Manu, who appeared shocked that the gag had backfired. Ms. Manu declined to be interviewed. Ms. Sanchez speculated that online humor around presidential politics had led her friend to think of the election, and what was at stake, as a joke. Ms. Sanchez said that Ms. Manu had apologized, and the two are working on reconciling. “A friendship is not all love,” Ms. Sanchez said. “There are going to be horrible things that are going to happen. We have to move on and grow from this. ” Officer Michael Peters was off duty when he flew a Confederate battle flag from the back of his pickup truck at a “Love Trumps Hate” demonstration in Traverse City, Mich. Officer Peters, an   Police Department veteran, was captured in photographs getting out of his vehicle, opening a Bud Light and arguing with protesters. He could not be reached for comment, but the Traverse City police chief said he had previously displayed the divisive symbol at work. After the most recent episode was shared widely on the internet and in news reports, he resigned, which Marty Colburn, the city manager of the popular tourist destination in northern Michigan, called “necessary. ” Mr. Colburn said Mr. Peters had also offered an apology for what the former officer described as the “stain” he put on the city. He added that Mr. Peters had cut short a   trip to sign the paperwork to complete his resignation. On Tuesday, Mr. Peters delivered a letter to the local newspaper, saying that he attended the rally to protest what he viewed as political correctness. He added that he believes the Confederate symbol “has nothing to do with racism, and everything to do with embracing and celebrating the simple lifestyle that is the country  . ” John Sousa, a high school teacher and golf coach in Wesley Chapel, Fla. was suspended from work after students accused him of telling a group of black classmates, “Don’t make me call Donald Trump to get you sent back to Africa. ” The school district is investigating the episode. Mr. Sousa did not respond to requests for an interview. In a Facebook post, Donnie Jones Jr. a Wesley Chapel High School parent, said he had spoken with the teacher on the phone. “He actually admitted saying it,” Mr. Jones wrote online. “He said it was just an    comment and wasn’t meant to be racist. He said it was a bunch of male and female students in the hallway and he was talking to everyone. ” Edward Tomasso and Parker   students at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. drove onto the nearby campus of Wellesley College flying a Trump flag from their vehicle and chanted Mr. Trump’s campaign slogans outside a building where minority students can seek support. They bragged about the episode in an online video that has since been taken down. But after facing a backlash that included death threats on social media and a harsh response from officials at both schools, each posted an apology on Facebook and denied targeting minority students. “Publicly celebrating the election at a time and in a place when so many were deeply disappointed about its outcome and, indeed, genuinely grieving about it, was just not smart,” Mr.   wrote. “We had no idea that our actions would be interpreted as racist, or sexist, or harassment. ” Mr. Tomasso wrote: “As a white male, I do not feel threatened by the new president. I have not had to work for that privilege. It was something I was born with. ” He included a phone number and email address where he said those he had offended could reach him directly. Quickly, though, angry comments  —   along with a few written in support  —   inundated the post, and Mr. Tomasso stopped responding. Neither Mr. Tomasso nor Mr.   responded to requests for comment. Shacara McLaurin, a singer and   activist in New York, said that she was walking home after a performance last week when she passed a political protest, and an elderly man who supported Mr. Trump began to heckle her. After a physical altercation in which the man fell to the ground, Ms. McLaurin, 23, was charged with assault and harassment. She said that the man had thrown himself onto the ground and appeared to be drunk, and that she had lost her day job as a home health aide because of the episode. She also said that since the incident, she has been attacked on social media. “Why should it have to come to the point where we are threatening each other and threatening each other’s lives over a presidential election?” she asked.",0
18867,So-So Players’ Salaries Soar in N.B.A. Flush With New TV Money - The New York Times,"Timofey Mozgov is a journeyman N. B. A. player who averaged 6. 3 points a game last season. Last week he agreed to a   $64 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers. It was a little like a character actor suddenly being paid more than Will Smith for a bit part in a summer blockbuster. The past week in the N. B. A. in which players whose contracts had expired began to negotiate new deals, has turned the sports economy on its head. An infusion of billions of dollars into the league’s coffers from a television contract agreed upon two years ago has led to this: That random guy on the bench is getting upward of $15 million a year. After his deal was announced, Mozgov told The Los Angeles Daily News that he planned to spend the summer “sitting on the beach and drinking a piña colada. ” Or five million piña coladas. Matthew Dellavedova, who last season often sat on the Cleveland Cavaliers’ bench alongside Mozgov, also cashed in, agreeing to a   $38 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. Ryan Anderson, a sharpshooter who plays questionable defense, scored $80 million over four years with the Houston Rockets. That annual rate, $20 million, is higher than what any player made on last season’s   Golden State Warriors, including Stephen Curry, the league’s   most valuable player. The numbers were even bigger for players considered more talented, even if they are not recognizable to casual sports fans. The Memphis Grizzlies agreed to give Chandler Parsons $94 million over four years and Mike Conley $153 million over five years  —   the biggest contract in N. B. A. history. Conley is a very good point guard LeBron James he is not. This startling redistribution of wealth is a product of a TV rights extension that will go into effect next season, under which ESPN and Turner (which carries games on TNT) are paying the league $24 billion over nine years  —   about a 180 percent increase over the last contract. The enormous jump was seen as a reflection of the general value of live sports in an age of DVR and YouTube clips and specifically of the appeal of a   exciting league. “As shocking as the numbers seem, the reality is the business is that much stronger, and the players are just getting their rightful share,” said Marc Fleisher, a basketball agent and the son of Larry Fleisher, who helped found the N. B. A. players union. The salary cap  —   the maximum amount each team can spend on salaries (with some exceptions built in)  —   was $70 million last season, a $7 million rise from the previous season. But next season it will be $94 million, and it is projected to be $107 million for the   season. Also rising was each team’s salary floor, mandating that franchises spend at least 90 percent of the cap’s value on their players. Translation: There had never been a better time to be an N. B. A. free agent than this month, and there may never be again. Players whose contracts expired at the end of the recently completed season hit the jackpot as frenzied teams scrambled for bodies. “Panic is probably not the right word, but teams get afraid that they’ll be left with nothing after months and months of planning and seeing everyone get snatched up quickly,” Fleisher said. Each pro sports league has its own, often complicated salary structure. Right now, basketball players seem charmed in comparison with their counterparts in the N. F. L. and Major League Baseball. In the N. F. L. where the players’ union is relatively weak, contracts are typically not even guaranteed. In baseball, which has the strongest union and no hard limits on spending, the biggest stars have received gargantuan contracts. But the equivalent of a Dellavedova  —   a reserve utility infielder?  —   probably does not receive $9. 5 million a year. Because N. B. A. salary rules also restrict maximum payouts, favor veterans and strictly slot rookie contracts, many milquetoast players are paid above what their open market value would be. If there were an Occupy Wall Street of the N. B. A. it would not consist of the 99 percent revolting against the 1 percent. Rather, its youngest players and maybe its biggest superstars, who many argue are paid less than what they are truly worth, would take on the vast middle class. “Veterans have decided, ‘We want to shift the money from rookies to veterans,’” said Warren Zola, who teaches sports business at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. That decision was reached when most of this season’s rookies were too young to drive. Although basketball fans generally believe that more revenue should go to the players rather than the owners, many have nonetheless been dazzled by recent deals. “I wasn’t shocked Chandler Parsons got a max contract,” Joel Martinez, who, under the name The Kid Mero,   a popular podcast, said on Twitter, “until I found out it was for basketball and not spraying cologne at Abercrombie. ” After committing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to Conley and Parsons, the owner of the Grizzlies, Robert Pera, posted an image of one of the Little Rascals throwing money out a window. As much money as Pera and his fellow owners are throwing around this summer, though, they, too, are enjoying the N. B. A. ’s boom times. The high contracts reflect a fundamental reality: Business has never been better. “The bottom line is the players get somewhere between 49 and 51 percent,” Fleisher said, referring to the current apportionment of what is known in the jargon as   income. “So the fact that the players are getting this just shows you how much the owners are making. ”",0
18868,"BREAKING: Melania Trump’s Immigration Records Made Public, Show Trump’s ULTIMATE Hypocrisy | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave","on November 4, 2016 10:58 pm · 
GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline – and even bigoted – stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect “deportation forces” to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. 
According to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trump’s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor’s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. 
So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: 
“As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.” 
Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn’t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management – a modeling agency. Also, there’s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor’s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania’s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . 
The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the “other.” Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn’t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

18869,14 Outstanding Facts About the Anunnaki,". 14 Outstanding Facts About the Anunnaki The Anunnaki, probably the number one topic when it comes to the Ancient alien theory, but what are ... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/14-outstanding-facts-about-anunnaki.html The Anunnaki, probably the number one topic when it comes to the Ancient alien theory, but what are the facts? 1. In many depictions of the Anunnaki , we can see strange objects worn by “those who came from the stars”, one of the most interesting examples are “wrist watches” which appear in almost every single depiction of the Anunnaki. 2. The Sumerians were the first people who started building actual cities, organized using actual city grids like we see in modern day cities around the world, according to the Ancient Alien theory, the Anunnaki transferred this knowledge to ancient man. 3. In the 19th century archaeologists exploring the ancient ruins of Nineveh discovered 22,000 clay tablets which are directly connected to the Anunnaki . 4. In 1976 author Sitchin published his personal translations of the Sumerian texts in a series of books called “ The Earth Chronicles “. According to Sitchin the clay tablets describe an alien race known as the Anunnaki came to Earth to mine gold . 5. Gold reflects infrared light. Infrared is basically light you don’t see it, but we interact with it in the form of heat, the radiation interacts with our molecules and that makes them vibrate faster and you’ll feel that as heat, gold also makes a good heat shield, partly because it’s so malleable. You can make gold very thin; it’s easy to work with; and it has great properties for reflecting and heat protection making it a “must have” resource not only for us but potentially for extraterrestrial visitors as Sitchin suggests. 6. Sitchin theorized that “the Anunnaki” came from another planet in our solar system that has an 3,600-year elliptical orbit. 7. According to the ancient Sumerian tablets, the Anunnaki genetically altered primitive mankind and created a labor force which allowed them to mine gold faster. 8. According to Zecharia Sitchin, “the Adamu” were the first modern humans, they were created by the Anunnaki 450,000 years ago when they genetically mixed their DNA with that of prehistoric man and that way obtained a labor force which did what the Anunnaki wanted. 9. “Adam” in Hebrew stands for “man”. “Adamu” is what the Sumerians refer to as “first man,” the Anunnaki slaves. 10. Zulu legends speak of a time when “visitors from the stars” came to excavate gold and other natural resources. These mines were worked by slaves created by the “First People“. — By Ancient Code Bonus 11. According to both texts and depictions, the Anunnaki were giants (notice the Anunnaki god below, offering agriculture to mankind — seated, he is just as tall as the two Homo Sapiens standing in front of him). 12. The Anunnaki knew about 6,000 years ago that the sun and the planets in our solar system are spherical and that they revolve around the sun (see the above depiction of our solar system), which is clear evidence that their stories about coming to Earth from outer space were real. 13. According to the so called "" Lost Book of Enki ,"" the Anunnaki built the Egyptian pyramids after a great cataclysm that almost wiped out our species. 14. According to the Sumerian King List and the Sumerian tablets , the Anunnaki lived extremely long lives or, possibly, they could not die from natural causes. ""After the kingship descended from [the] heaven[s], the kingship was in Eridug. In Eridug, Alulim became king; he ruled for 28800 years. Alaljar ruled for 36000 years. 2 kings; they ruled for 64800 years."" By HumansAreFree.com  ",0

Troubled London Stadium, Stratford, LONDON: With an expert in Stadium building announcing that the athletics stadium should be demolished and rebuilt properly as a football stadium, the Duchess of Knightsbridge has made an enormous gesture. 
""Let it be known that I shall pay in FULL for the London Stadium rebuild!"" cried the Duchess of Knightsbridge. In tears, she came forth to express her regret that West Ham Utd had ever left the Boleyn Ground. 
""All David Sullivan kept going on about, was that the toilets were better at the London Stadium, than the Boleyn Ground! Surely we could have upgraded the toilets at the Boleyn rather than go to that athletics track up Stratford way!"" 
With a Stadium expert advising to knock down the violence-prone London Stadium and starting again, the Duchess of Knightsbridge has offered to open up her purse to pay for it ALL! 
The rebuilding cost COULD spiral even more, the extra charge is now quoted at £52 million, but never mind, the Duchess of Knightsbridge can pay that out of her purse and has agreed to do so! 
Members of Parliament are already calling for West Ham Utd to play their matches behind closed doors, but with the Duchess offering to pay for the full rebuild costs out of her purse, this 'might' quiet them down in shock! Make SpoofyDoofy's  ",0
18872,Media’s Odd Couple: Proudly Freewheeling HBO and Buttoned-Up AT&ampT - The New York Times,"Can an elite,   TV network based in Manhattan find a comfortable home at a Dallas telecommunications company led by an executive who is also the Boy Scouts of America president? Richard Plepler, the head of HBO, considered the question at his regular lunch spot  —   a corner table at The Lambs Club in New York. It had been a whirlwind few days for Mr. Plepler, and while the restaurant may have been familiar, little else about the week was business as usual. Five days earlier, HBO’s parent company, Time Warner, agreed to be taken over by ATT in an $85 billion deal that startled the media world. Mr. Plepler met his potential new boss, the ATT chief executive Randall Stephenson, for the first time last Monday, and they spent 30 minutes chatting at HBO’s headquarters overlooking Bryant Park. Still, Mr. Plepler said he was comfortable with this shotgun marriage, and for one big reason: He believes he will be able to run things the way he always has. “Randall made very clear to everybody that what they are buying they look at with enormous respect and admiration, and the last thing they have any interest in doing is messing with a winning game,” he said on Thursday. Will it be that simple? HBO, which also has operations in Los Angeles, is a creature of its coastal milieu and creates shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Westworld,” the kind of   entertainment that appeals to viewers with a tolerance for amoral protagonists and graphic violence. It is also home to the liberal   host Bill Maher, and the British comedian John Oliver, who delights in skewering powerful corporate interests on his show “Last Week Tonight. ” The premium cable channel is an unabashed big spender, too, throwing lavish parties and dinners at places like the Museum of Modern Art in New York City or the Hotel du Cap in Cannes, and flying actors, directors and writers across the country. ATT, though, will have $175 billion or more in debt on its balance sheet if the proposed merger is completed. “One is a connectivity sales company and another is an entertainment provider,” said Gary Arlen, the head of Arlen Communications, a research firm that examines the media and telecommunications industries. “ATT has a history as being a public utility. It’s bland and very vanilla. HBO is showbiz all the way. ” Over a plate of chicken paillard last Thursday, Mr. Plepler acknowledged that assimilation would take some time. “Obviously when you get to know people, there’s a learning curve on both sides,” he said. But he said that for HBO and other parts of Time Warner to thrive, “you have to have a Chinese wall between the creative process and everything else. ” For its part, ATT has contended it would stay out of the way. “I know they’re different cultures, and we’ll be protective of the cultures to ensure we don’t destroy the business,” Mr. Stephenson said at a conference conducted by The Wall Street Journal last week. “We’ll have the experts that know to run these businesses running these businesses. ” If the deal is not blocked by regulators, ATT will acquire not just HBO, but also CNN and entities like TBS, TNT and Warner Bros. which earn billions in revenue. But HBO is the crown jewel of Time Warner’s media properties, having won more Emmys than any other network for 15 consecutive years. Now, however, HBO faces increased pressure to find new hits and pick up new subscribers when there is more competition than ever in television. There are examples of peaceful transitions when a nonmedia company acquires a content company  —   like Comcast’s ownership of NBC Universal, which has gone smoothly  —   but others have created headaches. Universal Pictures, for instance, has endured many owners, including bankers (Standard Capital) liquor moguls (Seagram’s) and cable pioneers (Comcast). When it was owned by General Electric, about a decade ago, executives at the film studio were required to attend Six Sigma sessions  —   which involve meticulous business analysis exercises  —   in Crotonville, N. Y. to their extreme displeasure. When Columbia Pictures was owned by   in the 1980s, it had hits like “Ghostbusters” and “Tootsie,” but the studio was banned from showing   soft drinks, and executives chafed under Coke’s expectations about profit margin, according to “Hit and Run,” a 1996 book about the movie industry by the entertainment reporters Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters. Still, the   ATT is certainly no stranger to enormous acquisitions  —   and bringing in a company, however different, is nothing new. “At ATT, there’s a culture within consumer marketing and there’s another culture in the engineering area, but there is mutual respect,” said James Cicconi, a former longtime ATT executive who ran external affairs and retired last year. “The same thing would be true for more creative areas or companies like an HBO. ATT is pretty sophisticated in terms of acquisitions and the importance of being able to integrate. ” As a subscription service that does not rely on ratings for revenue, HBO depends on generating excitement, striving to place its shows at the center of the cultural mainstream. It willingly approves big budgets to ensure high production quality and attract top talent, a practice that has allowed it to forge strong relationships with prominent actors, writers and directors. While many television networks now shoot in Canada because it is cheaper, for instance, HBO does not. The reason? Most actors prefer to avoid making the trip. When HBO made the film “Clear History,” Larry David’s 2013 comedy, the comedian requested that the network add a few million dollars to the budget. They gave it to him. He asked if the movie could be shot on Martha’s Vineyard, where he has a home. They did it. “If we make an investment, whether it’s a screening or an event, it’s about enhancing our brand and elevating our brand,” Mr. Plepler said. He said he would “be very surprised” if ATT did not embrace that. There are other questions about melding the two cultures. HBO has a proudly progressive view of the world, and its prominent dramas feature plenty of violence and sex. It is also willing to take risks. Michael London, a producer of “Confirmation,” an HBO original movie that recreated the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas hearings, said in an interview this year that the filmmakers “knew it would be difficult and challenging to tell the story within a corporate environment with legal threats and telephone calls. HBO is fearless. ” If ATT gets someone complaining on the phone, will there be bigger problems? “HBO has succeeded on their terms, but ATT plays a much larger game,” said Bill Miller, a prominent lobbyist based in Austin, Tex. “HBO plays to their hometown, but ATT plays to a national audience where half of them aren’t progressive, and that puts them in a bit of a bind potentially. As soon as people feel unhappy or victimized, they’ll hear a lot about it. That’s what elected officials do: They complain. But for now, it is time for the honeymoon, with Mr. Stephenson, the telecom executive and Boy Scouts president, and Mr. Plepler, the consummate media executive, developing a relationship in real time. At the conference in California last week, Mr. Stephenson said he would visit the Warner Bros. studio later that day. And then, making light of their distinct sartorial preferences, he quipped: “I’m going to unbutton my shirt like Richard’s over there. ”",0

18874,7 Not-So-Secret Homes of Super Secret Societies,"In clandestine corners of the world, the elite come together in secrecy. Some of them don’t mind that we know of these society meetings, while others maintain that they do not organize at all.


Yet doormen speak to their friends, initiation rites are leaked, people peek in windows, chanting in far underground lairs can be heard by a passerby. Conspiracy theorists have long held that someone, and not the Fates, is manipulating our world, and perhaps in these secret societies the strings are being pulled.

Here is a list of seven groups so secret some members will never admit to their involvement, and their meeting places hiding in plain sight.

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT 
Ivy league Yale University is considered to be one of the most selective higher educational institutions in the United States, if not the world. Its motto lux et veritas translates to “light and truth.” On the historic campus in New Haven, Connecticut, there is a building where “light and truth” are reserved for carefully selected members and alumni.

What is known about the Skull and Bones secret society is minimal. The organization started in 1832. An official roster of its members was published up until 1971. Bonesmen, as members are called, have been heads of corporations, senior government officials, Supreme Court justices, and even presidents. Theories about what the Skull and Bones actually do range from its members controlling the Central Intelligence Agency, being a part of a global network aimed at world domination, to being a branch of the Illuminati.

It’s also unknown exactly what happens in The Tomb, the group’s headquarters, but there are strange rumors of what is contained in the windowless sandstone building. The Egypto-Doric style of the structure makes it appear as an immense sepulcher. The tomb is thought to hold secret documents containing the roster of all members, ritual details, as well as multiple stolen relics. Some of the bones rumored to be in The Tomb include the skulls of Geronimo, Pancho Villa, Martin Van Buren, and the gravestone of Elihu Yale, the school’s founder. Bonesmen are also known to take other societies’ belongings in a show of thievery and cunning known as crooking.

OOSTERBEEK, NETHERLANDS 
Hotel de Bilderberg. (Photo: Michiel1972/CC BY-SA 4.0 )  
In November of 1954, 50 delegates from 11 countries in Western Europe and 11 Americans spent three days in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, at the Hotel de Bilderberg . The purpose of the meeting was said to foster conversations between Europe and North America. Those in attendance included a prince, a prime minster, and the head of the CIA. Since that meeting, each year a group of international leaders in the fields of politics, business, media, and communications have met to discuss… we’re not exactly sure.

There is no agenda, no resolutions are proposed, no voting of any kind is executed, and no positions or policy statements are issued. The meetings are held in a different location each year and each year the topics of the meeting are up for the general public to theorize over. The roster of attendees is never officially made public, but there have been leaks over the years. Conspiracy theories abound, especially because of the group’s intense level of secrecy. Many believe the group is conspiring to impose capital domination, a world government, or a planned economy. What is certain is that the more prominent you are, the more likely you’ll be to get an invitation to next year’s Bilderberg conference.

TREMENTINA, NEW MEXICO 
Trementina Base, New Mexico. (Photo: Google Earth ) 
Scientology is most visible today because of celebrity members like Tom Cruise and John Travolta, yet the organization has been aggressive over the years in tackling critics and maintaining its secrets. One of the most controversial religious groups, some characterize the movement as a cult.

Basic Scientology belief holds that humans are immortal beings who have reincarnated and have lived on other planets before finding themselves now on Earth. One of the things that makes the religion controversial is its assertive nature, often turning to character assassination or litigation in dealing with skeptics and critics who question their practices. The church is also extremely secretive, holding many of its teachings from members until they have made it through multiple levels.

Scientology operates several churches called Celebrity Centres that are opened to the public, but are primarily meant for “anyone with the power and vision to create a better world.” The Church of the Spiritual Technology, or CST, is reserved for the most trusted of members. Many of these members manage elaborate bases including the Trementina Base . The official word from the church is that the base is a location used to preserve Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s writings, which are said to be engraved on steel sheets and encased in titanium cases. It’s thought that Trementina is more than just a location to archive Hubbard’s works, however.

Trementina contains underground dwellings and tunnels, but what’s most interesting about the base is what you see from the outside. Aerial photographs above the base show huge images dug into the Earth. The images are that of the church’s logo. Former members have claimed that the symbols are to mark the return point for members when they travel into the future. Other members have stated that this is the place where Hubbard is supposed to go when he returns.

The Illuminati: Domus Sanctae Marthae 
VATICAN CITY, VATICAN Pope Francis entering Domus Sanctae Marthae (Photo: Pufui Pc Pifpef I/CC BY-SA 3.0 )  
Established in 1776 in Bavaria, Germany, this group of freethinkers, humanists, and academics opposed superstition, prejudice, religion, and its influence over the public, and they supported the advancement of women.

The Illuminati were a shadowy group, believed capable of influencing movements in government and the arts. The group was infiltrated and shut down a decade after its founding, or so the official record goes. Conspiracy theorists have long been obsessed that the world has been controlled by the Illuminati for generations. There are many modern groups that claim to be the descendants of the original Bavarian Illuminati; they go so far as to use the name “Illuminati” in their title, but there is no evidence that these recent organizations are tied to the original.

Besides its actions, what is a major mystery of this group is the location of its headquarters. Theorists have claimed many prominent locations are the headquarters of the Illuminati from Disney World in Orlando, Florida, the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Statue of Liberty in New York City, Big Ben in London, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and, among many others, the Vatican.

The theory that the Illuminati headquarters is located at the Vatican is especially interesting due to the group’s opposition to the church. It’s believed by conspiracy theorists that the church was long ago infiltrated by the society and so that would make its leader, the pope, one of the Illuminati’s highest ranking members. Today, the pope resides in a simple room at Domus Sanctae Marthae , a guest house adjacent to St. Peter’s Basilica. The five-story building containing 106 suites and 22 single rooms is for clergy who are in town on official Holy See business, or perhaps for an Illuminati meeting or two.


Ordo Templi Orientis: Bay Area Thelemic Temple 

OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA Mural of Aleister Crowley at the Abode of Chaos . (Photo: Thierry Ehrmann/CC BY 2.0 ) 
The Order of the Temple of the East was founded between 1895 and 1906 in either Austria or Germany. It is believed wealthy industrialist, Carl Kellner, began the religious movement, but it was famed occultist Aleister Crowley whose name and additions to the group shrouded it in curiosity and mystery.

OTO was modeled somewhat after another secret society, Freemasonry. But Crowley added a layer, his own self-created belief system called Thelema. Thelema’s practices and beliefs are written out in a book titled The Book of Law and its core belief is: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” Ideas from occultism, and Eastern and Western mysticism, found their way into Thelema and thus OTO. The religion is highly secretive and members move through the order in a series of rites and rituals, moving up levels in the forms of initiations. Levels have curious names such as Minerval, Master Magician, Illustrious Knight, Grandmaster of Light, and so on.

There are two components at the core of OTO: magical rituals, which have been rumored to include tantric sex, the summoning of angels and demons, and astral projection. Then there is the gnostic mass, reminiscent of a Catholic mass only because it contains a host and wine toward the end. The gnostic mass includes elaborate costumes, and at the climax of the mass it’s believed that the host turns into the Body of God and the wine the Blood of God.

There are multiple locations of worship called camps, oases, or lodges. The majority of them keep their locations secretive to the greater public. The relatively small location in Oakland is an oasis . They hold a weekly gnostic mass in a temple decorated in candles and Egyptian imagery. It’s unknown exactly what takes place during initiation ceremonies and what knowledge is shared during these events. According to Crowley’s autobiography, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley : “the OTO is in possession of one supreme secret. The whole of its system [is] directed towards communicating to its members, by progressively plain hints, this all-important instruction.”

Priory of Sion: Bibliothèque Nationale de France 
PARIS, FRANCE National Library of France Reading Room. (Photo: Vincent Desjardins/CC BY 2.0 ) 
The secret of this secret society is that many people believe in its existence, but scholarly claims have repetitively stated the group is a complete myth, constructed by the imagination of a madman.

The myth begins that the Priory of Sion was a group charged with protecting the descendants of Jesus of Nazareth and Mary Magdalene who eventually went on to settle in France. It was leaked in the 1970s that the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris, the French National Library, was in possession of a file calledDossiers Secrets d’Henri Lobineau that pointed to the Priory of Sion being located in France. The file contained an introduction, maps of France, genealogies, newspaper clippings, letters and a list of grand masters of the Priory of Sion that included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Leonardo Da Vinci.

The authenticity of these files has been questioned ever since they were left at the library. Eventually, they were traced to Pierre Plantard. It is believed Plantard planted the document at the library in order to perpetuate an elaborate hoax. He himself claimed to be a descendant of Jesus’ bloodline. Academics went on to agree that the Priory of Sion was a hoax constructed by Plantard. Yet, books, articles, and movies continue to be made about this group. Whether or not there is a secret society dedicated to protecting a family descendant from biblical times we may never know.

Rosicrucianism: Rosicrucian Park 
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum grounds. (Photo: Ginabovara/Public Domain ) 
Several manifestos were anonymously published in the early 17th century that told of legends, mysticism, alchemy, and the Order of the Temple of the Rosy Cross. One of these documents was the Fama Fraternitatis which was published in Cassel, Germany.

The Fama spoke of the 15th century German doctor and mystical philosopher Christian Rosenkreuz who traveled through parts of the Middle East where he learned esoteric wisdom, studying in places such as Turkey and Egypt. There, he claimed to learn extensive knowledge regarding nature and the universe. When he returned, he attempted to share what he learned but he was dismissed. He then formed a like-minded group called the Fraternity of the Rose Cross.

The year of his birth and death remain shadowy, but some documents claim he lived over 106 years. The group upheld Christian beliefs, but strongly opposed Roman Catholicism, and was also said to have influenced Freemasonry along with hundreds of other groups, many of which have adopted titles with similar names throughout modern times. At its simplest form, the group aimed to promote a “Universal Reformation of Mankind.” Some reports claim that the requirement for membership was that one must have been capable of using more than the average amount of brain power.

During Rosenkreuz’s life, the group was thought to have only consisted of a handful of members, each of whom was a doctor. All members took an oath to remain bachelors, and also to treat the sick without payment and to find a replacement for themselves before they died. Interest in the group peaked between 1607 and 1616 with the appearances of the anonymous works that included the Fama Fraternitatis which ranged with content that included mysticism and apocalyptic warnings.

Whether Rosenkreuz’s original idea continued is unknown. One of the hundreds of groups claiming to be tied to the original is the Ancient Mystical Order Rosea Crucis that has some connection to occultist Aleister Crowley. AMORC claims to be devoted to the “study of elusive mysteries of life and the universe.” They utilize ideas from major philosophers, including Thales and Pythagoras, healing techniques, alchemy, symbolism, and mysticism. The group claims its history can be traced to pharaoh Thutmose III in 1477. The AMORC headquarters is located at Rosicrucian Park in San Jose, California, which spans a city block and includes several structures. The park is home to elaborate gardens, a research library, a planetarium, a temple, and it houses the ashes of Harvey Spencer Lewis, founder of the secret society.

Grenade blasts from   battles echo through Leblon, the seaside bastion of the city’s elite. Even the governor’s daughter was recently mugged at gunpoint outside her home. When Brazil’s new leader, Michel Temer, took the reins of the nation this month  —   a milestone in the caustic fight to oust President Dilma Rousseff, who faces an impeachment trial  —   he promised a new day of “national salvation. ”  But what Mr. Temer did not mention is that his political party and its allies have wielded immense power here in the   state of Rio de Janeiro for most of the past decade  —   and this place needs a whole lot of saving, too. In other words, critics lament, the same party that created a mess in Rio is now running the country. “Rio is evolving into a   as its leaders find new ways to squander Brazil’s greatest oil bonanza,” said Marcelo Portugal, a Brazilian economist. The state’s finances are a shambles. Some athletes are so disgusted with the City of Rio’s   bay that they want the Olympic sailing races moved. Last month, a stretch of a new $12 million bike path flowing gracefully by the coast  —   one of Rio’s signature upgrades for the Games  —   collapsed after being hit by a wave, causing two men to plummet to their deaths. “This is everything that we did not want happening at this moment,” said Rio’s mayor, Eduardo Paes, a prominent member of Mr. Temer’s party. “It’s not easy to host the Olympics in the current Brazilian environment. ” Rio’s leaders had promised that the Olympics would showcase Brazil’s triumphs. Instead, as Mr. Temer scrambles to put Brazil’s economy on stronger footing, Rio is emerging as a cautionary tale of what a government led by his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party could mean for the rest of the nation. Some of the top leaders in Mr. Temer’s party  —   including the head of the Senate and the former speaker of the lower house of Congress, who was forced to step down this month to face graft charges  —   have been accused of accepting enormous bribes. But their party, known as the P. M. D. B. is also coming under fire over accusations of mismanagement and graft involving the Olympics. Engineering executives have testified that Sergio Cabral, the former governor from the party who helped land the Rio Olympics and still exerts considerable sway, demanded millions in bribes. They say the payments were the equivalent of 5 percent of the cost of the renovation of the landmark Maracanã soccer stadium and other public works projects. Mr. Cabral also came under scrutiny for using the state’s helicopters to transport his children, their two nannies and the family dog on weekend jaunts to a beach house. “Rio’s politicians are absolutely disgusting,” said Leonardo Siqueira, 37, a cosmetics distributor. He cited the collapse of the bike path, graft scandals involving public works projects and streets that flood with sewage during rains. “Rio is in this crisis because of the P. M. D. B.,” Mr. Siqueira said. “They are politicians who govern first and foremost for themselves, not for the citizens. ” In a statement, Mr. Cabral said that he never took bribes and that his security advisers suggested using public helicopters to avoid potential attacks from drug gangs. Under Mr. Cabral, Rio carried out a polarizing “pacification” campaign to police the city aggressively and alter its notorious reputation for crime. But that, too, is coming under strain, with a crime wave marked by muggings throughout the city, an increase in the homicide rate and a terrifying surge in killings of children by stray bullets. In one tragic episode, a    boy in a suburb was fatally shot this month while in his car seat. Then there is Rio’s financial crisis, which is occurring despite the revenue from   oil fields off its coast. The undersea wealth helped turbocharge the regional economy just a few years ago, thanks to legislation giving state and local governments access to a trove of royalties. Now Brazil’s oil industry is in turmoil as Petrobras, the national oil company, reels from bribery scandals and low energy prices. Petrobras, based in a huge Brutalist headquarters downtown, has fired tens of thousands of employees over the past two years, sending a chill across other industries. Rio’s share of oil royalties is plummeting to about $1 billion this year, from $3. 5 billion in 2014. Rio’s leaders say the fiscal crisis has forced them to delay pension payments to retired state employees. The education budget was slashed, prompting teachers to strike and high school students to occupy more than a dozen schools to protest deplorable conditions. Some factors in Rio’s crisis are beyond the state’s control, like global oil prices and the weak national economy. But wings of government have preserved their privileges while services suffer. Judges recently won a ruling requiring the state to pay them before honoring other obligations. At the other end of the social spectrum, leaders are cutting back. A program created five years ago to provide cash subsidies of about $22 a month to about 200, 000 of the state’s poorest residents ran out of money this month. “I feel deceived as a cabinet member and revolted as a citizen,” Paulo Melo, the state official in charge of antipoverty programs, told reporters. He condemned the state government’s “generalized callousness. ” Leaders from the P. M. D. B. a largely centrist but ideologically malleable party that provided a facade of democratic opposition during Brazil’s military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, had vowed to reverse the decline that characterized Rio after the national capital was moved to Brasília in 1960. In 2007, Mr. Cabral took the helm of the state government, which oversees major functions like the police. Altogether, the State of Rio has a population of 16. 5 million, almost the size of Chile. Mr. Cabral, 53, nurtured an alliance with the governing Workers’ Party of Ms. Rousseff, enabling Rio to land the Olympics and secure federal funds for projects like a subway expansion. In 2009, the P. M. D. B. also took control of the City of Rio, which has about 6. 3 million people. The mayor, Mr. Paes, 46, embarked on a frenetic urban overhaul to highlight Rio on the global stage, refurbishing parts of the old center and installing light rail. In the P. M. D. B.’s favor, most venues for the Olympics have been completed, easing concerns about Rio’s preparations for the Games, in August. On a national level, Mr. Temer has named respected economists from outside the party to important posts. And party leaders say they have provided a “moderating force” in Brazil’s tumultuous democracy. “The P. M. D. B. is a pillar of governability,” said Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate. Here in Rio, Mr. Paes emphasizes that the city’s finances are in better shape than the state’s. Still, his administration faces accusations of ineptitude involving some Olympic projects, highlighted by the collapse in April of part of the new coastal bike path. Protesters in Rio, as elsewhere in Brazil, have long complained that their leaders have prioritized lavish   like the Olympics and the World Cup while neglecting essentials like hospitals and schools. It was a central grievance in the protests that shook the nation three years ago. Now, people wonder about Rio’s capacity to solve its problems. Mr. Cabral’s successor, Luiz Fernando de Souza (known by his nickname, Pezão, or Bigfoot) who took office in 2014, also came from the P. M. D. B. As Rio’s problems intensified, Mr. de Souza seemed unusually focused on a painting that hung in his office, “Death of Estácio de Sá,” depicting the agony of the Portuguese military officer who founded Rio in 1565. Complaining about negative energy emanating from the painting, Mr. de Souza called it “really heavy” and had it removed. A few weeks later, Mr. de Souza, 61, revealed that he was battling   lymphoma and went on medical leave. His absence left the lieutenant governor, Francisco Dornelles, in charge. A veteran from the Progressive Party  —   which hews to conservative ideas and is closely allied with the P. M. D. B.  —   Mr. Dornelles, 81, has suggested suspending interest payments on Rio’s debt to ease the state’s woes. “The P. M. D. B. and its allies have simply run Rio into the ground through their mixture of corruption and stunning incompetence,” said Marcelo Freixo, a prominent state legislator. The     leaders of the P. M. D. B. in Rio are now embracing policies commonly found in leftist countries. To raise money, the state’s leaders approved taxes of nearly 20 percent on offshore oil production in Rio’s waters. At a time of low oil prices, opponents say, the measure could destroy Rio’s oil industry. “The tax makes most of the projects in Rio unviable,” said Antonio Guimarães, the director of the Brazilian Association of Oil Producers. Despite the grim assessments, some in Rio draw on the city’s history of resilience. Ruy Castro, 68, an author, told the magazine Veja that Rio had an “unrivaled capacity to frustrate those who root against the city. ” He then added a dash of skepticism. “We’re good at partying,” Mr. Castro said. “Not at legacies. ”",0
18877,"Focused on Singles, Jack Sock Delivers a U.S. Open Upset - The New York Times","Jack Sock was not going to be satisfied anymore with just making the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. In years past, he said, “I was happy to make the third and, you know, kind of whatever happens, happens. ” That nonchalance is perhaps befitting a    but not one who aspires to be a tennis champion. Sock has been a leader of the next generation of American men since winning the United States Open junior championship in 2010. He has been in the top 30 in singles most of the past year, but his greatest success has come in doubles, in which he has won two Grand Slam titles and two medals at the Rio Olympics. This summer, though, Sock decided to stop playing doubles regularly, splitting with his longtime partner Vasek Pospisil, with whom he won Wimbledon two years ago. “It was a tough decision on one end, but also an easy decision on the other, where you get all your energy and rest and hydration and you just take all the necessary steps to do your best in singles,” Sock said. “I think it’s showing. ” Sock claimed the biggest singles victory of his career Friday, upsetting   Marin Cilic,       to advance to the fourth round of the United States Open for the first time. “For me to make the second week here and every Slam going forward is my goal,” said Sock, who is seeded 26th. “I feel like if I’m playing good tennis and how I can, I feel like that’s kind of where I belong. ” Sock’s only other    appearance at a Grand Slam event was at the 2015 French Open, where he lost to Rafael Nadal in four sets. Nadal also advanced to the fourth round on Friday, with a       victory over Andrey Kuznetsov. In the fourth round Sunday, Sock will face     Tsonga, who defeated No. 23 Kevin Anderson,       (4). Cilic, the tournament’s 2014 champion, had won eight straight matches and ended Andy Murray’s   winning streak in the final of the Cincinnati event last week. Sock had beaten Cilic in their previous meeting, in July, overcoming a     deficit in a Davis Cup quarterfinal. Sock said the victory had been “the   of the summer for me. ” The Open has   Caroline Wozniacki’s year. A finalist here two years ago who is now ranked 74th, Wozniacki followed her upset of   Svetlana Kuznetsova with a     victory over Monica Niculescu. “It feels great to be back here,” said Wozniacki, who had not advanced past the third round of a tournament since February. “It feels like my back garden and everything feels so familiar. ” Anastasija Sevastova also backed up her upset of   Garbiñe Muguruza, topping Kateryna Bondarenko,     to reach the fourth round at a major for the first time since 2011. Ryan Harrison, the   American who beat   Milos Raonic on Wednesday, was not able to follow that upset with another victory. He lost,     (4)     to Marcos Baghdatis, who had not advanced to the fourth round of a major since the Australian Open in 2009.   Novak Djokovic is a regular in the round of 16 at majors, but he has never gotten there as easily as he has in this tournament. He has not played a full match since Monday night. Djokovic received a walkover in the second round because his opponent, Jiri Vesely, had a forearm injury. He got another break Friday when his   opponent, Mikhail Youzhny, retired with a left hamstring strain six games into their match. “This particular situation I never had in my Grand Slam career,” Djokovic said after practicing for an hour in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic, who is recovering from a wrist injury, said it was good to have some days off and shorter matches. But spending so little time on court is not ideal either. Djokovic has played only two full matches since winning the Rogers Cup in Toronto at the end of July and has just four and a half sets under his belt at the Open. “As you are approaching second week of the Grand Slam, you want to have match play and you want to have time spent on center court before you face one of the top players,” he said. Djokovic managed to avoid a top player in the next round, too. His opponent will be the Briton Kyle Edmund, ranked 84th in the world, who upended   John Isner,         (5). Edmund, 21, is enjoying the finest Grand Slam tournament of his young career. He had won only two matches in eight Grand Slam singles appearances coming into the Open, but he knocked out   Richard Gasquet in the first round before taking out Isner. Edmund broke Isner three times and piled up 43 winners. “I was pleased with my consistency throughout the match,” Edmund said. “There weren’t too many dips. And to do it on that stage, as well. Good crowd. Big court. Against John in his home country. ” He added, “These are the situations that you want to be in, that you dream about. ” Isner’s loss leaves Sock as the   American man, and Sock can make a run at being the top American in the rankings. Even with his renewed focus on singles, Sock gained something from his Olympic success in doubles: a new celebration dance. At the end of Friday’s match, Sock shuffled his feet and pretended his racket was a fencing foil. It was a nod to a friend he made in Rio, the American fencer Miles   who was at the match. Even in celebration, Sock was not settling for his current form. “If he’s in the box on the next one and I’m able to win,” Sock said, “you might see a   technique and a better version of it. ”",0
18878,FCC Passes Sweeping Internet Privacy Rules in ‘Big Win for Civil Rights’,"FCC Passes Sweeping Internet Privacy Rules in ‘Big Win for Civil Rights’ Posted on Oct 27, 2016 Shutterstock 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday passed sweeping new privacy rules designed to keep broadband providers from giving customers’ private data to third parties. 
The rules, approved by a vote of 3-2, require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to get customers’ explicit consent before using or sharing behavioral data like browsing history, location, and other sensitive information with marketing firms or other companies, the Washington Post reports . 
“It’s the consumers’ information,” FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. “How it is used should be the consumers’ choice. Not the choice of some corporate algorithm.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
According to the Post’s Brian Fung: 
Also covered by that requirement are health data, financial information, Social Security numbers and the content of emails and other digital messages. The measure allows the FCC to impose the opt-in rule on other types of information in the future, but certain types of data, such as a customer’s IP address and device identifier, are not subject to the opt-in requirement. The rules also force service providers to tell consumers clearly what data they collect and why, as well as to take steps to notify customers of data breaches. 
However, the new rules do not require providers to get clear permission before using the data themselves. 
Still, watchdog groups praised the announcement, with the digital rights organization Fight for the Future calling it “a big win for consumers [and] civil rights.” 
Chris Calabrese, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said , “This rule represents a significant step forward in protecting internet users, who have no choice but to expose massive amounts of information to broadband providers. It reflects the reality that where we go online is private and the people we pay to carry it should treat it as private.” 
Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the vote was “a historic win for privacy and free expression and for the vitality of the internet. Just as telephone companies are not allowed to listen in to our calls or sell information about who we talk to, our internet providers shouldn’t be allowed to monitor our internet usage for profit.” 
Still, he noted, “The FCC’s order is not airtight. We can expect the industry to try to exploit every crack in these protections, and hope that the spirit of vigorous oversight and consumer protection that has animated this proceeding will continue.” 
The racial justice group Color Of Change, which advocated for stronger privacy protections as a safeguard against data collection—which disproportionately affects communities of color—also welcomed the announcement. 
“When Color Of Change began their advocacy on behalf of communities of color, the FCC listened, and today ends the era of corporations having unfettered access to our personal data and information, which has been routinely used to take advantage of the vulnerable,” said the organization’s campaign director Brandi Collins. “Third party marketing and advertising entities can no longer shamelessly target and prey upon black people and communities of color. This ruling also takes a strong stance to eliminate schemes that require payment for data to be protected and safeguards our actions online.” 
Dallas Harris, policy fellow at the media democracy group Public Knowledge, said the decision “marks a significant step forward in protecting consumer privacy. For the first time, [ISPs] will be required to get consumer consent prior to using the sensitive information they collect. While much remains to be done to protect consumers online writ large, the commission’s rules establish a baseline level of protection for all.” 
“Thanks to the rules passed by the commission today, consumers now have more control over how their information is used online than ever before. Yet, consumer protection rules are only as strong as their ability to be enforced, so it is imperative that the commission follow these strong rules with strict enforcement,” Harris said. TAGS:",0
18879,"How Omran Daqneesh, 5, Became a Symbol of Aleppo’s Suffering - The New York Times","BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   In the images, he sits alone, a small boy coated with gray dust and encrusted blood. His little feet barely extend beyond his seat. He stares, bewildered, shocked and, above all, weary, as if channeling the mood of Syria. The boy, identified by medical workers as Omran Daqneesh, 5, was pulled from a damaged building after a Syrian government or Russian airstrike in the northern city of Aleppo. He was one of 12 children under the age of 15 treated on Wednesday  —   not a particularly unusual figure  —   at one of the hospitals in the city’s   eastern section, according to doctors there. But some images strike a particular nerve, for reasons both obvious and unknowable, jarring even a public numbed to disaster. Omran’s is one. Within minutes of being posted by witnesses and journalists, a photograph and a video of Omran began rocketing around the world on social media. Unwittingly, Omran  —   like Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler who drowned last September and whose body washed up on a Turkish beach  —   is bringing new attention to the thousands upon thousands of children killed and injured during five years of war and the inability or unwillingness of global powers to stop the carnage. Maybe it was his haircut, long and floppy up top or his rumpled   showing the Nickelodeon cartoon character CatDog or his tentative, confused movements in the video. Or the instant and inescapable question of whether either of his parents was left alive. In any event, by Thursday morning, Omran’s image had been broadcast and published around the world, and Syrians were sharing   of his photograph in memes that both cried for help and darkly mocked the futile repetitiveness of such pleas. One, riffing on Omran’s officelike chair, showed him at a desk as if representing his country to the world. Another pasted him like a silent accusation between President Obama and his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir V. Putin. The drafting of Omran as an emblem of despair is not new images of dead and injured children from Syria are shared daily on social media, many of them indescribably more harrowing. Pieces of children’s bodies being pulled from rubble are photographed with appalling regularity in a war of indiscriminate attacks, most often from government airstrikes and shelling but also from rebel mortars. But while the mind revolts against looking too long at those pictures, and many news media shun them as too gruesome, it may be the relatively familiar look of Omran’s distress that allows a broader public to relate to it. In the case of Alan, the Syrian toddler who washed up on a beach after his family tried to reach Europe on a smuggler’s boat, the child was dead. But his body was intact, lying in the sand as if sleeping, and dressed neatly with evident parental love for his big journey. Omran, as he is carried from a damaged building in the dark, could be Everychild. He looks around in confusion, his chubby forearm draped trustingly across the reflective stripe on his rescuer’s back, before he is plopped into the chair at the back of an ambulance, lit blindingly white. He settles into a   stare, apparently too stunned to cry. Then he puts a hand to his bloody brow, looks at his palm in surprise, and tries to wipe it on the chair. He glances around, as if trying to understand where he is. Omran’s picture and video were distributed by the Aleppo Media Center, a longstanding group of antigovernment activists and citizen journalists who document the conflict. They were also shared with journalists by doctors from the hospital where he was treated, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society. The video shows two more small children brought to the ambulance, and then two adults. They were taken to a hospital already swamped with casualties. Mohammad   a radiology nurse, was in the emergency room when Omran arrived around 9 p. m. with bruises and cuts all over his body. “The boy was traumatized,” Mr. Ahmad said. “He wasn’t speaking when he arrived. A few minutes later, he started crying from pain. ” Mr. Ahmad cleaned Omran’s face and bandaged his head, as images shared by the hospital’s medical staff showed. Doctors said they found no apparent signs of brain injury. In the chaos, the hospital workers, who communicated via online messages, could not immediately say which of the boy’s adult relatives were alive and whether they were with him. That is not unusual, medical workers say, in a city where some dead and injured children cannot even be identified because they are brought in alone. Bombings bring so many patients at once that doctors treat them on the floor, and hospitals and medical workers have been systematically targeted in the war. Later, doctors at the hospital said they had verified that Omran’s parents had survived, though their home had been destroyed. Relatives declined to speak, saying they were afraid of government reprisals. The doctors said the family may have relatives living in   territory. Mahmoud Raslan, who had taken some of the video and photographs of Omran, said in an interview that the boy lived with his mother, father and three siblings, and that they were all injured. Cases like Omran’s are a daily sight in eastern Aleppo, several doctors said, adding that he was lucky in that he made it to a hospital that was still open. Mr. Ahmad, the nurse, said three other children had been hospitalized with Omran, along with a    man who had been stuck under rubble for eight hours. He said that at least three people had died in the strike. “But Omran took all the attention,” he said. Mr. Raslan, the photographer, was surprised that the images of this one boy drew so much news coverage when, he said, he photographs similar events every day. On Thursday morning, journalists from around the world were clamoring in an online chat group for more information about Omran and his family. But the doctors had moved on. They were handling yet another influx from a bombing that morning, later posting new images. A boy lay on the floor, his legs missing. A woman in black put her hand to her mouth in anguish. Another boy lay on a gurney, soaked in blood, as a clinician worked on him. A few minutes later came another text message: The boy had died. His name was Ibrahim Hadiri, and there was a new photograph of his face, eyes closed. It is not likely to go viral.",0

18881,Pre-Natal Care? Planned Parenthood Staff Members Admit Ultrasounds ’Only for Abortions’,"  organization Live Action continues its series of undercover videos investigating Planned Parenthood’s claim that it offers “  care” to pregnant women. [In the video below, Live Action investigators called Planned Parenthood affiliates throughout the country, asking if they could have an ultrasound to check on the health status of their unborn baby:   “Oh, we won’t be able to tell you if it’s healthy or the gender,” says a Planned Parenthood staff member in Farmington, New Mexico. “If you’re, you know  —   we specialize in abortions. You know, that’s what our ultrasounds are for, to see how far along the, um, patient is. ” At Planned Parenthood in St. Paul, Minnesota, a worker states, “We do [ultrasounds] when, um, when performing abor  —   um, abortion procedures. ” In Corning, New York, a Planned Parenthood staff member explains, “No, we only do  —   we only do ultrasounds if you are terminating. ” “We have to do an ultrasound with an abortion, but we don’t offer them for  —   we can’t do anything to make sure that the pregnancy’s fine,” says a Planned Parenthood employee in St. Louis, Missouri. At a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday, Live Action President Lila Rose was joined by U. S. Reps. Diane Black ( ) Vicky Hartzler ( ) Ann Wagner ( ) Trent Franks ( ) Chris Smith ( ) Steve King ( ) and other members of Congress to promote the defunding of Planned Parenthood and the redirection of its taxpayer funds to other federally qualified healthcare centers that provide comprehensive services for women without abortions. “The reality is Planned Parenthood’s focus for pregnant women is abortion,” Rose said at the press conference. “It’s not   care. It’s not serving young mothers, promoting them, supporting them it’s abortion. ” “Women in our country deserve far better than abortion,” she continued. “Far better than to be seen as, ‘You need abortion in order to achieve your dream, in order to live your life, in order to have your career and your family the way you want,’ and we reject that. ” “I can think of no organization in the recent history of the world that has deceived the world more than Planned Parenthood,” said Rep. Franks, noting that the abortion chain’s president, Cecile Richards, has claimed defunding Planned Parenthood would be harmful to women. “Live Action’s investigative video series has completely exploded this ridiculous lie,” he added. “The truth is Planned Parenthood is the largest perpetrator of abortion in America, mercilessly killing some 300, 000 human babies a year. ” “Planned Parenthood is not interested in providing health care to women,” said Rep. Hartzler. “Its exclusive mission and its area of expertise is abortion. If Planned Parenthood’s mission is to serve the health needs of women, they are failing miserably. ” Rep. King said Americans must look hard at the morality of abortion and the fact that “we are borrowing money from China to fund Planned Parenthood. ” “If we fail to [defund Planned Parenthood] during this 115th Congress, shame on us,” he said. The first video of Live Action’s new campaign exposed Planned Parenthood’s marketing of   care in support of its bid for taxpayer dollars. The   group’s investigators were turned away at 92 different facilities, where Planned Parenthood staff said they do not provide   care, but do specialize in abortions.",0
18882,"Pope on Palm Sunday Decries Suffering from War, Terrorism Attacks in Egypt","VATICAN CITY (AP)  —   Pope Francis on Sunday decried a deadly attack on a Coptic church in Egypt during Palm Sunday celebrations, just weeks before his planned visit to Cairo. [The pontiff expressed his “deep condolences” to the Coptic patriarch, Tawadros II, calling him “my brother,” to the Coptic church and “all of the dear Egyptian nation,” and said he was praying for the dead and injured in the attack that occurred just hours earlier as Francis himself was marking Palm Sunday in St. Peter’s Square.  The pontiff asked God “to convert the hearts of those who spread terror, violence and death, and also the hearts of those who make, and traffic in, weapons. ” The pope’s remarks on the church attack were handed to him on a piece of paper after he remembered the victims of the Stockholm attack Friday night. The Palm Sunday celebrations in St. Peter’s Square were held under tight security, with streets surrounding St. Peter’s Square blocked to traffic and security search of the faithful entering the square. The pope and cardinals in red robes led a solemn process clutching elaborately braided palm fronds as they walked through the throngs, followed by the papal blessing of palm fronds and olive branches. The processions recalls the bittersweet nature of Holy Week, with the faithful clutching simple palm fronds and olive branches to commemorate Jesus’ triumphant entrance into Jerusalem only to be followed later by his death on a wooden cross. In his homily, the pope remembered the suffering in the world today, citing those who “suffer from slave labor, from family tragedies, from diseases   …     They suffer from wars and terrorism, from interests that are armed and ready to strike. ” After his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope circled the square in the pope mobile to greet the faithful.",0
18883,"A ‘Stonehenge,’ and a Mystery, in the Amazon - The New York Times","CALÇOENE, Brazil  —   As the foreman for a cattle ranch in the far reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, Lailson Camelo da Silva was razing trees to convert rain forest into pasture when he stumbled across a bizarre arrangement of towering granite blocks. “I had no idea that I was discovering the Amazon’s own Stonehenge,” said Mr. da Silva, 65, on a scorching October day as he gazed at the archaeological site located just north of the Equator. “It makes me wonder: What other secrets about our past are still hidden in Brazil’s jungles?” After conducting radiocarbon testing and carrying out measurements during the winter solstice, scholars in the field of archaeoastronomy determined that an indigenous culture arranged the megaliths into an astronomical observatory about 1, 000 years ago, or five centuries before the European conquest of the Americas began. Their findings, along with other archaeological discoveries in Brazil in recent years  —   including giant land carvings, remains of fortified settlements and even complex road networks  —   are upending earlier views of archaeologists who argued that the Amazon had been relatively untouched by humans except for small, nomadic tribes. Instead, some scholars now assert that the world’s largest tropical rain forest was far less “Edenic” than previously imagined, and that the Amazon supported a population of as many as 10 million people before the epidemics and   slaughter put into motion by European colonizers. In what is now the sparsely populated state of Amapá in northern Brazil, the sun stones found by Mr. da Silva near a stream called the Rego Grande are yielding clues about how indigenous peoples in the Amazon may have been far more sophisticated than assumed by archaeologists in the 20th century. “We’re starting to piece together the puzzle of the Amazon Basin’s human history, and what we’re finding in Amapá is absolutely fascinating,” said Mariana Cabral, an archaeologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, who together with her husband, João Saldanha, also an archaeologist, has studied the Rego Grande site for the last decade. Back in the late 19th century, the Swiss zoologist Emílio Goeldi had spotted megaliths  —   large monumental stones  —   on an expedition through Brazil’s frontier with French Guiana. Other scholars, including the pioneering American archaeologist Betty Meggers, also came across such sites, but argued that the Amazon was inhospitable to complex human settlements. It was not until Mr. da Silva, the former ranch foreman, came across the stones at Rego Grande while deforesting surrounding jungle in the 1990s that scholars focused greater attention on the findings. Mr. da Silva said he first stumbled on the site while hunting wild boar as a teenager in the 1960s, but had subsequently avoided the area. “The place initially felt sacred, like we didn’t belong here,” said Mr. da Silva, who now guards the Rego Grande site as its custodian. “But it was impossible to miss it during the deforestation drive of the ’90s, when the priority was to burn down trees. ” About 10 years ago, after securing public funds to cordon off the stones, Brazilian archaeologists led by Ms. Cabral and Mr. Saldanha began excavating the site, which is shaped roughly like a circle. They soon identified a portion of a river about two miles away where the granite blocks may have been quarried. They also found ceramic burial urns, suggesting that at least part of the Rego Grande site may have been a cemetery, while colleagues from Amapá’s Institute of Scientific and Technological Research discovered that one of the tall stones seemed to be aligned with the sun’s path during the winter solstice. After identifying other points in the site where stones could be associated with the sun’s movement on the solstice, the researchers began piecing together a theory that Rego Grande could have served various ceremonial and astronomical functions connected to agricultural or hunting cycles. Ms. Cabral said that Rego Grande and a series of other less elaborate megalithic sites found in Amapá may have also served as markers for hunters or fishermen on a landscape that was being transformed by Amazonian peoples a millennium ago. Still, other scholars say that more information may be needed about Rego Grande to lift it into the realm of prehistoric places clearly conceived for astronomical observations. “We’ve seen a lot of similar claims, but it takes more than a circle of standing stones to get to a Stonehenge,” said Jarita Holbrook, a scholar of physics and cultural astronomy at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa, citing the need for more findings about Rego Grande’s characteristics and how the site was used by the people who built it. For now, Rego Grande, which local people already call the Amazonian Stonehenge, remains enigmatic. Pottery shards jut through the soil as if offering tantalizing clues around the place, which has the feel of a contemporary conceptual art piece. Researchers are still trying to determine how Rego Grande fits into the evolving views on the Amazon’s human history. Representatives of the Palikur, an indigenous people living in Amapá and French Guiana, have recently stepped forward to say that their ancestors had frequented Rego Grande. Still, archaeologists express caution about establishing such links, emphasizing how much can change in human societies over the span of a thousand years. Ms. Cabral, the archaeologist who has spent years studying Rego Grande, said that evidence of large settlements remains elusive, in contrast with other sites in the Amazon like Kuhikugu, at the headwaters of the Xingu River, where researchers have drawn parallels to the legends surrounding the mythical Lost City of Z, long an irresistible lure for explorers and adventurers. Either way, John McKim Malville, a solar physicist at the University of Colorado who writes extensively on archaeoastronomy, emphasized how the field is moving away from focusing exclusively on astronomical functions to interpretations that are more holistic, by including the ceremonies and rituals of ancient cultures. In that sense, the site in Calçoene offers a beguiling if cryptic glimpse into Amazonia’s past. “The stones of Rego Grande are quite extraordinary and in their irregularity may have their own unique meaning, different from other megalithic sites around the world,” Mr. Malville said, raising the possibility that Rego Grande reflects the importance in Amazonian cultures of animism, the attribution of a soul to entities in nature and even inanimate objects. He added, “We can only speculate what its stones mean. ”",0

18885,Washington Transit Officer Is Charged With Helping ISIS - The New York Times,"A police officer with the Washington transit system has become the first American law enforcement officer to be charged with supporting the Islamic State, accused of trying to send financial help to the group after advising a friend on how to travel to Syria to join it. In court papers filed on Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, federal law enforcement officials charged the officer, Nicholas Young, with attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization. The charge is based on the allegation that Mr. Young bought gift cards worth $245 and sent their code numbers to someone he believed had joined ISIS in Syria, to help the group pay for mobile phone messaging with its supporters in the West. The documents state that agents had been shadowing Mr. Young for almost six years, that he went to Libya twice in 2011 to aid a rebel group fighting Muammar   and that he had associated with two people convicted in 2012 on terrorism charges: Amine El Khalifi, who pleaded guilty to plotting a suicide bombing at the United States Capitol and Zachary A. Chesser, who admitted to trying to join the Shabab, a   Islamist terror group, and to threatening violence against the creators of the television show “South Park. ” Mr. Young, a United States citizen who lives in Fairfax, Va. joined the Washington Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s police force in 2003. The authority, which said he was dismissed after his arrest on Wednesday, would not say where he was assigned or what kind of work he did. An undercover law enforcement officer who befriended and monitored him in 2011 and 2012 reported that Mr. Young had spoken of committing violence against the F. B. I. including using gasoline to set agents’ cars on fire and kidnapping and torturing an agent who had interviewed his family members and   according to an affidavit by an F. B. I. agent, David Martinez. The affidavit says that Mr. Young knew he was probably under surveillance and that he took steps to evade it, like using disposable phones. But it said he did talk to the undercover officer about sneaking weapons into a federal courthouse, and stockpiling weapons. Mr. Young came under F. B. I. scrutiny in 2010 because of his acquaintance with Mr. Chesser, and then he and the undercover officer met several times in 2011 with Mr. Khalifi and discussed violent jihad, the affidavit says. In 2014, an F. B. I. informant posing as an American military veteran who supported ISIS met 20 times with Mr. Young, Agent Martinez wrote. Mr. Young advised him on how to set up anonymous email and text messaging accounts, how to travel to Syria to join ISIS without being caught, and even what gear he should take, the agent said. Mr. Young believed the other man went to Syria and kept in touch with him electronically, but in fact, he was communicating with F. B. I. agents posing as his friend, according to the affidavit. When Mr. Young asked how he could send money to ISIS without being detected, the agents requested the gift cards, and he bought them and sent the serial numbers last week, it says.",0
18886,Sufism in the Service of Empire: the Case of the Maryamiyyah,"The Greatest Name shall do its things, O heart, be of good cheer For by wile and guile the demon shall never become Solomon. 
~ Hafiz 
In 2014, a former, estranged disciple of Seyyed Hossein Nasr’s — an ex-Maryamiyyah member — told me that Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Russian fascist Alexander Dugin and his organization are on quite intimate terms, apparently sharing similar long-term political aspirations, and not just where their purported Traditionalism is concerned. At the time this revelation struck me as a bit odd since Nasr (and specifically his son Vali-Reza) are staunch Atlanticists –- Vali-Reza Nasr being the veritable prized subaltern ornament of Neoconservatism in America — whereas Dugin and his Eurasianism ostensibly (at least where the rhetoric is concerned) stand at the very opposite pole. The complex details of this Nasr-Dugin nexus is a discussion better left for another day, only to say that –- and as recently outlined in one academic monograph [1] — this unlikely fellowship may actually have something to do with Frithjof Schuon’s (d. 1998) underlying ideological “Aryanism” with its “de-semitization” of the theosophical Sufism of Ibn ‘Arabi: an ‘Aryanism’ and ‘de-semitization’ that Dugin’s brand of occult fascism would very much be in agreement with. But let us turn here to the checkered history of the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order itself, which Seyyed Hossein Nasr currently heads [2]. 
The Maryamiyyah Sufi Order 
The Maryamiyyah is the Sufi order created by the Swiss writer and esotericist Frithjof Schuon (d. 1998) which stems from an Algerian sub-branch of the Shadhiliyah Sufi Order [3]. After briefly visiting North Africa in the early 1930s to meet the charismatic Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi (d. 1934) [4], from the mid 1930s onward Schuon attracted disciples of his own in his native Switzerland while as of 1936 he also began claiming to be the successor to this same Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi. The actual successors of Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi, however, have adamantly denied Schuon’s claims and instead maintain that Schuon only spent a sum total of a few days with their master in the early 1930s; that he was barely even initiated into their order, only authorized to transmit the Muslim confession of belief (i.e. the shahada ); let alone being the Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi’s actual successor. This, and other related controversies, soon led to a bitter schism within the ranks of the Traditionalist school and specifically a personal falling out between Frithjof Schuon and the leading intellectual light of the movement, the Frenchman Rene Guénon (d. 1951). One recent study published in Iran suggests that Guénon’s premature death in Cairo in 1951 may have even been somehow orchestrated by the Maryamiyyah itself, thus making of Guénon’s demise possibly a murder at their hands since, had he lived longer, Guénon’s rivalry with Schuon would have certainly proven deleterious to Schuon and the Maryamiyyah’s long-term political interests [5]. 
Particularly after Rene Guénon’s death, Frithjof Schuon’s Maryamiyyah Sufi Order (based at the time in Basle, Switzerland and now operating almost like a quasi-Masonic order) began spreading among some elite Western intellectual circles, claiming in its ranks some notable figures among the academic Islamic Studies as well as the Comparative Religious Studies establishments of the time (eg. Huston Smith, Victor Danner, Cyril Glasse, to name few). During the 1960s Schuon now claimed mystical visions of the “Divine Feminine” in the naked form of the Virgin Mary who anointed him the Avatar of the Age, the Imam Mahdi, the Return of Christ, the Fifth Buddha, the incarnations of Kalki and Vishnu, etc. Within its specific Islamicate context, Schuon’s claims, his ‘universalist’ teachings, and some of the details of his visions of the divine feminine are eerily similar to those claimed by the Baha’i founder Mirza Husayn ‘Ali Nuri Baha’u’llah (d. 1892), with other striking similarities existing between Bahaism and the Maryamiyyah that deserves a detailed comparative analysis in its own right. Today both also enjoy a very cozy relationship with the state of Israel — with the former also sharing a cozy relationship with the Gulf potentates as well as the Moroccan elite. 
One feature of the Maryamiyyah practice which they are noted for is that they pray to Schuon as well as the Virgin Mary; and, along with offering blessings ( salawat ) to the Prophet Muhammad and the Madonna, the order also offers daily blessings ( salawat ) to Frithjof Schuon –- a feature of their practice which would certainly scandalize any orthodox Muslim, Sunni or Shi’i. Much of the Maryamiyyah’s teachings and practices also seem to share common elements with the Indian Tantric Left-Hand Path tradition. Schuon’s ‘sacred nudity’ and his spin on the nature of the ‘divine feminine’ would be easily recognizable to any genuine Tantric initiate. Be that as it may, and even under the mountains of obfuscatory terminological mumbo-jumbo that the Maryamiyyah regularly use to conceal the fact, the Left-Hand Path is never mentioned nor is it remotely the ‘orthodoxy’ that Schuon insists upon in his books; but rather it is the very same ‘heterodoxy’ he incessantly decries. To date, the Maryamiyyah have never forthrightly acknowledged this fact or dealt with it in any honest manner. 
That said, in 1980 Schuon, his family, entourage and disciples moved from Switzerland to Bloomington, Indiana, and henceforth made it the Maryamiyyah’s headquarters. A series of scandals and public defections rocked the cult throughout the 1980s, and in the early 1990s Schuon was even briefly indicted by an Indiana Grand Jury. These scandals stemmed from Schuon’s “Primordial Gatherings” in Bloomington were scantily clad members of the Maryamiyyah –- with Schuon sometimes appearing completely naked donning only a Native American Lakota head-dress — would publicly engage in activities resembling something between a Native American pow-wow, a Sufi majlis and a Tantric maithuna ceremony. However, the scandals were very swiftly covered up and the public prosecutors and attorneys involved against the Maryamiyyah were eventually intimidated and browbeaten by unknown, behind the scenes actors to drop the case against Schuon: a case, I might add, involving allegations by ex-members of criminal sexual impropriety in the presence of minors (including paedophilia and related felonies). Schuon was also accused of forcing some of his leading disciples to divorce their wives, which he would then promptly re-marry as his “vertical” or ‘spiritual’ wives [6]. 
Schuon died in 1998 and left a splintered, scandal-ridden organization in his wake with one group gravitating towards the figure of Martin Lings (d. 2005) in the UK — who had served as Guénon’s secretary in Cairo while also being among Schuon’s earliest disciples — with another group congregating around the figure of Seyyed Hossein Nasr in the Beltway area of the United States. More diehard Schuonites stayed in Bloomington, Indiana, and refused to recognize either Lings or Nasr as Schuon’s putative successors and continued with their syncretistic, nudist “Primordial Gatherings” as before. 
The Maryamiyyah After Schuon and Its Marriage to Empire 
Both Nasr and Lings brought the Maryamiyyah closer to the circles of Western elites. To some degree this was already a process in full swing during Schuon’s own lifetime. But Nasr and Lings each in turn made closer alliances with the British establishment and the American deep state, going so far on occasion to operate in the capacity of covert and clandestine fronts for Anglo-American ‘soft power’ in numerous locales throughout the Muslim world [7]. Seyyed Hossein Nasr himself was already a royalist insider in Pahlavi Iran, especially during the last two decades and a half of the Pahlavi regime, earning his post at Aryamehr (now Shahid Beheshti) University due to his intimate connections with the Shah’s royal court and Farah Pahlavi specifically. It was as a consequence of this royalist connection that he was forced to flee Iran in 1979 following the Islamic Revolution. 
That said, while not formally accounting himself among the ranks of the Maryamiyyah, Prince Charles, for example, considers himself to be some kind of (soft) Traditionalist as well as an avid fan of the writings of Guénon, A.K. Coomaraswamy, Schuon, Nasr and other Traditionalists. It should also be pointed out that the presence of Schuonian Traditionalists among assorted reactionary monarchist groups and organizations is a regular feature of their activities virtually everywhere around the world. This would also explain their proximity to the Moroccan royalty and elite. What is not widely appreciated is their alleged closeness to the various potentates and elites in the Gulf kingdoms (who are not usually known for their love of Sufism), and particularly those in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Due to his skills and vast connections, some ex-Maryamiyyah members even contend that Martin Lings himself may have been a life-long operative of the British SIS/MI6 [8]. Then there is Seyyed Hossein Nar’s long-time association and friendship with Henry Kissinger; the fact that prominent Turkish Maryamiyyah member Ibrahim Kalin has served as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s official spokesman in Turkey for some years now; not to mention the proximity of the Maryamiyyah to the Jordanian royal family and Prince Ghazi specifically who publishes “The Muslim 500” which regularly lauds the policies of the corrupt Gulf kingdoms and celebrates Anglo-American and Israeli policy against Iran and Syria [9]. Certainly the Russian occult fascist Alexander Dugin knows all about these linkages yet continues in his association with Nasr and the Maryamiyyah, which defies conventional explanation when he, his organization and the Russian state that Dugin advises pretend to stand as geopolitical adversaries to everything Nasr, his Maryamiyyah Sufi Order and these Atlanticist connections represent. 
On the ground in North America, the Maryamiyyah’s rank-and-file is predominantly composed of upper middle-class professionals (monied and college educated) with white upper middle-class converts being the most preferred among recruits. Liberal, left-leaning and anti-establishment members entering the order are often required to become apolitical and focus instead on the “inner life” and forgo all politics, but over time they are turned conservative (or, rather, reactionary) and instead made to support the establishment conservatism of the Republican Party. One former member has alleged that Seyyed Hossein Nasr was actively canvassing for George W. Bush among his acolytes during both the elections of 2000 and 2004 and for John McCain in 2008, proving that father and son share identical political views and that the proverbial apple does not fall far from the tree. Be that as it may, so much for the ‘Traditionalism’ that ostensibly seeks to shun the convoluted and corrupt materialist politics of the ‘Reign of Quantity’, especially the politics of the West which Traditionalists are supposed to believe represents the epitome of this ‘Reign of Quantity’ – or, as they elsewhere like calling it, “the system of the Antichrist.” The same contact also reported rampant classism, racism and similar discriminatory, elitist attitudes prevalent throughout the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order together with an almost “congenital hatred” for all forms of liberal/leftwing and social justice causes, issues and charities [10]. To deflect and smokescreen from his own role in the Pahlavi regime, Seyyed Hossein Nasr has even gone on public record recently besmirching the memory of Ali Shariati (d. 1977) and accusing him of having been a SAVAK mole [11]; this, while some former members have alleged that the FBI, DHS, NSA, CIA and other agencies of American law enforcement and the US deep state are crawling all over the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order as either full-fledged members, affiliates or sympathizers [12]. 
As a process that began under Schuon, the Maryamiyyah has also firmly entrenched itself within important segments of the Islamic/Mid East Studies establishment of the Western Ivory Tower as well as in parts of the Muslim world, strategically placing proverbial ‘gatekeepers’ in key places. Besides Seyyed Hossein Nasr himself, William Chittick, Terry Moore, Hasan Awan, Reza-Shah Kazemi and Alan Godlas are presently just a few of those names associated with the Maryamiyyah at its highest level [13]. The Iranian scholar Gholamreza Avani, who was also at one time a student of Henry Corbin’s — who, for his part, was either generally aloof, if not hostile, to the views of Guénon, Schuon and the Traditionalists — is the most eminent figure of the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order in Iran today. 
In recent times, allegations of abuse and cult-like behaviour continue to bedevil the Maryamiyyah’s reputation. A noteworthy incident is the one cited by Koslow (and reiterated by Shahbazi in his book) regarding the initial publication schedule for Mark Sedgwick’s ‘ Against the Modern World ’ [14]. Apparently the book was supposed to have been published by Oxford University Press earlier than 2004. Koslow claims that Sedgwick wrote to him in 2004 to say that Oxford University Press had been “…threatened by the Schuon cult with legal harassment [regarding its initial publication draft]. Rather than face the mafioso tactics thrown at him by the Schuon cult, Sedgwick…backed down and published a rather weak assessment of Schuon’s polygamous activities, criminal actions, visions of nude Virgins and delusions of grandeur…” [15] 
Withal, it should be underscored that Sufism has not always been (nor is it in all present circumstances) in the service of First World imperial, neo-colonial agendas. Historically many individual Sufis and Sufi orders have actually stood against Western imperialism, colonialism and their lackeys. Amir Abd al-Qadir Jaza’iri (d. 1883) in Algeria, Shamil Daghestani (d. 1859) in the Caucuses, Umar Mukhtar (d. 1931) in Libya and those Iranian Sufi masters with their disciples who stood on the side of the people during the period of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (1905-09) and later with the Islamic Revolution of 1979 are just some prominent examples of Sufis who have stood against both authoritarianism as well as the colonial powers of their day. 
Unfortunately Western (and specifically Anglo-American) Sufism has increasingly gone in another direction, allying itself more and more with the agendas of Western establishments and the core interests of Empire in the Muslim world (the Naqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order is another notable example here). This turn to the darkside by organized Sufism in the West may also explain one of the heretofore unnoted factors in the growth of Islamist ideologies and organizations among countless disaffected, marginalized (immigrant) Sunni Muslim communities, since such a blatant infiltration of Sufism by the Western establishment, with the inevitable corruption it brings with it, is unquestionably as big a betrayal of the ‘Tradition’ as Islamism itself is. It certainly also explains why a country like the Islamic Republic of Iran is generally weary of the influence and activities of such organizations as the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order and similar.

18888,"Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador, Dies at 64 - The New York Times","UNITED NATIONS  —   Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, who represented his country through times of domestic tumult and rising tensions with the West, died on Monday morning while at work in Manhattan. He would have turned 65 on Tuesday. The Russian government said he died suddenly but did not specify a cause. The New York City police said there were no indications of foul play. “The outstanding Russian diplomat died in harness,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on Twitter. The United Nations observed a moment of silence on Monday. His death comes at a critical juncture in   relations, amid allegations of Russian interference in the United States presidential election and President Trump’s praise for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated in recent years, and diplomats have been watching whether the dynamics will change under the Trump administration with the appointment of Nikki R. Haley to be the American United Nations envoy. This month, she condemned what she called Russia’s “aggressive” actions in Ukraine. Mr. Churkin, on the same day, lauded her track record in politics. She was governor of South Carolina when Mr. Trump appointed her. “I never underestimate my colleagues,” Mr. Churkin told reporters before posting on Twitter a picture of their first private meeting. Mr. Churkin had been unusually absent during several Security Council meetings recently, but this month he brushed off reporters’ questions about his health. The deputy Russian ambassador, Petr Iliichev, said in brief remarks at a United Nations meeting on Monday that Mr. Churkin had been in the office “until the final moments. ” A Fire Department official said a 911 call had reported a cardiac arrest at the Russian mission on East 67th Street in Manhattan. Police officers from the 19th Precinct station house, across the street, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The medical examiner’s office said an autopsy would be conducted on Tuesday. A police official said Mr. Churkin had a history of medical problems, including leukemia and heart ailments. He had kept them private among his diplomatic colleagues. Mr. Churkin, a former child actor who had starred in three films, two of them biopics about Lenin, was widely considered a masterly diplomat. He could be caustic and wry in equal measure, especially in exchanges with his American counterparts. Once, after Samantha Power, a United Nations ambassador in the Obama administration, scolded him for Russia’s actions in Aleppo, Syria  —   “Are you truly incapable of shame?” she said  —   he accused her of acting like Mother Teresa. Mr. Churkin had been trained as a translator, and as an ambassador, he sometimes became visibly annoyed with United Nations interpreters who could not keep up with his    speaking style. Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin was born in Moscow on Feb. 21, 1952. He held a Ph. D. in history and was a graduate of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He began his career in the Soviet era and quickly rose through his country’s diplomatic corps as the Soviet Union was opening up under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He was a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry from 1990 to 1992, represented his country in peace talks in the former Yugoslavia, and became ambassador to Belgium and Canada before taking on the United Nations post in 2006. He was a forceful defender of the Kremlin under the leadership of Mr. Putin, who issued a statement of condolence on Monday. But Mr. Churkin was not always comfortable with Mr. Putin’s actions, some diplomats said privately. Tom Brokaw of NBC News, who had known Mr. Churkin for many years, recalled that at a lunch at his home in 2015, the ambassador described Mr. Putin’s administration as “a kleptocracy. ” “He was privately very critical of Putin and how he was running the country,” Mr. Brokaw said on Monday. “He was equally critical of the Obama administration. He said: ‘They just don’t get us. They’re not dealing with us the right way. ’” Russia’s relations with the United States soured during Mr. Churkin’s tenure at the United Nations, first over Libya and then over crises in Syria and Ukraine. In an interview in October, he said that   relations had not been so strained since the   conflict nearly brought the two Cold War powers to a military confrontation four decades ago. He was a staunch defender of the Syrian government of Bashar  . He used Russia’s veto at the Security Council to block six resolutions that would have punished the Assad government, including one aimed at referring its actions to the International Criminal Court. He repeatedly questioned all evidence that appeared to point to Syrian or Russian government crimes in Syria and met every Western criticism of Russia’s conduct there with retorts about the West’s role in Yemen and elsewhere. He picked apart every word of every draft resolution to ensure that it satisfied Russian interests. But he could also surprise his fellow diplomats. Last December, he negotiated with his French and American colleagues for three hours in a closed room on the wording of a draft resolution to send United Nations monitors to oversee evacuations from Aleppo. It was the first time in months that the Security Council had reached a consensus on Syria. Mr. Churkin is survived by his wife, Irina Churkina a son, Maksim and a daughter, Anastasia. News of Mr. Churkin’s sudden death sent a shock through the diplomatic community, where he was widely seen as a deft diplomat, skilled at using the rules and protocols of the United Nations to his country’s advantage, including Russia’s veto in the Security Council. Ms. Power, who sparred with him regularly in the Council chambers, said on Twitter that she was “devastated” by the news of Mr. Churkin’s death. “Diplomatic maestro  deeply caring man who did all he cld to bridge   differences,” she wrote. The two were friendly enough that she once took him to see the musical “Hamilton. ” Mr. Churkin recalled that her husband, the legal scholar Cass Sunstein, had sat next to him in the theater and schooled him on the United States Constitution. A previous American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, called Mr. Churkin “highly effective and very funny. ” Mr. Churkin had been the   ambassador on the United Nations Security Council, and he sometimes jokingly referred to himself as the “permanent representative,” the formal title for each member nation’s top envoy to the United Nations.",0
18889,"BREAKING – Obama Betrays America in MASSIVE Move Before He Leaves Office, Media is Silent | EndingFed News Network","Email Print President Obama has proven he is nothing but a vindictive man who is upset like the rest of the liberals that the person he was lobbying for didn’t win the 2016 election. But you’d never guess what he did with hit time in the Oval Office running out. President Obama has shut down the aerial surveillance over the U.S./ Mexican border with only two months left in his presidency. He’s trying to make it difficult for President-Elect Donald Trump, as per Watchdog.org The Department of Homeland Security can no longer do its job, and it is not securing the southern border with even the limited measures it has at its disposal right now! This is a move to help illegal immigrants come into this country, with Obama making it less difficult for them to break the law! They won’t be seen, and, thus, they won’t be caught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security shut down Operation Phalanx, the aerial program that helps halt the movement of drugs and illegals across the border. This DHS move is challenged by Rep. Henry Cuellar, who claims that Congress gave this operation funding for the whole year of 2017. Cuellar, who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the Homeland Security Subcommittee, is composing a letter to send to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson about the shutdown. And this is not the first time Johnson has been challenged. With the help of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Cuellar went against Johnson earlier in the year in February when the Phalanx’s flight operations were reduced. Now, Cuellar is looking for reinforcements in Texas including Sen. John Cornyn and Reps. Mike McCaul and John Carter. McCaul has previously called on DHS to “develop a strategy to gain operational control” of the border. “Over the last several years, Congress has provided billions of dollars to secure the borders but without an end goal in mind,” McCaul stated. McCaul has also worked to make legislation “to require the [DHS] secretary to gain situational awareness through the use of sophisticated technologies and others means, giving our border agents the ability to predict changes in illegal activity.” The DHS claims the illegals coming into the U.S. have declined at the Texas stretch of the border, but apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley rose 27 percent in the fiscal 2016 year alone. In the small Laredo border section, Operation Phalanx accounted for 10,559 apprehensions and 4,007 “turnbacks” from March 2012 to December 2015. Phalanx was credited with seizing 12,851 pounds of narcotics during the period. The fact that Obama would do away with that just because Donald Trump won says a lot about what kind of man our outgoing president is. He would let more criminals and drugs come into this country just to make it harder to control for Trump, but Obama is not hurting Trump—he’s hurting the American people. And that’s disgraceful. With Trump in office in January, however, Phalanx will be up and running once more… and Obama can’t do anything to stop it. What do you think of Obama’s move to shut down aerial surveillance of our southern border? Please share this story on Facebook and tell us what you think because we want to hear YOUR voice!

18890,Video: Horsemen Ride into Texas Walmart,"HOUSTON, Texas  —   A video shot by a Houston man while riding his blonde horse in a Walmart store is going viral. The video, posted to Facebook on Sunday, received nearly 2 million views. At least two mounted horses are shown coming from inside the store. [Woody Fields posted his video stating he was in “Walmart on a horse grocery shopping. ” The   video shows him riding his horse up and down the aisles of the store while people looked at him with shocked expressions.  (function( d, s, id)  (document, ’script  ’))   Walmart on a horse grocery shopping, Posted by Woody Fields on Sunday, March 19, 2017, Since posting the video Sunday, Facebook users viewed the trail ride 1, 735, 903 times as of this publication. Users shared the post nearly 32, 000 times, and 8, 400 people commented on the horse adventure. Following the short tour through the store, Fields exits the store through the front door and joins a fellow rider waiting outside. A short time later, a second mounted Walmart shopper can be seen exiting the same door. It is not known if the rider waiting outside had also ventured through the store with his horse. Several small children could be seen in proximity to Fields and his horse as they rode through the store. No groceries or other items were purchased, despite his claim of “grocery shopping. ” Fields made a second post that appeared to mock the store’s greeter as he entered the building. “We were just riding, and a buddy of mines was, like, ‘Let’s go to Walmart,’ and I was, like, ‘Man, I’m not going to Walmart,’ Fields told Click2Houston. “He was, like, ‘Come on, let’s go! ’” “I wasn’t trying to hurt nobody, or do anything destructive. It was just, like, you only live once, you know? That’s all,” Fields said. KTRK ABC13 reported one of the horses relieve itself inside the store. They did not say if Fields and his companion offered to clean up the mess. Walmart officials did not appear pleased as they responded, “We in no way condone yesterday’s reckless stunt inside our store and are thankful no one was hurt by these actions. ” The Houston Humane Society also appeared to not approve of the behavior. The group posted this statement: At minimum, riding a horse inside a store is incredibly irresponsible. This would be extremely stressful on any horse. Horses can easily become spooked, endangering not only themselves, but also any shoppers they might encounter. The Houston Humane Society urges all pet owners to think and act responsibly when it comes to the lives of animals in their care. Houston is currently in the middle of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. It is not known if Fields and his companion were riding in connection to this or if they were simply out having fun during the   conditions on the last official day of winter. He posted a group of photos showing his horse buddies riding in other areas of Houston, including the Galleria area. It appears everyone was having a good time and many children were able to experience the horses first hand.

18892,More Bark than Bite in Trump’s Canadian Lumber Tariff - Breitbart,"When the Trump administration announced Monday that it would impose new tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber imports, it elicited protests from Canadian officials, American   and  . [“We will be putting a very big tariff on the lumber coming into the country,” President Donald Trump said.  Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland warned that the move would hurt U. S. families by raising the price of materials needed to build new homes. “You need our lumber. You need our lumber to build your homes,” Freeland said in an interview on CNBC. Beyond the headlines, however, there are signs that there may be less to the new tariffs than meets the eye. For one thing, lumber prices actually declined after the tariffs were announced. Lumber futures fell on Tuesday by the $10 exchange limit in Chicago, a 2. 5 percent drop. The prices of Canadian lumber companies rose, some sharply. Shares of Canfor Corp were up by 8. 09 percent on Tuesday and West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. rose by 2. 37 percent. As it turns out, the 20 percent tariff was smaller than what the market expected. The Trump administration has actually adopted a gentler policy on Canadian lumber than analysts and investors had forecast. It’s unlikely that the 20 percent tariff will have much of an effect on home prices, despite the protests of home buyers. Lumber prices make up a small fraction of the prices of new homes. And with the tariff coming in lower than expected and lumber prices falling, it’s just as likely that the announcement could slow rising home prices. The lumber tariff is best understood as a symbolic gesture by the Trump Administration aimed at underlining its America First stance. The intended audience are trading partners in Europe, Japan, and Mexico. Taking a stand on Canadian lumber is a way of sending the message without seriously impeding larger trade flows. Canada is the model target for such symbolism because it’s unlikely to retaliate against the U. S. for the sanctions, and penalizing Canada doesn’t risk mixing in messier concerns over race, national security or immigration. During a briefing on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross praised Canada as “a good neighbor” and played down the possibility that this was the beginning of a larger trade war. The Trump administration also hoped the move would be welcomed by economic nationalists, first announcing the tariffs at a meeting with conservative journalists on Monday night. Many of Trump’s economic nationalist supporters have become increasingly concerned that the administration may be backing away from America First trade stance that was central to its electoral victory in November. The decision not to designate China as a currency manipulator, for example, has raised fears that trade reforms could take a back seat to other administration priorities.",0
18893,"U.S. Economy, Showing Resilience, Added 156,000 Jobs Last Month - The New York Times","Amid a presidential campaign marked by fears about the country’s economic future, the American jobs machine keeps chugging. Employers added 156, 000 positions in September, the Labor Department said on Friday, enough to accommodate new entrants to the labor force and entice back workers who dropped out after the Great Recession. The unemployment rate, which had been stuck at 4. 9 percent since spring, ticked up slightly to 5 percent, but that was mostly because more people were drawn into the labor force by evidence that hiring is still going strong. For all the anxiety at home and turmoil abroad, like the vote in Britain to withdraw from the European Union, the current expansion shows little prospect of ending abruptly. Average hourly earnings rose by 0. 2 percentage point last month, bringing the wage gain over the last 12 months to 2. 6 percent, well above the pace of inflation. The typical workweek also grew slightly in September, after a pullback in August. “It was solid, not spectacular,” said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. “The good news is that participation went up, even though the unemployment rate did, too. Regaining that ground is very important. ” Before the report was released, economists on Wall Street looked for the economy to add 172, 000 jobs in September. Revisions for July and August showed that 7, 000 fewer jobs were created in those months than the Labor Department first estimated. Given the latest figures, the Federal Reserve is still expected to delay raising interest rates until late this year, and there was little in the report to suggest that the job gains might lead to significantly higher inflation. “There are still plenty of unemployed people out there, enough for employers to continue to hire at a substantial pace,” said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. “The expansion will end before you run out of labor,” added Mr. Gapen, who estimates that the unemployment rate could drop to 4 percent by the end of 2017. The overall participation rate inched up to 62. 9 percent, above the low point of 62. 4 percent last September, but well below the most recent peak of 66. 4 percent in early 2007. With many   workers still available to be hired  —   what economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserve blandly term “labor market slack”  —   the current pace of hiring should be able to continue with little threat of overheating the economy. Moreover, the labor force itself jumped by nearly half a million, a bright spot in an otherwise steady picture of the economy. The nation has added an average of 178, 000 jobs a month this year, less robust than the average monthly gain of 229, 000 in 2015 but still a healthy reading given the longevity of the recovery and the slowdown in population growth among adults of working age. Mr. Gapen attributed most of September’s dip in job creation, which was below the consensus forecast and the annual average, to an unexpected 11, 000 drop in government payrolls. The public sector added more than 50, 000 positions in July and August, and Mr. Gapen said the private sector’s relative strength was what counted, not a slowdown in government hiring. “It’s not a negative signal,” he said. “We see the miss as mainly a   government issue. ” Despite the robust hiring in the last couple of years, tens of millions of workers have barely felt the benefits of the recovery, and notable pockets of economic weakness remain more than seven years after it began. Those two contrasting realities  —   healthy hiring and falling unemployment on the one hand, millions of economically sidelined Americans on the other  —   sustain the narrative of the two main presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. Both candidates’ critiques of the economy contain kernels of truth. Friday’s report, while generally strong, contained fodder for both. The jump in participation, and healthy gains in   professional services fields, bolster Mrs. Clinton’s case that the economy is growing steadily and creating   jobs. The drop in manufacturing jobs by 13, 000 will underscore fears among   voters that their livelihoods are imperiled, a main factor in Mr. Trump’s appeal. In addition to strong gains in services, the closely watched construction industry added 23, 000 jobs. The housing market has been booming in many parts of the country, and like manufacturing, construction remains an important source of   jobs for workers with just high school diplomas. “I’m heartened to see that we have an unmistakable trend toward   jobs,” said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. “I know there’s a doom and gloom caucus out there, but they’re on a collision course with the facts. ” Another encouraging development was a slowdown in the huge round of job cuts in the mining and logging industries prompted by falling prices for oil and other commodities. After falling for 23 consecutive months, with 223, 000 jobs slashed during that time, employment in the sector was flat last month. “Instead of declining, jobs may start coming back to the sector,” Ms. Swonk said, noting that the recent rebound in oil prices may spur new investment in exploration and drilling after a   drought. Although Wall Street watches every jobs report, this one drew less attention because the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise rates until December at the earliest. The Fed will meet in November, but it is not expected to raise rates so close to the election. Moreover, waiting until December to decide whether to tighten monetary policy would allow policy makers to consider the October and November jobs reports. Mr. Gapen said December remained the most likely target for the Fed’s next interest rate increase, but he added that it was hardly certain. “We think there’s a 60 percent chance the Fed will act, or slightly better than even,” he said. “There is a little something for everyone in this report from a   perspective. ” The 2. 6 percent increase in wages in the last 12 months is better than the 2. 3 percent annual increase in 2015, but it is still less than many   workers would hope to see at this point in the recovery. Still, there are plenty of signs the tighter labor market is finally paying off and producing raises, for workers at both the bottom and the top of the pay scale. This trend may also indicate that minimum wage increases in many states are beginning to filter through the broader economy. As the more modest gain in payrolls for September suggests, some big employers have slowed the pace of recruiting slightly, but they continue to add to payrolls. Ernst  Young, the giant accounting and consulting firm, plans to hire 15, 200 people in the United States in the 2017 fiscal year, which began July 1. In the 2016 fiscal year, Ernst  Young hired 16, 375 people, said Dan Black, Ernst  Young Americas recruiting leader. “It’s not a     moment,” he said. “It’s more of a    scenario. ”",0

“Indications that Clinton is heading towards a solid win” might suggest that 2016 is “the safest year ever to vote Green, right?” No, say Democrats. 
“Dems will never admit it’s a good time to go Green,” writes Scott McLarty, media coordinator for the Green Party, at The Hill. “They want a field permanently limited to two parties of war and Wall Street.” 
To understand what we’ve lost under the two-party racket, compare the cringeworthy Clinton-Trump debates with Green nominee Jill Stein’s rebuttals. 
Stein addressed issues that were either touched on superficially or absent from the bipartisan bicker-fest. She proposed solutions — especially the Green New Deal. Progressive ideas, the kind advanced by Bernie Sanders in his call for political revolution, are effectively censored in the debates. 
Marginalization of alt-parties in the late 20th century is one of the unmentioned reasons for the triumph of the right wing in both major parties. It explains the disappearance of big progressive ideas like FDR’s New Deal and LBJ’s Great Society. 
The Green New Deal is a vision of how we can improve the lives of millions of people and rescue the planet from climate chaos. 
Today’s Democrats give us no such vision. All they’ve offered is modest reforms, ideas that pretended to be progressive but aren’t (e.g., Obamacare, originally Romneycare), and slogans like “Change We Can Believe In.” The vision Hillary Clinton evokes is “I’m not Trump.” 
The two-party racket is incapable of dealing with the crises of the 21st century: climate change; creeping corporate oligarchy and economic inequality; the national-security/mass-incarceration state; endless war. 
These crises promise an era of deteriorating quality of life, increasing personal debt, eroded rights and freedoms, lawless militarism, and social breakdown. The danger they pose can be compared with the rise of totalitarian states and the Cold War’s nuclear menace during the 20th century.",0

Una situación económica parecida a la actual fue superada en 1930 por la Segunda Guerra Mundial. pixabay.com   
La carga de la deuda de los países desarrollados ha alcanzado el nivel máximo desde la época de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, mientras que las inversiones han llegado al mínimo, según muestran los datos del Fondo Monetario Internacional ( FMI ), citados por el portal ruso Vesti Finance . 
Hoy en día, se destacan los llamados a la estimulación fiscal , pero el estado de las economías de los países desarrollados se parece a lo que vio el mundo antes de que estrellase la Segunda Guerra Mundial. 
Según el portal, las autoridades no ven otra salida que el aumento continuo de la carga de la deuda. Sin embargo, para calmar a la sociedad se ven obligadas a recurrir al término de un 'déficit bueno' , que sirve de ""excusa para incrementar los gastos a nivel nacional"". 
Una situación muy parecida a la actual reinaba en EE.UU. en los años 1930, así que la Gran Depresión fue superada en gran medida como resultado del inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. La realidad económica de Japón 
El ministro de Finanzas de Japón, Taro Aso, recordó el pasado mes de marzo que ""durante la década de 1930 en EE.UU. la situación con la deflación se desarrollaba de una manera similar "". Señaló que el mayor problema relacionado con la introducción del nuevo trato ('New Deal') del presidente Franklin D. Roosevelt constituyó en el hecho de que durante mucho tiempo los emprendedores y gerentes no estuvieron dispuestos a invertir capitales mediante préstamos. 
Según Aso, esto es lo que ocurre en este momento en Japón . Destacó que ""los ingresos muy altos han sido obtenidos por compañías japonesas, pero no van a gastarlos para la inversión de capitales"". ""Tienen fondos para aumentar sueldos o pago de dividendos, pero no lo harán. Guardan su dinero y depósitos, mientras que los beneficios reservados siguen creciendo"", explicó el ministro japonés. 
Según indicó Aso, esta situación en la década de 1930 fue resuelta por la guerra , ya que ""la Segunda Guerra Mundial y la recuperación en los 1940 se convirtió en una solución para EE.UU."". Una guerra como un ""estímulo económico"" 
Por su parte, Paul Krugman, premio Nobel de Economía, en su conversación con el ministro japonés opinó que ""desde el punto de vista macroeconómico una guerra es un fuerte estímulo financiero "", es decir, fue la guerra que ""llevó a una estimulación fiscal"". 
Krugman destacó que la historia de los años 1930 constituyó en el hecho de que el nuevo trato de Roosevelt se basó en la estimulación presupuestaria de 1937, ya que ""en aquella época, como ahora, había muchas señales que indicaban la necesidad de equilibrar el presupuesto"". El economista tachó la medida de ""un error terrible"", ya que ""causó la segunda recesión a gran escala"".",0
18896,"ISIS Fighters Are Still Lurking in Surt, Libyan Officials Warn - The New York Times","CAIRO  —   Libyan officials were cautious on Thursday about declaring complete victory over the Islamic State in the coastal city of Surt, saying unknown numbers of the militant organization’s extremists remained ensconced in three neighborhoods. While the Islamic State’s headquarters in the heavily fortified Ouagadougou Center, as well as an adjacent hospital and other important buildings, were taken on Wednesday by   militiamen backed by American airstrikes, the fight was clearly far from over. “If we knew how many of them were left there, we would attack tomorrow,” said Mohammed   the spokesman for   militia forces. “So far we have been very professional and careful. ” The newly returned mayor of Surt, Mukhtar Khalifa, told The Associated Press that the militiamen, who were from the neighboring city of Misurata and aligned with the United   government in Tripoli, controlled 70 percent of the city. The mayor, who had vacated Surt while the Islamic State controlled it, predicted the rest of the city would soon fall as well. Mr. Ghasari described the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, as cornered in the three city neighborhoods, near the port. “It’s about a two square kilometer area  —   their days are numbered,” he said, describing an area of about 500 acres. “This shouldn’t take longer than a few weeks. They are completely cut off. We have naval forces in the water, troops on the ground and U. S. airstrikes. ” In addition to hunting down the remaining Islamic State militants, the   forces had to contend with hidden bombs and mines. Many Surt residents fled the fighting. “Only a few families have returned and they went back to areas away from yesterday’s clashes,” said Reda Eissa, another spokesman for the   campaign. “We advised everyone not to come back just yet. This is still a military zone and ISIS left behind a jungle of land mines. ” Mr. Eissa put the number of remaining Islamic State fighters at “several hundred,” but he said the government side now controlled 85 percent of the city. As well as taking the Ouagadougou Center, the militias drove Islamic State members from about seven of their strongholds, including the hospital, a university and other places. Despite their setbacks on Wednesday, Islamic State fighters still shot down a Libyan Air Force fighter plane, killing the pilot, Gen. Mukhtar Fakroun, and his   Libyan officials have said. “Some of the residents who had fled returned to their homes but everyone is still very much terrorized,” said Ali Busitta, an official from Misurata working with a humanitarian committee that followed the fighters into Surt to provide aid to civilians. “Our committee tags along with the forces and goes in after an area is cleared to give people juice and try and comfort children. But they say the situation there is scary. Everyone is still rattled. ” Although the defeat of the Islamic State in Surt remained incomplete and qualified, the group’s presence in Libya has been severely reduced. Islamic State extremists had controlled Surt since last year, and before the   militias began their offensive early this summer, the organization controlled 150 miles of coastline as well, which it has now lost. The United States carried out at least 28 airstrikes in the first nine days of August against ISIS targets in Surt, reportedly using drones based in Jordan, which the militias credited as a major element in their victory. “It would have been very difficult without the Americans,” Mr. Busitta said. “We would have seen greater casualties. ” He said military leaders had told him that the Americans had been providing vital intelligence and surveillance information to the fighters. Mr. Ghasari put the number of   fighters killed in the Surt campaign at 350, including 16 in the fight for the Ouagadougou Center on Wednesday. The militias’ supporters denied reports that American or British special forces had joined the final push into Surt. “Rumors about the presence of foreign fighters are politicized,” Mr. Busitta said. He attributed the rumors to people who want to subvert the United   authority in Tripoli, called the Government of National Accord, and “make it look like some kind of puppet government controlled by the West. ” France was forced to admit that it had special forces in Libya last month, after Islamic militants shot down a French helicopter near Benghazi, killing all three soldiers on board. In addition, news organizations in Italy reported Wednesday that several dozen Italian special forces troops were secretly in Libya, in the cities of Benghazi, Misurata and Tripoli, training Libyan forces.",0

According to Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the refusal was made in response to being threatened with sanctions. “We can never do business under this kind of blackmail,” said Rutte, expressing amazement that family affairs minster Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya attempted to circumvent the Dutch ban on Turkish politicians campaigning in the Netherlands by bringing a fleet of ministerial cars across the German border, which the European Union’s borderless Schengen Area leaves unprotected. “We drew a red line,” he said, explaining why Kaya was escorted back to the German border  —   a move which prompted Erdoğan to denounce the Dutch as “fascists” and “Nazi remnants”. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim vowed there would be “a stronger reprisal against the unacceptable treatment toward Turkey and ministers who have diplomatic immunity” on Sunday afternoon. “Our   European friends who speak of democracy, freedom of expression and human rights have failed their class,” he declared. It is not yet clear what form Turkish reprisals will take, but foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has hinted the country may open its borders and allow illegal migrants to flood into Europe.

18900,Caddell: Dishonest Anti-Trump Media Have Become ’Danger to Democracy’,"Pollster and analyst Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Friday about his reaction to Thursday’s testimony by former FBI Director James Comey as well as the media’s reaction. [“I didn’t think it was a great day for the media, said Caddell. “However, if you watched some of the other cable news networks, you’d think this was a disaster for Trump. It was anything but. ” He went on to call out the media for pursuing a political agenda, as opposed to the truth, saying that media today is actually “a danger to democracy. ”  “The media really took it on the nose,” he went on, pointing out that Trump was not lying about the three times he claims Comey told him he personally was not under investigation. “How come that didn’t leak out? That is an interesting question because enough people knew on Capitol Hill, and it tells me that it was the media. And this was really the chilling part, that they have their narrative agenda, that Trump is in collusion, Trump is this, and Trump is that, and he’s under investigation. They did not want to challenge that narrative. ” “They weren’t reporting facts,” continued Caddell. “They were reporting sources who would give them statements that would contribute to their   narrative. This is not a press. This is a propaganda machine. It’s full speed against the president. ” Caddell said he could turn to almost any network and predict its coverage, “If Trump walked on water, they’d say he couldn’t swim. ” “They are so negative, as they were in the campaign,” he went on. “They haven’t let up, and they have invested themselves in a political result, not in telling the truth, and that is a danger to democracy. ” Caddell said the press has damaged the very institution of the press by having decided to bring down a president versus report the truth, and “Democrats are falling right into the path with them. ” As for Trump and Comey, Caddell said, “Comey basically vindicated him, first of all, on the question if there was collusion, or even on the Flynn matter  —   whether there was obstruction, and it just doesn’t hold,” he continued. “Obviously, Mueller wouldn’t let him testify if he thought there was an obstruction case. ” Added Caddell, “Comey’s behavior is just bizarre. This man really believes that he is a demigod when it comes to the law. He keeps changing the goal lines. His weakness, which he confessed to, but I think it was more a device than a critical perception, whether it was with Loretta Lynch, when she asked him to conform to the Clinton campaign, which I thought was a revealing comment and opened up a lot of other doors, when he talked about his own leaking, volunteered how he had leaked and what he had done with those memos, I thought that was just really strange. His criticism of the media, he basically denied their stories.

18901,Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta’s Brother Is an Active Foreign Agent on the Saudi Arabian Payroll,"
by Claire Bernish
Tony Podesta — brother of the now-disgraced Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, whose files Wikileaks has been publishing — is not only a powerful Democratic Party lobbyist, but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of Saudi Arabia. 
No — as tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist as it might sound — that scenario is the absolute truth. 
In 1988, John and Tony Podesta formed the Podesta Group and have used their bigwig party-insider status to lobby and influence government policies — while, at various times, simultaneously holding positions of power — which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest. 
According to the March 2016 filing made in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, Tony Podesta is an active foreign agent of the Saudi government with the “ Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court ,” and acts as an officer of the Saudi Arabia account. 
(click to enlarge)


At this point, the web of pay-for-play between the Washington, political heavyweights, and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight. 
For starters, the Podesta brothers’ lobbying firm receives $140,000 every month from the Saudi government, which, in no uncertain terms — and despite a status as privileged U.S. ally — wages a bloody campaign of censorship, murder, suppression, human rights abuse, and worse against its civilian population, while bombing hospitals, schools, and aid convoys in neighboring nations. 
John Podesta previously served as President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, founded the think tank Center for American Progress (which oh-so-coincidentally touts the need to reframe Saudi Arabia’s hopelessly tarnished image), counseled President Obama, and now chairs Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
Tony Podesta acts as a foreign agent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the Kingdom — while also contributing to and bundling for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
Think about that for a moment. 
One brother uses the influence of money to both affect United States foreign policy and infuse the Clinton campaign with cash — while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities. 
As the Washington Post reported months ago in July, Tony Podesta’s lobbying efforts “raised $268,000 for the campaign and $31,000 for the victory fund.” 
“The Saudis hired the Podesta Group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in Yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home, including sentencing blogger Raif Badawi to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for ‘insulting Islam,’” Alternet reported . “Since then, Tony Podesta’s fingerprints have been all over Saudi Arabia’s advocacy efforts in Washington DC. When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions, The New York Times noted that the Podesta Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution.” 
Notably, the Saudis’ reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up — concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year, but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict. 
Additionally, Tony Podesta’s status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15, 2015 — ironically revealed by Wikileaks’ publishing of his brothers personal communiques — in which former Clinton Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders: 
“Hi all – we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] are already donating and raising. 
“I do want to push back a bit (it’s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties)… and how do we explain to people that we’ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won’t. Either way, we need to make a decision soon.” 
To which general counsel to the Clinton campaign, attorney Marc Elias, replied [all errors original and emphasis added], 
“Responding to all on this. I was not on the call this morning, but I lean away from a bright line rule here. It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta, Canada can’t give, but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can. Just as we vet lobbyists case by case, I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied, it would not be a flat our ban. A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Obama.” 
As the exchange continues, how to precisely handle the campaign’s image with potentially controversial donors — while, at all costs, maintaining the flow of cash — becomes even more apparent. As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds, 
“Where do we draw the line though?” 
Elias suggests a particularly intricate solution: 
“If we do it case by case, then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money, we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States, its relationship to the State Department during Hillary’s time as Secretary, and its relationship, if any, to the Foundation. In judging the individual, we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary’s past campaigns specifically. 
“Put simply, we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists, except with a somewhat more stringent screen. 
“As a legal matter, I am not saying we have to do this – we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. I’m just offering this up as a middle ground.” 
Mook eventually decides plainly, 
“Marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don’t really get you anything…that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So…in a complete U-turn, I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?” 


All of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect — despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime — the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015. 
Tony Podesta’s specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, which will earn $1.68 million by year’s end, does, indeed, suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine. 
“Saudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington,” Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post . “That spans both what you’d call the inside game, which is lobbying and government relations, and the outside game, which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying.” 
That broader audience — the American public — has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis, as well. 
As The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported , the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable — including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign. 
Although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet. And yet, at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House — who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts. 
The system isn’t rigged — it’s performing exactly as intended — and always will as long as the vote validates its existence. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

18902,ARIZONA Charter School teacher accused of harassment and assault of Somali Muslim student just because he is a Muslim,"BNI Store Nov 2 2016 ARIZONA Charter School teacher accused of harassment and assault of Somali Muslim student just because he is a Muslim Does anyone else smell the stench of designated terrorist group CAIR lurking in the shadows? A sixth grade teacher at the Academy of Excellence, a public charter school in Phoenix, allegedly said to a Muslim student: “You’re a terrorist. I can’t wait until Trump is elected. He’s going to deport you all.” The ACLU has since filed complaints with the Obama Departments of Justice and Education. ABC15 The American Civil Liberties Union says a Somali Muslim immigrant and his sister were expelled from a Phoenix school after a sixth grade teacher allegedly discriminated against him. The complaints were made against Academy of Excellence Charter School, a public charter school in Phoenix. According to a letter sent to both state agencies, the 11-year-old student allegedly was targeted by his sixth grade teacher multiple times during the 2015-2016 school year. The letter accuses the teacher of singling out the student because of his religion and/or nationality. On one occasion, the teacher allegedly showed a video about the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks. The teacher is accused of then telling the student “That’s going to be you,” suggesting that he was to become a terrorist himself, ACLU attorney Heather Weaver said. Earlier in the school year, the same teacher had refused to let A.A. pray during class one day , and is also accused of grabbing the student by his neck and choking him because he would not stop talking with his classmates . The letter said that, during a separate incident in which the teacher was speaking about Donald Trump, she turned to the student and said, “I can’t wait until Trump is elected. He’s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn’t be given visas. They’ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You’re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.” Because of the teacher’s comments claimed by the ACLU, the student allegedly was teased by classmates on the bus ride home that day and was accused of plotting to blow up the bus, calling him a “terrorist.” She then allegedly threatened the student, saying “If you tell your mom (about the abuse), watch what happens next.” The ACLU said that when the alleged victim’s mom complained to the school, the school director sided with the teacher, stating that she had done nothing wrong. The student was accused of breaking school rules by opening an emergency window while riding on the bus. As a result, both he and his sister – a second grader at the same school – were expelled; effective immediately. The complaints against the teacher were’t lodged until after the students’ expulsion from the school. The Academy of Excellence Charter School is refuting the claims. They’ve since released a statement regarding the situation, calling the allegations false. “The Academy of Excellence Charter School Governing Board and Administration (“AOE”) refutes the allegations contained in two letters from the ACLU. Those letters, both of which are dated October 28, 2016, are devoid of any evidence and contain false and unsubstantiated allegations. AOE conducted an internal investigation on January 25, 2016. That investigation produced no evidence to support the claims now being made . Additionally, these allegations were investigated by the Phoenix Police Department but at that time, her only complaint was that “she believed that her children were kicked out of our school due to their Muslim faith.” AOE has many children who practice the Muslim faith. It was not until February 24, 2016, that the mother and her son made the allegation of ‘choking.’ This allegation was investigated by a Detective who found that, ‘At the conclusion of the investigation, a crime in this matter was unfounded. Both suspect and witnesses provided corroborating statements, and were not consistent with the victims’ statement.’ This is the “cursory and inadequate” investigation the ACLU notes in the footnotes to its letters. Finally, if you compare the timing of events contained in the ACLU’s letters and the statements made to the Police by the teacher and the student, they are completely different. The difference between the statements calls into question the motive of the plaintif. AOE’s first contact from the ACLU sought a substantial monetary payment.” (DING DING DING! It’s always about the money) See more “victim jihad” in public schools: ISLAMIZATION OF SCHOOLS",0

18905,Have You Heard? Scientists Now Growing Human Ears From Apples,"The rogue work of one nonconformist scientist could one day enable us to grow cheap replacement body parts. Humanity in general and humans in particular have one dream: to live longer than the allotted age. If we could live forever, well, that’d be just swell, never mind the consequences.
However enamored to the idea of just swapping out old organs for newer, flawless ones, we’re still a long way from mass producing body parts. Sure, there might be a few unorthodox laboratories secretly catering to the specific needs of the 0.01 percent, but these do nothing to benefit the rest of mankind. The reason behind this is that living matter is incredibly well-structured and its organized form is hard to grow outside of living things.
For example, you could multiply and grow liver cells in a lab but you would end up with an organic mass unable to serve any useful function. That’s because a liver is much more than a number of hepatic cells; these cells need to form tissue, which is fed by blood vessels and crisscrossed by a network of neurons. All this needs to sit inside a scaffold called the extracellular matrix (ECM). Huh, another matrix keeping things together.
COLORED IN BLUE ARE HUMAN CELLS GROWING ON AN APPLE SLICE SCAFFOLDING
When growing organs in the lab, scientists don’t have a lot of options regarding the scaffolding they use. It’s either sourced from live animals and cadavers or 3D printed from proprietary materials. Both these practices are time-consuming and prohibitively expensive. Well, maybe not anymore.
We used an apple and it cost pennies.
Meet scientist-entrepreneur Andrew Pelling. Also a professor at the University of Ottawa, Pelling knows the only way to truly understand the world around us is to be curious and open-minded. That is how he got worldwide recognition for growing human ears from apple slices.
In order to do this, Pelling and his team came up with some “minor modifications to well-known decellularization protocols that are typically applied to existing organs and tissues.” Decellularization is the process through which cells are flushed out from tissue, leaving behind only the extracellular matrix. Scientists have been doing this for decades, but never before has been fruit used to grow human ears.
So how did they manage this feat of biohacking? Easy. Pelling’s wife is a musical instrument maker so she carves wood for a living. The scientist simply asked his wife to sculpt some ears from Macintosh apples. After removing all the apple cells from the apple ear, Pelling was left with a ready-to-use, cheap cellulose scaffold.
“As weird as this is, it’s actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized,” Pelling told the audience during a Ted Talk. “ And we found in our pre-clinical work that you can implant these scaffolds into the body, and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive. This is the point when people started asking me,’ Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?’ And I’m like, ‘You’ve come to the right place.’” 

The importance of this endeavor goes far beyond the shock value of using something as unassuming as an apple to potentially make us live longer. In a very unexpected way, fruits and veggies could help improve the lives of many sufferers. The thing is, you have to set them in a Petri dish rather than a plate.
Sensing the importance of their project, Pelling and his team posted the instructions online as open-source. That way smaller laboratories on a tight budget could one day come up with solutions “to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kitchen.” 
That would leave us with more time to come up with great ideas, a process that coincidentally happens in the same kitchen.
“ Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus, what you can see are all these tiny little vessels. And when we image them in the lab, you can see how the cellulose forms these structures. This image reminds me of two things: our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.” 
Imagine using asparagus stalks to grow new neurons and them implanting them in the bodies of those with damaged nerve connections. If researched properly, this technology has the potential to save millions. It goes without saying that an unconventional, creative way of thinking needs to be in place way before mainstream science can accept the fact that the solution to so many of our problems is right there in front of us.
In the meantime, don’t forget your fruits and vegetables. You know what they say, “an apple a day might save you from having to wear the same pair of tired-ass ears for the rest of your life.” Or so I’ve heard.

18906,WikiLeaks Reveals Hillary Campaign Deployed “Brown And Women” Pundits To Get Favorable Coverage,"BOOM: Clint Eastwood Has PERFECT Response to Hollywood Libs Calling Trump Racist 
While the advice allegedly came from Wolfson, the words were her own, and the message was simple: Women and minorities should be used to shame The New York Times and other liberal media outlets into writing positive stories about the Democrat nominee. 
By the way, it’s worth noting that Arthur Sulzberger’s family has controlled the Times for 120 years, but Tanden reckons he’s a “schulzburger” as well as a wuss. Maybe Mr. Sulzberger should ask for more respect from political campaigns his paper endorses. Advertisement - story continues below 
According to LifeZette , the email was sent in July 2015 around a time when “Hillary Clinton’s coverage in The New York Times wasn’t going the way the campaign wanted.” 
Moreover, Tanden’s use of the term “brown” was politically incorrect to the max — so much so that former President George H.W. Bush was reportedly flayed by the media in 1988 after he described his Hispanic grandchildren as “the little brown ones.” 
With double standards so prevalent in the contemporary age, however, it was unlikely that either Clinton or Tanden would be criticized by the media for their inappropriate use of the term. 
In fact, a cursory glance of Google search results Thursday morning showed that not a single mainstream outlet had even picked this story up yet. Advertisement - story continues below",0
18907,Sports Writers: Colin Kaepernick Getting Blackballed by the NFL - Breitbart,"The sports media has spent most of the offseason wondering why Colin Kaepernick hasn’t yet signed with a team. Well, according to a couple prominent sports writers, the answer is simple: no NFL team has called him. [According to Tim Kawakami of the Mercury News:  A source tells me that Kaepernick to this point has had no serious talks with any team about a contract and has had no meetings, which means he has not demanded a starting role or a $10M salary or a $5M salary or any of the other things circulating among the NFL gossip mill recently. There is zero evidence that any team has come anywhere close to signing Kaepernick, and a source close to Kaepernick told me yesterday that they have not discussed even general money terms with anybody this offseason. And Kaepernick is not demanding a guaranteed starting role. How could he if he hasn’t had a single serious conversation with a team? I don’t know if Kaepernick would accept a bare minimum contract like Blaine Gabbert (! !! More on Gabbert in a bit) who just reportedly signed with Arizona to be the   or   QB behind Carson Palmer, but I do know, from the same source, that not a single team has asked if he would accept it. So how could Kaepernick be demanding anything of anybody? To thin air? It doesn’t make sense, unless we’re talking Fake Information World. A black ball while ferociously saying it’s not a black ball. Charles Robinson of Yahoo! agrees with Kawakami, specifically in regard to the reports that Kaepernick had asked for far too much money, saying, “And thus far, not one NFL source has been able to confirm to Yahoo Sports any number that Kaepernick is looking for in terms of contract price or even structure. In turn, not even one NFL team is confirmed to have had any financial talks with Kaepernick. By all accounts, the financial barrier to Kaepernick landing with a team appears to be bogus at this stage. ” So, what does all this mean? If you believe the reporting, it means no one has called Kaepernick about a job. Hence, all the theories about why the former 49er remains unsigned, such as how he’s not working out anymore, how he’s asking for too much money, and how he’s going to be a lifelong protester. These theories have no merit, because no one has picked up the phone and even broached the subject of signing him. This lack of contact with Kaepernick, especially in light of Blaine Gabbert signing with Arizona, and the retirements of Jay Cutler and Tony Romo, constitutes blackballing in the eyes of the media. Kaepernick made a conscious decision to perform an immensely unpopular act, repeatedly, on national television throughout the course of an NFL season. Despite the anger he sparked in millions, and the advice he received from many in the industry, he continued to do this while proudly claiming to stand for what he believed. That’s his right. It’s also the right of 32 NFL owners to take a look at that clown show and say no thanks. One person’s freedom of speech is not another person’s muzzle. The freedom to react with speech, ambivalence, or the decision not to hire someone is an inherent, and essential, corollary to the freedom of speech. If not, then the freedom to speak is nothing more than a tyranny of what the cultural establishment deems politically correct and proper. No Boston dock worker or Virginia farm boy would have ever picked up a musket to fight for that. All that being said, Colin Kaepernick isn’t truly being blackballed. At least not yet. Colin Kaepernick threw four touchdowns for every interception last year, on a team in complete disarray, with no receivers and a suspect offensive line. He’s not the quarterback he was three years ago, but he’s absolutely good enough to be in the NFL. So, why isn’t he in the NFL? Simple: it’s May, it’s the offseason. The draft is over. Free agency? Over. Baseball is less than 40 games in, and the NBA is currently mired in the most boring postseason in the history of postseasons. If an NFL team signed Kaepernick tomorrow, they would absorb the full brunt of media coverage and scrutiny for the better part of the next three months. Most of that time, with no other sport, or major sports story to distract from it. That’s not blackballing, that’s strategy. No, the real test of whether or not Kaepernick has been blackballed won’t happen in May, it’ll happen in November. It’ll happen when the starting quarterback for a playoff contending team with no viable backup gets injured. Kaepernick has played well enough to land on the very short list of available quarterbacks to receive a phone call in that situation. It’s also a heck of a lot easier to explain making the Kaepernick call at that time. In the heat of the playoff chase, no other viable alternatives, desperate times, desperate measures. With all the distractions of an NFL season in    season form. If that situation, or some other similar manifestation of that situation, unfolds, without Colin Kaepernick getting an offer from an NFL team then a strong case could be made that Kaepernick was indeed blackballed by the NFL. But, you still shouldn’t care, because that’s their right, and that’s what he deserves. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
18908,Steve Mnuchin: ‘The Unemployment Rate Is Not Real’ - Breitbart,"During his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin said the unemployment rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not capture the reality of the conditions facing American workers. [Mnuchin’s   comment was “The unemployment rate is not real,” but he doesn’t seem to have been questioning the validity of the statistics produced by BLS.   U. S. News and World Report, for example, swiftly accused Mnuchin of repeating a “claim that has rankled economists” about how “government statistics have been politicized and aren’t accurate,” but that’s not what Mnuchin said. Rather, he made the case to Senator Maria Cantwell ( ) that the official unemployment statistics suggest the job market has healed to a degree most actual workers and   would disagree with, because there’s so much happening that isn’t captured by that narrow statistic. There was a bit of ideological jousting in the exchange, as Cantwell was basically trying to push Mnuchin into saying his primary focus should be preventing another “major implosion” in the financial markets, while he galloped in the opposite direction and talked about   Donald Trump’s commitment to the forgotten middle American.  Democrats want the 2008 financial crisis to be seen as an impossible,   challenge President Obama was still coping with on his last day in office. Mnuchin turned that around by talking about how the American workforce has suffered under Obama’s policies. “Let me just tell you, from having traveled with the   for the last year, I absolutely understand why he got elected,” Mnuchin said. “And that is because, as you point out, the average American worker has gone nowhere. ” “The unemployment rate is not real,” Mnuchin continued. “The average American worker has gone nowhere. And the   is committed  —   as am I, as his economic adviser  —   to work for the American people and grow the American economy, so that the average American worker does better. ” “That’s why I’ve been willing to sell all my investments, okay?” he said. “I’ve been willing to give up my businesses. My desire is to work for the American people, to create a better economy. And I understand that. I’ve traveled for the last year. I’ve seen this, and the   understands that very clearly. ” The Hill notes that   Trump himself has criticized the unemployment rate as “phony numbers” and “totally fiction. ” He’s not alone in that critique, especially in questioning how only one of the many numbers compiled by BLS gets media attention (at least, under Democrat presidents) and it doesn’t count people who have exited the workforce entirely. The Wall Street Journal’s MarketWatch noticed Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci stepping forward on Twitter to back Mnuchin’s play: He’s right. Wage growth stagnant, labor force participation at   low,   unemployment rate high for this stage in economic cycle https:  .   —   Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) January 19, 2017,  The numbers are accurate, but they have been cherry picked and spun dry.

18909,Meet the Greenland Shark. It Could Be the Longest-Living Vertebrate. - The New York Times,"The Greenland shark is a ludicrously late bloomer. This   Arctic predator reaches sexual maturity when it’s about 150 years old. Though more than a century of prepubescence might sound bad, there’s a bright side for the sea creature. Once it hits adulthood, it still has another hundred years to live. Maybe even more. The Greenland shark has a life expectancy of at least 272 years, according to a study published Thursday in Science. If its findings are correct, that makes it the   vertebrate animal in the world, surpassing some sea turtles (about 100 years) tortoises (between 100 and 200 years) and bowhead whales (around 200 years). But that number, 272, doesn’t tell the whole story of these underwater geezers. Researchers estimated that two of the 28 Greenland sharks they observed were over three centuries old. “The oldest shark that we’ve analyzed, it’s amazing,” said Julius Nielsen, a doctoral candidate at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and lead author on the study. In their paper they report that it could be 392 years old. But even that number, 392, doesn’t complete the story. The oldest shark could actually be 120 years older, he said. Mr. Nielsen and his colleagues used radiocarbon dating and statistical methods to measure the sharks’ ages. The tools can only provide accurate age ranges for each specimen, not an exact age. “We are 95 percent certain that it is between 272 and 512 years,” Mr. Nielsen said. “This is the first time ever anyone has made an age range of uncertainty of 240 years and they still consider it a success. ” Even at the lower end of the range, the Greenland shark still takes the gold for living things with backbones in the   Olympics. To calculate the ages, the researchers studied the eye lenses of each shark they found. The eye lenses first develop when the sharks are still inside their mothers, and as time goes by, they grow like onions, adding layer after layer of tissue. By cutting away the layers and analyzing the nucleus of the center of the eyelens, the team can gauge how old each shark is. Similar techniques have been used to estimate the age of bowhead whales. All the sharks the team analyzed were females that were already dead. Previous studies had determined that the sharks become sexually mature when they are about 13 feet long. The new study determined that those that size or bigger were at least 150 years old. Males were left out because they were harder to find, but the team thinks life expectancy and the age when they reach adulthood will be similar. Greenland sharks are found throughout the North Atlantic. They are plump and gray, and many have a characteristic parasite latched to the corner of one or both eyes. Researchers aren’t sure what the parasites do, but they are ubiquitous among the species. The sharks are   adding about a centimeter a year.

18910,"Gorka: ‘I Guess the Obama Administration Were Islamophobes, as Well,’ Since They Created List of Nations for Trump Immigration Order","Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy adviser to President Trump and former National Security editor for Breitbart News, addressed criticisms of the president’s revised immigration order on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily. [SiriusXM host Alex Marlow began with the charge that President Trump’s executive order is a disguised “Muslim ban” or the beginning of a “slippery slope” to block all Muslim immigration to the United States.  “Well, then I guess the Obama administration were Islamophobes, as well, because the list of seven nations  —   which we’ve actually reduced to six, excluding a very large country called Iraq  —   that list was inherited from the Obama administration’s analysis,” Gorka pointed out. “The fact is, we agree with the threat analysis from the Obama administration, which also had concurrence from Congress, as well, that these are the seven nations that are most problematic when it comes to national security vetting for immigration and for refugees,” he said.  “And again, I cannot make this point enough times: if there were any dread ulterior motive to this executive order with regards to Islam or Muslim nations, why is the largest Muslim nation in the world, Indonesia, not included? Why is the largest Arab Muslim nation in the world, Egypt, not included?” he asked. “This is about national security, very very simply. ” Marlow quoted an ACLU interview on National Public Radio that revealed that the crux of the argument against the new executive order will be President Trump’s campaign rhetoric, in which he referred to a “Muslim ban. ” “That’s incredibly telling,” said Gorka. “It really is part and parcel of what I call the fake news phenomena. You look at the media, and they always focus in on half a sentence, on a phrase, and believe they can generate stories out of that. That’s the same in this case. When you’re using shorthand for a very, very significant national security exercise, it’s the broader instrument that needs to be analyzed  —   especially if it goes to a court of law, where somebody wishes to use legal instruments to analyze it. ” “It’s good to hear they’ve tipped their hand, but yet again, if you look at the order, the text of what it predicates and why it was brought, there’s absolutely no way  —   in the courts or outside of the courts, using common sense  —   to imply anything other than this is a national security measure that is in the purview of the president,” he said. “Only the president has the prerogative, since the 1950s, to determine who comes into the United States and against what metrics they are measured. That’s not disputable. That cannot be parsed in a court of law. It is laid down in national statute. The ACLU may have an opinion, but the law remains the law. ” Marlow observed that some critics on the Right do not think the order went far enough, and he asked if it was meant as a negotiation or stalling tactic. “We start from simply a   determination of where the threats are. Again, the list can be shortened. You saw that it was shortened in the last month. It can be increased. There can be more nations added to it. It’s a temporary measure  —   very important. This is 90 days, so it’s something that is about the review of the system,” Gorka replied. “You look at those seven nations, and there’s one thing that links them,” he said. “You take Iran out of it. Iran is a special case because they’ve been a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. Every other country is home to the new Caliphate, the Islamic State, ISIS, or is a hotbed for   activity. ”  “This isn’t randomly chosen nations picked out of a hat. This is the most clear and present danger from individuals in active war zones, that have groups who say  —   have said this in English in their propaganda product  —   ‘We will exploit the refugee streams and the migrant streams to insert our individuals, our operatives, into those flows.’ It’s just hard, cold analysis,” said Gorka. Marlow cited a report from Fox News that about 300 refugees are currently the subjects of FBI terrorism investigations. Gorka said this was just part of a broader picture of the terrorist threat. “There have been, since September the 11, just under 600 successful terrorist prosecutions in the United States, in the last 16 years,” he noted. “Approximately half of those put people in prison who were not born in the United States, about half of them. And of the number that were not U. S. nationals, about three dozen were actually refugees or had asylum status. ”  “So again, this isn’t hyperbole,” he stressed. “This isn’t fictional hypothesizing. It’s based on the facts of what’s happened in the last 16 years, and most importantly, Alex, it’s about preventing the next attack. Good   isn’t reactive. You don’t wait until 120 people have been massacred at a rock concert in Paris. You don’t wait until somebody steals a truck and mows down 80 people, as in Nice. What you want to do is to prevent the bad guys coming in, and that’s exactly why the president brought his order,” said Gorka. Marlow quoted a complaint from the Powerline blog that Trump’s executive order does not go far enough to consider the possibility that “sons and daughters of those who will still be admitted” could become terrorists. “That’s another front in the war against global jihadism or radical Islamic terrorism,” said Gorka. “The author of the article should be fully aware of the fact that this administration understands that not all terrorism is done by foreign nationals or refugees,” he said in response to the Powerline piece. “We’ve seen this. We’ve seen this with Nidal Hassan. We’ve seen this with other individuals here in the United States. Yes, there will be other measures taken that look at the issue of what you do with people who choose the life of jihad as a U. S. national or as somebody who grows to the age of maturity and then decides to go down that path of killing their fellow American or plotting to do so. ”  “Remember, this is just one executive order. Nobody in the administration is positing that we are solving all counterterrorism issues with this one executive order,” he promised. On the subject of detainees released from Guantanamo Bay and returning to terrorism, which President Trump addressed in a Tuesday morning tweet, Gorka said, “We’ve got to change the policies that we’ve seen occur over the last eight years. ” “We have an unbelievably high recidivism rate from Guantanamo Bay. The president has been clear that he understands the value of Guantanamo Bay,” Gorka said. “What needs to be understood about the facility is that it’s not just a detention facility. It’s also a very, very important intelligence asset if you look at the kinds of people that we’ve put in there and the kinds of intelligence we’ve gleaned from them. ” “There’s no ideology driving this administration that is about feeling good and releasing people when we feel that they’re no longer a threat. If these individuals have chosen the life of jihad and are committed to it, that means in perpetuity. Unless they distance themselves from it and reject it, they remain a threat to everything this nation stands for,” he declared. Gorka said President Trump’s next priority is “the finalization and deployment of the   plan. ” “It’s been drawn up by the generals, by Secretary Mattis, and now the final touches will be put to that plan. The intent is  —   and it will happen the president said so in his joint session, when he addressed the joint session of Congress  —   that we will obliterate the Islamic State and wipe this type of terrorism from the face of the earth. The next large muscle movement is going to be the   plan’s implementation,” he said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: ",0
18912,Trump May Have Pushed Dutch Voters Away From Populism - The New York Times,"THE HAGUE  —   If there is one thing the Dutch agree on, it is to preserve the dikes that protect this   country from the ravages of violent seas. That sentiment translates into politics. For the Dutch, both the British vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump’s election in the United States broke political dikes, leaving the Dutch ill at ease with the conflict and uncertainty that has ensued. That, some analysts said, helps explain why the Dutch ultimately chose to contain the populist surge led by Geert Wilders, the   icon, in their elections on Wednesday. “In Europe we all see the developments in the United States, and that’s not where we want to go because we see it as chaos,” said Janka Stoker, a professor in the School of Economics and Business at the University of Groningen in the north of the Netherlands. “We’re a coalition country, we don’t always like the coalitions, but we know it gives stability and people know here that we have to work together,” Ms. Stoker said. It is hard to say if the same feeling will prevail in other European countries holding elections this year. The Netherlands, a nation of essentially liberal social instincts, is some barometer, but an imperfect one, with its proportional electoral system that dissipates power and enforces cooperation. It is far less clear that the political circuit breakers in places like France or Italy will similarly hold back a populist movement. They have already blown in Britain, where the incautious choice of a   referendum on Europe removed the usual electoral safeguards, and in the United States, where the Electoral College has twice overridden the popular vote since 2000. So while the sense of relief among   politicians and voters was palpable on Thursday after the Dutch vote, Europe  —   its project of integration, its unity, its political ideals  —   was by no means free of populist threats. Even if the Dutch refused to hand a big win to Mr. Wilders, they backed center right parties that adopted some of his positions and language in order to win. Over all,   parties, including the parties defined as populist by academics and pollsters, gained seven seats in the Dutch Parliament, giving them 57 percent of the   body in this election, in contrast to 52. 6 percent in the last election when they had 79 seats. At the same time, one of the oldest Dutch political forces, the mainstream left Labor Party, cratered. The result all but guarantees that policies toward immigrants and Muslims will be more restrictive, though less than if Mr. Wilders were running the Dutch government. Yet there are several signs the “Trump effect” that was once expected to carry similarly minded populists is less powerful, or even having the opposite impact, several analysts and pollsters said. Similarly, the British vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, may look less inviting as a model as the reality of its messiness comes into view. Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a   research organization, said the “Trump factor” had played a role in “making people think twice about voting for a populist, as people have seen that if you elect a populist you can get all kinds of wacky policies. ” “At the same time,” he added, “we have seen a drop in populism in Europe since Brexit, as citizens have realized that, while a protest vote is fun, it can lead to the uncertainties of Brexit, which are not funny at all. That helped shift the mood in the Netherlands. ” In polls in the Netherlands that looked at perceptions of Mr. Wilders before and after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Wilders did significantly better before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, said Maurice de Hond, one of the Netherlands’ most seasoned pollsters. “The reason Wilders ended in second place has to do with Trump,” he said, noting that there were other factors, like Mr. Wilders missing early debates. Not everyone agrees, and some analysts underscored that all politics are local. More important than Brexit or Mr. Trump may have been last weekend’s diplomatic spat with Turkey, which gave the   party a lift after it took a strong stand against Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. “It’s not just that the Netherlands was not that concerned with Trump and Brexit, it’s that there’s a provincialism about these European elections,” said E. C. Hendriks, a Dutch researcher in social sciences and cultural anthropology who is now at Peking University in Beijing. “Really, everyone is on his island. ” Certainly, there are factors in both France and Germany that make their respective elections idiosyncratic and potentially less affected by the American and British political winds. Nonetheless, in France it is striking that for the most part Marine Le Pen, the leader of the   National Front, has steered clear of analogies between her politics and those of Mr. Trump. “Geert Wilders, the Le Pen Dutch equivalent, spoke a lot about Trump, he praised him on the Muslim ban and was one of the few European political figures to praise that ban,” said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, director of the German Marshall Fund office in Paris. “Le Pen was quieter, I think she understood that to be too close to Trump right now when his administration was in a chaotic phase was not to her advantage. ” Some Dutch voters said they took Mr. Trump’s sometimes bellicose tone seriously, and consciously voted for parties that supported the European Union because they believe that Europe is stronger together and better able to stand up to the United States under Mr. Trump. For similar reasons, some said, they did not favor Brexit. “I don’t like Brexit, it weakened the system, it weakened the European Union and indirectly the Netherlands,” said Max den Voort, 19, a student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in Delft. The Green Party, led by    Jesse Klaver, was an unexpected winner, scoring the biggest parliamentary gains on the left. The D66 party also had a successful showing, getting the left’s largest share of votes. Both parties are  . One important difference between the Netherlands and countries that vote later this year is that the Dutch have already had experience with populists in government, said Ronald Kroeze, a political historian at the Free University of Amsterdam. Mr. Wilders was part of the governing coalition in 2010, but when it came to supporting austerity measures in the wake of the recession, he refused to go along. That left the impression he was not serious about governing. In contrast, France and Germany have no direct recent experience with populist leadership and they may be more open to it as a result. Regardless, the continent seems to be moving in an   direction that relies more on identity politics, Ms. Hoop de Scheffer said. “The mainstream parties are now stealing parts of the populist discourse, and this is undermining the attraction of the populist parties,” she said. “But it’s a dangerous game because it almost normalizes these ideas. ”",0

18915,"Trump Budget Is Heavy Lift, Even for G.O.P. Congress - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   After eight years of chafing under President Barack Obama’s fiscal priorities, congressional Republicans were longing for a budget proposal that did the two things that have become the party’s mantra: Make broad cuts to federal spending and reduce the federal deficit. Instead, President Trump sent them a budget even many Republicans found difficult to love. To fulfill a campaign promise to leave Social Security and Medicare  —   which represent more than 40 percent of annual federal spending  —   untouched while constructing an expensive border wall, Mr. Trump went after a relatively small pot of money, discretionary spending, goring Republicans’ pet programs in the process. He does propose increasing military spending by 10 percent, something many conservatives would also like to see, but he probably cannot unilaterally break through legal budget caps, imposed after a battle in 2011 over raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling. Mr. Trump ran as a populist and stacked his cabinet like a conservative, yet he delivered a budget that in many respects is neither. The result is deeply unsatisfying for many in his party, which has been yearning for a unified government to finally make major changes to entitlement programs to bring the deficit in line. “This is a good budget if you want to spend your time fighting small fires,” said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who as the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee spent years trying to rally lawmakers to do the hard work to balance the budget. “It’s a statement of policy, which is legitimate, that the government is too big,” Mr. Gregg said. “As a practical matter, it does not affect the big issues that drive that. ” Congress could have eliminated every penny of domestic spending at its annual discretion this year, and it would not have balanced the federal budget, according to Congressional Budget Office projections, much less rid the nation of its nearly $20 trillion in government debt  —   which Mr. Trump told voters he could do easily in eight years. It is precisely what conservatives have wanted to control. “The fact is that until the president and Congress are willing to address the real drivers of our debt, Medicare and Social Security, we will be complicit in shackling future generations with the financial burden of our own lack of discipline,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. “That is not a legacy I want to leave. ” Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s budget director, who as a member of the House was one of the biggest deficit hawks, was confronted with the budget’s failure to deal with the debt in a news conference with reporters on Thursday. “It’s a fair question,” he said. “I would just suggest to you it’s not the right time for the question. The budget blueprint, again, does not deal with the debt. It even doesn’t even deal with the deficit. It is simply the first part of the appropriations process. ” The budget document represents a   aspiration for Mr. Trump, leaving it to the House and Senate appropriations committees to do all the painful work, like finding a way to pay for a wall along the Mexican border that the White House wants. But trying to pass appropriations bills with large cuts to popular domestic programs seems almost impossible in both chambers, especially the Senate, leading Congress on another path to   spending measures that Republicans have long wanted to escape. The Congressional Budget Office foresees a federal deficit for the 2018 fiscal year of $487 billion, rising steadily from there until it reaches $1 trillion in 2023. But that is driven all by an aging population, rising health care costs and rising interest payments from the escalating debt. Projected declines in discretionary spending under Mr. Trump’s plan would be more than swallowed by rising payments to Social Security and Medicare because the population aged 65 and older is expected to grow by 39 percent through 2027. In that time, spending on people 65 and older who receive Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement income will rise from 37 percent of federal spending in 2017 to 45 percent in 10 years. And many of his proposed cuts are at odds with congressional priorities. His budget cuts spending for the National Institutes of Health, which lawmakers  gave a big funding increase last year to help attack cancer and other diseases community block grants, which help feed hungry children (a Democratic priority) and local law enforcement (popular with Republicans) as well as pet programs like funding to care for the Great Lakes, which Midwestern lawmakers have fought hard to maintain. “The president proposes and Congress disposes,” said Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican appropriator from Pennsylvania. “We can’t finance a defense buildup entirely on the back of domestic, nondefense spending. It’s not realistic and unfair. ” Mr. Trump’s budget also shows little regard for the political sensitivities of his party. His proposal to restart licensing for a nuclear waste repository in Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, creates a headache for Senator Dean Heller, a Republican who is up for   in that state next year. His response was swift and blunt. “As has been stated in the past, Yucca is dead, and this reckless proposal will not revive it,” he said in a statement. It even takes an ax to programs that are important to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, by proposing cuts in funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission and some air service that would probably eliminate two airports in his state. Mr. McConnell on Thursday went in search of a silver lining. “I’m pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets,” he said in a statement. “These are positive steps in the right direction. I look forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring. ” Mr. Trump is hardly alone in putting forth a budget dismissed by his own party. Mr. Obama pushed the idea of changing the way the inflation rate was calculated to slow the growth of big programs like Social Security, a proposal many Democrats opposed. President George W. Bush pressed to partially privatize Social Security, and many Republicans disliked that idea. But it is striking to read Mr. Trump’s budget and see clearly mixed messages from the opening pages delivered by Mr. Mulvaney, who praised the budget as a debt crusher, and from Mr. Trump, who emphasized his increases in military spending. Those contradictions are among the many reasons that even members of Mr. Trump’s party see his budget more as a mere suggestion than an edict. “Historically, presidential budgets do not fare well with Congress,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.",0
18916,Experts tired of the general public,"November 7, 2016 
Experts around the country, from rocket scientists to brain surgeons, have confessed that they’re tired of the British public. 
‘If we’re not careful, we’re in serious danger of having no experts at all.’ says the nations favourite expert on absolutely everything, Professor Brian Cox. ‘I refuse to believe that’s what Joe Public really wants, but it’s what they’re in danger of getting. 

Professor Jane Wilson, clinical neuroscientist at Greater London Hospital agrees. ‘Patients routinely ask me about diseases they looked up on the internet and think they have, just because they got a headache last Tuesday. I never use Google to look up symptoms, but I can’t tell you how many times I’ve searched “how to become a plumber” and considered passing on my ‘expert badge’ to Barbara from Ealing – she clearly feels she’s earned it.’ 
The Centre for Rocket Scientists took it one step further, and released a statement that accused the public of being ‘children with the delusion of competence about issues they haven’t the slightest clue about’, and challenged any person on the street ‘to put a rocket millions of miles into space before crashing it on Mars’.

18917,Ann Garrison: Clinton Serves the Interests of the Oligarchy that She Herself Has Joined,"68 Shares
67 0 0 1
Mohsen Abdelmoumen : Do you think the United States can claim to be democratic simply by electing a woman president? Can we talk about democracy in the USA with a candidate of the financial lobbies and AIPAC?
Ann Garrison: No, of course not. No more than we could claim to be a democracy because we elected a Black president. These two elections signify nothing more than the inclusion of previously excluded classes of people in the super elite. The United States is an oligarchy of the .01%, 1% of the 1%. Any president who is not already among the .01%, like Bill Clinton, becomes part of the .01% by serving its interests and then peddling influence after leaving office. No one has developed an influence peddling machine as well-oiled as the Clintons, with Bill working the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative while Hillary was Secretary of State. Just imagine the new depths of corruption that the next eight years and beyond could bring. Obama has said he’s now considering a move from the White House to venture capitalism that has Silicon Valley slathering at the opportunity.
Every four years Americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs and/or aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy. Candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the pay-to-play campaign contributions of the oligarchs.
In municipal and county elections and ballot measures, Americans often do have real choices, but the higher and more powerful the office, the greater the corruption and oligarchic control. Nevertheless, only a small minority of Americans actually vote n local elections; The Atlantic's CityLab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than 20% vote in mayoral elections in 15 of the 30 most populous cites. Disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of American political life.
Regarding federal elections, this concept of democracy within the largest, most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with. When U.S. citizens cast ballots to elect a new commander-in-chief who will continue the project of perpetual war, military industrial profits, and global hegemony, how democratic is that? The vast majority of those who will suffer and die don’t get to vote; the only exceptions are members of the U.S. Armed Services who die in U.S. wars. If those on the other side of the Pentagon’s crosshairs were able to vote, I’m sure they would elect our Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who said, “We say to Trump, we don’t need no friggin’ wall! We just need to stop invading other countries.” Her running mate, vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white man’s burden and said, “You have to ask yourself, when was the last time the U.S. has been on the side of the people? And the answer is: NEVER.”
MORE... Top Aide to Hillary Clinton Urges the FBI to Disclose what it Knows about Trump's Russia Ties What will Hillary Clinton do for India? Not Much and Here's Why Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency How do you explain the dynastic governance Clinton? Is the American dream in all its glory?
I’m not sure I can explain the Clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one. Chelsea has been very involved in the Clinton Foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day. We have had other political dynasties, most notably the Roosevelts, the Kennedys and the Bushes, and there are many lower level dynasties, like the Browns in California. Jerry Brown, the current governor of California, is the son of former California governor Pat Brown. New York State has the Cuomos; Governor Andrew Cuomo is the son of former Governor Mario Cuomo, and his brother Chris Cuomo is a prominent corporate television host.
Regarding the American dream, I assume you're referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can achieve some proportionate degree of status, security and prosperity. If so, the Clintons certainly aren't living the American dream because, although they did well in school, they've hardly played by the rules. They've enriched themselves with that well-oiled influence peddling operation I mentioned earlier, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. We're all wondering whether Hillary Clinton, and maybe even Bill Clinton, might finally be indicted now that the FBI has reopened its investigation of Clinton e-mail because more of it was discovered on the laptop that Anthony Weiner - a former Congressman under FBI investigation for sex offense - shared with his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. If Hillary Clinton is elected, she'll have to be impeached, convicted and removed from office, but that's extremely unlikely - no matter what's in the newly discovered e-mail - if her party, the Democrats, win a majority in the House and more than a one- third minority in the Senate. It takes a majority in the House to impeach a president and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to then convict and remove a president. So Hillary Clinton is at a Berlusconi moment in her sordid career; her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected. Getting back to the American dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a 19-year-old White House intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee. However, his own party held a majority in the Senate and they acquitted him. This was all legal, according to the U.S. Constitution, but does it really sound like he was ""playing by the rules""? During the final days of his presidency, Clinton acquitted Glencore International founder Mark Rich, an international fugitive who had fled to Switzerland. His ex-wife had donated to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign.
According to the law, President Clinton had the authority to acquit Rich, but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption?
In 2006, Clinton polished the reputation of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's autocratic leader and human rights offender, who then gave a uranium mining lease to Canadian businessman Frank Giustra's Shell Company, making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight. Giustra then made a big contribution to the Clinton Foundation. No one has claimed that this was illegal, but is it ""playing by the rules""?
When Guistra sold a majority stake in his company, Uranium One, to Rosatom, the Russian atomic energy agency, it was approved by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Giustra then contributed $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton was offered a $500,000 speaking engagement with a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin. Does that sound like playing by the rules? And now Hillary's trying to make us believe that Russia's meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with Russia over Syria. I don't think she's kidding about the confrontation, but the Clinton Foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances.
Meanwhile, most of the rest of us are not living the American dream. Sixty-three percent of Americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe, unable to handle a $500 car repair or a $1000 emergency room bill . The Clintons, as I said, serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join. When Bill Clinton was on his way out, in the last months of his presidency, he worked with Republicans in the lame duck Congress to deregulate the banking industry. By 2008, its dishonest, excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy, costing millions of Americans their jobs and/or homes. Then, as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crash’s wake.
How do you explain that candidate Clinton, who failed as Secretary of State with the death of the US Ambassador in Libya, her health problems, the scandal of emails, is the candidate of the Democrats?
Again, Clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined. Many people believe that the nomination was stolen from Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy, growing income inequality, and even the Israeli lobby’s dominance in American politics.
But there’s one other important element to this. Americans who identify as liberals, supporters of women's rights, and/or anti-racists have such a longstanding allegiance to the Democratic Party that supporting its nominee every four years is their knee-jerk reaction. Ever escalating foreign wars don’t seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience, especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of U.S. troops. And once the Republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic Donald Trump, defeating Trump became a liberal crusade.
There are, of course, glimmers of rationality and hope. Yesterday I was out canvassing for an Oakland, California ballot measure with a young Black man, a college sophomore. Despite Trump’s overt racism, he told me that he considers Clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with Russia over Syria. He understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war, accidental or not, and that Trump, for all his faults, says that the Cold War is over, that NATO is largely obsolete, and that Clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with Russia by promising to remove Bashar Al-Assad.
Our Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is reported to be polling at 16% among voters under 35, and much of Bernie Sanders’s support was quite visibly from the same age group. Local, grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control. They include community gardens, renewable energy buyers' co-operatives, and GMO-free zones. If a ballot initiative to make California's Sonoma County GMO-free passes, the whole northwest coast of California will be a GMO-free zone, from Santa Cruz to Humboldt Counties and including one inland county, Trinity.
Don't you think that the two-headed American system with the candidates of two traditional parties, Democratic and Republican is out of breath?
I wouldn’t say it’s out of breath because it’s still very much in control. However, Trump has left the Republican Party in disarray, with many Republican luminaries and funders defecting to Clinton, who is welcoming them with open arms. As Black Agenda Report Editor Glen Ford has written , the Clintons “have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the U.S. ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons. The scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the Lords of Capital so well for so long, has come undone. Thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules, the two parties of the ruling class have become one.”
It’s hard to say whether or not the Republican Party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does.
One possibility could significantly change this. If Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein wins 5% in this election, the Green Party will become an official national party eligible for 5% of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee. This year all federal funds went to the two official national parties, Republicans and Democrats, who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money. The Greens take no corporate money.
Five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much, but it would be a huge watershed for the U.S. Greens. It would be a big psychological and visibility boost, and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that Jill Stein’s campaign has been able to raise.
Winning 5% would also ensure ballot access for the Greens in most states, not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races. As it is, Greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the 50 states.
Everyone knows that Clinton is the future president of the USA. In your opinion, why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing Clinton in the Oval Office?
She is backed by the oligarchy, corporate and dynastic, particularly the investment bankers, the oil industry, and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars. They are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them. Liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid Clinton operatives in this election, and the corporate media, like the cops, serve as protectors of the oligarchy. And again, the majority of Americans are politically disengaged.
You are close to Jill Stein, head of the Green party, which emerged late in the campaign. Why was this alternative sabotaged?
Well, I wouldn’t say I’m close to Jill personally, but she knows who I am and I, of course, know who she is. I’ve reported on her campaign and on the U.S. Greens for the past year, on radio and in print and online outlets, and I’m always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages. I write for the Black Agenda Report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors, who have given their full support to the Green Party this year, even as Bernie Sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the Democratic nomination. In these times that are so easy to see as the end times, shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have, regardless of the geographic distance between us.
Jill’s campaign could hardly compete with the Republicans' and Democrats' because neither she nor any other Greens solicit or accept corporate money. We stand behind the slogan, “People and Planet before Profits.” And we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers, fossil fuel giants, and agro-chemical companies who profit from it. Jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half, closing all the U.S. military bases in foreign countries and launching a “peace offensive.” She proposes free public education from kindergarten through college, the abolition of student debt, national health insurance and a “Green New Deal” that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal, immoral, lethal and environmentally catastrophic U.S. wars. The Green New Deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before it’s too late to stop the climate meltdown - if it isn’t too late already. And it would fully employ Americans in meaningful, dignified and cooperative work for the common good.
Of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the death-march industries. I would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka from winning the 5% that would make us an official national party.
I have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop Greens at the local level. In 2003, Matt Gonzalez, the Green Party's mayoral candidate in San Francisco, seemed to have a good chance of winning. That so alarmed the Democratic Party that it sent all its best known, most powerful names and faces to San Francisco to campaign for the Democratic candidate. They sent Hillary and Bill. They sent Jesse Jackson. They sent many Democratic Party superstars more than once. They seemed to be more concerned about defeating Matt Gonzalez and the Greens in San Francisco than they were about defeating George Bush and the Republicans in the following year’s presidential election.
One of the founders of the San Francisco Green Party was elected to the City and County Board of Supervisors twice, but when he ran for Sheriff, an executive office, Democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the Greens and joined the Democratic Party, which he did. They still got rid of him after his first term, with a really ugly campaign, but that’s another complicated story in itself. The City and County of San Francisco once had more elected Greens than any city or county in the country, but many of those that Greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the Democratic Party for the sake of their political careers.
Is not Hillary Clinton a danger for humanity?
Hell yes. I agree with Congolese author and political activist Patrick Mbeko, who said she’s more dangerous than ISIS, for all the reasons I’ve already mentioned. Her dark alliance with the death-march industries, and her seeming eagerness to confront Russia over Syria and/or on Russia’s borders in the interest of global hegemony. Russian uranium deal aside, I think that Diana Johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that “her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in Russia.”
And I have to mention my friends from the African Great Lakes Region - particularly Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo - which became the killing grounds of the 1990s, as the U.S., using African proxies, established itself as the dominant power there. Most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the Clintons’ all but certain return to the White House. The Clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the Rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the First and Second Congo Wars and later the “humanitarian” interventions in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. If the truth about Rwanda and DR Congo were known, Bill Clinton would be implicated in mass murder, but that's true of every U.S. president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that. No one's going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority.
You have many worked on Africa. How do you explain the French leadership in Africa?
Well, I’m no expert in this, but I can say a few things.
First, I wouldn’t call it leadership. I’d say that France sustains a neocolonial and military presence in Africa. France was a partner in the destruction of Libya. In Mali, Niger, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, France is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates 75% of its electricity. There’s no doubt that France was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister President Thomas Sankara and the installation of President Blaise Compaoré in Burkina Faso. I don’t see any sign that French policy towards Burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now, despite its resignation to Compaoré’s ouster by a popular movement.
France and the U.S. now appear to be military partners in Africa more often than not, but during the Rwandan war and massacres and the Congo Wars of the 1990s, the U.S. displaced France as the dominant power there.
However, a source of ongoing tension between France and the U.S. has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the Rwandan Genocide. The U.S. defends Rwandan President Paul Kagame’s account, in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage. Kagame blames France, particularly for Operation Turquoise, in which French troops created a humanitarian corridor for Rwandan refugees, mostly Hutus, who were fleeing the advance of Kagame’s Rwandan Patriotic Army. This conflict has recently been renewed, first with France reopening its investigation of allegations that Kagame ordered the assassination of Rwanda and Burundi’s Hutu presidents, Juvenal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, in 1994. Rwanda responded by accusing 22 French officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in Rwanda.
In 2010, Nicholas Sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between France and the U.S. and Rwanda by accepting the U.S./Rwandan account of the massacres. He publicly apologized for France’s alleged guilt in Rwanda’s tragedy , and shortly thereafter, France was rewarded with greater access to DR Congo's resource riches. However, Alain Juppé, who was the French prime minister at the time of the Rwandan massacres and Operation Turquoise, was having none of that. He even left the country during Kagame’s 2011 ""reconciliaton"" visit to Paris . Now Juppé seems to be leading Sarkozy in the bid for his party’s nomination, and if he is elected president, the history of Rwanda and DR Congo in the 1990s will be more fiercely contested. Most of my Rwandan friends very much hope that Juppé will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened. They believe, for one, that Operation Turquoise saved many Rwandan lives.
While Africa is a young continent, How do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who don't want lose the power?
The old presidents cling to power, and the Western powers with geo-strategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people. Rwanda’s Kagame and Uganda’s Museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the U.S. and other Western interests.
France, the U.S., and all the rest of the NATO nations appear to be united in their determination to topple Burundi’s Nkurunziza, who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the East, particularly Russia, in resource extraction contracts. I can't explain Mugabe's hold on power at age 92 or Omar al-Bashir's at 72, since neither are U.S. aliies. You'll have to ask Africans in those countries to explain that.
In your opinion, is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of Africa? Why doesn't Africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model?
I really hesitate to say anything about that because I’m not African myself and I think Western media often use the word “‘tribe” as a racial slur that disguises Western resource interests at play in African conflicts. I recently wrote a piece about the new film A Brilliant Genocide , and Milton Allimadi, the Ugandan-born editor of the Black Star News, told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which I’d used the word “tribe.” I told him I'd been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it. I’m now reading his book, “ Hearts of Darkness: How White Writers Created the Racist Image of Africa .”
Why are Congolese being massacred in Beni Territory, North Kivu Province ? The first question I've asked to try to answer that question is, “What resources are there?” In Beni, the answer is oil, timber, gold, diamonds, wolfram, coltan and cassiterite. Beni is a vivid example of the saying, “Everybody wants a piece of Congo.” No one could convince me that the industrial nations’ hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts. Why are all the deadly “ethnic” conflicts in DR Congo’s resource-rich eastern provinces?
The competition and/or animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real, as they are in the West, but in Africa, the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes. Western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests.
I sometimes co-host a show called AfrobeatRadio with my friend Wuyi Jacobs on WBAI-New York City, and we both hope to someday produce a show about Rwanda and Burundi in which we won’t have to use the words “Hutu” or “Tutsi.” Dr. Léopold Munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in Rwandan history that were exaggerated by Europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other.
Libya lives total chaos. How do you analyze the situation in Libya?
It’s horrible. Like so much else, it makes me deeply ashamed to be an American. If you read Hillary Clinton’s e-mail, it’s easy to see that the U.S.]/NATO war on Libya was, for one, another Western war against another defiant resource nationalist, Muammar Gaddafi. Regardless of whatever human rights offenses Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein were guilty of, both were resource nationalists, as was Mohammed Mossadegh, the secular, democratically elected prime minister of Iran who nationalized Iranian oil before our CIA and the UK's M16 ousted him in the 1953 coup. I wrote about how this played out in Libya in “ Clinton E-MaIl: We came, we saw, we got oil .”
Obama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the Libyan War was the greatest mistake of his presidency, but I'd say his greatest mistake was waging the Libyan War in the first place. Like the Iraq War, it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the Middle East and North Africa.

The “historic” transparency keeps on coming : 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered.

18920,U.S. Takes A Stab At A No Fly Zone In Two Places – Syria And Standing Rock,"By Brandon Turbeville 
As the United States marches forward with its war of terror abroad it is, as predicted by researchers and informed observers many years ago, clamping down on the domestic population at home. Indeed, it is virtually inevitable that the great eating machine of the empire returns home to be turned on the people who ignored it while it was grinding up so many innocent lives overseas. 
So as the war drums beat louder and as America ekes closer toward the impending Clinton coronation and the possibility of the declaration of yet another “ no fly zone ,” this time over Syria, becomes more and more likely, it is poetic justice that a no-fly zone is being declared inside the United States. 
While Russia stands in the way of America’s march to create Libya 2.0 in Syria, there is no one willing and virtually no one able to stand in the way of America’s declaration of war on itself, personified by the vicious police state brutality being visited upon the protestors at Standing Rock – indigenous and otherwise – and the crackdown on virtually every amendment to the Constitution including the arrest of demonstrators and journalists, some of whom are facing incredibly ridiculous amounts of time in jail. 
Indeed, the United States has even declared a no-fly zone over the protest area, preventing media coverage of the ensuing bravery of the protesters and brutality of the “Serve and Protect” crew who are willing to bash every skull and crush every human right in the quest to “just do their jobs.” 
One need only take a look at the photos of the protesters vs the heavily armed and militarized police (can we still call them police?) forces amassed around the location to see the crumbling of America into the police state foreseen for Western countries as the rug gets pulled out from under them economically, socially, and culturally despite their use as tools of imperialism abroad. The blunt hammer of Anglo-American hegemony that is the United States is falling apart even as it continues to strike at Syria, Iran, and Russia. 
While police can murder with impunity and Black Lives Matter activists can destroy cities at will, Standing Rock protesters are charged with high crimes for spray painting bulldozers; and journalists who dare to even cover the protests are arrested and charged with trespassing, inciting riots, and conspiracy. Even left gatekeepers like Amy Goodman have been charged with such crimes. But, while Goodman’s charges were eventually dropped, other journalists such as Deia Schlosberg face 45 years in prison simply for filming a protest that involved the disruption of the pipeline’s operations. 
In regards to the current events taking place at Standing Rock, Jay Syrmopoulos writes , 
This latest flashpoint in the ongoing conflict is north of the larger and more permanent encampments, which have been constructed on federally owned land where over 200 Native American tribes have gathered to oppose the pipeline’s construction. 
On Wednesday, a heavily militarized law enforcement presence began mobilizing heavy equipment, including Humvees, armored personnel carriers, and buses and demanded the protesters leave the occupied area. 
In an ominous sign, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has restricted flights , and banned the use of drones within a radius of about 4 ½ miles of Cannon Ball. The FAA declared that only aircraft affiliated with the North Dakota Tactical Operation Center are allowed within the restricted airspace. The flight restriction went into effect Wednesday and will last until November 5. 
Indian Country Today reports : 
What began with prayers and a single tipi alongside Highway 1806 quickly grew to more than a dozen tipis surrounded by tents, buses, cars and hundreds of water protectors. Some are calling it the “1851 Treaty Camp” to acknowledge their Treaty rights. 
Across the road is the encroaching pipeline and a heavily militarized police force with armored vehicles, helicopters, planes, ATVs and busloads of officers. Tensions are growing as unarmed citizens worry that police will use unnecessarily harsh tactics. 
In recent weeks, nearly 300 unarmed water protectors who were arrested have been subjected to pepper spray, strip-searches, delayed bail, exaggerated charges and physical violence, according to interviews with several who were taken into custody. The ACLU and National Lawyers Guild recently sent attorneys to Standing Rock to help the Red Owl Collective, a team of volunteer lawyers headed by attorney Bruce Ellison, who are representing many of those arrested. 
The massive law enforcement contingent, consisting of sheriff’s deputies and officers from numerous other states and counties, as well as National Guard, began staging near the encampment — with scores of Armored Personnel Carriers, buses and Humvees poised at the ready. 
“At some point the rule of law has to be enforced,” Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said Wednesday. “We could go down there at any time. We’re trying not to.” 
Dakota Access LLC, the pipeline developer released a statement encouraging trespassers to “vacate the land immediately” or be “removed from the land.” 
“Alternatively and in coordination with local law enforcement and county/state officials, all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land,” the company said. “Lawless behavior will not be tolerated.” 
Just days ago, sheriff’s officials had said earlier they didn’t have the resources to immediately remove activists from the private land, about 50 miles south of Bismarck. Subsequently, law enforcement officials put out a call for reinforcements, with hundreds of officers from out of state responding. 
So there is an official “no fly zone” over the Standing Rock protest (which can be seen here at the FAA website ) and, on the ground, we have an army of storm troopers no doubt eager to bust heads and fire off some rounds into a group of people who only want clean water, property rights, and the honoring of the legal agreements they signed. 
Across the ocean, however, we await another no fly zone with the creeping Clinton coronation and possibly even a last stab by the Obama administration once the fix for Hitlery is officially in. 
In the last of three Presidential (in name only) debates, Clinton stated clearly her support for war in Syria by virtue of establishing a “no fly zone.” She stated , 
I’m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track. 
Of course, the establishment of a “No-Fly Zone” is tantamount to a declaration of war . Such has even been admitted by top U.S. generals when explaining exactly what a No Fly Zone would entail. As General Carter Ham stated , 
We should make no bones about it. It first entails killing a lot of people and destroying the Syrian air defenses and those people who are manning those systems. And then it entails destroying the Syrian air force, preferably on the ground, in the air if necessary. This is a violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel. 
General Philip Breedlove also echoed this description when he said, 
I know it sounds stark, but what I always tell people when they talk to me about a no-fly zone is . . . it’s basically to start a war with that country because you are going to have to go in and kinetically take out their air defense capability 
When Senator Roger Wicker asked Gen. Joe Dunford what it would take to impose a no fly zone upon Syria, the General responded , “Right now… for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.” 
Thus, the entire Western “sphere of influence” is slowly descending down to become a place of no fly zones, riot police, and a boot slowly stamping on the human face. At home, those individuals who resist the “new normal” will be steadily dealt with either by economic hardship or a rude reminder that dissenters will be silence, imprisoned, or killed. 
Elsewhere, however, the Anglo-American system has begun to encounter nations who are not only willing to fight back but who are able to do so. A dying empire caught in its death throes, trying to remain alive by creating the “absence of dissent” might well launch a third world war with a nuclear power as a last stab at hegemony. 
On the other hand, Rome could just burn slowly. 
Rest assured, however, the skies above the city will be empty.",0
18921,Elizabeth Warren: The Left’s Progressive Political Flip-Flopper - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s   tenure in public service is rife with contradictions, as an examination of her current positions juxtaposed with her past behavior reveals. [Warren’s latest book, “This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class” is her 11th. Rumors have been swirling that the progressive Democrat and Harvard law professor could be positioning herself for a run in the 2020 presidential elections.  When digging into her very near past though, Warren’s hypocritical position as a champion of “equal pay for equal work,” her phony war on big business, her   stance on a   health care system, and her hypocrisy on school choice quickly come into question. In her 2014 book “A Fighting Chance,” she criticized her 2012 opponent Scott Brown for voting against equal pay for equal work. In the book, she said of Brown, “He’s had exactly one chance to vote for equal pay for equal work, and he voted no.   …     Those were bad votes for women, and it felt right to say so. ” However, a Washington Free Beacon article titled “Elizabeth Warren’s Female Staffers Made 71% of Male Staffers’ Salaries in 2016” reported that the gender pay gap in Warren’s own Senate office is “nearly 10 percent wider than the national average. ” Warren has also contradicted herself with her claims that she fights against big business  —   failing to mention that she worked “on behalf of a big business” and got paid over $200, 000 in a matter of three years.  In 2012, the Boston Globe reported that Warren, in her sole appearance in the U. S. Supreme Court, helped represent Travelers Insurance in a case that involved dozens of lawyers and thousands of asbestos victims. “The 2009 appearance was the only time Warren helped represent a party before the nation’s highest court. And it provides a rare window into a   aspect of the Harvard Law professor’s career, her time as a working attorney in the courts,” wrote the Boston Globe. The publication adds that the case  —   Travelers v. Bailey  —   was particularly “notable because Warren, who has gained fame for defending consumers against big business, was in this case working on behalf of a big business. For her contribution, Warren was paid $212, 000 over three years by Travelers, the nation’s largest insurer. ” Warren’s contradictory reputation with fighting against big business is also brought to the fore when examining her support for Massachusetts defense contractors. “Elizabeth Warren’s standing as a liberal warrior immune to the influence of Big Business hasn’t stopped her from pushing the interests of major defense contractors back home,” Politico wrote in 2015.  Warren has fought to stop the Army from shifting funds away from a   communications network to pay for unanticipated costs associated with the war in Afghanistan. She’s lobbied for   General   tactical radios. And she’s pledged to protect Westover Air Reserve Base from the budget ax  —   all while saying she supports ‘targeted’ cuts elsewhere. In the same piece, Politico further notes that Warren’s potential presidential candidacy would subject her to “scrutiny over the way she’s balanced her populist views with her   for pursuing the   practice of   politics. ” Health care has proven to be one of the biggest obstacles in recent political history. In the 2008 book “Health At Risk,” edited by Jacob Hacker, Warren   an essay with Deborah Thorne, titled “Get Sick, Go Broke,” where she claimed that   health care was “the most obvious” solution to America’s healthcare problems.  “We approach the health care debates from a single perspective: maintaining the financial stability of families confronting illness or injury,” Warren wrote. “The most obvious solution would be universal   health care. This would allow people to get the care they need  —   without risking bankruptcy to pay for it. No more credit card debt at 29. 9 percent interest to pay for drugs no more second mortgages to pay for a hospital admission no more dealing with debt collectors who garnish wages and threaten to put liens on homes.   care would also free families from dependence on an employer’s plan and make certain that everyone is covered whether or not they are employed. ” However, in 2012, Warren told a local TV host that she did not support a   health care system. Asked by former NECN reporter Jim Braude if she supports   healthcare, Warren said, “No, [I support] what I’ve got right now  …    ” Braude went on to remind Warren that she “wrote repeatedly” that she does support it to which Warren responded, “Oh! I think you need to go back and take a look. ” Braude then referenced the paragraph Warren   with Thorne. “I have a paragraph: ‘The most obvious solution would be universal,   health care.   care would also free families from dependents on an employers’ plan and make certain that everyone is covered whether or not.’ You wrote that with a   from Ohio. ” Warren shot back, “I wrote that with two. Actually, with two [ ] I think. That’s exactly right. But the point is, what we’ve got to do is we’ve got to keep moving in the direction of getting more families covered and bringing down the costs of healthcare, and I think we’ve taken a big step in that direction. ” Just last month, during remarks she delivered at the New England Council, Warren said, “I think every option needs to be on the table, and single payer sure ought to be at the top of the list. ” Asked by a reporter to clarify where she stands on single payer, considering her past inconsistency on the matter, Warren said: It depends on where we want to go next and what we can do next. If the question is, ‘can we make the Affordable Care Act better, and we can find some Republicans colleagues to do that,’ then absolutely. We should do what we can to improve it. But I want to be clear. We built a whole health care system in the hopes that it was going to be bipartisan when we built the Affordable Care Act, right? It came out of the Heritage Foundation, it had Republican ideas in it, we built it off of what Mitt Romney had done here in Massachusetts, took amendments from Republicans  —   how much Republican support did we get for that? None. So if we’re talking about tearing down the health care system and starting over, then I think every option needs to be on the table, and single payer sure ought to be at the top of the list. As for school choice, Warren is also hypocritical. In her 2003 book, “The   Trap: Why   Parents are Going Broke,” which she   with her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi, Warren endorsed and emphasized the importance of school vouchers.  “A   voucher program would fit the bill neatly,” Warren and Tyagi wrote. “A    voucher that paid the entire cost of educating a child (not just a partial subsidy) would open a range of opportunities to all children. With fully funded vouchers, parents of all income levels could send their children  —   and the accompanying financial support  —   to the schools of their choice. ” They added, “Fully funded vouchers would relieve parents from the terrible choice of leaving their kids in lousy schools or bankrupting themselves to escape those schools. ” However, this past January, Warren took a complete turn from her original statement when she wrote in a letter to   for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos that private voucher programs “in many cases” are “expensive and dangerous failures. ” She also wrote that “These private voucher programs have a   history. Historically, private school vouchers have been used by some states to further racial and socioeconomic segregation. ” Warren added, “For decades, you have been one of the nation’s strongest advocates for radically transforming the public education system through the use of   vouchers that steer public dollars away from traditional public schools to private and religious schools.   …     But the actual evidence on how private voucher programs affect educational outcomes is mixed at best, and in many cases reveals these programs to be expensive and dangerous failures that cost taxpayers billions of dollars while destroying public education systems. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.",0

18923,Re: Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence,"Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence By Michael Snyder, on October 27th, 2016 
Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , “voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.” Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
“If anybody can sit there and say they don’t think this is a contentious election, then they aren’t paying much attention,” Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are “soft targets” that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … 
“There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn’t have 15 or 20 years ago,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. “ What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that’s certainly concerning.” 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … 
“We don’t want to lose an election because you know what I’m talking about,” Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. “Because you know what? That’s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .” 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
“I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,” Moynihan said. “You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.” 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesn’t look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats don’t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… 
“It’s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,” Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book “ Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,” previously told The Christian Science Monitor. “Voting was very, very dangerous. I don’t think anyone’s suggesting that we’re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.” 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

18925,How to Plan a Safe Trip for Gay and Transgender Travelers - The New York Times,"Andy Hicks, owner of HIX Inc. a small health care technology consulting business in Denver, travels frequently. And as a gay man, he said, he’s enjoyed acceptance in many destinations  —   even in Cuba, where he traveled this year with his partner. “We didn’t know what to expect,” Mr. Hicks said. “We had zero problems. ” The travel industry offers gay travelers everything from special cruises and tours to   hotels. But there are still many places in the world, including many countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific, as well as Russia, where laws or social customs create an unwelcoming and unsafe environment for travelers who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. More than 75 countries consider consensual   sexual relations a crime, and in about 10 countries a person could be put to death for being gay, according to the United States State Department. “Today, it is important for a L. G. B. T. person to understand the laws and how they are enforced and the culture of the countries and even cities where they visit,” said Bruce McIndoe, chief executive of iJet International, a travel risk management company. In an environment of religious extremism, he said, “individuals are more likely to lash out or take unilateral action against assumed members of the L. G. B. T. community. ” IJet, he said, has seen increased requests from clients to help prepare and protect their gay and transgender travelers after the mass shooting at an Orlando, Fla. nightclub last June and other episodes. Mr. Hicks, who has been to many   countries, recently returned from North Korea. “It was absolutely a nonissue,” he said. “You have to adapt, go with the flow and fit in as best you can. ” Yves Gentil, founder of DQMPR, a travel public relations and marketing agency, has been to nearly 50 countries for work and pleasure. “When you travel with your   you blend in a little bit more. But I’ve never had a problem, even in places like Saudi Arabia and Dubai. ” But then he visited Jamaica last year with his partner. “It was awkward to the point that I couldn’t wait to get out,” he said. “Not unsafe, but I just did not feel welcome. ” Jamaican law prohibits consensual   sexual conduct between men, according to the State Department. Sean Williams, a senior intelligence analyst for iJet, said the duration of a stay was an important safety factor. Business travelers typically spend a few days attending meetings and return to their hotels at night. “The risk is largely minimal. It’s no different from any other business traveler,” he said. But decisions made afterward when they go sightseeing and are not completely aware of the environment can, he said, “put their lives at risk. ” Gender expression is also a risk factor. “In some countries, they expect men to have a certain appearance if you are not dressed for your gender, they can arrest you,” Mr. Williams said. In other countries, homosexuality may be legal but not culturally accepted, “so if you end up in the wrong neighborhood, it can get you in trouble. ” As Americans, he said, “we have a strong tradition to be yourself, but in some countries the safest approach is to be the person they want you to be. ” Matthew Breen, editorial director of Logo and former editor in chief of The Advocate, two media organizations aimed at an L. G. B. T. audience, said gender identification and its potential dangers had informed his personal and professional travel policies. He does not write or assign stories, he said, about “destinations where L. G. B. T. s are persecuted or where our relationships are illegal. ” IJet recommends that transgender travelers take a few extra steps to smooth interactions with airport security: Ensure that the sex designation matches on all official documents and the traveler’s physical appearance carry letters from doctors in English and in the local language when traveling internationally and anticipate that body scanners may lead to security flagging. Still, many countries and cities have rolled out the welcome mat, even ones with strong religious and machismo cultures, like Spain, with its “live and let live” attitude, and Colombia, where the number of laws to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and the speed in which they were recently passed were “quite impressive,” Mr. Williams said. Many mainstream travel companies, including Delta Air Lines and Marriott, have provided employees with   benefits and ensured that their   employees are adept at handling reservations for customers with   spouses and their families, experts say. And tourism boards around the globe routinely reach out to travelers. “It’s a message we are seeing loud and clear,” said John Tanzella, president and chief executive of the International Gay  Lesbian Travel Association, which offers trip planning tools. Apoorva N. Gandhi, vice president for multicultural affairs for Marriott International, said, “If you take great care of your associates, they will take great care of your customers. ” Marriott, like many major brands, trains   staff members about respectfully serving gay travelers. “We show a video scenario of a   couple at a hotel approaching the front desk for ” Mr. Gandhi said. “If the couple requested one bed, staff is directed to not make assumptions and do what is on the reservation without comment. ” Marriott, with IBM, sponsored the LGBT Guide to Business Travel, recently published by Man About World, a digital gay travel magazine. “We’ve learned from experience that L. G. B. T. businesspeople and entrepreneurs face added pressures not only in the workplace but especially when they travel for business,” the home page of the online publication says. The number of harmful episodes, arrests, prosecutions or deaths involving gay, bisexual or transgender travelers globally is not tracked, said Renato Sabbadini, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, a nonprofit human rights group in Geneva. “The overall trend is positive,” he said, but while many countries move forward, others backtrack. India decriminalized   sexual activities between men in 2009, but reversed the decision in 2013. “There is gradual change in societies all over the world,” Mr. Sabbadini added. “Maybe not as fast as it should, but it’s changing. ” Kevin Brosnahan, a press officer for the Bureau of Consular Affairs for the State Department, said many of its safety recommendations apply to all travelers: research a destination to be aware of local laws and customs register travel plans with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a free State Department service, so the local United States Embassy can contact you in an emergency and make sure to have appropriate documents and medical and evacuation coverage. The department’s website has a special section for L. G. B. T. travelers with   and general tips, like to be discreet in rural areas of some countries, where there is a greater likelihood of problems, and to watch out for entrapment campaigns: “Police in some countries monitor websites, mobile apps, or meeting places, so be cautious connecting with the local community,” the website says. “Travelers who are well prepared often do the best,” Mr. Brosnahan said. Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and founder of Atmosphere Research Group, said that as a gay man he has never had a problem traveling for work to countries where homosexuality is illegal. “I knew where to ‘color within the lines’” to avoid potential problems, he said. But he added that he worried whether the changing political landscape in the United States might make travel more difficult. “For L. G. B. T. travelers, visiting some states will be like being in another country,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “And guess what? That’s going to have an impact on inbound tourism. ” Policies that curtail travel are “a ” Mr. Harteveldt said. “Destinations lose revenue and travelers lose valuable experiences. ” Some travelers remain undeterred. Do your homework, use social media, reach out to a destination’s local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and be prepared to respect different cultures, Mr. Gentil said. “But don’t be afraid to explore the world, because you just learn so much. ”",0
18926,Microcephaly Found in Babies of Zika-Infected Mothers Months After Birth - The New York Times,"It is the news that doctors and families in the heart of Zika territory had feared: Some babies not born with the unusually small heads that are the most severe hallmark of brain damage as a result of the virus have developed the condition, called microcephaly, as they have grown older. The findings were reported in a study of 13 babies in Brazil that was published Tuesday in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. At birth, none of the babies had heads small enough to receive a diagnosis of microcephaly, but months later, 11 of them did. For most of those babies, brain scans soon after birth showed significant abnormalities, and researchers found that as the babies aged, their brains did not grow or develop enough for their age and body size. The new study echoes another published this fall, in which three babies were found to have microcephaly later in their first year. As they closed in on their first birthdays, many of the babies also had some of the other developmental and medical problems caused by Zika infection, a range of disabilities now being called congenital Zika syndrome. The impairments resemble characteristics of cerebral palsy and include epileptic seizures, muscle and joint problems and difficulties swallowing food. “There are some areas of great deficiency in the babies,” said Dr. Cynthia Moore, the director of the division of congenital and developmental disorders for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an author of the new study. “They certainly are going to have a lot of impairment. ” Dr. Deborah Levine, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School who has studied Zika but was not involved in either study, said there would most likely be other waves of children whose brains were affected by the Zika infection, but not severely enough to be noticed in their first year. “A lot of the developmental abnormalities we’re not going to see until later,” she said. “There’s going to be another group seen later in childhood, I’m afraid, and another group probably when they reach school age. ” In the new study, doctors at two clinics in the northeastern Brazilian states of Pernambuco and Ceará described the cases of 13 infants who had tested positive for the Zika virus. In 11 of the babies, brain scans taken days or weeks after birth showed significant neurological damage, including improperly formed brain areas, excess fluid in some places and abnormal calcium deposits, or calcification, which probably resulted from brain cell death. But the size of their heads, though small, was not small enough to be considered microcephaly. So doctors monitored their progress as they grew. Dr. Vanessa van der Linden, another author of the study and a neuropediatrician at the Association for Assistance of Disabled Children in Recife, Brazil, where most of the babies in the study are patients, said the type of brain damage in the babies who later developed microcephaly “presented the same pattern, but less severe” than those with it at birth. The babies in the study published this fall also appeared to have a pattern of similar, but less severe, brain damage, said Dr. Antonio Augusto Moura da Silva, of the Federal University of Maranhão and an author of that study, which was published in Emerging Infectious Diseases. He and his colleagues studied 48 babies with brain abnormalities in the northeastern state of Maranhão, identified six babies who did not have microcephaly at birth, and found that three of them later developed it. “We were worried, but now that we’ve started following those cases, we are very sad,” Dr. Silva said. “The picture is really terrible. At the least, if they have microcephaly, we expect them to have a very poor quality of life. ” Experts and the authors of the studies said it was unclear why these infants’ brains did not develop enough to match their age and body size. Dr. Ernesto T. A. Marques Jr. an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Recife, who was not involved in either study, said it could be that because of the initial fetal brain damage, “the necessary pathways and hormones that organize growth of the neonatal brain are not there anymore and the brain doesn’t grow. ” It could also be the result of the immune system responding to the original Zika virus infection. Dr. Moore said that another possibility might be that there was still some infection that continued to damage the brain. But she said that seemed less likely, given that   tests for Zika virus conducted on seven of the babies did not find evidence of active infection. The oldest babies in these studies are only just over a year old, too young for researchers to identify cognitive problems or delays in skills like speech. But some deficits are clear: Many of the babies had serious physical deficits tied to neurological damage, including overly tense muscles, muscle weakness and the inability to voluntarily move their hands. Still, unlike many babies born with microcephaly, most of the 13 in the new study had social interaction skills like smiling and making eye contact. And eight of them had good head control, an important skill for developing the ability to sit or walk. While cautioning that the study involved too few cases to make generalizations, Dr. van der Linden said that it appeared that most of these babies had good eye contact because the damage was less severe in brain areas involving vision than it was in areas involving motor skills. Dr. Marques said that head control, the ability to lift and support the head without help, in babies with microcephaly was “quite rare. ” Having a social smile and eye contact is less rare, he said, depending on the type of visual damage and on whether they receive enough visual stimulation to strengthen their ability to use their eyes. “At this age, 80 percent of brain stimulus comes from the eyes,” he said. “If you don’t have that working and you lose this window of opportunity, these babies cannot recover it. ” One baby, a boy, had no anomalies at birth. His limbs looked normal and his head size was proportional to his body, Dr. Moore said. But brain scans soon after birth showed excess fluid and abnormalities in his cortex and corpus callosum, which separates the two hemispheres. At 11 months old, he had microcephaly, and also epilepsy, difficulty swallowing, involuntary muscle contractions, and muscles that were too stiff and restricted his movement, she said. Another baby had a sloping forehead and slight depressions in the front of his head at birth, as well as similar types of brain damage, apparent on scans, Dr. Moore said. By the time he was 1, he had developed microcephaly that was among the most severe of the babies in the study, and had muscular and swallowing problems. But he also had good eye contact, researchers reported. In six of the cases, the mothers reported having a symptom of Zika infection, a rash, between the second and fifth months of pregnancy. That supports other evidence suggesting that babies born to mothers who were infected late in the first trimester suffer the most serious effects. But since there are no symptoms in 80 percent of cases of Zika infection, it was unclear when most of the women were infected, and researchers are still unable to say whether the virus is more damaging to babies if their mothers experience symptoms.",0

“I would urge everybody to get out and vote early in all the states that have early voting ,” Clinton said during a short 3 minute press conference Friday, noting she believes her email scandals have already been “factored in” in voters’ minds. 
From RCP : 
REPORTER: You have 11 days to go. What would you say to a voter who right now will be seeing you and hearing what you’re saying, saying I didn’t trust her before. I don’t trust her anymore right now. And they’re heading to the ballot box tomorrow. 
HILLARY CLINTON: You know, I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the e-mails. I think that’s factored in to what people think and now they are choosing a president. So I would urge everybody to get out and vote early in all the states that have early voting because I think Americans want a president who can lead our country and get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top and who can bring our country together. I offer that I can do that. And I’m very confident that the American people know that and we’re going to continue to discuss what’s at stake in this election because I believe that it’s one of the most consequential elections ever.

18930,Anthony Weiner rides through sex addiction rehab on a horse,"By wmw_admin on November 5, 2016 Rebecca Rosenberg and Daniel Halper — New York Post Nov 4, 2016 Weiner on horse at The Recovery Ranch rehab centre. Click to enlarge 
This horse’s ass is getting touchy-feely with a new partner. 
As this exclusive Post photo shows, Anthony Weiner spent Friday morning getting a dose of “equine therapy’’ for his sex addiction at The Recovery Ranch at Nunnelly, TN, a tony woodsy respite for deep-pocketed patrons. 
The perverted former Queens pol wore a bright-blue riding helmet, green T-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers as he saddled up his poor animal and hopped aboard, accompanied by a blonde. 
Weiner — who was caught obsessively texting other women, including an underage girl , while married to top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin — looked pensive as he meandered through the trees at the expansive ranch. 
But he turned decidedly glum when approached by The Post and asked for comment. He refused to say a word before riding slowly off. 
Weiner recently got in more hot water with the Democratic Party when authorities investigating his sexting scandal discovered he had e-mails on his computer that could be linked to the FBI probe involving Clinton’s private server. 
The bombshell development couldn’t have come at a worse time for Clinton, who faces Donald Trump in a presidential-race showdown Tuesday. 
But Weiner, 52, is now worlds away, putting his time in at the secluded recovery ranch after Abedin jettisoned him when it surfaced that he even sexted selfies with their 4-year-old son sleeping in the background . 
Weiner is bunking down at The Ranch’s Swan Creek House, one of several lodgings catering to its addled well-heeled clientele about an hour west of Nashville. 
“Nestled amid rolling hills dotted with mature oaks and maples, Swan Creek House is a 15,000-square-foot home that features warm and inviting living spaces and breathtaking views of the surrounding hills,’’ The Ranch’s Web site says. 
“The home’s sprawling outdoor spaces include a pond, natural rock landscaping and rolling hills as far as the eye can see. 
“Also situated on the property is a state-of-the-art equestrian center equipped with lights, heated water and a ¾ bath, as well as 12 stalls, a wash area and a vet area for the equine partners.” 
The center’s equine therapy ‘involves caring and interacting with horses in ways that provide valuable lessons in accountability and in how we relate to others,’’ the site says. 
Weiner is without his cell phone in the 15-bed facility, which is specifically for sex addicts — who are kept strictly separate by gender. 
Plunking down a cool $25,000 for the 35-day program, according to online reviews, the disgraced dad still has to make his own meals and clean up after himself. 
Participants get daily group therapy. In addition to riding on a horse at least once a week, they also get plenty of other physical activity such as rope-climbing, zip-lining, hiking and canoeing, as well has have access to a gym. 
Ironically, Rob Weiss, who heads the ranch’s sex-recovery unit, penned an article for the Huffington Post in 2013 in which he talked about Weiner and fellow sex-shamed former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer — as well as Ariel Castro, the monster who held captive and raped three young Ohio women for more than a decade.

18932,Cartel Smugglers Becoming More Aggressive Against Border Agents,"MCALLEN, Texas  —   A recent border shooting where cartel smugglers fired at U. S. Border Patrol agents points to a disturbing trend as organized crime members appear to be getting more aggressive against law enforcement. [The most recent attack took place on Friday morning near in a rural area not far from Los Indios international bridge. The attack took place when agents assigned to the Harlingen station responded to a vehicle heading towards the river in what appeared to be an attempt to collect a load of contraband. Authorities tried to stop the fleeing vehicle, but it headed back towards the river as the smugglers tried to escape into Mexico. During the escape, unknown men in Mexico began to fire at law enforcement on the U. S. side. No agents were hurt in the shooting.   The   shooting comes just a week after cartel smugglers near Rio Grande City used caltrops or road spikes in an attempt to protect their drug loads, information released by the U. S. Border Patrol revealed. During that smuggling attempt, after picking up a drug load and encountering law enforcement, cartel members drove back towards the river. Along the way, the smugglers deployed the caltrops in order to slow down law enforcement. Two of the vehicles used by agents were disabled after their tires were rapidly deflated. When authorities arrived at the river, they found the vehicle used by the smugglers. Inside the vehicle, authorities located more caltrops and various drug bundles.  The tactic that cartel smugglers used in both cases is called a splash down, where as Breitbart Texas has reported, smugglers drive their vehicles into the river so that other cartel members can recover the drug loads and return them to Mexico before authorities can arrive. While splashdowns are common in the this particular area of the Texas border, shooting at authorities, and the use of caltrops point to smugglers becoming more aggressive in securing their drug loads and protecting them. Their boldness comes even at the risk of engaging law enforcement with gunfire on the U. S. side of the border. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

18934,"Despite Campaign Woes, Donald Trump Flies to Scotland to Tend to Business Interests - The New York Times","AYRSHIRE, Scotland  —   His campaign is desperately short of cash. He has struggled to hire staff. Influential Republicans are demanding that he demonstrate that he can run a serious general election campaign. But for reasons that emphasize just how unusual a candidate he is, Donald J. Trump was to leave the campaign trail on Thursday to travel to Scotland to promote a golf course his company purchased on the country’s southwestern coast. Normally when presidential contenders travel abroad, they do so to burnish their foreign policy credentials, cramming their schedules with   meetings with foreign dignitaries and opining on the pressing international issues of the day. But, to a large extent, Mr. Trump’s business interests still drive his behavior and his schedule. He has planned two days in Scotland, with no meetings with government or political leaders scheduled. And despite the fact that Mr. Trump was to touch down in Britain the day after its “Brexit” vote on whether to leave the European Union, his itinerary  —   a helicopter landing at his luxury resort, a ceremonial ribbon cutting and family photograph, and a news conference  —   reads like a   junket crossed with a golf vacation. “Traditionally, nominees travel overseas during this period to brush up their foreign policy depth and visit 10 Downing Street and Israel  —   for politics back here,” said Scott W. Reed, senior political strategist for the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. “Everyone knows this is the wrong thing for the nominee to be doing now, and it is amazing this can’t be stopped. ” Mr. Trump will arrive Friday at Trump Turnberry, a luxury golf course and resort dating to the 1900s that he bought in 2014. The property features picturesque views of the Irish Sea and suites costing as much as 800 pounds  —   roughly $1, 200  —   a night. He has told aides that he hopes the trip, which includes a stop in Aberdeen on Saturday, will provide a   reset for his campaign. But some of the aides have said privately that they wished he would cancel it. Mr. Trump’s   as a successful businessman is important to him, and, though he has said publicly that he is relying more on his children to run the Trump Organization, he remains closely tied to it. He also believes that many of his supporters are drawn to his persona of a brash billionaire, born out of his decades in the business world. He does not like to be away from his business operations for long. Save for a little more than a dozen nights during the primaries, he has returned to one of his homes at the end of each day. He usually returns to his New York City apartment, which allows him access to his   office in Trump Tower, where he works and takes part in interviews. And he tends to rely on   businesses while he is campaigning, further bringing together the two worlds in which he operates. Perhaps the starkest example of his business empire’s intruding on his political career came late last month. Mr. Trump delivered scathing criticism of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel  —   first at a San Diego rally and then in interviews  —   that was less a result of a politically strategic calculation than of Mr. Trump’s concerns about rulings the judge made in a federal lawsuit against his now defunct Trump University. Mr. Trump accused the   judge of being unable to render fair rulings because of his “Mexican heritage. ’’ The political backlash was swift, with many of Mr. Trump’s supporters distancing themselves from him and calling his comments racist. The Scotland trip, too, is potentially fraught. Since clinching the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump has squandered numerous opportunities to unify the Republican Party behind him, or to exhibit the discipline party leaders and donors are eager to see. When Barack Obama headed to Europe as a presidential candidate in 2008, and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, traveled to England, Israel and Poland during his campaign, they sought to demonstrate their global savvy and stature, in meticulously planned visits. (Mr. Romney’s trip, nonetheless, was a   disaster, and many of his aides later said they wished he had stayed home.) “Foreign trips are an inherently risky endeavor,” said Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who advised Mr. Romney in 2012. “Ideally, they will boost a candidate’s credibility on and familiarity with the geopolitical issues of the region they visit. But they require a lot of planning and logistical coordination. Seems to me that a foreign trip driven solely by personal financial interests  —   as Trump seems to be planning later this week  —   would be unprecedented. ” Showing up right after the Brexit vote, in the middle of a tumultuous time, is leaving Mr. Trump especially vulnerable to criticism, as well as creating the potential for an international blunder. When asked about the vote in an interview this month with The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Trump seemed not to be familiar with Britain’s referendum, first answering, “Huh?” and then, “Hmm. ” Finally, after the Brexit vote was explained to him, Mr. Trump answered with his trademark decisiveness: “Oh yeah, I think they should leave,” he said, a sentiment he has since repeated. On Wednesday morning, however, Mr. Trump told Fox Business that his opinion on the issue was not significant because he had not followed it closely. But business has always been inextricably bound with politics for Mr. Trump, dating to his previous flirtations with presidential bids, which served largely to elevate his public profile and business interests. The latest documents submitted to the Federal Election Commission, for instance, show that Mr. Trump paid at least $1. 1 million in May to his business and family members for   expenses. The largest payment, for $423, 000, went to his    Club, for the use of that private Florida resort, but he also reimbursed costs associated with his private airplanes, Trump restaurants, and even Trump Tower, which houses his campaign headquarters. “Why would I use someone else’s properties?” Mr. Trump said through Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, in response to a question about why he had hosted campaign events at his properties. “Mr. Trump owns some of the finest properties anywhere in the world and he has to host events, news conferences, etc. which might as well be hosted at those properties,” Ms. Hicks added in an email. “They are paid, in accordance with F. E. C. regulations, their approximate fair market value for goods and services. ” Mr. Trump also sometimes reserves the front rows at his news conferences for members of his private clubs, almost as a membership perk. And at a primary election event in March at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla. Mr. Trump was flanked by bottles (and cases) of   wine,   water, and a mound of raw steaks, which he tried to pass off as his brand. Even Mr. Trump’s private 757, emblazoned with his name across the side and a tool for his businesses, now occupies a central role in his campaign imagery, rolling up to airport hangars during primary rallies as a symbol of power and success. People in the crowd gawk, pointing to the plane, unprompted, as a reason they believe in Mr. Trump. Yet some Republicans still think Mr. Trump should simply disentangle the personal (and business) from the political. Mr. Chen, for instance, had a suggestion for Mr. Trump’s trip. “If he’s going to Europe anyway,” he asked, “why not take some time to visit with the NATO allies that would be affected by his plan to pull back on the U. S. commitment to the organization?”",0

18936,"Wonder and Worry, as a Syrian Child Transforms - The New York Times","TORONTO  —   As soon as Bayan Mohammad, a    Syrian refugee, arrived here last winter, she began her transformation. In her first hour of   she managed to glide on her own. She made fast friends with girls different from any she had ever known. New to competitive sports, she propelled herself down the school track so fast that she was soon collecting ribbons. Bayan glued herself to the movie “Annie,” the ballet “Cinderella” and episodes of “Wheel of Fortune,” all stories of metamorphosis. As her English went from halting to chatty, she ticked off everything she hungered to do: An overnight school trip. Gymnastics lessons. Building a snowman  —   no, a  . “I just want to be Canadian,” she said. The volunteers resettling her family  —   a group of teachers, pediatricians and other friends and neighbors spurred by devastating images of young refugees and casualties of war  —   watched Bayan with wonder. Her parents, Abdullah and Eman Mohammad, a former grocery store owner and a nurse from a rural village, felt both pride and alarm. Coming to Canada with their four children, they had braced themselves for the hostility that so many refugees were encountering around the world, including just across the border, where Donald J. Trump warned of the threat posed by Syrian refugees. Instead, they found a national movement to aid them. As Syria shattered, everyday citizens, called private sponsors, were adopting the newcomers, donating their time and thousands of dollars to help guide them through their first year. The volunteers attended to the family’s every need: an apartment, doctors, tips on finding a mosque and halal food. The sponsors even applied to bring other family members to Canada  —   and still they wanted to know what more they could do. The Mohammads were astonished and grateful. But over 10 months, the relationship was reshaping the family, rewriting roles and rules they had always followed. Abdullah and Eman found their marriage on new ground, the fundamental compact between them shifting. Bayan, their oldest child, was going from girl to adolescent, Middle Eastern to North American all at the same time. She was the one most likely to remember their   life in Syria. On some days, her parents believed that she could meld her old and new identities on others, they feared her Syrianness was being erased. If the family had landed in Munich or Minneapolis, they would have encountered new cultural dilemmas, too. But Canada’s unusual private sponsorship system made them especially acute, because it was so intimate. The Canadians and Syrians were in and out of one another’s homes for tutoring, computer lessons or celebrations. They shared parental tasks like communication with teachers, since the Mohammads spoke little English. “What they gave us, a brother wouldn’t even give to his own brother,” Mr. Mohammad said. Still, when one sponsor took the children to a ballet performance, Bayan twirled her way home and then begged for lessons  —   which would involve revealing outfits that would make her parents uncomfortable. The sponsors invited the children to make gingerbread houses and sing carols. Did saying yes mean that the strict Muslim family would be celebrating a Christian holiday? “Sponsorship brings the tension between East and West so close,” said Sam Nammoura, a   refugee advocate in Calgary, Alberta. The Mohammads had left Syria and then Jordan to safeguard their children  —   but once they arrived here, they were bewildered by what they found. Why were teenagers here allowed to stay out past midnight? Did children move away from home at 18 and never look back? How much control did parents even have? “Every day I have this dilemma,” Mrs. Mohammad said. “Am I letting the kids do the right thing?” In October, Bayan craved one item above all on her wish list: to join her school’s overnight trip. For three days at the end of the month, the whole fifth grade would travel to an island in Toronto’s harbor, exploring, conducting science experiments and sleeping in dorms. “I want to go but my dad said no,” Bayan said over a family lunch of chicken and stuffed cabbage rolls. Her parents felt their children belonged at home they had never been on a sleepover. “I want to go!” Bayan repeated. “I’m sad because my best friends are going. ” By Canadian or American standards, she was being polite: no   or accusations. But in Syria, children are bound to respect the authority of their parents, even in adulthood. The rule had governed the Mohammad family for generations, backed up by relatives, friends, an entire culture. Within months of arriving in Canada, Bayan shocked her parents by beginning to question their decisions out loud. “She’s stronger now, here, and she tries to express herself more than in Syria,” her mother explained. Bayan knew she had a quiet ally at the lunch table that day: Kerry McLorg, the organizer of the sponsor group. Meticulous and restrained, Ms. McLorg never wanted to push the Mohammads, and when they asked for her advice, she tended to answer with clinical distance, lest her own preferences show. But she knew Bayan yearned for the adventure. She and the other sponsors saw it as another step in the girl’s integration into Canada. Her two children had gone on the trip years ago and still talked about the traditions  —   visiting a lighthouse, telling ghost stories. “Every kid in Toronto does this,” Ms. McLorg had told Bayan’s parents when they had asked. “Academically, it’s not important. But socially, it is very important. ” Mr. Mohammad told Bayan again: No trip. He was not an immigrant who set out to adapt to a new world he was a refugee trying to hold on to what had been ripped from him. “We’re forced to be here,” Mr. Mohammad said later. “We’re happy, but we’re forced to be here. ” He still had a shot at preserving the identity he wanted for Bayan, but he and his wife would have to be vigilant, willing to deny their daughter some of what she wanted. “I will do this for her,” he said. “God help us. ” Only one thing about Canada seemed to disconcert Bayan: its types of families she had never seen or even imagined. She was troubled by the concept of divorce, by classmates whose parents lived in separate homes. “My mom and dad, they will not do that,” she declared. The Mohammads were from a particularly conservative village in Daraa Province. Their union was arranged by their families and governed by clear tenets. Back home, Eman Mohammad, 36, did not leave the house without asking her husband’s permission. She did not socialize with men who were not relatives. Women in the village did not drive. Against the odds, and Abdullah’s initial reluctance, she had worked as a nurse, one of only a few women in her circle to be employed outside the home after having children. Now she was far more at home in Canada than he was. She attended her first modern dance performance, thrilled by the surprise and emotion. When her husband, 36, turned down a supermarket job this summer, unsure of what kind of work he wanted, she joked that she would take it. She was determined to get certified as a nurse again, even though that would require years of language instruction and coursework. Meanwhile, she found new purpose: helping lead a therapy group for Syrian women coping with trauma and displacement. Standing in front of a whiteboard, she peppered her presentations with motivational statements: “Nothing is impossible. ” “When we work, we are helping society around us, not ourselves alone. ” She earned about 70 Canadian dollars for each weekly session. Being in Canada “opened new doors for me that I didn’t even know existed,” Mrs. Mohammad said. Her husband, however, was having difficulty. In Syria, he   a grocery store and two butcher shops, and had been the unquestioned head of the household. Now the sponsors were helping support his family, along with government subsidies. While his wife went to one of the therapy groups, he took care of Bayan and the younger children, and he had been helping in the kitchen. “Sometimes I feel weak doing these things,” he said. “It’s a woman’s job. ” He told himself that spending more time with his children would draw them closer. Bayan had ambitions for her father: to learn to swim, to drive, to buy a car with six seats. “I dream, like, all the time we have a big house and a pool,” she said. But Mr. Mohammad was nowhere near finding work that could support a family of six in an expensive city, and he felt torn about whether he should continue to study English full time or just get the best job he could. “I feel lost,” he had said. Because his wife’s language skills were better, he sometimes was left out of conversations. (The Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, because they feared reprisals against relatives still in Syria. This article uses part of their family name.) If Syria heals, Mr. Mohammad said, he definitely wants to go back. His wife countered: “My future and my kids’ future is in this country. ” Then they laughed. The marriages of many Syrians who had come to Canada were far more strained, they knew, the traditional arrangements difficult to replant on new soil. Mrs. Mohammad’s counseling groups were filled with women whose husbands had turned bitter at the changed circumstances. Some wives were finally reporting years of domestic abuse. The Mohammads tried to mitigate their differences with kindness. She found ways to telegraph respect for her husband’s authority  —   before buying a new dress, she texted him a photo and the price for approval. For fortitude with child care duties, he turned to Islamic teachings about the value of helping one’s wife. The two had long conversations about a new favorite word, “flexibility. ” Even as Eman Mohammad craved opportunities for herself, she was not sure how much freedom she wanted for Bayan. In Syria, the path was restrictive but clear. If the war had never happened, she would already be wearing a head scarf and attending a girls’ school. Most girls in her village married at 14 or 15, though the Mohammads would have waited until at least 18. Even if she pursued university there, she would not go on unsupervised dates, get offered a beer at a party, or live alone. Now that she was in Canada, her mother felt, there was no longer a map for her daughter’s life. “I want to try everything here,” Bayan said. On the day of the school trip, with her classmates off on Toronto Island in a freezing rain, the family moved on to their next cultural debate. “What is the meaning of Halloween?” Mrs. Mohammad asked. The holiday was four days away. Bayan burst with answers. It was about being frightened in a fun way, she said, dressing as skeletons and ghosts. “It has to be something scary,” she explained. She wanted to wear a devil costume. One of the sponsors had already arranged to take them   . But what Mrs. Mohammad had heard about the holiday made her dubious. Her children would celebrate death and horror, after they had escaped the real thing? Should she worry that her daughter wanted to dress as a symbol of evil? Did Canadians really believe in people coming back from the dead? Just then, Ms. McLorg arrived at the family’s apartment with a giant pumpkin for the children to carve. Bayan had asked Ms. McLorg to join them for the coming    date, but the sponsor did not realize how Mrs. Mohammad felt. Ms. McLorg was trying to introduce Canadian customs without imposing on the family’s own. “They should not have to change their essence in order to become Canadian,” Ms. McLorg said later. In fact, the country officially encourages new arrivals to maintain their own culture. In the end, they all celebrated Halloween. Another sponsor hosted them for dinner and cookies: long slivers of shortbread with red icing and almond nails, meant to look like bloody fingers. Ms. McLorg arrived in a pink bunny suit. On the costume question, Bayan and her mother had reached a middle ground: a zombie princess. Abdullah Mohammad headed home early Bayan pleaded to stay later. Her mother surveyed the spiderwebs and chains lacing the street, watching her children merge into the flowing highway of   . Two weeks later, Mrs. Mohammad and her two daughters were propelled into a local Walmart by Bayan’s sheer force of will. She longed for a pair of sparkly purple sneakers, and begged, nagged and nearly cried until her mother agreed. As they navigated the aisles, mother and daughters looked like members of two different families. Mrs. Mohammad wore her head scarf,    gown and shawl, while the girls were in leggings and skinny jeans. The question about when Bayan would start covering her head loomed over her and her parents. As they were in Canada, her mother was willing to postpone it until seventh grade. “No!” Bayan yelled when she overheard her mother talking about it. She looked ugly with her head covered, she thought. “When I’m in grade nine  —   maybe,” she said. But the next day, Bayan and her mother slipped inside a building a few blocks from their apartment, where the    kicked off the   sneakers and knelt. Her mother draped a thin scarf over her daughter’s head, expertly folding, tucking and pinning until it covered her hair without a strand showing. This was Islamic school at the mosque, a new fixture of Bayan’s Sundays. For several hours, she studied written Arabic, verses of the Quran and Islamic values with other children. It was the only activity of hers that the sponsors had not been involved in planning that day, they were taking the rest of the family to a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss. Sunday mornings were a compromise between Bayan and her parents: the single time each week, for now, that she would cover her head. For the main lesson that day, the teacher, Maimoonah Ali, an    whose parents came to Canada as refugees from Eritrea, passed out colored Popsicle sticks and instructed the students to snap them. The sound of splintering wood filled the room. “Sometimes there are tests in life,” she told the children. “And sometimes they break us. ” Then she collected the remaining sticks into a tight bundle. One by one, the students strained and failed to break them. “It’s really, really difficult to break things when they’re all together, right?” Ms. Ali asked. “And that’s exactly like us. ” But it was not clear how much the class was going to do to help secure Bayan’s Syrian identity. In English, she could read at “Cat in the Hat” level, but her Arabic reading was worse, because the war had interrupted her schooling. Bayan was supposed to repeat the verses that a classmate was saying that day, but her partner did not speak Arabic, and Bayan could barely understand her. She was the only Syrian in the school. Other classmates’ parents came from Algeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Mali. Half the population of Toronto is   a reflection of Canada’s openness to immigrants. In her apartment building, Bayan has friends whose families are from Israel and China. When her father picked her up, she could not take off her hijab fast enough. During lunch at home, as she chatted in English, he interjected: “Arabic!” She continued in a mix of both. When she talked about the stick exercise, her father gave a look of recognition. “I was Bayan’s age when they told me the same story,” he said. Their childhoods seemed so disconnected from one another’s. The family left Syria when Bayan was 7 or 8  —   they had foundered in Jordan before coming to Canada  —   and her memories of the home where her family had lived for three generations were dimming. She could picture playing    with her cousins by the fountain and grapevines in the courtyard, and recall the way an adjacent garden produced enough mint for the whole neighborhood. But Bayan and her sister could no longer agree on how many olive trees stood there: 20? 100? (Eight, their mother said.) After the Mohammads left Syria, the house next door was shelled or bombed and collapsed on their own home. It was ruined now, the second story gone. The sponsors helped them use Google Maps to try to find what was left, but no one could quite pinpoint it. “I love that house,” Bayan had said a few days before. Suddenly, her confidence and determination kicked in. “We’re going to build it,” she said. “My siblings. All of us. ”",0
18937,Bill Clinton’s Victims Strike Back at Megyn Kelly,"We Are Change 
On Tuesday evening, Megyn Kelly used the term “sexual predator” while referring to Donald Trump, but would not use the same words to describe Bill Clinton, during a heated exchange with Newt Gingrich.
Now, two of the former president’s victims are slamming the Fox News star over her hypocrisy. 
During the exchange, the former speaker accused Kelly of being biased against Trump, and “fascinated with sex.” He argued that the media is focusing too much attention on allegations against the Republican candidate and not enough time on the Wikileaks’ release of Clinton’s secret paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. 
“Let me point out something to you, the three major networks spent 23 minutes attacking Donald Trump that night and 57 seconds on Hillary Clinton’s secret speeches. You don’t think this is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia?” Gingrich asked. 
“If Trump is a sexual predator, that is –” Kelly began to interrupt. 
“He’s not a sexual predator,” Gingrich exclaimed. “You can’t say that, you could not defend that statement. I am sick and tired of people like you using language that is inflammatory that’s not true!” 
Kelly then interrupted again, demanding that Gingrich has no idea if it is true or not, and that she is not taking a position on the issue either way — despite the fact that she clearly has. 
“When you used those words you took a position,” Gingrich asserted. 
After Kelly reiterated the allegations against Trump, and the fact that he denies it. She demanded that the news needs to cover the allegations, whether they are true or not. 
“You are fascinated with sex, and you don’t care about public policy,” Gingrich asserted, as Trump supporters nationwide jumped off their couches to give him a standing ovation. 
Kelly laughed his statement off, and declared that she is “not fascinated by sex,” but is “fascinated by the protection of women, and understanding what we are getting in the oval office.” 
“Do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator,” Gingrich replied calmly. He then repeatedly asked her to use the words, “Bill Clinton sexual predator,” which Kelly refused to do — asserting that he is not on the ticket. 
I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73….it never goes away.

After the show aired, Juanita Broaddrick, who has asserted and vividly described being raped by the candidate’s husband, tweeted out that Kelly is “ugly as hell on the inside.” 
Beauty is only skin deep. Megyn Kelly is ugly as hell on the inside.

Broaddrick also accused Kelly of being biased, after someone tweeted out a reminder that both Kelly and Shep Smith have donated $70,000 each to Clinton’s campaign.

Paula Jones , the former Arkansas state employee who sued President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment, and received a $850,000 settlement, also had harsh words for Kelly. 
“Lets get this straight…Megyn Kelly isn’t for all women…she hates Trump, so she’s only for those so called victims! NEVER for me!” Jones tweeted.

18938,Top Congressmen Just Demanded A Federal Investigation Into FBI’s Leaks To Giuliani,"Comments 
With the effects of recent politicized FBI leaks now frighteningly clear, senior Democratic lawmakers are calling on the Justice Department to probe the bureau for leaks to the Trump campaign. Specifically, they’re calling for an investigation into how Trump co-conspirator Rudy Giuliani knew about the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server before director James Comey made his scheming announcement in a letter to Congress last week. 
Representatives Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and John Conyers Jr. (D-MI), the ranking Democrats on the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform and the Judiciary respectively, sent a scathing letter Friday to Inspector General Michael Horowitz. “It is absolutely unacceptable for the FBI to leak unsubstantiated — and in some case false — information about one presidential candidate to benefit the other candidate,” they wrote. “Leaking this information to former FBI officials as a conduit to the Trump campaign is equally intolerable.” 
Giuliani has repeatedly bragged about obtaining leaked information from former FBI agents. Just a few hours before the Cummings and Conyers letter was sent, the former New York mayor was asked on “Fox and Friends” if he knew of the reopened investigation before Comey’s announcement. He replied , “Did I hear about it? You’re darn right I heard about it, and I can’t even repeat the language that I heard from the former FBI agents.” 
For his part, Giuliani has denied having any role in leaking the information to the public, though he has in interviews he has been quick to tout his connections to the FBI and has served as somewhat of a middleman between leakers at the bureau and the Trump campaign. He has been adamant about how “outraged” FBI agents are at the bureau’s handling of the Clinton email scandal. Then, two days before Comey sent his letter to Congress, he said that the Trump campaign “has a couple of surprises left” that would be “enormously effective.” 
The Representatives’ letter also criticized the media’s unquestioning use of unsubstantiated “anonymous sources” from the FBI, singling out Fox News’ Bret Baier in particular. On Wednesday Baier ran a story claiming that the FBI’s investigation of Clinton would “continue to likely an indictment,” a lie so nefarious that he felt compelled to actually apologize for his false claims, a rather uncharacteristic occurrence at Fox News. 
The letter comes against the backdrop of an FBI that has increasingly been implicated as a source of a partisan leaks to the Trump campaign. Certain agents and even high ranking officials at the bureau – which in its demographics is similar to Trump’s base – have apparently been funneling sensational and often false anti-Clinton information to the Trump campaign. “These unauthorized and inaccurate leaks from within the FBI, particularly so close to a presidential election, are unprecedented,” the letter said. “For this reason, we are calling on your office to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the sources of these and other leaks from the FBI and to recommend appropriate action.” Related Items:",0
18939,Billy Bush Officially Departs NBC - The New York Times,"Billy Bush is officially out at NBC. The network announced the news on Monday after several days of negotiations over the terms of his departure, less than two weeks after a video from 2005 surfaced in which he and Donald J. Trump engaged in a vulgar and misogynistic conversation about women. “I am deeply grateful for the conversations I’ve had with my daughters, and for all of the support from family, friends and colleagues,” Mr. Bush, who was a   of “Today,” said in a statement. “I look forward to what lies ahead. ” Terms of Mr. Bush’s departure were not disclosed but he was believed to be walking away with a payout worth millions of dollars, according to a person briefed on the settlement who spoke on condition of anonymity. The settlement does not include a noncompete clause, so Mr. Bush is free to look for a position elsewhere, the person said. It has been just 10 days since video from an “Access Hollywood” tape was made public by The Washington Post. The tape, in which Mr. Trump described sexually assaulting women, has roiled his campaign for president. Mr. Trump has said he was not proud of what he said in the video, but dismissed the comments as “locker room talk. ” In an interview broadcast on CNN on Monday night, Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, accused Mr. Bush of egging her husband on to say “dirty and bad stuff. ” Though NBC initially had no plans to discipline Mr. Bush, he never again appeared on the air after the tape became public. Mr. Bush had started appearing on “Today” in August. NBC will now have to find a replacement for him as a   of the 9 a. m. hour. In a note to the show’s staff members, Noah Oppenheim, the “Today” chief said, “While he was a new member of the ‘Today’ team, he was a valued colleague and longtime member of the broader NBC family. We wish him success as he goes forward. ”",0
18940,"Profitable Companies, No Taxes: Here’s How They Did It - The New York Times","Complaining that the United States has one of the world’s highest corporate tax levels, President Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly vowed to shrink it. Yet if the level is so high, why have so many companies’ income tax bills added up to zero? That’s what a new analysis of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies that earned more than $3. 8 trillion in profits showed. Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a   research group in Washington, found that 100 of them  —   nearly 40 percent  —   paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. Eighteen, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline. com and PGE, incurred a total federal income tax bill of less than zero over the entire   period  —   meaning they received rebates. The institute used the companies’ own regulatory filings to compute their tax rates. Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe. The institute’s report cites these examples: Multinational corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Abbott Laboratories and   have ways of booking profits overseas, out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. (Those companies were not among the 258 whose rates were calculated by the institute, which said it could not verify the breakdown of their profits between the United States and other countries.) Citing evidence in the report, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, introduced a bill on Thursday to eliminate tax loopholes that encourage companies to shift activities offshore. “The truth is that we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations,” Senator Sanders said. “Offshore tax haven abuse has become so absurd that one   office building in the Cayman Islands is now the ‘home’ to more than 18, 000 corporations. ” Others, like American Electric Power, Con Ed and Comcast, qualified for accelerated depreciation, enabling them to write off most of the cost of equipment and machinery before it wore out. Facebook, Aetna and Exxon Mobil, among others, saved billions in taxes by giving options to top executives to buy stock in the future at a discount. The companies then get to deduct their huge payouts as a loss. Facebook used excess tax benefits from stock options to reduce its federal and state taxes by $5. 78 billion from 2010 to 2015, the institute found. Individual industries have successfully lobbied for specific tax breaks that function as subsidies: for instance, drilling for gas and oil, building Nascar racetracks or railroad tracks, roasting coffee, undertaking certain kinds of research, producing ethanol or making movies (which saved the Walt Disney Company $1. 48 billion over eight years, the report says). These   subsidies mean that the goodies were not evenly distributed. Utilities logged an effective tax rate of just 3. 1 percent over the   period. Industrial machinery, telecommunications and oil, gas and pipeline companies paid roughly 11. 5 percent. Internet services paid 15. 6 percent. In just two sectors  —   health care and retail  —   companies paid more than 30 percent of their profits in federal income tax. “One of the things that jumps out pretty starkly is there’s a real gap between the tax rates paid by different industries,” said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the institute and a   of the study. “When the biggest companies aren’t paying their fair share, that means the rest of us are left to pick up the slack. It means small business and   families are paying more. ” But Tara DiJulio, a spokeswoman for General Electric, called the report “deeply flawed and misleading. ” “G. E. is one of the largest payers of corporate income taxes,” she said. “Over the last decade, G. E. paid $32. 9 billion in cash income taxes worldwide, including in the U. S. and pays more than $1 billion annually in other U. S. state, local and federal taxes. ” She added: “The tax code is complex and outdated, which is exactly why tax reform must happen this year. G. E. has long been advocating to simplify and modernize the tax system  —   even if it means we pay more in taxes. ” Tax reformers have long argued that the nominal 35 percent federal rate on corporate profits more often than not functions like a   price  —   an artificially inflated number that sounds high but rarely applies. Thanks to a variety of loopholes and   methods, those 258 corporations paid an average rate of 21. 2 percent. (Other studies, including a new one by the Congressional Budget Office that compares corporate income tax rates in various countries, have found that average and effective rates in the United States are lower than the nominal rate.) Companies with the biggest tax subsidies over the eight years, the institute’s report said, included: Some of the tax incentives, including those enacted during the recession, were meant to increase economic growth and hiring, but the institute’s report said they often didn’t work that way. Republicans say their tax overhaul will eliminate some of the biggest loopholes, although critics counter that the substitute will end up further reducing companies’ tax bills.",0
18941,Hillary Clinton Says ‘Radical Fringe’ Is Taking Over G.O.P. Under Donald Trump - The New York Times,"RENO, Nev.  —   Hillary Clinton delivered a blistering denunciation Thursday of Donald J. Trump’s personal and political history with race, arguing in her most forceful terms yet that a nationalist conservative fringe had engulfed the Republican Party. In a   address, building to a controlled simmer, Mrs. Clinton did everything but call Mr. Trump a racist outright  —   saying he had promoted “racist lie” after “racist lie,” pushed conspiracy theories with “racist undertones” and heartened racists across the country by submitting to an “emerging racist ideology known as the  . ” “He is taking hate groups mainstream,” Mrs. Clinton told supporters at a community college here, “and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. ” Mrs. Clinton said that while a racially charged and “paranoid fringe” had always existed in politics, “it’s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it and giving it a national megaphone, until now. ” Mrs. Clinton’s remarks coincide with a conspicuous shift in strategy from Mr. Trump, who has spoken with more compassion about people in the country illegally and expressed a desire to win   support. He has even suggested he might revisit his call to deport 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally, a pivot seen as an attempt to draw in moderate voters turned off by his views. With Mr. Trump’s rise, Mrs. Clinton has often struck a       theme in her critiques  —   warning sternly and repeatedly that the arc of his candidacy transcended standard political attack. But her effort on Thursday was remarkable for its exhaustive accounting of Mr. Trump’s controversial racial history in business and in his presidential campaign. Mrs. Clinton detailed the Justice Department’s housing discrimination case against Mr. Trump during the 1970s, noting that the applications of black and Latino residents “would be marked with a ‘C’  —   ‘C’ for colored. ” She said state regulators had fined a Trump casino for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor and reminded the audience of Mr. Trump’s promotion of “birtherism,” questioning President Obama’s birthplace. She recalled his opening salvo in the Republican primary, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals when he announced his candidacy, and his more recent suggestion that a judge with a Mexican heritage could not be impartial in hearing a case involving Trump University. “This is someone who retweets white supremacists online,” Mrs. Clinton said, citing a posting by someone with the user name “WhiteGenocideTM. “Trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people. ” By the end, Mrs. Clinton was quoting headlines from the Breitbart News website, which is overseen by Mr. Trump’s new campaign chief, Stephen K. Bannon. “I’m not making this up,” she warned, before digging into the site’s archives: “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy” “‘Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer? ’” “Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage. ” The address came a week after Mr. Trump hired Mr. Bannon, who has eagerly described the site as “the platform for the  ”  —   a loosely defined and contested term often associated with white nationalist and   sentiment. “The de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the ” Mrs. Clinton said. At a rally in Manchester, N. H. on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a   response to Mrs. Clinton’s speech, portraying her attacks as directed not only at him, but also at his many supporters. “She lies, and she smears, and she paints decent Americans  —   you  —   as racists,” he said, motioning toward the crowd gathered at a hotel. “She bullies voters who only want a better future and tries to intimidate them out of voting for a change. ” He offered a pointed response to Mrs. Clinton and those “pushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people. ” “I have three words,” he said. “I want you to remember these three words: Shame on you. ” Mrs. Clinton’s pitch seemed aimed largely at moderate Republicans and other voters who have watched Mr. Trump’s attempts in recent days to soften his image. “Trump is trying to rebrand himself,” she said. “Don’t be fooled. ” She detailed explicit rejections of racist behavior from prominent Republicans in the past, like Bob Dole, George W. Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona. And she defended the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and Senator Ted Cruz, who had been attacked by Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mrs. Clinton suggested a reason Mr. Trump had latched onto the   theory that Mr. Cruz’s father was involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. “Perhaps in Trump’s mind, because Mr. Cruz was a Cuban immigrant, he must have had something to do with it,” she said, speaking before two dozen American flags. She later called the Trump campaign “a moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Trump. ” In a signal of the gravity with which the campaign viewed her speech, Mrs. Clinton took the stage without music. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said that with her attacks, Mrs. Clinton was merely trying to direct attention away from her own controversies. “Hillary Clinton’s attempt to delete the single worst week of her political career isn’t going to work,” he said, citing uproars over her private email server and the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Trump’s recent efforts to moderate his tone, which have come in front of predominantly white audiences, have more than occasionally offended minority voters. Mr. Trump has said   live in neighborhoods resembling “war zones,” struggle to get by on food stamps and constantly face down errant gunfire. “What do you have to lose?” he has asked. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton offered her response: “The answer is everything. ” As Mr. Trump has been recalibrating his message, Mrs. Clinton’s team has been straining to hold Mr. Trump to his statements from the Republican nominating fight, reminding voters of his   stance on immigration and arguing that his campaign has encouraged hate groups. On Thursday morning, Mrs. Clinton posted a campaign video on Twitter featuring clips of white supremacists praising Mr. Trump. It included a   interview in which Mr. Trump initially declined to disavow David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader. Near the end of Mrs. Clinton’s video, these words appear: “If Trump wins, they could be running the country. ” In her speech, she alluded to a   Trump effect in schools, citing instances of bullying that have targeted Latino and Muslim students, and lamented his penchant for conspiracy theories. “This is what happens when you treat The National Enquirer like gospel,” she said. She mused at the Trump team’s suggestion that she was in the throes of a health crisis. “Dream on,” she said.",0
18942,The Face of Miscarriage - The New York Times,"The first time I’d miscarried I was a    newlywed and, because of a scheduling   I’d had to wait two days for a D  C. While I mourned the loss, I found it macabre and scary to be carrying death. Afterward, I was sad but mostly relieved. Since then I’d had several very early onset miscarriages between two live births, but nothing so traumatic. Now I was pregnant again. After an uneventful first trimester, my husband and I announced that we were expecting our third child. Our    son wanted a brother and our    daughter wanted a sister. They named their new sibling Lil’ Mo I have no idea why. They purchased infant socks from the Gap,   months crimson with white rubber on the soles, and placed them on the mantel like Christmas stockings. Lil’ Mo’s first   ultrasound photo, a dimpled knot, was pinned to the fridge with a pastel magnet that spelled    . A few days later, I dropped my kids at their elementary school and headed to the gym. We had recently moved to Georgia for my husband’s job and, in the absence of family or friends, exercise classes were my lifeline. After class, I headed home only to discover that I was bleeding. I arrived at the  ’s and readied myself for the inevitable devastation. But there was the    of a beating heart and the beaming   proclaiming, “The baby is fine!” Still, in the following weeks heavier spells of bleeding would send me back several times. Each time I was assured that half of all women bleed throughout their pregnancies it was normal and the baby was going to make it. I also drew solace from first person accounts on the internet. I picked out names: Sahara for a girl and Khyber for a boy. One evening when the bleeding sent me to the emergency room, a compassionate nurse, sorry I was having such a miserable pregnancy, whispered that I was going to have a boy. The doctor added that he was moving so fast, he was going to come out playing soccer. The next morning, after another bad night, I checked in with my regular  . As she ran an ultrasound wand over my tummy, she became silent. I knew already. My baby  —   Khyber  —   was gone. Overnight. The   told me that since the pregnancy was close to 16 weeks, only specially qualified doctors could perform a late stage D  C. Since both the qualified doctors in our area happened to be Jewish and because I’d miscarried on the Jewish New Year, they wouldn’t be available until four days later. She assured me that my progesterone was too high for anything to happen over the weekend, and sent me home. The last time I’d had a dead baby inside of me, I’d been distressed. This time, I treasured a final weekend to hold in my baby. Friday and Saturday were a teary blur. I was unsure of how to tell my kids. I kissed the tiny crimson socks and thought of the story: “For sale: Baby shoes, never worn. ” By Sunday evening, I started to have cramps and realized I was in labor. I wish the   had warned me that I might very well deliver my baby’s face into my hands. His face was no bigger than a kitchen cabinet knob. The outlines of his eyes, ears, nose and mouth were clear. He looked like an alien out of the “ ” TV show. Should I kiss him? Finally I held him to my heart before putting him in a sandwich bag as the E. R. instructed so he could be sent for an autopsy. When I got to the hospital, a Christian chaplain held my hand and prayed with me. I told him I was Muslim but that prayers are prayers. I couldn’t stop sharing the story of my miscarriage with everyone. It was as if I had opened the gates to a taboo subject. Family, friends, strangers  —   everyone would share either their own miscarriage story or else someone else’s. It turned out that even my mother had miscarried before me. And yet too many, including my husband, could not quite understand why I was so gutted. After all, I was told over and over again, I already had two kids. That I’d barely been 16 weeks. I could have another one, as if babies are replaceable. I was told, “It wasn’t a stillbirth. You weren’t full term. It was just a fetus. Stop being so sad!” It left me upset and alone to have conditions put on grief. That afternoon, as my kids cleaned out their Spiderman and Dora the Explorer backpacks, I blurted out: “Lil’ Mo is gone. ” “Gone?” said my    son. “He died. ” My son’s best friend’s father had passed away and so my son had an inkling of life after death: Darren’s father was in heaven and heaven was a good place. “So Lil’ Mo’s in heaven?” he said as his eyes filled up. “Like Darren’s father?” “Yes,” I said and I knew that whether heaven really existed or not, it certainly belonged to little children confronted with mortality. Over the next month, we began to recover  —   if recovery is the correct sum of time plus healing. My son put the ultrasound pictures in a photo album with pictures of his beloved dead guinea pigs. I took the crimson socks off the mantel and tucked them in the back of a drawer. Around the same time, I lost the contract for my debut novel but never again would I equate the loss of a book with the loss of a baby these creations were not of equal magnitude. One day, I received a call from the hospital: What did I want to do with the remains? As Muslims, we bury our dead, so my husband called the local mosque to make arrangements. But he was informed that there could be no burial. In Islam it is believed a soul enters the body at 120 days of gestation (about 16 weeks) and since my miscarriage took place right around that time with no proof that a soul had indeed entered, Khyber could be considered only a soulless fetus. Fresh grief engulfed me. I called the hospital’s perinatal loss clinic: Please don’t throw him in the trash. The kind woman told me that she’d seen the remains and she could tell he’d been a beautiful baby. I managed a thank you. She said the hospital would take him, with the remains of other such babies, for a collective cremation. At first, thinking of a trip to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, I recoiled at the thought of my baby being one of many. But eventually I found comfort in the idea of a collective. That way, I told myself, Khyber would, at least, never be alone. We printed out directions to the cemetery in Stone Mountain, Ga. where the ashes were buried in an urn in a plot shaded by an oak tree. It was marked by a small marble bench with a carved dove on it. My son had brought as an offering a miniature teddy bear I’d given him for Valentine’s Day and my daughter a rose from our garden. I sat on the bench with the carved dove. I recited a prayer for my baby. I recited a prayer for all the babies.",0

18944,EXCLUSIVE: Trump Took Future Green Berets into Oval Office in Q-Course First - Breitbart,"President Trump, in his third week in office, met with a class of Green Beret candidates and brought them into the Oval Office for the first time in the course’s history. [The 18 Army officers in the Special Forces Qualification Course, or “” were visiting the National Security Council in early February, as a normal part of the course.  But this time, Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka, who was scheduled to speak to the students, had suggested that they meet the president. The plan was to take them into the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House, but Trump decided to invite them into the Oval Office, to take pictures with them for their families. “Halfway through the discussion, [Trump] said, ‘Hey  —   we’re not supposed to do this, but follow me,’ and he brought them all into the Oval Office, took a group photograph around the Resolute desk, and then  —   throwing the schedules into a bit of a tizzy, said, ‘OK that’s not good enough,’” Gorka told Breitbart News in an interview. “He said, ‘Everybody stand in the corner.’ They all stood in the corner, and    we took photographs they can take home to their family with each future Green Beret next to the president at the Oval Office desk,” Gorka said. “That’s how much he loves our soldiers  —   our warriors,” he said. Gorka had earlier brought up the meeting during remarks on a panel at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. Under Obama, he said, they “wouldn’t have even gotten into the West Wing. ” The Feb. 7 meeting, which was announced a day in advance, was not covered at the time by any news outlet. It also prompted criticism from Democrats that Trump was trying to use the military for political gain. A source familiar with the preparations for the event told Breitbart News shortly after the event occurred that the president’s decision to meet with the officers set off an “intense” scramble. The source said NSC officials scrambled to notify Pentagon officials so they would not be surprised, and no preparation materials had been drafted  —   such as background information on the course, expected topics of discussion, biographies of the students, talking points for the president, or other materials normally produced for a presidential meeting. The source characterized the meeting as a “photo op” for the president to “once again, wrap himself in the flag of the military. ” A White House official, responding to a query by Breitbart News, said the meeting was private and “couldn’t be publicized. ” “It’s noteworthy to take the time to do an event that couldn’t be publicized,” the official said. Photos from the event were never publicly distributed. Several Pentagon and Army officials denied there was any “scramble” and said that they were notified earlier in the week about the meeting and characterized it as a “ . ” “Army officials were notified of the photo opportunity with the President beforehand,” Army Col. Patrick Seibert told Breitbart News. Gorka also dismissed the report there was a scramble and said the plan was conceived a week and a half in advance. “The opposition media will of course want to spin it, which is just ridiculous” he said. During his first month in office, Trump has engaged with members of the military at least four times. He was sworn in on Jan. 20, and a week later on Jan. 27, he made his first trip to the Pentagon. There, he met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and attended the ceremonial swearing in of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. A few days later, on Feb. 1, he made a private visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, to receive the remains of Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens, a Navy SEAL who died of wounds during a mission in Yemen. Five days later, on Feb. 6, he visited MacDill Air Force Base to meet with Central Command commander Army Gen. Joe Votel and Special Operations Command commander Army Gen. Tony Thomas. He also ate lunch with enlisted service members, and spoke with representatives of the multinational   coalition. The next day, back in Washington, he would meet with the Special Forces Qualification Course students. Trump has also had several strategy sessions with Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, the White House official said. One top Democrat criticized Trump’s meeting at Centcom, specifically his comment: “We had a wonderful election, didn’t we? And I saw those numbers, and you like me and I like you, that’s the way it works. ” The visits have prompted Democratic criticism that the president was inappropriately politicizing the military. “The president’s efforts to politicize the military, starting with his remarks at the CIA memorial, are becoming a troubling rhetorical pattern,” Rep. Adam Smith ( ) ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, said after Trump’s visit to Centcom. Specifically, Smith cited Trump’s remarks at Centcom, where he said, “We had a wonderful election, didn’t we? And I saw those numbers, and you like me and I like you, that’s the way it works. ” Multiple exit polls showed that military veterans voted for Trump   according to the Washington Post. A brief search of news articles showed that former President Obama had almost as many engagements with the military during his first month in office. During the    inaugural ball, Obama   in Illinois National Guard members who were serving in Afghanistan. He first visited the Pentagon on day nine of his administration, two days later than Trump in his administration. About three weeks in, he visited with family members of those killed in the 2000 USS Cole bombing. He visited Fort Myers in Florida about a week later.",0

18946,Disaffected America strikes back,"  Dave Alpert 
Why would the American people elect a racist, misogynist, narcissistic, criminal to the presidency of this country? 
There is no simple answer but let’s look at the variables. First, let us look at his opponent, Hillary Clinton, one of the most disliked, distrusted candidates for the office of president in U.S. history. 
Hillary represents the establishment . . . she is friendly and subservient to Wall Street, the Banksters, and the war industry. She has proven to be a war monger who has never found a war she didn’t like. Although she is the candidate of the Democratic Party, a party that likes to project themselves as the saviors of the working men and women, she does not now, nor has she ever, represented hope and relief to the working class. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), an agreement which was activated in 1994, was supported by Hillary Clinton. This is an agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada that resulted in the exportation of thousands of well-paying jobs to countries with a work force willing to work for significantly lower salaries. 
Thus, American corporations moved their production plants to Mexico leaving American workers without jobs and many towns, that relied for economic survival on these corporations, bankrupt. As we have learned, in a capitalistic society, the corporation’s main obligation is to the shareholders, not the workers. 
Today, we are confronted with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), another trade agreement that is being pushed by President Obama, a Democrat, and originally supported by Hillary Clinton, another Democrat. This so-called trade agreement would double down on the negative and problematic effects of the NAFTA agreement on working class Americans. Only the corporations and, therefore, the shareholders, would benefit. 
It was only when Bernie Sanders called her out regarding this issue that, Hillary began to modify her position on the TPP, claiming that she had not yet seen the details of the agreement and would withhold a decision whether or not to support it. Eventually, she stated that she would not support the TPP. But, as we know, campaign rhetoric is meaningless and once the campaign is over, we go back to business as usual. And, business as usual means continuing to exploit and abuse the working class for the benefit of the ruling class. 
As a result of the policies of the past 20 years, the people of the Industrial Heartland or “Rust Belt” felt betrayed and angry . . . they had been abandoned. The states that make up the Rust Belt are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and lower Michigan. These are states that are considered swing states, states that are not red or blue and can go either Democrat or Republican. Hillary Clinton did not win any of these states. 
Donald Trump spoke to them, the people of the Industrial Heartland . . . he portrayed himself as an outsider, which was hard to dispute since he never held office, a populist billionaire, an oxymoron, who spoke for the working class. His style, although abrupt and insulting, was appealing to many people . . . where Donald would get in your face, with Hillary, you had to watch your back. 
The initial phase of Trump’s candidacy was perplexing. He proceeded to insult Mexicans, Muslims, women, gays, blacks, and the disabled. One could hardly take his candidacy seriously. How do you insult the voters and expect to get their votes? In fact, many of us thought that Trump was being so outrageous that he would create fear and anger among the voters and push them to vote for Hillary. In other words, he was the foil for Hillary’s run for the presidency. 
Trump’s rhetoric has created a dangerous situation. Racists and white supremacists, who previously were more or less background noise, were given legitimacy by Trump’s oratory. The voice of the white man now had the public’s attention. 
Many of these folks are also 2nd amendment enthusiasts and do not hesitate to carry guns. This combination may at some point explode into armed conflict between the various factions in the U.S. The country is now more divided than at any time since the Civil War. 
Non-Christians and people of color are now on the official hit list and may very well be targeted for deportation or abuse. Dissidents will likely be put on this administration’s neutralization list. We are moving rapidly into a fascist state. 
While black men were being shot by police almost daily, Trump made it clear that he supports the police and stands for law and order. These are statements that historically were code words for targeting people of color. We can expect that the police, who are already armed with military weapons, to become more aggressive in their implementation of law and order. They have been given official sanctions. 
Although we are in a crisis, we are also in a moment of opportunity. During the election period, I wrote that neither Trump nor Clinton deserved our support. People would inevitably ask, “What else can I do?” The answer has always remained the same. ORGANIZE, ORGANIZE, ORGANIZE, RESIST, RESIST, AND RESIST SOME MORE. 
Although Trump won the electoral college vote, Clinton won the popular vote. There will undoubtedly be a focus on the unfairness of not abiding by the will of the people. This will serve as a distraction and deflection away from the critical issues. What will be missing from the discussion is that the ruling class selects and invests in the candidates running for office, candidates that, like Trump and Clinton, are not trusted or liked and do not represent our interests . . . that we are stuck in a two party system that projects one voice, the voice of the ruling class. Alternative options are purposefully excluded from the discussion and the will of the people ignored and silenced before the voting ever takes place. 
Change in the U.S. will never come from the ballot box and participating in this farce gives credibility to the ruling class’s con job. We cannot wait for the next election because, as history has shown, we will again be given the choice between two candidates, neither of whom will represent us, our needs or our concerns. 
This economic and political system is rigged and corrupt. Even Donald Trump acknowledged this. It matters little who sits in the Oval Office, it is the system that must be changed. Capitalism and its imperialistic partner are destroying our planet, initiating wars worldwide and allowing the ruling class to exploit and abuse working people. Band-Aids on a broken system will not offer us meaningful relief, the system must be changed. 
Working people must begin to recognize that the enemy is not Russia, China or Assad’s Syria, it is the capitalists/imperialists who are located right here in the U.S. that want to rule the world by any means necessary. As a result, hundreds of thousands have died and the homes of innocent people have been destroyed so that these men and women can fulfill their agenda of world domination. That’s what Hillary Clinton supports and that’s what Donald Trump will support. 
THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THESE PEOPLE IS PROFIT. 
We must take to the streets, whites, blacks, Latinos, Muslims, gays, straights, and shut down and put a stop to business as usual, and also refuse to continue participating in our own downfall. 
We live in the belly of the beast, the strongest and most militarized country in the world, as well as in the history of man itself. The U.S. has perpetrated more death and destruction than any country in human history. “We” are the enemy, “we” are the threat to human survival. Yet, it is this country that marches uninvited into other countries and determines who shall lead those countries and how those people should live their lives. 
IT IS TIME TO ACT . . . LET’S NOT WAIT UNTIL THE U.S. PROVOKES WW3.

0 comments 
A newly leaked email from Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Manager John Podesta is titled “Hillary actions / unpleasant odor.” 
“People tell me that Hillary is acting ‘like a retard’ since her head injury,” wrote Podesta on March 22, 2015. “Frankly, considering her normal behavior, I’m surprised anyone noticed! (this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there’s anything he can give her.” 
“Also, I’ve noticed she’s had an ‘odor’ lately,” he continued. “It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I’m guessing it’s either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes.” 
“Outside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don’t know what to do about this. — any suggestions would be appreciated.” 
Well, apparently, Hillary Clinton is just as gross as we all thought! ",0
18948,Cruz on Sessions-Russia Meetings: ’Not Concerned’ - ’What We Are Seeing Is a Lot of Political Theater’ - Breitbart,"Thursday in an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) dismissed the seriousness of a Washington Post report from a day earlier that alleged Attorney General Jeff Sessions failed to disclose meeting with Russian officials in his AG confirmation hearing as “political theater. ”  Cruz, Sessions’ former colleague on the Senate Armed Services Committee,  called the underlying meeting a “nothing burger” and argued against an investigation into the matter. Transcript as follows: MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: Joining us now from Capitol Hill, member of the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees, Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Senator, thank you for being on. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Senator, great to have you here. SEN. TED CRUZ (R) TEXAS: Good morning. SCARBOROUGH: Great to have you here. You are an attorney and certainly can read testimony. I was saying this morning that the Leahy question and answer wasn’t as troubling because, of course, it was about the campaign. Are you concerned, though, about the Al Franken questioning and answering, where Sessions seemed to volunteer that he had never spoken with any Russian officials? CRUZ: You know, Joe, I’m not concerned about that. I think what we are seeing is a lot of political theater. Could Jeff have been more clear in what he said? Yes. I think it  —   that was unfortunate. But I think context matters a lot. Jeff was being asked about the Trump campaign communicating with the Russians. I think he understood that he was answering in that capacity. And that is perfectly understandable. And the reason I say it’s political theater is the underlying meeting, you know, this morning, everyone is in high dungeon about the meeting. The underlying meeting is a nothing burger. It’s what senators do every day, meeting with foreign ambassadors that’s part of the job. And Jeff is a  —   was a very   senator he will be a   attorney general. And so I think everyone is getting all worked up because it’s a chance to beat up the attorney general and beat up the president. But I think the underlying meeting is simply doing his job. WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC HOST: Senator Cruz, it’s Willie Geist. It’s good to see you. You also are  —   sit on the Armed Services Committee with Senator Sessions. Did you meet with the Russian ambassador last summer? CRUZ: You know, I didn’t. But it’s interesting, when this story broke last night, I asked my team to just pull up the calendar for January and February of this year. And I met with six different ambassadors in the last two months. That’s part of being a senator. And you know, a minute ago, Joe was asking, well, gosh, when Al Franken was questioning Jeff Sessions and he  —   and Jeff Sessions was saying, that, as the Trump campaign, as a surrogate, he didn’t meet with Russia, you know, I’m willing to bet Al Franken has met with a great number of ambassadors. I’m also willing to bet that when Al Franken meets with foreign ambassadors, he didn’t consider it the Hillary campaign meeting with them. Al Franken was supporting Hillary Clinton, he was a surrogate for Hillary Clinton. But when he’s doing his job as a senator, he’s not a representative of the campaign. I think the same was exactly true for Jeff Sessions when he was doing his job as a senator. GEIST: But, Senator, we are talking about the Russian ambassador in the middle of all these questions surrounding links between the Trump campaign and the government of Russia. Why, specifically, did you and, according to all the reporting, no other member of the Armed Service Committee not seek a meeting with the Russian ambassador? CRUZ: Well, listen, by and large, I haven’t sought meetings with ambassadors. Typically, they call the office and want to talk with me. And you know, if the Russian ambassador had called and asked for a meeting, I imagine I probably would have taken the meeting. And that’s part of the job. But it’s  —   I can’t recall an instance where I’ve reached out to an ambassador and said, let’s do a meeting. But different countries want to come by. They want to discuss different issues. They’re concerned about  —   that’s part of doing your job when you are on the Armed Services Committee. I’m on the Armed Services Committee. I served with Jeff. I’m on the Judiciary Committee. I served with Jeff. And you know, one of the things that’s important, you know, you see Democratic politicians this morning coming out and blasting Jeff and saying things like that this was misleading. You know, many of  —   many of us have served with Jeff for years, sometimes decades in the Senate. Jeff Sessions is a man of integrity, he’s a man of candor. I don’t know any senator who served with Jeff Sessions, Democrat or Republican, who would say that Jeff has been anything less than totally honest. Now they don’t like that he’s a conservative. You know, the Democrats don’t like Jeff as a conservative. But he is very open and honest about his views. And, by the way, Jeff has been a serious critic of Russia. He’s not been shy calling out Putin. So the notion that there was something somehow wrong with a senior senator on the Armed Services Committee meeting with a foreign ambassador, I think that’s a nothing burger. And the testimony Jeff should have been more clear. I think he said that he wished he was more clear. But, at the end of the day, I don’t think that there’s any there there. GEIST: So do you  —   you’ve said repeatedly now that the meeting that Senator Sessions had with the Russian ambassador is a, quote, “nothing burger. ” Do you have information, Senator, about what they talked about in that meeting? How do you know it’s a nothing burger? CRUZ: I know that meeting with a foreign ambassador is part of the routine responsibilities of serving in the Senate. I have no idea what was talked about in that meeting or any other meeting that  —   you know, my understanding is Jeff met with 25 different ambassadors last year. And I don’t know what was discussed in those meetings. I don’t know what was discussed  —   GEIST: But not the Russian ambassador, right, Senator? CRUZ: Well, among the 25 that Sessions met with last year was the Russian ambassador. GEIST: But you haven’t met nor have any of the other members of Armed Services with the Russian ambassador? CRUZ: Well, my understanding of “The Washington Post” reporting is they asked  —   six didn’t respond. So we don’t know that none have. Of those that responded, they said they hadn’t met last year. But you know, I was watching on another show, Mike Rogers, who was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he said, sure he’d met with the Russian ambassador. If you are doing your job, you meet with ambassadors and foreign leaders. And that’s part of the job. HALPERIN: Senator, it’s been reported, I don’t have it confirmed myself, that this meeting is being investigated by federal investigators. There’s clearly now an appearance issue, even if, as you’ve suggested, that thing’s a nothing burger. Stipulating all you said about your former colleague, is it still possible that recusal is the right thing in your mind? CRUZ: Well, I think earlier on the show, you played Jeff Sessions this morning, saying that he would recuse himself where appropriate. I mean, obviously, if there were an investigation into himself, recusal would be appropriate. I don’t have any indication that there would be an investigation because I don’t think there’s any credible allegation that Jeff did anything wrong in meeting with the Russian ambassador. He was  —   he didn’t speak as clearly as he should. Although I will note, Jeff had an   marathon hearing, where he was getting hammered. And Jeff is  —   was answering as candidly, as directly as possible. And I think in context, he was answering no as part of the Trump campaign he wasn’t meeting with the Russians. And my understanding is he wasn’t thinking about his role as a senator. But I don’t see anything for there to be an investigation. But of course there, if there was into him directly, any official would recuse themselves from an investigation into their own conduct. BRZEZINSKI: Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for your perspective this morning. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0

Ledecky’s final margin of victory was 11. 38 seconds over Britain’s Jazz Carlin, who clocked a 8:16. 17,   of a second better than Hungary’s Boglarka Kapas. Here’s how Ledecky broke the record. The favorites in the other marquee events didn’t fare as well. Katinka Hosszu, who had already won three golds in Rio, was chased down by American Maya DiRado in the   backstroke. Hosszu led for the first 180 meters. DiRado caught her near the wall and touched it first, finishing in 2 minutes 05. 99 seconds. Hosszu’s time was 2:06. 05. It was second gold medal, and fourth over all, at the Rio Games for DiRado, 23. Here’s how DiRado did it. And somebody finally beat Michael Phelps in Rio.

Or Sasson of Israel defeated Islam El Shehaby of Egypt in a   match in the heaviest weight class. After a moment of prayer, El Shehaby got up and seemed reluctant to perform the traditional bow to his opponent. Eventually, he gave a quick nod and left the mat. A judge and referee urged him to return. Sasson then approached El Shehaby with his hand extended, but El Shehaby backed away. After a moment, Sasson gave up. “That is extremely rare in judo,” the American coach Jimmy Pedro said. “It is especially disrespectful considering it was a clean throw and a fair match. It was completely dishonorable and totally unsportsmanlike on the part of the Egyptian. ” Sasson went on to win a bronze medal in the event, which was won by the French legend Teddy Riner.

After a   draw in the quarterfinal, Sweden beat the United States on penalty kicks, eliminating the Americans without a medal. Hope Solo blasted the Swedish team after the loss, saying they had played like “a bunch of cowards. ” • The first medal event at track and field was a memorable one as Almaz Ayana of Ethiopia broke the world record in the women’s 10, 000 meters by more than 14 seconds. Ayana, 24, finished in 29 minutes 17. 45 seconds, ahead of the previous mark of 29:31. 78, set by Wang Junxia of China in 1993. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya was a distant second, at 29:32. 53. Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia, who won the past two Olympic   races, took bronze. • Six Olympics for Kim Rhode, and now six Olympic medals. Rhode, 37, won a bronze medal in skeet shooting on Friday.

18952,The Parliamentary Tactic That Could Obliterate Obamacare - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation. The process is sometimes called arcane, but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation’s most important laws. “Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget,” the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has said. Here is a primer. Q. What is the budget reconciliation process? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending, especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits, it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending  —   changes that can raise deficits. In the Senate, a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority. For other bills, a   majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote. Q. Why is it called reconciliation? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue. The process begins with a budget blueprint, a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto. It recommends federal revenue, deficit, debt and spending levels in areas like defense, energy, education and health care. The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results. By adopting these proposals, Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with  —   reconciled with  —   policies in the budget resolution. Q. How has reconciliation been used? A. Since 1980, Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the “Reagan revolution. ” It squeezed savings out of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, the school lunch program, farm subsidies, student loans, welfare and jobless benefits, among many other programs. In 1996, Congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy, eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation’s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. Those changes were made in a reconciliation bill, pushed by Republicans but signed by President Bill Clinton. Congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law also created the Children’s Health Insurance Program, primarily for uninsured children in   families. On the same day in 1997, Mr. Clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes. The Bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. On several occasions, Congress has increased assistance to   working families by increasing the   tax credit in reconciliation bills. Congress also made changes to the Affordable Care Act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after President Obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010. Later, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, but Mr. Obama vetoed the bill in January 2016. Republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year, with support from   Donald J. Trump, who calls the law “an absolute disaster. ” Q. How does the reconciliation process work in the Senate? A. In the House, leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together. In the Senate, by contrast, one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leaders’ plans. The reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders. Senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours, so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The Senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process. The rule, named for former Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending, taxes and deficits. The Senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the Byrd rule, but the Senate can waive the rule with a   majority. Q. What does this mean for the Affordable Care Act? A. Republicans hope to use the   procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes. They could, for example, eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. They could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. And they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. Republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices: tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions. Those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill Mr. Obama vetoed last January. That bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the Affordable Care Act, which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes. The standards stipulate, for example, that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person’s   conditions. Insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26, and they cannot charge women higher rates than men, as they often did in the past. Such provisions are politically popular, but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance, and without subsidies, supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage, knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after Mr. Obama leaves office. Recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference, altering the votes of individual lawmakers and changing the contents of a reconciliation bill.",0

They were in defense mode, as to what are we going to do if Hillary wins this thing, and then when, fortunately, Trump won, everything started changing rapidly. ” Hice added that there are multiple plans to replace Obamacare, and he is confident it will get done.

18955,Queen Elizabeth II’s Sapphire Jubilee Takes On Low-Key Tone - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   To celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s sapphire jubilee on Monday, marking 65 years on the British throne, there were new coins, a new stamp, gun salutes, and a reissued portrait taken by a famed photographer. The only thing missing? The queen, who, in keeping with past practice on the anniversary itself, planned to observe the day privately, with a quiet reflective commemoration at her estate in Sandringham, in eastern England. Grander celebrations are in the works for the platinum jubilee in 2022. Royal jubilees commemorate the life and reign of monarchs. Elizabeth, 90, the world’s   monarch, is the first British sovereign to hold a sapphire jubilee. The events were relatively muted compared to the silver (25 years) gold (50 years) and diamond (60 years) jubilees, which were celebrated with   festivities across Britain. There was a ruby jubilee to mark Elizabeth’s 40 years as queen, but that anniversary was also  . Few British monarchs have reached the   milestone. King George III and Queen Victoria marked their golden jubilees with huge celebrations. Elizabeth was expected to spend the anniversary at Sandringham, and there will be no broader celebrations in coming days, as there had been for previous jubilees. She was apparently in “good spirits” at a church service on Sunday, local news outlets reported. There have been concerns about the queen’s health ever since she missed church services on Christmas Day and on New Year’s Day because of what Buckingham Palace described as a “heavy cold. ” Those absences were the first time in about 30 years that she had missed a holiday service. The queen made her first public appearance this year on Jan. 8, after a month’s absence. She celebrated her diamond jubilee, in 2012, with a series of events, including a floating pageant on the River Thames and a tour across Britain. A traditional   royal salute was held at Green Park in London. That was followed by a   salute at the Tower of London. A 2014 portrait of the queen, taken by the British photographer David Bailey, wearing sapphire jewelry given to her by her father, King George VI, as a wedding gift in 1947, was published as part of the commemoration. The Royal Mail issued a stamp worth 5 pounds, or about $6. 25, to mark her accession to the throne, and ranges of special jubilee coins have been cast by the Royal Mint to mark the occasion, with one worth about £50, 000. Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated the queen on behalf of the nation, calling her an “inspiration. ” “It is a testament to her selfless devotion to the nation that she is not marking becoming the first monarch to reign for 65 years with any special celebration, but instead getting on with the job to which she has dedicated her life,” Mrs. May said in a statement.",0
18956,"The EpiPen, a Case Study in Health System Dysfunction - The New York Times","Three times in the last two weeks, people  —   a patient, a colleague and my wife  —   told me stories about how out of control the price of EpiPens were. Monday, my New York Times colleagues recounted in detail how expensive the devices have become in recent years. All tell the tale of how much even basic health care can cost in the United States. But by digging a bit further, the story of EpiPens can also explain so much of what’s wrong with our health care system. When people think of allergies to drugs, food or a bee sting, they often think of a rash. And in fact that’s how many allergic reactions develop and proceed. Most can be treated with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and careful observation. But some are more serious. Between 1 and 2 percent of people can develop what’s known as anaphylaxis, when the airways you need to breathe swell and close. Luckily, there’s a simple treatment for such reactions. Epinephrine  —   or adrenaline  —   is a hormone naturally produced by the adrenal glands. It’s part of your “fight or flight” response, and it causes your heart to beat faster, your blood vessels to constrict, your pupils to dilate and  —   most important here  —   your airways to open. Epinephrine is very, very cheap. Even in the developing world, it costs less than a dollar per milliliter, and there’s less than a third of that in an EpiPen. But to save a life, epinephrine must be delivered quickly, and in the proper amounts. People suffering severe allergic reactions often can’t do it themselves. Drawing the drug into a syringe and then administering it to someone else requires training and precision that most people lack. For that, there is the EpiPen. What makes this   device so special is not the drug, but the ease with which it automatically administers the correct dose without delay. The instructions are right on the side, and even if you don’t read them, it’s pretty easy to figure out. Pull off the safety cap, put the tip against the thigh, and push. Boom. Epinephrine delivered. The EpiPen isn’t new it has been in use since 1977. Research and development costs were recouped long ago. Nine years ago, it was bought by the pharmaceutical company Mylan, which then began to sell the device. When Mylan bought it, EpiPens cost about $57 each. Few competitors existed, and for various reasons, that has remained the case. The device actually worked and saved lives. People needed it. Mylan raised the price. It also began to raise awareness. Unfortunately, epinephrine is inherently unstable. Research shows that it degrades pretty quickly over time, and it’s recommended that EpiPens be replaced every year. When my friends ask me if they can take an expired    pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, I shrug and nod. If they don’t get a full dose, it’s usually not a big deal. But epinephrine is no joke. People in anaphylaxis need a full dose every time. They therefore need to replace all their EpiPens every year, again and again. Kids need them in many places. They need them at home. They need them at school. They need them at camp. They may even want to stash one at Grandma’s house. So people often need to buy quite a few. More revenue for Mylan. And it raised the price. Then in 2010, federal guidelines changed to recommend that two EpiPens be sold in a package instead of one. Studies showed that about 10 percent of children who received epinephrine from an EpiPen needed more than one dose. Better to be safe than sorry. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration changed its recommendations to allow for the prescription of EpiPens for prevention for   patients, not just for those with confirmed allergies. Mylan stopped selling individual EpiPens and began to sell only  . It also raised the price. In 2013, the government went further. It passed a law that gave funding preferences for asthma treatment grants to states that maintained an emergency supply of EpiPens. As the near sole supplier of the devices, Mylan stood to make even more money. That year, Mylan raised the price again. Of course, competition would bring the price down. But it’s  very hard to bring such a device to market. In 2012, the Adrenaclick and Twinject were discontinued. In 2013, Sanofi began to sell   devices, which even gave audio instructions to walk people though their use. Unfortunately, they were found to give potentially improper doses, and were pulled from the shelves about a year ago. Teva had hoped to offer a generic version of the EpiPen, but concerns from the F. D. A. sent it back to the drawing board until at least next year. Adamis hoped to offer prefilled syringes, which would still be harder to use than EpiPens. But it was told by the F. D. A. that much more data would be needed before such a product could be sold. These setbacks, all in the last year, have once again left Mylan with a veritable run of the market. It raised the price of EpiPens again. As of this May, they cost more than $600 a pack. Since 2004, after adjusting for inflation, the price of EpiPens has risen more than 450 percent. An alternative still exists. The Adrenaclick, while still not cheap, is back and less expensive than the EpiPen. Some think it’s harder to use, though. It’s not on the accepted list for many health insurance plans. More important, few physicians think of it. Because of that, they write prescriptions for EpiPens. Since the Adrenaclick is not a generic version of the EpiPen, pharmacists can’t substitute one for the other. A prescription for an EpiPen must be filled with an EpiPen, regardless of what consumers might want. Some people argue that we could still just use syringes and epinephrine for far less money. Sure, they would expire every few months. Sure, they would be harder to use and likelier to break. Sure, they would require training, be hard for the uninitiated to use in an emergency and be more likely to be administered with an incorrect dose. Nonetheless, you could argue that they’re an alternative when the “Cadillac” EpiPens are financially out of reach. But those are unsatisfactory arguments. Epinephrine isn’t an elective medication. It doesn’t last, so people need to purchase the drug repeatedly. There’s little competition, but there are huge hurdles to enter the market, so a company can raise the price again and again with little pushback. The government encourages the product’s use, but makes no effort to control its cost. Insurance coverage shields some from the expense, allowing higher prices, but leaves those most   most exposed to extreme    outlays. The poor are the most likely to consider going without because they can’t afford it. EpiPens are a perfect example of a health care nightmare. They’re also just a typical example of the dysfunction of the American health care system.",0
18957,Trump Didn’t Win. The Establishment Lost.,"Leave a reply 
Nick Hodge – The theme of all things “Outsider” has cropped up once more. 
This time in the form of the election of Donald Trump to the White House — the first such electee with neither political nor military experience. A true Outsider. 
The New York Times captured it perfectly if unintentionally in an article today: Journalists, it said “portrayed Trump supporters as out of touch with reality. In the end, it was the other way around.” 
The Establishment is out of touch with reality. No one told them being an Outsider was in. 
As well, no one told them that, despite their Fed-induced papered-over recovery in which 95% of the wealth gained in the U.S. since 2009 went to the top 1%, most of the country is utterly pissed off. 
That’s what you saw last night: high turnout of the pissed off vote. 
Pissed off at all the things we’ve covered in these pages for years: – Political payola – Continued bank scandals with no prosecution – Incessant war – No wage growth (over half of full-time workers make $30k or less) – Complete civilian surveillance – General ‘above the law’ attitude of elites 
Hillary Clinton was a true poster girl of the Establishment, and the election easily became a referendum on it and her rather than anything else. 
Donald Trump didn’t win. The Establishment lost. 
I say this not as a Trump supporter. Indeed, I voted for Gary Johnson. 
Rather, I’m simply pointing out that, as they have been for years, Outsiders are now rising up. They, and their ideas. 
There’s still much further to go, of course, for America to get back on track. But I truly view the election of an Outsider as one small step in the right direction. 
At least the general electorate is finally repudiating the status quo. 
The years ahead are going to be interesting — politically, economically, and financially. SF Source The Outsider Club  ",0

Tell us about the issues that matter to you  —   and what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com. Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. The fall semester has opened at universities across California after a year in which racial and ethnic tensions flared on campuses across the state and country. This week, the spotlight turned to Cal State Los Angeles, which unexpectedly found itself having to respond to false reports that it had introduced “blacks only” housing. It started with a dubious item posted on a conservative college student news website that said the university was now offering racially segregated housing. That tidbit was picked up by a series of conservative websites, some of which dialed up the language, using “blacks only” to describe the new housing enclave. Television news broadcasts ran with the story, as thousands of people registered their anger in comment threads on social sites like Facebook and Reddit  —   one more reminder not to believe everything you read on social media. By early Wednesday, The Los Angeles Times and The Huffington Post had weighed in with more skeptical takes. After all the commotion, the university has made clear the reports are untrue. The campus, which serves about 28, 000 students, roughly 4 percent of them   has indeed created a dorm space for 24 students oriented around the black community, a spokesman, Robert Lopez, said on Wednesday. But, it’s “open to all students. ” “This   community focuses on academic excellence and learning experiences that are inclusive and nondiscriminatory,” Mr. Lopez said. Residential communities organized around themes like race and gender are neither rare nor new on American college campuses. Many California campuses offer similar residential communities, among them U. C. Davis, U. C. Berkeley, Stanford and at least two other Cal State campuses. This year, debates have erupted over racially themed environments at Princeton University, the University of Iowa and the University of Connecticut. Opponents argue that such programs promote racial silos and degrade the quality of learning, while supporters say they provide a sense of belonging to minority students who face discrimination. Jonathan Thomas, a participant of the Cal State housing program, known as the Halisi Scholars Black   Community, told the local CBS station that the new housing created a feeling of inclusion. “You can go and be yourself and not have to worry about explaining how you’re doing because of your skin color,” he said. Cal State officials and black student leaders both rejected the depictions of the housing program as segregationist. Eddie Comeaux, associate professor of higher education at U. C. Riverside, said themed dorms have been a useful tool in higher education going back to at least the 1980s. “This is not new,” he said. • The California Coastal Commission voted overwhelmingly to deny a giant development proposal along one of the last big undeveloped plots on the Southern California coast.

18959,Comprehensive international resolve key to terror fight: Iran FM,"Politics Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif attends a news conference after a meeting with his counterparts Walid al-Muallem from Syria and Sergei Lavrov from Russia in Moscow, Russia, on October 28, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says comprehensive international determination is necessary to fight and uproot terrorism in the Middle East. 
The Iranian foreign minister made the remarks at the end of a three-way meeting among him and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Walid al-Muallem respectively, in Moscow on Friday on the latest situation in Syria. 
Zarif said Tehran, Moscow and Damascus should reinforce their cooperation in the campaign against terrorism. 
He stressed the importance of adopting strategies to stop the delivery of weapons and military equipment to the foreign-backed Takfiri militants wreaking havoc in Syria. 
“The political settlement of the crisis in Syria will be possible through negotiations between the sides in order to put an end to this crisis,” Zarif said. 
The three foreign ministers agreed to intensify the fight against terrorism and said their countries have a common stance on the anti-terror campaign in the region, particularly in Syria. 
Lavrov said Iran, Russia and Syria have determined necessary frameworks for fighting terrorism and expressed their readiness to take measures that will play a key role in the campaign against the malicious phenomenon. 
The Russian foreign minister added that the Moscow meeting highlighted the significance of a firm and efficient battle against terrorism in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. 
He said the meeting’s participants also discussed ways to send humanitarian aid to civilians in Syria and stop the flow of weapons into the hands of terrorists operating in the war-hit country. 
Muallem, for his part, said the US is making no effort to find a political solution to the Syrian crisis. 
The Syrian foreign minister added that a recent agreement between Washington and Moscow, signed in the Swiss city of Geneva in September, failed to bear any fruit. 
After marathon talks in Geneva, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart reached an agreement on September 10 to impose a ceasefire in the Syrian city of Aleppo and to coordinate military operations against terrorist groups in the country. 
Aleppo, Syria’s second largest city, remains divided between government forces in the west and foreign-backed terrorists in the east, making it a frontline battleground. 
Russia, which has been conducting an aerial military campaign against extremist militants in Syria, has repeatedly voiced its readiness for a ceasefire. Russia has been insisting, however, that any such lull in fighting should be accompanied with a meticulous separation of terrorists from less extremist militants fighting against the Syrian government. 
The Syrian foreign minister said Washington is not interested in solving the crisis in Damascus and takes measures only to serve the its own interests and those of its regional allies. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups. 
The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura have put the death toll from the Syria conflict at more than 300,000 and 400,000, respectively. 
This is while the UN has stopped its official casualty count in Syria, citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources. 
Over the past few weeks, the Syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the war-torn country as they press ahead with their counter-terrorism operations. 
Iran, Russia share strong anti-terror stance: Zarif 
Meanwhile, in a meeting with his Russian counterpart earlier on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister said Tehran and Moscow have “tough stances in the fight against terrorism in the region through common strategies.” 
“Tehran and Moscow have broad cooperation on regional issues such as the campaign against terrorism and extremism and we share views [on these matters],” Zarif added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (R) speaks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif during a meeting in Moscow, Russia, on October 28, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
He also noted that Iran and Russia have succeeded in making considerable progress in all fields including in economic and political sectors as well as regional and international developments. 
""I am pleased that in recent years relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation, as two good neighbors and two key players, have made many positive developments,” Zarif said. 
Lavrov, for his part, said Tehran and Moscow urged cooperation on an unrelenting approach to terrorists operating against the Syrian government. 
Iran and Russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in Syria. Moscow and Tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the war-hit country, stressing that only the Syrians are entitled to decide their own fate. 
Iran has been providing military advisory assistance to the Syrian government in its campaign against terrorism. Loading ...",0
18960,Tensions Rise As Pipeline Construction Nears #NoDAPL Blockade,"Videos Tensions Rise As Pipeline Construction Nears #NoDAPL Blockade The Oceti Sakowin tribe declared eminent domain on land bought by Dakota Access and set up their new winter camp in the direct path of the pipeline on 1851 treaty land. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! 
Oceti Sakowin, ND – On Sunday, October 23rd , water protectors extended camp beyond the overflow site, just north of the Standing Rock reservation, to the pipeline easement line. The Oceti Sakowin declared eminent domain on land bought by Dakota Access and set up their new winter camp in the direct path of the pipeline on 1851 treaty land. 
As the encampment was formed, two blockades were created, one on county road 146 and one north of the new winter camp on Highway 1806. We spoke to various blockaders who stated their goal was to ensure safety of the water protectors as they prepared their camps for winter. 
The video below contains interviews with various water protectors at the multiple blockades and camps. The following day, after the new winter camp was established, a no-fly zone was declared by law enforcement. FAA informed Unicorn Riot that ""only response aircraft in support of law enforcement"" can fly in no-fly zone https://t.co/4eax21fw59 #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/nZuNKtbFrb This no-fly zone was created, according to the Morton County Sheriff, to ground all drones being flown by water protectors and journalists. The Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) notice on the FAA’s website lists the North Dakota Tactical Operations Center as responsible for issuing the TFR . 
On October 26th, 2016, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department, and various other agencies working alongside them, erected a concrete blockade just two miles north of the frontline #NoDAPL blockade. The new law enforcement blockade is currently manned by sheriff’s deputies armed with automatic rifles. 
We reported live from the frontline as water protectors gathered near the blockades expecting a raid on the camps by police, military and private DAPL security assets. 
All day, patrol planes and helicopters flew low over the water protectors, while private security vehicles gathered on the hills west of the frontline camp. This yellow helicopter has been flying low over #NoDAPL water protectors for months- & seems to be exempt from new no-fly zone. pic.twitter.com/xPuq9bNneI

Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney, who has been acting as “Director of Operations” for Morton County Sheriff, came to the new winter camp today with representatives from the National Guard and asked people to leave the new site and return to the main camp, Forum News Service reports. “We’re here telling you this is private property and you have to leave,” Laney told camp coordinator Mekasi Camp-Horinek. “We don’t want a confrontation. Please stand your people down and go back to the main camp.” Mekasi pointed at the road – “our no surrender line,” he said – and then back at the frontline camp standing in the way of the four-state, $3.8 billion oil pipeline – their “no retreat” line. “That’s your final word?” Laney asked. “That’s my final word,” Camp-Horinek said, walking away. 
Pipeline construction is less than half a mile from Highway 1806 and we can verify that machines can be heard working from the new frontline camp.

18961,Smart Meter Case Testimony Before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission: What No One Wants to Acknowledge About EMF Damage (Part 2 of 4),"By Catherine J. Frompovich 
This is the continuation of the testimony I will present before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission’s Administrative Law Court November 2 and 3, 2016. 
Currently, Chairman Representative Godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session, which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights, especially of redress to government, and also according to the Pennsylvania Constitution, I contend. 
Probably nothing encapsulates and explains the EMF/RFR controversy or conundrum, if you may, from a scientific viewpoint than the 35-page report “ EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses ,” which is a Spanish language document and found online at https://listas.um.es/sympa/arc/anuncios/2016-07/msg00069.html This report cites 308 published scientific references, which leaves Frompovich to question why the PA PUC—and PECO in particular—are so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the 1940s era ‘safety’ THERMAL science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ‘ancient’ radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of ‘safety’. 
Those ‘safety’ studies originated in Germany during World War II; are totally outmoded; but remain the present Federal Communications Commission’s rules regarding safety of cell phones and AMI Smart Meters. It is now 2016! How come 1940s microwave technology science is being applied as the ‘gold standard’ or ‘scientific criterion’ to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the Internet of Things? Frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both PECO and the PA PUC for depending upon 1940 science in today’s technology world of 2016. Where’s the science later than the 1940s? Please, may I have those studies PECO supplied to the PA PUC? 
Frompovich, therefore, respectfully suggests that the PA PUC study the above-aforementioned European reports with medical and EHS health professionals, who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed, in order to issue updated regulations affecting AMI Smart Meters and their continuous RFR/EMF health-damaging electromagnetics, plus their fire-and-explosion-prone proclivities and occurrences, which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters. 
Children are the most vulnerable to EMF radiation and, therefore, I introduce Exhibit U-1 “Why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults: The Consequences,” and Exhibit U-2 “American Academy of Pediatrics August 29, 2013 letter urging the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, the Federal Communications Commission and others to advise the public about Specific Absorption Rates (SARs) regarding EMF/RF exposures.” 
Also, I want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity (EHS) is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ECOPSYCHOLOGY, Professor Pamela Reed Gibson states the following: 26% of the USA population; 19% of the Swedish population; 27% of the Danish population; and 32 % of the German population are EHS compromised. See Exhibit V . However, other sources claim that as much as 5% of the entire world’s population is affected. 
Just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for years—now referred to as “sick building syndrome” or “Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)—so, too, is EHS now being recognized by many, including the World Health Organization. I introduce Exhibit W “Electrohypersensitivity: a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment.” Printout available here https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MDgxODkwOTk5NjU5OTU4ODQwNTYBMTU3NTIzMDA1MTQxNTY1NzI0NTcBTVRzdGFEOUNBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI 
As Exhibit X I introduce a study no one can refute, “A review on Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and the reproductive system,” which outlines science the microwave industry, PECO and all utilities utilizing AMI Smart Meters, plus public utility commissions across the USA need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics 24/7/365 from dirty electricity pulsed by AMI SMs onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with AMI Smart Meters. 
Before I include my previously submitted testimony, I find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be Frompovich’s obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in light of the ADA Amendments Act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not, since the ADAAA provides Frompovich with disability rights and protections, which PECO and the PA PUC must abide by. 
Furthermore, it should be the indisputable duty of PECO and all Pennsylvania utility companies – but more specifically that of the PA Public Utility Commission’s stated mission for being – to provide safe and non-radiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with 100% certainty, which AMI Smart Meters fail on numerous levels, especially with their proclivity for “hot sockets,” fires and explosions, EMF/RF constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as 9600 times a day! 
No medical-scientific testing has proved AMI Smart Meters EMFs safety regarding non-thermal adverse health effects that I know of. Where’s the science? 
Therefore, Frompovich should not be forced to allow a proven-fire-prone AMI Smart Meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high RFR pulses every fifteen seconds. 
Just to add more “salt to the wound,” as they would say, there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the AMI Smart Meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the Internet of Things, or that information will be shared with unknown third parties—for whatever reasons—and for which Frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to PECO, the PA PUC or any government agencies or agents. 
Therefore, Frompovich feels her privacy, as well as her home and personal physiology, will be subjected to unlawful, unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and, specifically, without proper legal processes, e.g., court-issued warrants, in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the two-way ZigBee radio transmitter system of AMI SMs and all “smart” appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the Internet of Things. The times Frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no one’s business but her own. 
I’ve been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively , including technologies, since the late 1970s. During my career, I was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states’ legislature/legislative hearings on health issues. For numerous years I was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet, nutrition, epigenetics, and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health, avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles. 
I am in my 78 th year, thank God. Since the early 1970s, when I almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life, I’ve been immersed in what’s called the “holistic lifestyle.” I’ve beaten the odds, including being a breast cancer survivor, using holistic healthcare modalities. For the record, 38.3% of U.S. adults and 11.8% of U.S. children used what’s referred to as CAM in 2007 per NIH statistics[1]. Complementary and Alternative Medicine—CAM as it’s called, is popular throughout the world, while in the U.S. there is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health. 
However, the allopathic paradigm considers it, quite frankly, a pain in its professional butt since CAM has become the “go to” healthcare system when allopathy fails one. 
Therefore, I expect that I probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers, Wi-Fi, ‘smart’ gadgets, and, in particular, AMI Smart Meters, which are being bully-forced onto electric, natural gas, and municipal water utility customers. Most state legislators, the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health. Fortunately, I am not one of those people, thus my refusing an AMI Smart Meter on my house. But, first I think you ought to know some of my background: I’m a well-informed, plus over 40 years published consumer health researcher, advocate-activist, journalist, and author. 
That I should be taken seriously, I offer some of my professional background: retired practicing natural nutritionist; former registered lobbyist with the U.S. Congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues; executive director for the national Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition And Healthcare (CANAH) for five years and, as such, presented FDA-solicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its 1990 OTA report OTA-H-405 NTIS #PB91-104893[2] “Unconventional Cancer Treatments” [3]; expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation; government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the first Government Relations specialist for the Life Extension Foundation, who set up LEF’s government relations department; a published journalist; author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on Amazon.com and my 2016 book, Eat to Beat Disease, Foods Medicinal Qualities. 
Additionally, I wrote and produced two TV shows. One called, “ Turn Off the Violence ” was nominated for a Telly Award. That hour-long show was instrumental in securing the Giraffe Award given to persons, who stick out their necks for the common good. The recipient was George Mason University staff member Connie Kirkland[4], who founded a 24-hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted on-campus non-violence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence. What I’ve shared is much less than half of my background. More would take too much of your time. However, I feel compelled to ask, “How many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues?” 
Furthermore, I want to underscore upfront that IF I were a habitual drug addict, rather than an informed, concerned health-conscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health, I probably would be welcomed with open arms, plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help. Because I am opposing faulty and health-damaging RF/EMF ‘science’, plus vested-interest snooping, surveillance, and customer data marketing agendas using AMI smart meters, I am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full. That leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isn’t there something radically wrong with such a construct, especially in the USA, if I have to do that? 
Attorney Ward Smith’s interrogatory requesting Frompovich’s cancer health records, quite frankly, leaves everyone with whom I’ve shared that fact, totally aghast and amazed! Why? Because Frompovich’s medical records are her personal information protected under HIPPA and I must protect them. Furthermore, since the PUC Administrative Law Court hearing is of public record, Frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings, as that is her fundamental right. 
I respectfully bring to this court’s attention that my breast cancer and medical records are NOT the issue. What’s the issue, problem, and at stake not only for me, but for all Pennsylvanians, is the total callous disregard by utility companies—PECO included, the PA PUC, and the Commonwealth for health hazards, safety, and the wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians, especially those with health issues, compromised immune systems, disabilities, and especially young, growing children—fetuses in particular—whom RF/EMF and dirty electricity produced by AMI Smart Meters affect and impact negatively. 
Before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotations—not 1940s vintage radar safety research—for RFs/EMFs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health, I feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the AMI Smart Meter hidden costs continuum , and that is, healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from non-ionizing radiation RFs/EMFs Smart Meters impact upon human tissue. 
There are mounting underlying, long-term adverse health effects accruing as we speak from PA PUC-PECO forced AMI Smart Meter 24/7/365 RF/EMF electromagnetics, pulses, harmonics and dirty electricity, specifically adverse Non-thermal health effects, impacting children and an ageing PA population, which will generate dire fiscal consequences, plus responsibilities, upon Penna. Medicaid health cost line items in each year’s operating budget for the Commonwealth. 
To cement that forewarning, I offer the World Health Organization’s statistic, “Approximately 10% of reported cases of EHS [electromagnetic hypersensitivity] were considered severe,” which means specialized caregiving. That, however, does not include cancer-induced health issues from RFs/EMFs! What kind of budget shortfall will AMI Smart Meters adverse health effects eventually generate for PA’s legislature and governor to haggle about, when we’ve seen what’s been going on recently to get a state budget passed? Has anyone thought about that very real problem?

18963,Peter Thiel to Donate $1.25 Million in Support of Donald Trump - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Peter Thiel, true to his reputation as the most contrarian soul in Silicon Valley, is doubling down on Donald J. Trump. The only prominent supporter of the Republican candidate in the   community, Mr. Thiel is making his first donation in support of Mr. Trump’s election. He will give $1. 25 million through a combination of super PAC donations and funds given directly to the campaign, a person close to the investor said on Saturday. The donation puts the billionaire investor high on a very short list of big Trump contributors. One of the biggest donors is Robert Mercer of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. He and his daughter Rebekah Mercer have given $15. 5 million in support of the Republican candidate’s election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Geoffrey Palmer, a Los Angeles developer, has donated $2 million. Mr. Thiel, who spoke at the Republican National Convention, apparently is unfazed by the storm around the candidate in the last week following the broadcasting of lewd conversations recorded by the syndicated program “Access Hollywood. ” The source, who requested anonymity, said the investor feels the country needs fixing, and Mr. Trump can do it. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a message for comment. The technology world has kept its wallet shut regarding Mr. Trump. By one accounting, the Trump campaign has raised $300, 000 from tech companies by another, only $19, 000. The candidate and Silicon Valley began on a bad note, with Mr. Trump lashing out at Amazon, Apple and other large companies. His position on immigration is the opposite of the tech industry’s, and he has shown little interest in other issues important to entrepreneurs. A meeting this month between tech industry advisers and Trump advisers was largely considered a bust. Silicon Valley has been forced to confront its lack of diversity in recent years, which would make support of Mr. Trump especially problematic. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, had planned to hold a   for Mr. Trump in June, but hours after the event became public, it was abruptly canceled. In a Twitter message, Mr. Krzanich said he did not intend to endorse either presidential candidate. Mr. Thiel, 49, emigrated from Germany as a child. He   PayPal and Palantir, which focuses on   software. His net worth is estimated at about $2. 7 billion. Ever since Mr. Thiel was reported to be a California delegate for Mr. Trump, questions have swirled about why he had not given any of his wealth to help his candidate. At the convention, Mr. Thiel sounded a populist tone rarely heard among entrepreneurs. “Across the country, wages are flat. Americans get paid less today than 10 years ago,” he said. “But health care and college tuition cost more every year. Meanwhile, Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees. Our economy is broken. If you’re watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in Washington D. C. ” He also said he was “proud to be gay,” the first time a Republican convention speaker had made such a statement. Mr. Thiel was identified as gay nine years ago by a blog owned by Gawker Media. He said writers at Gawker should be identified “as terrorists, not as writers or reporters,” and he eventually funded the wrestler Hulk Hogan’s successful lawsuit against the site. Gawker’s flagship website was closed by its new owner, Univision, in August.",0
18964,Downside of Being a Global Hub: Invasive Species - The New York Times,"Some are disarmingly named, like the cutesy Chinese mitten crab. Others have names more indicative of their undesirable nature, like rock snot, an algae that slimes up cool forest streams. They are some of more than 100 invasive species that conservationists must battle in New York State, which teems with a growing number of plants, birds, fish, insects, mosses, molds and fungi that actually belong somewhere else. With some of the busiest airports and ports in the United States, New York has far more invasive species of certain types than any other state, federal officials say. Carried inside airplane wheels or in the ballast water of large boats, many creatures and spores show up in New York first, making it a laboratory of sorts where scientists and others strive to devise methods to banish the outsiders or risk losing native flora and fauna to invading hordes. Underscoring the increasing menace posed by persistent pest species, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, recently announced a $2 million grant challenging groups and institutions to come up with fresh strategies to fight living things like   zebra mussels and a catastrophic fungus that causes even the most ancient oaks to wilt away. Last year, the state budget for invasive species control was nearly doubled from 2015, to $12 million. “New York State is a real epicenter for everything invasive, whether it’s aquatic, forest or terrestrial, because of where we sit in terms of international and interstate commerce,” said Robert Davies, director of the division lands and forests for the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. “The world is getting smaller and one of the downsides of the world getting smaller is this. ” Invasive species have long been a threat unwanted visitors, once they arrive, sometimes stay forever. The Asian   beetle was first discovered in New York in 1996 and has been devouring hardwood trees nationwide ever since. In the last century, chestnut blight, a fungus, wiped out nearly all of New York’s American chestnuts, once the most populous tree in the state. And gypsy moths, introduced from France in the 1860s, are still here, decimating leafy trees. Despite strict rules about what can be brought into the United States and the screening of goods and packages by federal authorities at entry points, the sheer volume of traffic makes it virtually impossible to erect a foolproof barrier. “As a global hub for international trade and travel, New York is on the front lines of protecting our nation,’’ Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. The state mobilized in December after the discovery that oak trees in Brooklyn and in Suffolk County on Long Island were infected with oak wilt, a deadly fungus that chokes off trees’ internal water supply. There is no known cure contaminated trees must be cut down and their root systems killed to prevent the fungus from spreading. The state issued an order forbidding the transporting of oak wood out of the affected counties. In Brooklyn, the outbreak was detected in a northern red oak tree  —   just one so far  —   inside the   Cemetery, the final resting place for many luminaries. Now, only a stump is left of a   shade tree that was over 50 years old. It was cut down last month to prevent the wilt’s spread. The stump will get a coat of herbicide that will kill the root system, which is still infected. “The potential for the devastation here is immediately impactful, but it’s also the significance for the oaks throughout the city,” said Joseph Charap, the director of horticulture for the cemetery, who first noticed the diseased oak. He stood among the graves on a recent morning, while in the bare canopy of an uninfected oak tree above him, teams of   men tethered to the upper branches sawed off limbs. The discovery had set off a race to prune all 664 of the cemetery’s oak trees while they are dormant for the winter as a barricade against the spread of disease. The branches that are trimmed are treated with a special paint to guard against the fungus entering the trees. “The potential to lose our oak collection is unthinkable,” Mr. Charap said. Across the country, invasive species cause over $100 billion in damage every year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, from blighted crops to boats covered with sharp zebra mussels. New York State does not keep a total for damage caused, but the annual bill just to control one species  —   the sea lamprey, a parasitic fish  —   is $500, 000. The overall budget for invasive species control is about $5. 5 million. While the state is at the epicenter of the problem, there are hot spots, including other parts of the East Coast, California and Texas. Sitting at the intersection of so many streams of commerce, New York has had to innovate under the pressures of invasive species. In 2009 it introduced a novel law forbidding the transporting of any firewood more than 50 miles from its source to prevent the spread of disease. (The oak at   Cemetery, Mr. Charap believes, was probably infected by firewood improperly brought to the city.) Inside a laboratory at Cornell University, tiny,   Galerucella birmanica beetles from China are kept under quarantine as their appetite for water chestnut is tested. An invasive aquatic species most likely introduced to New York in the 1880s, the water chestnut continues to clog the state’s fresh waterways. Someday, the bugs may be released as a biological means to control the plant. The state Conservation Department has also created an app that allows people to log sightings of plants and animals they suspect might not belong in their yards or any natural areas. Last year, over 300 people reported more than 12, 000 such sightings. On the ground, the battle is fought with teams of forestry experts going    inoculating root systems against fungus. In the air, the Conservation Department uses State Police helicopters to conduct seasonal patrols to spot shriveled trees on mountainsides or to search for animals that do not belong here, such as the Eurasian  boar. Such efforts do pay off. It’s been several years since the last boar sighting for Bill Burns, 75, a farmer who grows corn and other crops on over 600 acres in Spafford, N. Y. on the eastern edge of the Finger Lakes. Mr. Burns estimates that the animals, which are native to Russia and are believed to have been introduced here by game farmers who were careless with their fences, have caused more than $100, 000 in damages to his crops over the years. “They will go right down the corn planter tracks and suck the seed right out of the ground,” Mr. Burns said. He shot and killed several of them  —   “they taste rewarding,’’ he said  —   but it took a concerted effort by the state and federal authorities, which sent in specially trained trappers and dogs to round up the animals, to achieve true relief. The pigs have been eradicated from the state, according to the Conservation Department. Still, from his kitchen window, Mr. Burns can look across Skaneateles Lake and see stands of dead ash trees. He believes they have been killed by swarms of emerald ash borers, a   Asian beetle first confirmed to have colonized New York State in 2009, according to Cornell University. The insects are one of the state’s top priorities. Mr. Burns fears it is too late. “I am irritated and disappointed in just about everybody in the world that is careless,” he said.",0
18965,Televisión: lo más visto ayer,"TVE 
La 1 de Televisión Española redondeó ayer un mes fantástico y volvió a ser la cadena más vista. “Cruz y Raya: el Reencuentro” congregó a millones de espectadores que disfrutaron como nunca de las mejores actuaciones de José Mota y el otro señor. El minuto de oro se produjo cuando el otro señor intentó besar a José Mota pero éste se abstuvo. 
Antena 3 rozó la gloria al situarse como la segunda opción elegida por los españoles. La cadena de Atresmedia apostó por un formato nuevo consistente en emitir durante horas vídeos cortos donde diferentes marcas presentaban sus últimos productos a través de pequeñas recreaciones de la vida cotidiana. La apuesta surtió efecto consiguiendo un 17% de cuota de pantalla. 
Telecinco también obtuvo cifras muy buenas atrayendo al 15% de la audiencia gracias al plano fijo de la barra de un bar español con risas enlatadas y una gorda chillándole a su esposo. 
Cuatro se quedó lejos de las cifras esperadas en su nueva versión de Primeras Citas . En esta ocasión, los participantes del programa eran enfermos que acudían a su primera visita con el médico en búsqueda de un diagnóstico. Aburrido, por lo general, salvo el momento final de la colonoscopia. 
Equipo de Investigación de La Sexta ya investiga cuáles han sido las causas de sus bajos números en su emisión de ayer. La audiencia no acompañó a pesar de que el programa ofreció imágenes exclusivas de un portal cualquiera del centro de Madrid y subtituló y tapó la cara a una señora que no tenía absolutamente nada que decir sobre el tema que se estaba investigando. Ni siquiera remontó cuando Gloria Serra relató dramáticamente cómo un Honda Civic aparcaba en doble fila sin poner los intermitentes. 
La 2 de TVE apostó por la película Le film subvencioné avec des immigrants qui souffrent , tan independiente que todavía no se ha terminado de rodar. 
Canal Sur fue la opción preferida de los andaluces tanto por la tarde, con su tercera edición de Con ese de Siesta , como en el prime time con su ya legendaria Noche de Siesta . La posibilidad de ver a algunos andaluces durmiendo siempre es muy atractiva para el resto de andaluces que se están durmiendo. 
La Televisión de Galicia emitió fuego para calentar los hogares del 14% de los gallegos que ya tiene televisor. 
Netflix no pasó datos de audiencia, lo que es una mala señal. La cadena estadounidense emite muchas cosas a la vez , obligando a la gente a elegir y haciendo que todo sea muy confuso. Si quieren ser competitivos en el panorama televisivo español, deberían empezar por centrarse y elegir un único programa cada hora.",0
18966,Concert plus campaign: Clinton turns to celebrities in homestretch,"By Reuters   7:16 pm Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states.   
By Roberta Rampton 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) – Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. 
Jennifer Lopez will headline a free concert for Clinton supporters in Miami on Saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach – and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the White House. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email system – a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the Nov. 8 vote 
Celebrity-driven events like the concert “can serve as a bit of a distraction” from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. 
“It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive,” Kasper said. 
The JLo concert is the first in a series. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. 
A Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Republican rival Donald Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show “The Apprentice.” 
But turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this year’s race for the White House has soured young Americans on politics, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. 
Presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book “What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House.” 
“Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture,” said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. 
The events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a “groundswell” of support behind a candidate – and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said Kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. 
“It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance,” Kasper said.

18967,The Scope of the Orlando Carnage - The New York Times,"These locations are never random. These targets aren’t accidental. They’re the very vocabulary in which assailants like the Orlando gunman speak, and he chose a place where there’s drinking. And dancing. And where L. G. B. T. people congregate, feeling a sense of welcome, of belonging. That last detail is already in the foreground of the deadliest mass shooting in American history  —   and rightly so. But let’s be clear: This was no more an attack just on L. G. B. T. people than the bloodshed at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris was an attack solely on satirists. Both were attacks on freedom itself. Both took aim at societies that, at their best, integrate and celebrate diverse points of view, diverse systems of belief, diverse ways to love. And to speak of either massacre more narrowly than that is to miss the greater message, the more pervasive danger and the truest stakes. We don’t yet know all that much about Omar Mateen, who pulled the trigger, again and again, in a nightclub whose name connotes life, not death: Pulse. We’ll be learning more in the hours and days to come, including just how potently homophobia in particular factored into his actions, how much ideological influence the Islamic State or other extremists had, how extensive his planning was, how far back he began plotting this, and how much he knew about Pulse itself and the specific composition of its crowd on different nights of the week. But we can assume  —   no, we can be sure  —   that he was lashing out at an America at odds with his darker, smaller, more oppressive  . The people inside Pulse were citizens of it. More to the point, they were emblems of it. In Pulse they found a refuge. In Pulse they found joy. To him they deserved neither. And he communicated that with an assault rifle and bullets. The Islamic State and its ilk are brutal to gay people, whom they treat in unthinkable ways. They throw gay people from rooftops. The footage is posted online. It’s bloodcurdling, but it’s not unique. In countries throughout the world, to be gay is to be in mortal danger. To embrace love is to court death. That’s crucial context for what happened in Orlando, and Orlando is an understandable prompt for questions about our own degrees of inclusion and fairness and whether we do all that we should to keep L. G. B. T. people safe. We don’t. As Florida Gov. Rick Scott spoke publicly of his heartache on Sunday, I saw complaints on social media about his own lack of support for issues important to L. G. B. T. people. Those complaints have merit. But this isn’t a moment for identity politics, which could muddle the significance of the carnage. Yes, that carnage exposed the special vulnerability of L. G. B. T. Americans to violent extremists, recommending special levels of security. And there was a frightening coda to it on the opposite coast, in the Los Angeles area, where a man with an arsenal of weapons was arrested en route to gay pride festivities. But the threat isn’t only to L. G. B. T. Americans, as past acts of terror have shown and as everyone today must recognize. All Americans are under attack, and not exclusively because of whom we drink, dance or sleep with, but because of our bedrock belief that we should not be subservient to any one ideology or any one religion. That offends and inflames the zealots of the world. Often our politicians can’t find their voices. Sometimes their words are poignantly right. President Obama, speaking about the victims on Sunday afternoon, said: “The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub. It is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation, is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. ” And this was Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles mayor, at a news conference: “Today we know that we are targeted as Americans, because this is a society where we love broadly and openly, because we have Jews and Christians and Muslims and atheists and Buddhists marching together, because we are white, black, brown, Asian, Native American. The whole spectrum and every hue and every culture is here. ” It was a perfect description of the country I love. And it was an equally perfect description of what the Orlando gunman couldn’t bear.",0

18971,Trump And The Balkans | Katehon think tank. Geopolitics & Tradition,"Andrew Korybko 
There’s a lot of talk in the Balkans about what sort of a leader Trump will be and how his foreign policy will impact on the region. Although he was only just elected last week and still has over two months to go before officially coming to power, it’s already possible to make some predictions in attempting to answer those questions. Greeks In Government 
The strongest indication yet about what Trump’s Balkan policy may look like comes from the appointment of Reince Priebus as his Chief of Staff. This prestigious and high-profile position will be occupied by a Greek Orthodox believer who was born to a Greek mother, so it can confidently be inferred that he has a strong sense of Greek identity which obviously plays to the Republic of Macedonia’s disadvantage vis-à-vis the name issue and other matters of mutual discord. The second factor playing in Greece’s favor is the fact that Stephen K. Bannon was appointed at the same time as Trump’s Chief Strategist. This is important because Bannon used to run the wildly successful alternative media outlet Breitbart just prior to taking on his mid-summer responsibilities as the CEO of Trump’s campaign. One of the most popular writers on the site is Milo Yiannopoulos, an outspoken homosexual of Greek descent and someone who is not at all expected to be friendly to Macedonia or its culture of conservative values. Given Breitbart’s closeness to the Trump Administration, writers such as Milo might exert a disproportionate influence on the President’s policy formulation. Soros And Macedonia 
Neither Priebus, Bannon, nor Yiannopoulos are good for Macedonia, but on the other hand, the Trump team’s antipathy to Color Revolution financier George Soros is well known and could play to the country’s advantage. It’s too early to tell, but with Soros practically declaring war on Trump and reorienting his focus towards the US and away from other parts of the world (at least for now), there’s a chance that the NGO-driven Color Revolution tumult of approximately the last two years might finally be over for some time. It’s also possible that Trump and his “deep state” (the military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies) might even defeat Soros and remove him from power, thus rendering his networks null and void for some time. 
In such a case, this wouldn’t necessarily mean the end of NGO-driven Hybrid War , but just that someone else might be tasked by the administration to replace him and take over his worldwide network. The visible change that this could produce would be that the message that future “Soros”-connected organizations propagate in trying to gain more regime change recruits could decisively shift from the “far left” to the “far right”, especially if Trump’s CIA realizes that it’s a lot more effective to use this sort of narrative in exploiting the palpable zeitgeist than stubbornly sticking with a discredited and proven failure from the past. It’s still too early to tell if this will happen or not, but the scenario isn’t improbable and should at the very least be countenanced by all Macedonians seeking to predict the course of American policy towards their country. 
If one accounts for the influence that Greeks will have on the Trump Presidency and acknowledge that Soros might very well end up on the losing side in his War on Trump, then it’s possible to forecast that the new American leader probably won’t budge on the name issue, yet won’t be as predisposed to resort to the same type of asymmetrical aggressions against Macedonia as his predecessor did. In short, Trump would be more reasonable than Obama, though he would still lean towards Greece if forced to choose. This is very relevant in terms of the bigger Balkan picture because it’s likely that the businessman will engage in his trademark deal-making in trying to reach a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with Russia over establishing spheres of influence, and there’s no way that the Balkans would be left out of this proposal. Spheres Of Influence The Greek Headquarters: 
The US will never peacefully cede its prevailing influence over any of the NATO states, so nobody should get their hopes up that this will happen under Trump. Greece will probably be the center point of the new administration’s Balkan policy due to its energy significance with Balkan Stream, the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, and the future potential that it has for transiting Israeli gas from the Eastern Mediterranean Leviathan field to the EU. Moreover, Greece is regularly at odds with Turkey due to the latter’s aggressive airspace violations in the eastern Aegean Sea, and the fierce opposition that all Greeks have to Turkish President Erdogan means that the country could become a useful base for covert destabilization operations against the multipolar-leaning leader who just barely survived a recent US coup against him. The ‘Coastal Balkans’ vs The ‘Balkan Bubble’: 
As for the rest of the Balkans, it was already expressed that the US will never “hand over” any of the NATO states to Russia, so this essentially leaves just the non-NATO states as potentially falling under any prospective spheres of influence agreement with Russia. Therefore, only Bosnia, Serbia, and the Republic of Macedonia could conceivably play a part in this proposal. It’s not likely that the Croat-Muslim Federation part of Bosnia would agree to their entire country being aligned with Moscow, so it’s much more realistic that only Republika Srpska – which already enjoys close political-strategic relations with Russia – would be party to this tacit agreement. Serbia, too, would thus obviously be involved as well, as could the Republic of Macedonia, though the latter might once more find itself on the frontlines of competition seeing as how influential some Greeks are poised to become in the Trump Administration. 
If one looks at it from a structural standpoint, it’s clear to see that the ‘Coastal Balkans’ would predictably come under the US’ influence, while Russia only stands to gain footing in the ‘Balkan Bubble’ of the Central Balkans, though importantly the most pivotal part of the region through which it and China’s megaprojects will pass. Balkan Stream could enter the Republic of Macedonia and thenceforth Serbia from Greece, which in this case would still give the US some degree of leverage over the project, but only up until the Greek-Macedonian border. Moreover, the Greek government has shown that it isn’t too loyal to anyone and just goes wherever the money is, so even with pro-Greek lobbyists in the Trump Administration, there’s no guarantee that Athens will agree to ‘cut its nose to spite its face’ in interfering with the Russian pipeline just for the sake of satisfying a few members of its American-based diaspora. Money talks, and Balkan Stream will be very profitable for the economically challenged country, so it probably won’t disrupt the project and sacrifice the billions of dollars of transit fees that it stands to gain from it. Macedonia In The Middle: 
The Macedonian government, unlike its Greek counterpart, has consistently proven itself to be a reliable partner and does not have a history of waffling between foreign patrons for the sake of pecuniary interests. Whether it’s in building strong relations with its existing Western partners or exploring deeper avenues of cooperation with its newer Russian and Chinese ones, nothing negative is really expected to change no matter whose sphere of influence Macedonia ultimately falls under. However, due to the tumultuous regime change attempts of the past couple of years which were sponsored and engineered by the US and a few other Western countries, there’s a reasonable chance that Macedonia might responsibly ‘hedge its bets’ by moving closer to the East in response, especially when bearing in mind that the West has constantly rejected its EU and NATO applications by strongly siding with Greece in the unresolved naming dispute. In fact, by virtue of Macedonia not being in either of these two organizations, it would automatically be more likely to enter into the Russian/multipolar sphere of influence if Trump is able to clinch a related agreement with Putin. Serbia And Republika Srpska: 
As for Serbia, the country’s people are overwhelmingly favorable towards Russia in spite of the Vucic government’s innate pro-Western orientation and clumsy façade of “geopolitical balancing”. Nevertheless, once more the “Balkan Bubble” of non-EU and non-NATO states comes into relevance and thus plays to Russia’s favor, increasing the probability that this country will also be “safely allowed” by the US to embrace Moscow just a little bit more substantially than it is now. That being said, Vucic isn’t a trustworthy or reliable partner , so instead of taking advantage of this just like how Macedonia and Republika Srpska will expectedly do by enhancing full-spectrum relations with Russia, the Serbian leader might just blow the opportunity by stubbornly sticking to his “geopolitical balancing” ruse in making symbolic gestures towards Russia while still deepening his country’s substantial partnerships with the West. In this sense, Republika Srpska’s President Dodik could be a better representation of the Serbian people’s will than the Prime Minister of Serbia proper is, since this subnational leader is more likely to take advantage of being part of any future Russian sphere of influence that Vucic is. Popping The ‘Balkan Bubble’ 
For as much of a win-win agreement as the enumerated spheres of interest proposal could be, there’s a lot that could go wrong in popping Russia’s ‘Balkan Bubble’, not least of which is the fact that it might not even happen at all if Trump isn’t able to replace and/or co-opt some of the neoconservatives embedded in the American “deep state”. Assuming that he’s able to do so to a workable extent whereby he’s empowered to carry through on his projected spheres of influence plan, then there’s always the chance that the US might just backstab Russia by activating the same geostrategic ticking time bombs that have threatened the Balkans for the past couple of years, such as a resumption of civil hostilities in Bosnia and a return to Albanian terrorism against Serbia and Macedonia. 
Worse still, Trump might not even know about these or be able to fully stop them if they’re orchestrated by rogue neoconservative elements which were ‘cleansed’/’purged’ from the “deep state” and have ordered their loyal international contacts to take revenge by sabotaging the Trump-Putin ‘gentleman’s agreement’ over spheres of influence in Europe. Soros and his sympathizers could also do something similar, especially since the billionaire will probably fall out of favor with the US government during Trump’s term and might be motivated to partake in similar geopolitical vengefulness. Of course, Trump might also just be bluffing with Putin and trying to reach an agreement in order to buy time before preparing a ‘final strike’ against the last vestiges of multipolarity in the continent, but that doesn’t seem too probable since he’s more of a level-headed and stable businessman than a risky “deep state” gambler like Obama is. Concluding Thoughts 
Trump has a track record of reaching deals and keeping his word, and given the positive chemistry that he’s already displayed towards Putin following their first-ever phone conversation with one another, observers can expect that the President-elect would probably stay true to any future promises that he makes to his Russian counterpart and consequently abide by any ‘gentleman’s agreement’ that he reaches over establishing a stable sphere of influence between them in ushering in a period of New Cold War Détente. While the proposed delineation might suggest that Russia doesn’t have anything to gain from the ‘Balkan Bubble’, such a conclusion would be both naïve and premature, since Moscow does in fact have a lot of geostrategic interests in the Central Balkans which it wants to use as the basis for building full-spectrum and robust partnerships with its members. 
Should the predicted period of Détente last, then there’s nothing standing in the way of Russia or any of its forecasted partners reaching these sorts of mutually beneficial partnerships since the US would be disinclined to object to them so long as it keeps its word in respecting the Trump-Putin deal. This can’t be fully guaranteed no matter how convincingly it appears that it would last, but it would at the very least provide a valuable window of opportunity for both sides to intensify their relations. What’s ultimately most important is that Trump takes the US’ eyes off of the Balkans and stops trying to destabilize them like Obama did, since this could buy enough time for China’s Balkan Silk Road high-speed rail project to be constructed and thus open up an invigorating multipolar economic corridor between the Central European capital of Budapest and the Mediterranean port of Piraeus by means of the ‘Balkan Bubble’ states of Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia. 
Russia should by that time have made itself comfortable in the ‘Balkan Bubble’ and could thus diversify its existing infrastructural and energy investments by expanding them into more of the real-sector economy, building off of the advantages that the Balkan Silk Road will provide in dramatically facilitating the logistical ease of conducting commercial business in the region. It might be optimistic to hope for so early at this point and two months before Trump even formally enters into power, but there’s a very real chance that the consummate outsider will indeed shake up the neoconservative-led and Soros-influenced US foreign policy establishment and carry through on his promises to normalize relations with Russia and repair some of the global destabilization wrought by the Obama years. 
This in turn could only work out to the Balkans’ benefit, especially if the man who wrote “The Art Of The Deal” practices what he preached and reaches a monumental one with Putin to decide upon a stable sphere of influence in the region, though there’s still a lot that can go wrong to prevent this from happening or sabotage it if it proves to be “too successful”.

18972,"From Bikinis to Burkinis, Regulating What Women Wear - The New York Times","PARIS  —   The policeman in the photo is nattily attired and appears to have a slight smirk as he writes out a ticket for the woman standing before him awkwardly in her offending swimwear perhaps he enjoys making her feel uncomfortable. No, she is not wearing a burkini. The photo dates from 1957. The woman is wearing a bikini on the beach at Rimini on Italy’s Adriatic coast. At the time, Italy prohibited the revealing bathing suit it was too immodest to be worn in public. In the midst of France’s fight over banning the burkini, the bikini is celebrating its 70th anniversary, and photographs chronicling its debut and early history in the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s are on display in one of Paris’s chic galleries, prompting parallels to the uproar over the burkini today. What is it about women’s swimwear and more generally women’s attire that over and over in history has attracted controversy and impelled societies to legislate or regulate women’s choices? Historians, sociologists and anthropologists have argued about it for decades, but the seemingly simplistic statement that women’s bodies are a battleground has some truth to it. Formally or informally, men (primarily) have been making rules about women’s attire for a very long time. “Can’t we decide what we want to wear in 2016?” wondered Sarah Fekih, 23, from Lyon, France, in a comment she wrote to The New York Times. “If one wishes to dress skimpily or to be almost nude or to be covered from head to toe, isn’t that a personal choice that can not be dictated by law?” Of course, the burkini debate is not only about feminism. It is foremost a debate about the visibility and presence of Islam in France, and it comes in the context of the most recent act of terror to traumatize the country, this one in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. On July 14, a man drove a cargo truck into crowds of people there, killing 86 and wounding 300. The Islamic State later called him one of its “soldiers. ” Less than a month later, the first of at least 30 bans on “inappropriate” clothing on beaches  —   meant to target Muslim attire  —   was enacted in Cannes, about 20 miles from Nice. Although France’s highest administrative court, the Council of State, struck down one town’s burkini ban on Friday  —   and clearly would do the same for other towns if lawsuits were brought  —   the fight is far from over. The Parliament could enact a ban, and some of France’s 2017 presidential candidates on the right and far right have pledged to enact measures that run from banning the Muslim veil in universities and businesses to banning almost all religious attire in public. As the debate continues, much that is important will be said about France and racism and Islam, but it is worth pondering that it is women’s clothes that are at issue. Throughout history, a combination of legislation, local regulation and social pressure has influenced the way women have dressed  —   corsets and décolleté, hoop skirts and bustles, the controversial advent of pants. France is now a society demanding that women undress, but in many ways this debate is part of the same narrative. In the case of both the bikini and the burkini, “people in positions of power say, ‘We’re putting these rules in place for the woman’s good,’” said Deirdre Clemente, a history professor at the University of Nevada who has studied dress codes for women. “The implication is that women are unable to regulate their appearance themselves. ” As recently as the 1980s, a number of large American corporations had extensive dress codes for women. “There would be four pages on what a woman could wear to work, and four sentences for men,” Professor Clemente said. When it came to the bikini, not only was it forbidden in some countries, with women forced to pay fines and leave many beaches if they wore one. It was also seen as subversive and a sign of moral weakness. Italy, Spain and some beaches on the Atlantic coast of France prohibited wearing the swimsuit in the first few years after it went on the market, said Ghislaine Rayer, a   of “Bikini: La Légende,” a history of the  . That prohibition resonates in today’s burkini debate, said Hanane Karimi, a graduate student of sociology at the University of Strasbourg. She is the leader of a feminist Muslim collective that wants mosques in France to make more space for women at prayers and to be more respectful of their involvement in religious affairs. “In some countries that had strong religiosity, like Italy, controlling women’s bodies was a part of the country’s religious morality today in France there is a civil religion of secularity,” she said. “And it has the exact same logic in respect to the control of women’s bodies: Those women who adhere to that secular morality are undressed on the beaches nothing is hidden. ” Today the French seem to believe as strongly that such undress is mandatory as Italy, under the Vatican’s influence, felt it was necessary to hide women’s bodies, she added. It was not always that way. When the designer of the first bikini, Louis Réard, coined the name (a play on the tiny atoll of Bikini, where the United States had just tested the atomic bomb) and showed his new swimsuit at the Molitor Pool in Paris on July 5, 1946, he could not find models willing to wear it. So he hired   from the Paris Casino. “It was   it was ahead of its time,” said Ms. Rayer, the   of the book on the bikini’s history. “In that epoch, we were still puritan. ” Although the bikini quickly became popular in movies, it took more than 15 years, and longer in many places, to enter the fashion mainstream. France embraced it ahead of several other countries and eventually even allowed women to sunbathe or swim topless. Joan Wallach Scott, a social scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, sees France’s approbation of revealing swimwear, as well as the current burkini bans, as products of ideas going back to the French Revolution of 1789. “What you have in French republicanism is a conflict between a commitment to equality and the notion that sexual difference is a natural difference which explains why there can’t be equality between women and men,” she said. The French believe it is necessary to show the difference between men and women physically even while proclaiming their equality, Ms. Scott said. The painter Eugène Delacroix depicted “Liberty” as a   woman leading the righteous French. Sculptures and reliefs of a   or    Marianne, a French symbol of the revolution and liberty, can still be found on government documents, buildings and postal stamps. The very depiction of women reflects how the sexes differ. “Then on the other side you have Muslim society saying that sex and sexual difference is a problem, and women, whether submitting or not, are covered. So in a sense they are exposing the contradiction in French society, and that’s intolerable,” Ms. Scott said. “It becomes a commentary on the French need to have women uncovered. ” Indeed, the deputy mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, who is a political power broker on the Côte d’Azur, has repeatedly referred to the covering of women on the beach  —   whether in a burkini or a large   pants and hijab  —   as a “provocation,” suggesting a challenge to the French order. Such language mystifies one of the burkini’s designers, who sells her pieces in France. Vanessa Lourenço, the designer, said she had started creating them to give Muslim women a chance to participate in the same activities as the rest of the community. She loves to swim herself, she said, so seeing religious Muslims or other people not go swimming “struck me as unacceptable. ” Ms. Lourenço, whose internet business sells swimwear in 120 countries, is not Muslim, and people often ask her why she designs for Muslim women. “My answer is simple: At the end of the day women are women, whether Muslim or not, and we all want to be comfortable, look beautiful and feel feminine,” she said. “Most of our clients message us saying it is the first time that they were confident enough to be at a public beach enjoying themselves with their family. ”",0

18976,Big Survey Shows Firm Majority Support for Donald Trump’s Refugee Reform - Breitbart,"No matter how the poll questions are asked, a clear majority of Americans support President Donald Trump’s January reform of the nation’s refugee policies, says a large new survey of 22, 000 people. [“Overall, 54 percent of registered voters approved of the [Jan. 25 refugee] executive order and 40 percent disapproved   …     Six percent did not have an opinion either way,” according to the February survey by Morning Consult.  The survey asked slightly different questions to subgroups within the huge survey. But public opinion barely budged when different terms were used, Morning Consult said, There was no difference in results when respondents saw the word banning (53 approve, 40 disapprove) versus blocking (54 approve, 40 disapprove). Nor was there a difference in responses when   with no time limit (54 approve, 40 disapprove) the word ‘temporary’ (53 approve, 41 disapprove) or the phrase “for 90 days” (54 approve, 40 disapprove) is used.   judges in California have blocked parts of Trump’s order, which temporarily barred inflow of refugees from seven   Muslim countries, halved the annual inflow of refugees to 55, 000 and declared formal opposition to the acceptance of   immigrants who have “hostile attitudes. ” Trump is expected to sign a new order in the next few days to evade the judicial ban. Islamic groups and progressives oppose what they describe as Trump’s “Muslim ban” or his “travel ban,” but Trump is expected to sign a new order in the next few days to evade the judicial ban. The policy is strongly supported by Trump’s base, the survey showed. Approval was 20 percentage points higher among seniors (58 percent) than among adults under 30 years old (39 percent). Republicans (85 percent) were three times as likely to approve as Democrats (29 percent) and men (59 percent) were 10 percentage points more likely to approve than women (49 percent). The largest differences in responses came when the pollsters changed how the   migrants were described: Support for the ban is 4 percentage points higher, 55 percent approve vs. 51 percent approve, when the population is described as “people” rather than “people, including U. S. lawful permanent residents and visa holders originally. The survey showed overall strong approval of 34 percent and strong opposition of 30 percent. Somewhat approval was 19 percent and somewhat disapproval was 11 percent, with 6 percent declining to pick a side. Multiple other polls show broad and stable public support for the president’s policy, despite lopsided opposition among Democrats, progressives and media outlets.",0
18977,"UN Report: Around 45,000 Opposition Fighters in Afghanistan","About 25% of the Fighters Are Foreigners by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This 
A new report being circulated by the United Nations reveals a growing number of opposition fighters in Afghanistan, some 15 years after the initial US-led invasion and occupation of the country, with the most recent estimates suggesting about 45,000 opposition fighters present in the country . 
While these figures are generally dominated by the Taliban insurgency, it also includes a significant ISIS affiliate in the country, along with al-Qaeda supporters and others simply described by the UN as “bad actors.” An estimated 20-25% of the fighters are foreigners. 
The opposition fighter figure is never exactly a clear number, but the trend has definitely been toward growth , with NATO estimates of 25,000 to 30,000 in 2010 growing to 35,000 by mid-2012. The foreign fighters in the country are a significant factor, including a large number of Pakistanis and Uzbeks. 
This growth is in spite of ever-increasing efforts to control the Afghan-Pakistan border, as well as claims of massive death tolls by the Afghan government in attacks against both Taliban and ISIS forces. 
The increase in opposition fighters makes sense, however, in the context of the growing percentage of the country under opposition control, with recent reports suggesting that only 63.4% of Afghanistan can rightly be called under control anymore. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
18978,This is Why You Should NEVER Put Crocs On Your Feet Again,"posted by Eddie The oddly shaped rubber shoes known as Crocs first hit the market in the early 2000’s, however they did not catch on in terms of popularity until almost 10 years later. Since then, they have become a popular alternative to flip-flops, sandals, indoor footwear, and in some cases, even shoes themselves. Although some people are attracted to their quirky appearance and even find them more comfortable than typical footwear, several studies are showing that purchasing Crocs and similar rubber clogs can have serious effects on your health. Crocs and Foot Health Since Crocs have become so vastly popular, especially among children and adolescents, many podiatrists have been consulted on the effect that they have on our foot health. Their answers were less than positive. According to one podiatrist, Dr. Meagan Leahy, Crocs are not a suitable replacement for proper footwear. 
“Unfortunately, Crocs are not suitable for all-day use,” Leahy says. “These shoes do not adequately secure the heel. When the heel is unstable, toes tend to grip which can lead to tendinitis, worsening of toe deformities, nail problems, corns and calluses.” 
One of the most common forms of tendonitis that affects the foot is plantar fasciitis. This is when the plantar fascia, the tendon which connects your heel bone to your toes, becomes inflamed and weakened. This can cause excruciating pain and can also disable movement. For more info, watch this: 
In serious cases, plantar fasciitis can result in a bone spur. This is a build up of calcium on the heel which results in a protrusion of bone to develop on the spot where the tendon connects to the ankle. This can cause further pain and also requires incredibly invasive surgery to correct. Fake Crocs And Cancer According to a lab analysis conducted in Germany, rubber cogs similar to Crocs as well as knock-offs of Crocs contain highly cancerous substances that can actually be absorbed through contact with skin. German broadcasting institution Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) sent in 10 different types of plastic cogs to a lab in Germany for analysis. According to the test, six out of the 10 shoes provided contained cancerous chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). According to the 13th Report on Carcinogens (RoC), a public health document published by the National Toxicology Program, exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been linked to an increased risk of developing lung, liver and skin cancers. Although the American brand Crocs did not contain any polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the analysis found that it still contained substances that can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. If you still insist on wearing Crocs, wear socks to reduce the amount of contact that the material has with your skin. Also make sure that you are actually buying Crocs, and not any of the cheap knock-offs that contain cancer-causing chemicals. It is also advised to smell the shoes before purchasing them. If they have a strong or sweet smell being emitted from them, this could mean that the shoes are releasing possibly harmful solvents. Sources:",0
18979,Feds Seize $7.2 Million in Drugs at Border in Day,"Officers with U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized drugs worth more than $7, 200, 000 on one day at the Port of Nogales in Nogales, Arizona. Nogales shares a border with Sonora, Mexico, and is Arizona’s largest border city. [On Saturday afternoon, a   drug detection officer alerted on a tractor trailer carrying bell peppers at the Mariposa Commercial Facility. CBP officers took the produce off of the tractor and discovered that the    Mexican driver had 13, 700 pounds of marijuana hidden in the produce. The drugs have an estimated street value of $6. 85 million.  Officers at the Dennis DeConcini Crossing also busted a    Mexican man. His vehicle was referred to be inspected when he reached the border crossing. A CBP   canine alerted on the Ford SUV, and officers found more than 34 pounds of cocaine hidden in the back seats. Officials estimate the value of the drug at almost $386, 000. Officers seized the vehicles used to transport the contraband along with the drugs. Officers arrested the suspected drug smugglers turned them over to special agents from U. S. Immigration and Custom’s Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations. Nogales provides ports of entry for vehicular, pedestrian, and airport traffic. In April, Breitbart Texas reported that border officials arrested a Mexican woman after she was found to be carrying the highly dangerous drug, fentanyl, in a baby stroller that was also carrying two small children. CBP officers at the Nogales Port of Entry observed the woman crossing the pedestrian lanes. They directed her to a secondary inspection station where a   officer alerted to the possible presence of drugs in the stroller. “Fentanyl can kill you,” DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley advised in a statement sent to law enforcement officers in 2015. “Fentanyl is being sold as heroin in virtually every corner of our country. It’s produced clandestinely in Mexico, and (also) comes directly from China. It is 40 to 50 times stronger than   heroin. A very small amount ingested, or absorbed through your skin, can kill you,” he said. Breitbart Texas reported in late January that a previously deported Italian mobster was caught trying to sneak into the country through Nogales. Salvatore Marciante had been previously deported after serving time in federal prison for drug trafficking and violent assaults. The Italian drug Mafia mobster had been a permanent legal resident living in New York until he was convicted in 1995 and lost his legal status. After he had served time, officials deported him back to Italy. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

18981,"Brenda Barnes, Pepsi Chief Who Spurred a Work-Life Debate, Dies at 63 - The New York Times","Brenda Barnes, a   corporate chief executive whose decision to leave her top job at   sparked a national debate about women juggling career and family, died on Tuesday in Naperville, Ill. She was 63. Her daughter, Erin Barnes, said the cause was complications of a stroke. The elder Ms. Barnes had had a stroke in 2010, after which she gave up her corporate career entirely. Ms. Barnes had been chief executive of   North America for a year and a half when she decided in 1997 to step down, saying that after two decades of grueling hours away from home she wanted to spend time with her three children, ages 10, 8 and 7. She was 43 at the time and overseeing PepsiCo’s chief profit engine, based in Somers, N. Y. making her one of the most recognized women in corporate America. She resisted the entreaties of her peers to remain at the company, explaining that she had had her fill of days and nights away from her children. “I hope people can look at my decision not as ‘women can’t do it’ but ‘for 22 years Brenda gave her all and did a lot of great things,’” Ms. Barnes told The Wall Street Journal at the time. “I don’t think there’s any man who doesn’t have the same struggle. Hopefully, one day corporate America can battle this. ” Her choice and the blunt language she used to describe the many burdens executive women had to shoulder elicited sharp reactions. Supporters hailed her decision to put family first. Detractors argued that her retreat from such a lofty post was a defeat for women fighting to be considered men’s equals in the boardroom. The debate raged on television talk shows in the United States and in tabloid newspapers in London  —   much to the surprise of Ms. Barnes, who had never seen herself as a public figure pushing a cause. A private woman by disposition (her nickname growing up outside Chicago was Bashful) Ms. Barnes weathered the public outcry and returned to Illinois with her family, settling in Naperville, about 33 miles west of Chicago. She did not fully retire from corporate life, however. She became a   company director, joining the boards of The New York Times (from 1998 to 2008) Avon, Lucasfilm, Sears and Staples. In 2004, with her children in high school, Ms. Barnes accepted an offer to be a top executive at Sara Lee, the food conglomerate based in Chicago. She was soon named chairwoman and chief executive  —   becoming one of the few women to run a major American corporation  —   and given a mandate to revive Sara Lee’s sinking fortunes. Ms. Barnes presided over a broad corporate restructuring, selling off noncore businesses and focusing on the company’s food brands. But the overhaul did not spur a profit recovery, and Sara Lee’s stock price remained stagnant for much of her time there. Ms. Barnes’s stroke in 2010 came in May while she was lifting weights at a local gym. It left her incapable of simple motor activities. Three months later, at 56 and after a tough rehabilitation period, she stepped down permanently from Sara Lee. She did not return to corporate life again. Brenda Jo Czajka, a granddaughter of Polish immigrants, was born on Nov. 11, 1953, in Chicago and grew up in River Grove, Ill. a gritty suburb northwest of the city. Her father was a pipe fitter at International Harvester, the agricultural manufacturer her mother stayed home to look after Brenda and her six sisters. Ms. Barnes began working at 15, helping out at a neighborhood flower shop for $1. 25 per hour. (As chief executive of Sara Lee, she earned as much as $15 million a year.) She graduated from Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill. in 1975 with a major in economics. After stints waiting on tables and sorting mail, she landed a job in the back office of Wilson Sporting Goods in Chicago in 1976. Wilson was part of the   Pepsi conglomerate at the time, and Ms. Barnes began to climb the corporate ladder rapidly while working toward her master’s degree in business at Loyola University Chicago, receiving it in 1980. She then moved to a senior job marketing salty snacks at Pepsi’s   division in Dallas. Also in 1980, she married Randall Barnes, a top executive at the company. The marriage ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Ms. Barnes is survived by two sons, Jeff and Brian her partner, Sal Barrutia and five sisters, Linda Stebbins, Donna Williams, Rhonda Thompson, Laurna Czajka and Trina Baker. Another sister, Andra, died before her. In more than 20 years with Pepsi, Ms. Barnes rose from one top job to another, moving from marketing positions to broader management roles until she was named to run the company’s giant beverage business in North America in 1996. She gained a reputation for being adept at connecting with workers on the factory floor and for wooing her peers in the boardroom. But the hours were brutal. She often set her alarm for 3:30 a. m. she said, so she could catch up with work at home before rousing the children for school. “There were two things in my life, kids and job,” Ms. Barnes told The Christian Science Monitor. “Exercise? Golf? Sleep? None of that. ”",0
18982,Did the Clinton Foundation Personally Enrich Barack and Michelle Obama? – TruthFeed,"Did the Clinton Foundation Personally Enrich Barack and Michelle Obama? Did the Clinton Foundation Personally Enrich Barack and Michelle Obama? 
By Judi McLeod 
Did the pay-for-play Clinton Foundation personally enrich Barack and Michelle Obama? 
A question well worth thinking about because the corruption of Hillary Clinton is the horse that bolted out of the barn on the watch of Community Organizer President Barack Obama. 
In her own words, Hillary Clinton went from “being broke” in 2001 to a net worth of $350 million and still counting in 2016. 
oo many forget that Clinton enriched personal friends and foreign powers while she would be under scant suspicion as Obama’s chosen Secretary of State. It is vital to ask before Tuesday were Barack and Michelle two of the friends enriched by the corruption that flowed from the Clinton Foundation? 
During the time of Hillary Clinton’s corruption at work, Obama did not just keep looking the other way, he actually corresponded with Clinton on her private basement server under a fake name of. 
How like him to operate under a fake name as that’s what he’s been doing since 2008! 
Where’s the forensic investigation to tell us how much money has been siphoned off to the bank accounts of Barack and Michelle Obama through the Clinton Foundation? 
Standing in for the MIA mainstream media, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is asking the questions the voting public need need answered: 
“Have the Clintons been selling United States foreign policy? 
“Have the Clintons been engaging in pay for play? Meaning: You pay them and they’ll play ball with you by giving you policy considerations or what have you.” Have the Clintons been selling United States foreign policy? Engaging in pay for play? 
“There is little doubt in the layman’s world that that has been going on. Proving it is quite another matter, but there’s little doubt, especially in the political world. There’s no doubt in my mind that that’s what’s been going on and that’s why she set up the server in the first place. The entire reason for the server in her basement was not because she wanted privacy per se. It’s not because she wanted convenience. It’s not because she didn’t want to go to the hassle of having a StateDepartment.gov email address. It’s not because she didn’t trust people. ( Rush Limbaugh Nov. 3, 2016) 
“The reason she set up the server in her basement was specific, and it was to be able to conduct business for the foundation and keep those emails from ever being seen by anybody, including Freedom of Information Act requests. And what the Clintons have been doing via their foundation is where the real criminality is. There’s negligence and intent over on the email server side with classified data being trafficked and so forth. But over here at the foundation, that is where the Clintons have been engaging…” 
There can be little doubt that Obama’s a valued player of the Bill, Hillary, Huma and Anthony Weiner baseball team. 
Indeed we can see for ourselves that the Obamas are proud of what Hillary has done in the shocking and revolting pay-for-play game. Both president and First Lady have been out on the campaign trail telling Americans Hillary’s the ONLY option for president. 
In praising his former Secretary of State, Obama has been telling outright lies, including the whopper that “the fate of the world is teetering” because of Donald J. Trump. 
“The fate of the world is teetering” because Obama seeks to kill off all life for Western society. 
How conniving Obama is in his ‘Elect Hillary’ stumping: 
“You know what? She’s not flashy. She’s not going around spending all the time giving big stemwinders. And as a consequence, sometimes she’s underappreciated here at home,” he said. “But she made me a better president,” Obama told an audience of university students in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
“Obama became most animated, and spent the most time, on the topic of Trump – a person he views as an existential threat to not only his legacy, but the world. 
“I am not on the ballot. But I tell you what, fairness is on the ballot, decency is on the ballot, justice is on the ballot, progress is on the ballot,” he warned, his voice noticeably rising. “Our democracy’s on the ballot right now!” Clinton didn’t make Obama a better president but most likely only a richer one 
Clinton didn’t make Obama a better president but most likely only a richer one. 
Obama IS “On the ballot” because he’s going for a third term through the election of the country’s biggest liar. 
Civil unrest is being planned by community organizers everywhere should Donald Trump be elected, and the draining of the swamp will be epic. 
“For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required ,” reads Luke 12:48 in the King James Version of the Bible. 
Trump’s first job should be return the White House, now a den of inequity, to the people. America needs a White House that belongs—not to the perps but to the people. 
When global masters inflicted the community organizer president on the world back in 2008, it did not include a right to dictate who would follow him as president. 
Today’s the last ‘Friday Dump’ until after election and millions wait for the other shoe to drop. 
No matter what today’s dump brings, millions who want a better America will survive it and go on to fight the Obama-Clinton cabal to the finish. 
God help us all because the devil is now running as freely in the White House as he is at the Vatican.

18983,Source: Qatar asks Hamas to Cease Terror Planning from its Territory,"Qatar has asked Hamas to stop any actions that make the Gulf state look like a nation that provides a safe haven for the group’s terrorist activities, a senior official in Hamas told Breitbart Jerusalem. [According to the official, Qatar’s request included a demand to cease all activity in the country that is meant to harm Israel’s security. The request was detailed, said the source, and added that Hamas must desist from initiating any activity that will produce attacks.  The Qatari request joins a similar one from Turkey that was made several months ago as part of that country’s rapprochement deal with Israel. As a result, a Hamas official and member of the organization’s politburo, Salah Alarouri, who Israel has accused of funding and directing attacks against Israeli targets, left Turkey. Hamas released an official statement denying that Qatar gave the organization a list of officials and other Hamas members who should be expelled from the country. The source in Hamas confirmed the denial and said that the request was reduced only to stopping actions that would lead to attacks against Israel. “We understand the Qatari request,” said the source. “Qatar is asking that Hamas not become a stimulant for external pressure at an hour when Qatar’s enemies are trying to accuse her of supporting and funding terrorist actions and that she is a political patron of the Muslim Brotherhood. ” The source said the request was received during a meeting between official Qatari representatives and Hamas’ leadership in Qatar. According to the source, Hamas’ response was affirmative: “We told our brothers in Qatar that we never initiated actions against the occupation from Qatari territory and that our actions against the occupation are carried out only in the land of Palestine and accusations that members and leaders of Hamas abroad are involved in the creation and initiation of military infrastructure are lies. We respect the sovereignty of every country in the world, and of course the countries that host us. ” On Saturday, the Lebanese Almayadeen television station associated with Iran and Hezbollah reported that Qatar gave Hamas a list of its leaders and other members that should leave the country. According to the report, the main names on the Qatari list include senior figures in the organization living in Qatar and those responsible for coordination with members and officials of the organization in the West Bank. According to the report, the list was preliminary and the goal of Qatar’s request was to shore up U. S. support for Qatar in case of an escalation in the crisis between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and the Qatari fear that Saudi Arabia will support a coup in Qatar against the current leader, Sheikh Tamim Althani.",0
18984,"2 Valedictorians in Texas Declare Undocumented Status, and Outrage Ensues - The New York Times","When Mayte Lara Ibarra, the valedictorian of her high school’s graduating class, revealed her plans to attend the University of Texas at Austin on a scholarship, she did what any graduate would do: She shared her excitement on social media. Ms. Lara also declared, proudly, that she is undocumented. “Valedictorian, 4. 5GPA, full tuition paid for at UT, 13   nice legs, oh and I’m undocumented,” she wrote in a tweet posted last week, hours after she gave her valedictory speech to fellow graduates at David Crockett High School in Austin. In an era where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, has vowed to build a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants and many Latinos are rushing to seek citizenship to vote against him, others are finding ways to raise their voices or step out of the shadows. Ms. Lara, whose path to the United States was not immediately clear and who didn’t mention her undocumented status in her speech, chose instead to talk about AP tests, proms and pep rallies. But on the same day, a few hours north in McKinney, Tex. another valedictorian, Larissa Martinez, did. Speaking to her class, Ms. Martinez, who says she’s headed to Yale, declared that she is undocumented, and indirectly addressed   sentiments voiced by Mr. Trump. According to the website Mic, she crossed the border in 2010 from Mexico with her mother and sister. “America can be great again without the construction of a wall built on hatred and prejudice,” said Ms. Martinez, according to WFAA, a local ABC affiliate. She told the station that she had a full scholarship to Yale with plans to study medicine. But some observers saw the students’ decision to express pride in being undocumented as an affront, and criticized them on social media. In Ms. Lara’s case, the outrage over her tweet led her to delete her Twitter account. One critic, Hillary Shay Davis, who has a daughter who graduated with Ms. Lara, said she believed that the teenager was proud of “taking advantage of the system. ” “I have never thought about deporting a child who graduated from a U. S. high school and fought against the odds to be successful. Until this moment,” Ms. Davis wrote on Facebook. She added, “Something else that I have NEVER thought I would support until this moment is Trump and #buildthatwall. ” Versions of this sentiment echoed throughout social media. Ms. Lara is departing the Austin Independent School District, where 58 percent of students are Hispanic, and entering a college system where Hispanic students are the   share of the population. The University of Texas also offers support services for undocumented students. Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the University of Texas, said that federal law prevented him from discussing the cases of individual students, but he offered a statement that said that the university grants   tuition waivers to all valedictorians of Texas public high schools regardless of their residency status. “State law also does not distinguish between documented and undocumented graduates of Texas high schools in admissions and financial aid decisions,” the statement said. “University policies reflect that law. ” Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer   journalist and immigration activist who  revealed that he is undocumented in The New York Times Magazine in 2011, said that gestures like Ms. Lara’s were part of a larger effort on behalf of undocumented people to be open and upfront about their status. “Being undocumented is part of her identity, as is being a Latina,” he said Thursday. He added, “For many undocumented people, this is our way of telling people that we are not who people think we are. ” Define American, a project Mr. Vargas started in 2011, holds events and online campaigns where people can share their immigration status, an effort, he said, that was meant to shape the conversation around immigration “so it’s a more ‘human’ one. ” Although people have been using Twitter and YouTube to make their immigration status public for years, Mr. Vargas said he thought the criticism of Ms. Martinez and Ms. Lara was coming at a tense time in the election cycle. In the case of Ms. Lara, he said that people were circulating misinformation, and he referred to the state law granting the waivers to valedictorians. “This young woman is not taking somebody else’s spot,” he said of the waivers. “She’s not getting special treatment. She is getting that because she graduated as valedictorian, and that’s how it is in Texas. ”",0
18985,Snapchat’s Parent Files for a Stock Offering - The New York Times,"The clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of 2017: that of Snapchat, the popular messaging service. The social network’s parent, Snap Inc. has filed confidentially to go public, with an eye toward being valued at more than $30 billion, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday. That would make Snap the    technology company at the time of its market debut, after Alibaba and Facebook. The company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as March, though the final timing for an offering has not been determined. The confidential filing, made with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the presidential election last week, comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings. There have been 96 offerings of companies with a market value of more than $50 million in the United States so far this year, down 41 percent from 2015, according to data from Renaissance Capital. A successful debut of Snap could help revive that market, encouraging other technology companies to go public. It would be the first   “unicorn”  —   Silicon Valley lingo for private companies valued at $1 billion or more  —   to go public next year. Unlike Uber, Airbnb or the lender SoFi, however, Snap has a main business that is not subject to a web of government regulations that make a public listing complicated. A Snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like Google’s in 2004. Still, like Google, Facebook and other tech companies, Snap’s recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top executives, including its   Evan Spiegel, to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded. Yet Snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential investors, as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging service’s signature features. In August, Facebook’s Instagram rolled out its version of the Snapchat Stories photo and video service. A spokesman for Snap declined to comment on the filing, which was reported earlier by Reuters. Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011, Snapchat has become a darling of the tech world, as it has grown from a simple   service into a digital video phenomenon. Its lofty goal is to essentially become the online generation’s equivalent to television. It has built up its popular Stories service, in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers. And it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like lenses, which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon dogs, silly faces  —   or Taco Bell tacos, paid for by sponsors. Such has been the popularity of Snapchat that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service. Even the White House has set up a Snapchat account, and President Obama has given an interview on the company’s   political show. Analysts have estimated that Snap, which began its advertising business less than two years ago, could reach $1 billion in sales next year, up from more than $350 million this year. Snap’s financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed  —   if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares. The confidentiality of Snap’s filing was made possible by the Jumpstart Our Business  . or JOBS, Act of 2012, which permits companies with less than $1 billion in revenue to conduct much of their preparation for an I. P. O. away from the glare of public scrutiny. Twitter, GoPro, Box and even the English soccer club Manchester United have filed confidentially for stock listings in the United States in this way. Under the law, companies must publicly disclose their offering documents some 15 days before they start pitching the proposed share offering to prospective investors in what is known as a “road show. ” The investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been hired to lead the offering, people briefed on the matter have previously said. Unlike some private companies, Snap has had no trouble raising money on the private markets, so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public offering, according to corporate documents filed in Delaware. This sets Snap apart from offerings from Square and Box. Both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders. When Square went public last November, some investors received an additional 10. 3 million shares, which came at the expense of other investors. Similarly, when Box went public in 2014, some of the company’s earlier private investors were entitled to extra shares. “Snapchat will certainly be an indicator of whether there is a big pile of investor cash ready to go into the market,” said Doug Bontemps, Silicon Valley Bank’s managing director of corporate finance. “But Snapchat is unique. It’s growing quickly, is doing some interesting things with glasses and has gotten a lot of attention. There aren’t a lot of that ilk. ”",0
18986,Nurse Saves Resident’s A** Again | GomerBlog,"Tweet 
In a usual twist of events, Nurse Betty Sue has prevented yet another resident from killing an unsuspecting patient. 
Late in the evening, Nurse Betty Sue noticed that resident Dr. Jen Willis had ordered 100 times the usual dose of potassium via IV push which would surely result in the death of her dear patient. 
Panicked, Betty Sue paged the resident but received no response. Knowing this was a fairly urgent matter, she waited 20 minutes and paged the doctor again. And after another 20 minutes, a third time. 
Frustrated and concerned, she picked up the phone and called the resident knowing she would be very annoyed at best. But the doctor was not available by phone either. After some astute investigating, Betty Sue eventually found Dr. Jen Willis sleeping in the call room covered in Cheerios and saliva. 
Given the grave nature of the problem, Betty touched base with the resident’s attending who ultimately corrected the faulty order. “Another brilliant batch of new doctors,” grumbled Attending Dr. Bill Wineberg. 
The patient is now doing well after receiving the appropriate amount of potassium to correct her cardiac arrhythmia. “Doctors are so brilliant,” the patient stated, “I feel great!” 
Nurse Betty Sue was later interviewed by the hospital’s Sentinel Event committee regarding the near miss error. When asked to comment, Betty Sue stated “I’m just doing my job and keeping my patients safe — thank you for asking.” When the resident was finally awake, Dr. Jen Willis griped, “The nurses really need to stop paging us so much.” 1K Shares ",0
18987,Narendra Modi Bans India’s Largest Currency Bills in Bid to Cut Corruption - The New York Times,"NEW DELHI  —   Prime Minister Narendra Modi fired a direct shot at India’s endemic corruption with a surprise move on Tuesday to ban the country’s largest currency bills, starting the next morning. The ban is intended both to curb the flow of counterfeit money and to take aim at terrorist organizations that rely on   cash. It is also expected to help the government clean up a system that has relied on cash to pay bribes and to avoid taxes. But the announcement, made on national television in both Hindi and English, led to an immediate upheaval in the country. Abolishing the current version of the 500 and 1, 000 rupee notes, worth about $8 and $15, will effectively remove 80 percent of the currency in circulation. Mr. Modi said banks would be closed on Wednesday. After that, people can exchange the banned notes through the end of the year for those of smaller denominations or new bills that are being created. A. T. M.s around the country were overrun Tuesday night with people confused about the plan and trying to complete financial transactions before the machines closed the following day. In some places, hundreds stood in line in front of a single A. T. M. Cash is so prevalent in Indian society that the ban came with a   exception for paying for hospital bills and airline tickets. India’s   carrier, IndiGo Airlines, sent an email warning customers that banned notes could not be used to purchase   services or to pay excess baggage charges. The decision amounted to a “surgical strike” on the country’s vast amount of   cash, said Manish Kejriwal, founder of Kedaara Capital Advisors, a Mumbai private equity firm, using a military term. “This is Modi’s transformational reform,” said Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, one of India’s largest mortgage lenders. “It will be disruptive, it will be inconvenient, but in the medium term, it will be very good. ” Mr. Modi was elected in 2014 after running on an anticorruption platform that included a pledge to fight   cash, also referred to as “black money. ” The results have been mixed. Under one tax amnesty program, Indians owned up this year to about $10 billion in income on which taxes had not been paid, the Modi administration said last month. But another effort encouraging people to declare hidden assets and income abroad met with limited success. “There’s a perception that whatever he has done on the corruption front is not enough,” said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London, noting that elections in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, were expected to take place early next year. “Politically he probably felt he needed to do something more visible. ” While the currency plan had been under discussion for some time, few had expected such a bold step. Mr. Modi kept the decision quiet to prevent holders of vast amounts of   cash from outwitting the ban. The problems run deep. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington think tank, has estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit outflows of money in the decade leading up to 2011. But it is unclear what the full impact of the ban will be. Studies have shown that corruption can be curtailed by reducing cash transactions, but it is unlikely to be eliminated by the move. “It is regrettable this will inconvenience” 1. 29 billion people, said Pradip Shah, the founder and former managing director of Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited, one of India’s first   agencies, without stopping “the flow of black money. ” Even so, the ban on large bills is very likely to hasten India’s transition away from cash. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent to 25 percent in the United States, Britain and other countries, according to a report by Google India and the Boston Consulting Group. The new policy puts India at the “leading edge of countries restricting the use of   currency notes that are now seen as mostly fueling illegal activities rather than legitimate commerce,” said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell. As the ban works its way through the system, the real estate market could face a shock. Indian politicians, among others, not only hold vast amounts of cash, but they are also heavily invested in real estate, where it has historically been easy to convert   money into legal currency. A large percentage of real estate deals are done in unaccounted for cash. Without that cash, real estate prices could fall sharply. And developers holding large amounts of unaccounted for cash would find it suddenly rendered virtually useless, making it hard for them to pay their bills and finish their projects. “Can you imagine what’s going happen in real estate tomorrow?” said Mr. Kejriwal, who also anticipated a drop in the prices of gold and luxury items. The exchange process, too, could prove problematic. For the next two weeks, people will be able to exchange only 4, 000 rupees a day, or about $60. People holding vast sums of unaccounted for cash will find it hard to exchange the money at banks because they will need to explain where they got it, risking tax investigations, experts said. “If I walk in with two crores,” Mr. Kejriwal said, using the Indian term for 20 million rupees, or about $300, 000, “people will be worried that the government will be tracking my name and address. ” “People will be scared,” he added. Mr. Modi, in his speech, addressed the inconveniences the public would most likely experience in the coming days. “Brothers and sisters, in spite of all these efforts, there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens,” he said. “Experience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make the sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation. ”",0
18988,Trolls 101 —- How To Identify Trolls And Forum Spies,"2061 Views November 08, 2016 32 Comments commenter-corner Saker-Admin The following comment was selected by mod-kl from this post . Mod-kl found this dissertation on the various troll techniques to be quite well written and very education. We think other members of the saker community would also enjoy it. by Anonymous How To Identify Trolls And Forum Spies (Cryptome) Cointelpro Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of an ‘uncontrolled forum.’ Technique #1 – ‘Forum Sliding’ If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum – it can be quickly removed from public view by ‘forum sliding.’ In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to ‘age.’ Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a ‘forum slide.’ The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a ‘forum slide’ and ‘flush’ the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then ‘replying’ to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting ‘slides’ down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2 – ‘Consensus Cracking’ A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at http://www.abovetopsecret.com) is ‘consensus cracking.’ To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made – but the critical point is that it has a very weak premise without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is Imperative that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger ‘evidence’ or disinformation in your favour is slowly ‘seeded in.’ Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then ‘abort’ the consensus cracking by initiating a ‘forum slide.’ Technique #3 – ‘Topic Dilution’ Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a ‘Resource Burn.’ By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a ‘gossip mode.’ In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to ‘drive in the wedge.’ By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4 – ‘Information Collection’ Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a ‘show you mine so me yours’ posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your ‘favourite weapon’ and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite ‘technique of operation.’ From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5 – ‘Anger Trolling’ Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes – without the requirement to ‘stage’ a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to ‘lead’ the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you ‘do not care what the authorities think!!’ inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6 – ‘Gaining Full Con-trol’ It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings – and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the ‘ultimate victory’ as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a ‘honey pot’ gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. Conclusion Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants do not know about them. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.

18989,Man Is Fatally Shot and 2 Officers Are Hurt at Brooklyn Housing Complex - The New York Times,"A man was fatally shot by the police at a public housing complex in Brooklyn on Saturday after he hit two officers with a police baton he had grabbed from one of them, the police said. The officers, who were in uniform, went to a building in the Van Dyke I Houses in the Brownsville neighborhood around 1:30 p. m. in response to a 911 call about a suspicious man, the police said. The officers approached a man on the building’s ninth floor and asked for his identification and a “scuffle” ensued, according to James Secreto, chief of the Police Department’s Housing Bureau. The man grabbed a baton from one of the officers and began hitting them both on the head, Chief Secreto said. Both officers then shot the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene, at 362 Sutter Avenue, the police said. Relatives and the police identified the man as Erickson Gomez Brito, 21, of 563 Mother Gaston Boulevard. One of the officers sustained a   gash on his head, the police said. Both officers were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for treatment, where they were in stable condition, the police said. Omahis Gomez Brito, 19, the victim’s sister, said her brother had been treated for depression three years ago but had not been taking medication recently. She also said he was treated for addiction at that time, but she did not specify for what. Speaking to reporters outside the building where she and Mr. Brito lived with their parents, Ms. Brito said: “I want justice for my brother. I want to know why they killed him. ” Mr. Brito’s father, Osiris Gomez, said in Spanish that his son was not violent. Mr. Brito’s aunt lives in the building where the shooting occurred, relatives said. Ms. Brito said the aunt lived on the first floor, and she was not sure why her brother was on the ninth. The   Van Dyke I complex is in the 73rd Precinct as well as in the middle of a   area that is among the poorest in the city, according to an analysis done by Queens College in 2014. There had been 12 homicides in the precinct this year, though none at the complex, Police Department statistics show. Katt Williams, who lives in the neighborhood, said she knew Mr. Brito. “Minds his business,” she said. “It’s sad. ”",0
18990,VIDEO: Ex-Obama Staffer Who Urged Spying On Trump Predicted ‘Quick’ Impeachment Weeks Before Election,"TEL AVIV  —   Speaking at a conference two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Evelyn Farkas, a former top Obama administration official, predicted that if Donald Trump won the presidency he would “be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government,” Breitbart News has found. [Farkas served as deputy assistant secretary of defense under the Obama administration. She has been in the spotlight since the news media last week highlighted comments she made on television that seemed to acknowledge efforts by members of the Obama administration to collect intelligence on Trump and members of his campaign.  Now it has emerged that at on October 26, 2016, Farkas made remarks as a panelist at the annual Warsaw Security Forum predicting Trump’s removal from office “pretty quickly. ” Asked at the event to address the priorities of a future Hillary Clinton administration, Farkas stated: It’s not a done deal, as you said. And so, to the Americans in the audience please vote. And not only vote but get everybody to vote. Because I really believe we need a landslide. We need an absolute repudiation of everything. All of the policies that Donald Trump has put out there. I am not afraid to be political. I am not hiding who I am rooting for. And I think it’s very important that we continue to press forward until election day and through election day to make sure that we have the right results. I do agree however with General Breedlove that even if we have the wrong results from my perspective America is resilient. We have a lot of presidential historians who have put forward very coherent the argument  —   they have given us examples of all of our horrible presidents in the past and the fact that we have endured. And we do have a strong system of checks and balances. And actually, if Donald Trump were elected I believe he would be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government. And I am not even joking. Farkas was referring to General Philip Mark Breedlove, another panelist at the conference who served as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) of NATO Allied Command Operations.  The panel discussion was about what to expect following the Nov. 8 presidential election. Farkas has also been in the news after remarks she made as a contributor on MSNBC on March 2 resurfaced last week.  In the comments, she said that she told former Obama administration colleagues to collect intelligence on Trump and campaign officials. “I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,” stated Farkas. She continued: Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy   …     that the Trump folks  —   if they found out how we knew what we knew about their   …     the Trump staff dealing with Russians  —   that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence. The White House has utilized Farkas’s statements to bolster the charge that Trump was being illicitly surveilled during the campaign. White House Spokesman Sean Spicer last week stated: [I]f you look at Obama’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense that is out there, Evelyn Farkas, she made it clear that it was their goal to spread this information around, that they went around and did this.   …     They have admitted on the record that this was their goal  —   to leak stuff. And they literally  —   she said on the record “Trump’s team. ” There are serious questions out there about what happened and why and who did it. And I think that’s really where our focus is in making sure that that information gets out. Farkas, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia until she resigned in 2015. She told the Daily Caller last week that she had no access to any intelligence. “I had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn’t in government anymore and didn’t have access to any,” she said. Speaking to the Washington Post, Farkas denied being a source of any leaks. The Post reported: Farkas, in an interview with The Post, said she “didn’t give anybody anything except advice,” was not a source for any stories and had nothing to leak. Noting that she left government in October 2015, she said, “I was just watching like anybody else, like a regular spectator” as initial reports of Russia contacts began to surface after the election. Farkas currently serves as a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression. The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. the U. S. State Department, and NATO ACT. Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Farkas serves on the Atlantic Council alongside Dmitri Alperovitch,   of CrowdStrike, the   company utilized by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. Last month, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency never had direct access to the DNC’s servers to confirm the hacking. “Well, we never got direct access to the machines themselves,” he stated. “The DNC in the spring of 2016 hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system. ” National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers also stated the NSA never asked for access to the DNC hardware: “The NSA didn’t ask for access. That’s not in our job. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

18991,Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver on Promise of Greater Crop Yield and Diminished Pesticide Use,"Trending Articles: Trending Articles: Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver on Promise of Greater Crop Yield and Diminished Pesticide Use Published: October 31, 2016 Source: New York Times 
LONDON — The controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat. 
But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem — genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides. 
The promise of genetic modification was twofold: By making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests, they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the world’s growing population, while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides. 
Twenty years ago, Europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the United States and Canada were embracing it. Comparing results on the two continents, using independent data as well as academic and industry research, shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise. 
An analysis by The Times using U.N. data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany . Also, a recent National Academy of Sciences report found “there was little evidence” that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the United States had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops. 
At the same time, herbicide use has increased in the United States, even as major crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties. And the United States has fallen behind Europe’s biggest producer, France, in reducing the overall use of pesticides, which includes both herbicides and insecticides.",0
18992,Hacker Guccifer 2.0 Warns He Has “Info From Inside FEC: Democrats May Rig The Elections”,"
Before the recent torrent of daily Podesta email dumps brought renewed attention to Wikileaks (and accusations Julian Assange was working with the Kremlin despite his recent denial, which ultimately cost him his internet access), the media’s attention was closely focused on the recently emerged hacker known as Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be behind the hacking of the nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails and other documents distributed over the summer by WikiLeaks, and who likewise was accused of cooperating with Russia.
Earlier today, after a two week silence, Guccifer 2.0 reemerged, with a post on his blog, in which he alleges that he has information from inside the Federal Election Commission, according to which “democrats may rig the elections.” He then adds “this may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.”
INFO FROM INSIDE THE FEC: THE DEMOCRATS MAY RIG THE ELECTIONS I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.
As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.
I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.
I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.
It is unclear what FEC information the hacker was in possession of, or was referring to, and how he intends to observe the elections. A recent video by Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting provided a real-time demo of the GEMS vote-fraud system, “fraction magic,” an election theft mechanism with context and explanation. There is much more detail on the BlackBoxVoting website .
The demonstration below used a real voting system and real vote databases and takes place in seconds across multiple jurisdictions. Over 5000 subcontractors and middlemen have the access to perform this for any or all clients. It can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses. All political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors. It’s a product. It’s scaleable. It learns its environment and can adjust to any political environment, any demographic. It runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing.
It is possible that this is the process that Guccifer is referring to, although we are merely speculating. We are confident he will provide more detail shortly.
While we wait, watch the following video explaining how elections can be (and perhaps are) rigged.

18993,House Republicans Fret About Winning Their Health Care Suit - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration’s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. Trump’s administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. “Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,” said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. “Upon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ” In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyer’s decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they “and the  ’s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  ’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. ” The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will “provide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ” Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of “cascading effects” if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ’s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case “will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nation’s health insurance and health care systems generally. ” No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  —   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  —   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  —   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.",0
18994,Chris Matthews Tells the Truth About Hillary Clinton,"You know what Hillary Clinton absolutely despises? Can’t stand? Gives her migraines? 
Free speech and freedom of the press. 
And here’s why: people might just say what they think about her. And….it’s not good! 
*gasp!* 
Despite the team effort of the Clintons and CNN to censor any story line that cast Hillary in a negative light, well-known and informed individuals are standing up and speaking out. 
MSNBC’s Chris Matthews is the latest to do so. 
According to Breitbart : 
Thursday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” host Chris Matthews said, it’s the Clintons’ “pattern” to raise money “hand over fist” using the White House like a “Motel 6” and that will not change if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wins in November… 
…“You know what I think? I’m going to be more judgmental than Beth who’s a straight reporter. I’ll make a judgment. Every time I watch a politician engage in a certain pattern of behavior before they go to the White House, they continue to engage in that pattern afterwards. People don’t change because we swear them into the White House. They become that person big-time. And the Clintons were raising money like this hand over hand, hand over fist, back in 1996, using—we called it Motel 6. They were hoarding them in, pulling them in by train loads of contributors and then letting them sit in the Lincoln bedroom for a while and charging them by the hour. You can still vote for Hillary Clinton, but remember, you’re getting this as part of the package, because that’s been their pattern.” 
“People don’t change because we swear them into the White House.” 
Let that sink in for just a moment. 
The Clintons will not shut down the Clinton Foundation; they will not stop using White House bedrooms as a Motel 6; they will not stop the horrific behavior they are best known for. 
C, after all, stands for corruption, conspiracy, and Clinton. 
The Clintons have never been serving for the public good but for the Clinton good. 
If the Clintons have their way, C will stand for censorship soon.",0

18996,Trump warns of World War III if Clinton is elected,"Email Donald Trump warned in an interview Tuesday that Hillary Clinton's policies as president to address the Syrian conflict would lead to World War III, arguing the Democratic nominee would draw the US into armed confrontation with Russia, Syria and Iran. ""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",0
18997,"The Aftermath of Trump’s Election: Facing Down Fear, Panic, And Uncertainty","For this week’s “Unauthorized Disclosure” podcast, Rania Khalek returns as co-host to process how to handle all the fear, panic, and uncertainty created by the presidential election of Donald Trump. 
We assess what needs to be fought immediately. Kevin Gosztola suggests the Dakota Access pipeline and return of the Keystone XL pipeline will need to face resistance. 
“Climate change is probably the most important to organize and push back against. This is going to require people putting their bodies on the line,” Khalek adds. And Gosztola suggests we will need to support not just journalists charged with felonies but all people who are taking action to stop a “moral calamity from taking place,” especially in local communities defending indigenous land from destruction by fossil fuel extraction. 
Khalek shares her concern that the backing of Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson and the people Trump is surrounding himself means it is time to worry about a Trump administration bombing Iran. “There is going to have to be some resurgence in antiwar activism because that would be another moral calamity.”
Then, domestically, Khalek says we have to support immigrant communities facing the threat of deportation and support organizations that defend them as well. We have to encourage resistance to any efforts to ban Muslims as well. 
Lots of people in the United States are looking for ways they can plug in to stop Trump. Media organizations and nonprofit organizations, like the ACLU, have seen an incredible surge in donations. In that vein, Khalek and Gosztola suggest you support their journalism if you want something tangible and immediate to do. Khalek is raising money for a series of articles on the war in Syria. Gosztola runs Shadowproof, and the organization is consistently eager to have new members join . (Anyone who donates $5/month receives a tote bag.) 
During the show, the hosts also confront the reality that the last eight years of Democrats, including President Barack Obama’s administration, laid the groundwork for a lot of what Trump plans to do. 
It should serve as a warning, Khalek declares. “Even when your team does something bad or your team takes power that nobody should have, just because you trust the person who is currently president and occupying the White House doesn’t mean it is going to stay that way forever. You always have to remember whatever powers they take, the next Donald Trump gets to use.”

18999,"Trump on Their Side, Conservatives See Hope in Lengthy Abortion Fight - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Sensing a political opportunity they have not had in more than a decade, social conservatives are preparing for a lengthy fight over abortion rights that promises to widen the culture war fissures that Republicans have tried for years to bridge. Two fights now loom in Washington that are galvanizing the right as it solidifies control of two branches of government and moves to dominate the third: an effort in Congress to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and President Trump’s forthcoming choice of a Supreme Court nominee. The choice for the court is likely to meet conservatives’ expectations. But fulfilling even a   goal of the   movement, like defunding Planned Parenthood, will be a longer and more complicated process than it appears, setting up an early and potentially defining test for the new president. Mr. Trump, an eager if improbable combatant in the cause, made bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected and, in turn, won overwhelming support from religious conservatives. Yet those promises are now tangled in intraparty politics and, in some cases at least, will be blocked by Senate Democrats. They include laws that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and permanently prohibit all federal funding, including Medicaid, from paying for abortions. Cutting off Planned Parenthood is part of the larger and messier debate over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans so far have been unable to do. Even if the law is scrapped, there is no guarantee a Planned Parenthood funding ban could easily move forward, given that   women’s groups will bring intense pressure upon moderate Republicans to vote against it. On the other side of the spectrum among women’s groups is the Susan B. Anthony List, which has been lobbying to gut Planned Parenthood’s funding and is planning to target senators who may be wavering, especially in states where Mr. Trump won. “The commitments in the House and the Senate and in the White House are so strong, and the desire to get it signed is so palpable,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group’s president. “But like everything that’s worthwhile, it’s a crooked path. It gets more complicated as it gets more real. ” Mr. Trump has committed in writing to choosing a Supreme Court nominee who opposes abortion. But a Democratic filibuster of Mr. Trump’s choice  seems likely, which would force Republicans to confront the difficult question of jettisoning the Senate filibuster for all presidential nominees, once and for all. Not too far removed from the minority themselves, Senate Republicans have enjoyed the filibuster’s protections in the past. And many in the party are reluctant to move too hastily on it. While the ease and speed with which Republicans can act is in doubt, the new president’s commitment is not. Barely in office a week, Mr. Trump has already taken steps to reassure his   base. Earlier this week, he reinstituted a   policy prohibiting foreign aid to health providers abroad that discuss abortion as a family planning option. In a show of solidarity with the movement, Mr. Trump is sending Vice President Mike Pence to speak at an   rally in Washington on Friday that is expected to draw thousands. The president’s appointments so far, both in his cabinet and among other senior White House positions, include many committed and longtime opponents of abortion. The attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has called Roe. v. Wade “one of the worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time. ” Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s pick to be labor secretary, was an early advocate of legal efforts to define life at conception as a way of outlawing abortion. Tom Price, who is in line to become secretary of health and human services, has been a leading proponent of defunding Planned Parenthood in Congress. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway spent her time as a pollster and messaging expert before 2016, advising   groups and politicians on how to soften their approach when talking about the issue. Among her suggestions: telling a personal story about why they came to believe abortion is wrong. Mr. Trump adopted this approach during his campaign and spoke of two unnamed friends who ended up deciding against aborting a child he described now as “a total superstar. ” Ms. Conway is also a featured speaker at Friday’s rally in Washington, the annual March for Life. How Mr. Trump  —   a former Democrat who once declared, “I’m very pro choice”  —   became an unbowed voice for the   movement is a story of savvy political transformation and bald expedience. Women in the movement, like Ms. Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, once publicly declared themselves “disgusted” by him. But as it became clear he would be the Republican nominee, many social conservatives swallowed their pride to get behind him. To shore up their support, Mr. Trump pledged to name an   Supreme Court justice and largely turned the party platform over to social conservatives at last July’s Republican National Convention, which yielded numerous new provisions like the endorsement of a nationwide ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Mr. Trump went even further himself, disregarding Ms. Conway’s advice by talking about   abortion in the most graphic of terms, a move that endeared him to the movement’s supporters. Today, conservatives see his line “rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth” as a turning point in his campaign. In an interview, Ms. Conway marveled at how Mr. Trump had flipped the script. “I’ve been working on   messaging for two decades in this town,” she said. “And it took a billionaire man from Manhattan who had spent most of his life being   to deliver the most impassioned defense of life that many have ever heard. ” Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, said that many conservatives felt Mr. Trump spoke to them with that line in a way that other Republican nominees, like Mitt Romney, had been too timid to pursue. Mr. Romney barely spoke about abortion at all in the 2012 general election and when he did, it was often in the context of how he did not support further restrictions. “If you feel like your side is being pushed around and then someone comes around and says, ‘I may not be one of you, but I’m going to defend your views,’ they see that as loyalty,” Mr. Domenech said. “It’s a declaration of cultural war alliance. ” One quandary that Mr. Trump will surely face is meeting the expectations of a group of supporters so hungry for a victory after setting the bar so high. “The Trump administration presents us with a new opportunity: For the first time, really, we are able to interface with the federal government to achieve our goals,” said Dean Nelson, national outreach director of the Human Coalition, an   group. “We are cautiously optimistic. ”",0
19000,"Russia Looks to Exploit White House ‘Turbulence,’ Analysts Say - The New York Times","MOSCOW  —   The Kremlin, increasingly convinced that President Trump will not fundamentally change relations with Russia, is instead seeking to bolster its global influence by exploiting what it considers weakness in Washington, according to political advisers, diplomats, journalists and other analysts. Russia has continued to test the United States on the military front, with fighter jets flying close to an American warship in the Black Sea this month and a Russian naval vessel steaming conspicuously in the Atlantic off the coast of Delaware. “They think he is unstable, that he can be manipulated, that he is authoritarian and a person without a team,” Alexei A. Venediktov, the editor in chief of Echo of Moscow, a liberal radio station, said of President Trump. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, has long sought to crack the liberal Western order, both as a competitor and as a champion of an alternative, illiberal model. To that end, he did what he could to buttress the electoral chances of Mr. Trump, who seemed like a kindred spirit with his harsh denunciations of NATO and the European Union, his endorsement of the British withdrawal from the European Union and his repeated shrugs over Russia’s destabilizing Ukraine. In this context, Mr. Trump’s election was an unexpected bonus, but the original giddiness has worn off, and Moscow has returned to its    formula of creating turmoil and exploiting the resulting opportunities. “They are all telling each other that this is great, he created this turbulence inside, as we wanted, and now he is focused on his domestic problems and we have more freedom to maneuver,” Mr. Venediktov said. “Let them deal with their own problems. There, not in Ukraine. There, not in the Middle East. There, not in NATO. This is the state of mind right now. ” Sergei A. Markov, a leading analyst friendly to the Kremlin, made much the same point. “Right now the Kremlin is looking for ways that Russia can use the chaos in Washington to pursue its own interests,” said Mr. Markov, a member of the Civic Chamber, a Kremlin advisory group. “The main hope is that the U. S. will be preoccupied with itself and will stop pressuring Russia. ” Any turbulence that Russia foments also gives the Kremlin leverage that it can try to trade in the global arena at a time when it does not have much that others want. Mr. Venediktov compared the Russian position to an intrusive neighbor who promises to be helpful by avoiding noisy restoration activity at night even though it breaks the apartment building rules in the first place. Analysts say the Kremlin is aware that the tactic of creating and exploiting disarray can become   in that prolonged instability could allow threats like the extremist group Islamic State to flourish. “It is important for Russia that America does its job in foreign policy,” said Alexey Chesnakov, a periodic Kremlin political adviser and the director of the Center for Current Politics, a trend analysis group in Moscow. “If there is nobody to do that job, it might not be good for us, either. ” The Middle East provides examples of both vectors, analysts say, a moment of chaos to exploit and concerns about achieving stability for the   future. Moscow has begun courting Libya, where Mr. Putin seems to want to prove that the Obama administration and other Western powers made a mistake by working to force Col. Muammar   from power in 2011. Russia invited various powerful figures to Moscow and sent the country’s lone aircraft carrier, the somewhat dilapidated Admiral Kuznetsov, on a port call to Libya on its way back from Syria last month. Khalifa Haftar, the military commander in eastern Libya, got a tour. The government invited veteran officials and analysts from around the Arab world this week to discuss the future of Libya and Yemen, among other topics. Syria, on the other hand, underscores the limits to Russian power. In the two months since   government forces took back the city of Aleppo, there has been little movement in forging peace. Not least, Russia can ill afford the billions of dollars needed to rebuild the country. For that it needs Washington to help persuade its allies like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who all seek a political transition away from Syrian President Bashar  . Like much of the world, nobody in Moscow can figure out who makes Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, never mind what it will be. Since the inauguration, it has become clear that Mr. Trump’s rosy view of Mr. Putin is not shared by the president’s top foreign policy advisers, with the possible exception of Stephen K. Bannon, his chief White House strategist. “We cannot understand how they will work in concert,” said Igor Yurgens, a Russian economist who is prominent in business and development. The Kremlin has adopted a    attitude toward Mr. Trump, analysts said, expecting the first meeting with Mr. Putin in Europe sometime this summer to set the course for relations. Dmitry K. Kiselyov, the anchor of the main state propaganda program “News of the Week,” recently pronounced what seemed to be the new party line on the air. “Let’s not judge too harshly, things are still unsettled in the White House,” he said. “Still not a word from there. Only little words, and that doesn’t amount to a policy. ” Just how unsettled was underscored on Monday, when the White House announced plans to increase military spending by $54 billion, an amount just about equal to what Russia spends in total on its military annually. While the appearance of such turmoil in the White House has probably been surprising, even gratifying, to the Kremlin, analysts say Russia’s government is worried about having too much of a good thing. “It would be better for us to have a predictable partner,” Mr. Markov said. “An unpredictable one is dangerous. ” The perception of weakness calls into question here in Moscow whether Mr. Trump can ever live up to the many statements he made during the campaign about forging closer ties with Mr. Putin and Russia. “The overwhelming view of the Kremlin is that Trump is not very strong,” said Valeriy Solovey, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. “He might have sympathy toward Russia, but he is contained within the political establishment. ” Russia’s far right regularly predicts Mr. Trump’s assassination at the hands of the American establishment, a view occasionally echoed on state television. Alexander Dugin, a nationalist Russian philosopher, called Mr. Trump’s inauguration the happiest day of his life because it signified the demise of the liberal international order. Mr. Dugin seemed most eager for Mr. Trump to get on with his promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington, although he worried about the consequences. “It can kill,” Mr. Dugin said in an interview. “It is not so easy to drain the swamp. ” Since the inauguration, however, enthusiasm for Mr. Trump in official Russia lurched from cool to uncool seemingly overnight. Dmitri S. Peskov, the presidential spokesman, denied that the new skepticism had been ordered from the top. The speed of the change was striking, however. Russia’s political class marvels at how much time it now spends chewing over the minutiae of the American political system. Some attribute that to the fact that domestic politics are comatose, with Mr. Putin assured of winning another   term in 2018. “Nobody is talking about the Putin election,” said Mr. Chesnakov, the political consultant. “We are discussing relations between Congress and Trump. ”",0
19001,An Opera Star Finds the Right Duet - The New York Times,"For more than two decades, Susan Graham has made the world her stage, her sumptuous   and magical presence celebrated at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the Royal Opera House in London and the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. But a piece of her heart never quite left the   plains of West Texas  —   not Midland, where she spent her adolescence, or Lubbock, where she attended Texas Tech University. She would send her itinerary to her Friends and Family List, so that if she were singing in Vienna or Sydney or Timbuktu and someone from home happened to be there, they could connect. Clay Brakeley long held a place of honor on that list. They had met at college in 1983 (she was a graduate student in music he was an undergraduate in theater  —   as part of a boisterous social scene that gravitated toward Ms. Graham’s place, known as the Party Hut. “It was a little   rental house near the campus, and we were the repository for lost and wayward souls,” she said. “You never knew who was going to be sleeping on the couch when you woke up. ” Young, brash and prone to roaring around town on a motorcycle, Mr. Brakeley first caught her eye and then her ear as she gave him voice lessons. “He has a great voice and sang Riff in ‘West Side Story,’” she said, snapping her fingers and cooing softly. “‘Boy, boy, crazy boy, get cool boy!’ I taught him that. ” Soon they were an item (“She chased me till I caught her,” is how he likes to put it) in that haphazard way that college couples often are. When in 1985 she moved to New York to attend the Manhattan School of Music, he visited a few times, and their relationship fell back into its carefree rhythms. But eventually distance and careers divided them, and they sought love in closer proximity. “We both understood that we were moving in different circles at that point, but there was always a little something underneath when we would see each other,” Mr. Brakeley said. His own life turned peripatetic when he moved to Los Angeles and began working in lighting and stagecraft for Bonnie Raitt, Neil Diamond, Bon Jovi and the Jacksons (Michael and Janet). And as Ms. Graham’s itineraries kept arriving  —   first as letters, then as emails  —   their paths would occasionally intersect: Lunch in Chicago. A rock concert in San Francisco. Her stellar performance of a signature role, Octavian in Strauss’s “ Rosenkavalier,” at the Met. And two memorable days in Paris in 1996, when she was singing Dorabella in Mozart’s “Così Fan Tutte” at the Palais Garnier for the first time, and he had flown in from touring Ireland with Michael Bolton to see her  —   and to get his   roadie’s hair lopped off at a salon. (She requested that he wait a day so she could gaze at his leonine mane a bit longer.) “I was in a relationship with somebody else, and none of those encounters were anything but just friendly,” she said. “But it was always great to see him and there was always, I think, a little bit of sizzle, a little bit of familiarity and comfort. ” In 2000, Mr. Brakeley was married. Six years later he and his wife had twins  —   a son, Finn, and a daughter, Sydney. Meanwhile, Ms. Graham, her career soaring, thought that marriage and children were not an option. “It wasn’t even a choice,” she said. “My career was my child. My career took all of my energy and all of my nurturing and all of my love, and it was very fulfilling. ” “I had some fantastic relationships, and I do not for a minute regret a single one of them or a single minute of my life,” she said. But the complexities of dating men not comfortable with her increasing fame won out, and she wondered if perhaps she would grow old, with cats, in her “heart home,” Santa Fe, N. M. (She also has an apartment in New York.) In February 2010, Mr. Brakeley, by now separated and working in production for auto shows, discovered that he and Ms. Graham would be in Chicago at the same time. So he called and offered to cook her dinner at the apartment she was staying in while performing with the Lyric Opera. “I knew that his life had sort of been blown apart,” she said, “and he needed a friend. ” She, in turn, invited him to escort her that weekend to the opera’s gala, with instructions to meet her at the stage door. “He showed up with the hair perfectly done, the tuxedo, the long black cashmere coat, the black leather gloves, looking so sharp,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Oh, my God, he’s got it going on. ’” Guiding her with his hand on her back, he instinctively understood whom she wanted to talk to and whom they should avoid. And she had forgotten how well he could move until he twirled her across the floor. The   at which the women reclined on sofas while dangling their pumps from their toes and the men loosened their ties and drank Scotch, reminded them of a champagne ad. But mostly they were intoxicated with each other. “I think that cemented a reconnected time, and it has been that way ever since,” Mr. Brakeley said. “She has always been a bright light and a positive individual, and it’s very easy to fall under that particular spell. ” (“You are scintillating,” he wrote in a note to her afterward.) At four in the morning, he kissed her good night in front of her apartment building, then walked to his hotel across the street. But as the time approached for them to attend a Super Bowl party later that afternoon, Ms. Graham started to worry. “I thought, O. K. this is a big   point  —   because last night was great and do we go forward like we’re dating? Or do we go forward like we’re still just buddies and last night didn’t really have the import that it might have had?” she said. “And I was a little skittish because I thought, you can’t screw it up with somebody who has been your friend for 25 years. You don’t want to rashly go into something that you’re not sure about. But at the same time, how can you be sure at that moment? So we sort of just went forward as if we were pretending we were dating. ” By the end of their stay in Chicago, Mr. Brakeley was mapping out opportunities to meet months in the future. “And I was like, ‘Whoa, hold on, buddy. I’m not sure I’m willing to commit that far out,’” Ms. Graham said. “Because first of all, he was separated for over a year but he wasn’t completely divorced yet, and he had two little kids. And I guess I didn’t know what it would feel like to be   in a bona fide relationship. ” But she also realized that she didn’t want to lose him again, and decided to take the leap. With their mutual passion for music and theater as well as an understanding of the stress that accompanies a major career, they found that their lives blended seamlessly. And on the rare occasion when she acted the diva, he sweetly reminded her that he had worked for Michael Jackson, who was an even bigger star than she was. Two years later, it was Ms. Graham who sought a commitment and Mr. Brakeley who was reluctant to give it. But when it became clear that they were going to be together, with or without marriage, she made peace with their arrangement. “I always wanted to get married sometime, but I never was in the right place at the right time with the right person to do it,” she said. “Once I found him, I thought, this is the right place and the right time and the right person, but he has to want it, too. ” On July 23, 2015, Ms. Graham, who had been touring Australia, met Mr. Brakeley and his twins on Maui. It was her 55th birthday, and at the end of the festivities, he presented her with one last gift: a box holding three diamond bands in white, yellow and rose gold, symbolizing Mr. Brakeley and each of his children. “If you take one of us, you get all three of us,” he told the stunned Ms. Graham as he proposed, with an elated Finn and Sydney, now 10, jumping up and down in the background. “Part of the reason that she is who she is in her career is because of how open and inviting she is,” said Mr. Brakeley, 51. “She has all of these friends in all of these places all over the world. And that is the thing that hasn’t changed since she was in college. Underneath it all she is the same person. She just happens to be the same person with this really famous aspect of herself. And I think it’s wonderful. ” Laughing, Ms. Graham said, “Deep down, I’m just a very, very simple girl who has been thrust into an extraordinary life. ” On Sept. 17, Ms. Graham and Mr. Brakeley were married at Las Campanas Country Club in Santa Fe, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains silhouetted in the distance beneath a harvest moon. Irene Swain, a nondenominational minister, officiated at a ceremony filled with poetry written for the couple by Arnold Adoff and a Native American blessing in honor of the New Mexican landscape (both the bride and groom were born in the state). Ms. Graham’s eyes welled up, she later recalled, as Mr. Brakeley spoke to her generous spirit and beautiful nature, and she compared him to her deceased father, whom she likened to a towering redwood, during their vows. “You are the only man since my father on whom I know I can rely to be for me and take care of me when I need it, and even when I don’t think that I do,” she said. The   Sasha Cooke sang Jake Heggie’s “My True Love Hath My Heart” during the ceremony. The soprano Renée Fleming serenaded the couple with a cover of Etta James’s “At Last” for their first dance. “It took a long time to get here but it happened  —   we got it done,” said Ms. Graham’s mother, Betty Graham Webber. “She waited a long time, but he would be worth waiting for. He’s a great guy. I’m very proud of Suzy. ” The couple honeymooned briefly in Santa Fe before heading to performances in Boston, after which Ms. Graham headed alone to Toledo, Spain. These were their first journeys in a married life that will find them reconnecting as a family in New York or Burbank, Calif. where Mr. Brakeley lives with his twins (who, to the delight of their new stepmother, are members of the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus and appeared in the Los Angeles Opera production of Puccini’s “La Bohème” last spring). Marrying Mr. Brakeley 33 years after their first encounter “was a euphoria beyond anything I’ve ever felt on the stage,” Ms. Graham said after the wedding. “It beats the best curtain call I’ve ever taken. ”",0
19002,3 Charlotte Area Counties Report Voting Machines Picking Wrong Candidates,"MecklenburgCatawba 
The complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voter’s choice, but in all reported cases, the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them. 
“To my knowledge, at this point, we don’t have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints. Of course they’re all looked into and that’s why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official,” commented Gannon. 
The NC State Board Of Election released the following statement regarding the complaints: 
The N.C. State Board of Elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touch-screen voting machines in several counties. 
Similar reports have been made in recent elections, and we take them very seriously. 
We want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touch-screen machines accurately record voters’ selections. 
Touch-screen machines are tested thoroughly before each election. They are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy. If a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine, they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately. If needed, the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration, and the voter may be moved to a different machine. 
Also, each touch-screen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot. As with paper ballots, voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot. On touch-screen machines, voters also can review a real-time audit log that records all of their selections. 
“We urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots, and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials,” said Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the N.C. State Board of Elections.",0
19003,Did Someone Say ‘Tax Code Rewrite’? Lobbyists Scramble - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The homebuilders lobby fears that an ambitious rewrite of the entire tax code will stifle the housing market. Retailers fret that it will make the cost of their imports soar. For charities and their representatives, the worry is that donations will be stunted, plaguing nonprofit groups that serve the neediest Americans. President Trump’s new Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, casually predicted this week that the first true overhaul of the federal tax code in three decades would happen before lawmakers head home for their August recess. But there’s a bit of a problem: That “swamp” Mr. Trump liked to talk about on the campaign trail? It’s still undrained. And now the dwellers of that   swamp are mobilizing to protect their patch of the bog, with armies of corporate lobbyists scrambling to protect their favorite provisions, exceptions and deductions before it is too late. To those who are in the trenches, talk of enacting sweeping tax legislation in the span of a few months sounds like a mix of bravado, naïveté and delusion. By definition, tax overhaul creates winners and losers on tax day, and with billions of dollars at stake, the prospect of revamping the system has already created fierce infighting among Republicans and a massing of lobbyist forces underwritten by a divided but   business community. “Tax reform is a series of battles,” said Sage Eastman, who worked in vain on tax overhaul plans as a longtime senior aide on the House Ways and Means Committee and who now lobbies for Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen  Thomas in Washington. “This is just the tip of the iceberg. ” The most vocal battle thus far is over the “border adjustment tax” that is the linchpin of the House Republican tax plan drafted by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Ways and Means chairman. They have proposed a 20 percent import tax along with the elimination of taxes on exports so that, in theory, corporate tax rates could be slashed without ballooning the deficit. The plan has divided industries that have for years called for changes to the tax system, pitting retail and energy giants  —   which rely heavily on imports  —   against America’s biggest manufacturers, which hope the proposal will make their exports cheaper around the world. But the border adjustment tax is only the first fight. Tax experts are expecting a slog that could drag well into 2018 and even cast a cloud over the midterm elections. Many aspects of the House tax blueprint, the most specific plan floating around the capital, are already creating consternation across a swath of sectors that have learned over the years how to make do with the status quo, however cumbersome. With lawmakers working to put more concrete plans together quickly, these groups are pushing back before it is too late. Within the real estate industry, for instance, the concern is that a proposal to nearly double the standard deduction would reduce the tax benefits of homeownership people enjoy when they itemize their returns and deduct mortgage interest from their incomes. Reducing the appeal of this benefit, the argument goes, could weaken the housing market. “The current plan, by raising standard deduction so high, dilutes the importance of the mortgage interest deduction,” said Gerald Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders. “It really neuters it, so we’re going to try to fix that. ” Charities face a similar threat. Tax rules encouraging charitable giving have been around for ages, and they allow people to lower their tax bills and do good deeds at the same time. But, as with housing, changes to the standard deduction proposed by Republicans could erase those incentives. Last week, Michael Kenyon, chief executive of the National Association of Charitable Gift Planners, was part of a delegation of charities that came from around the country to Washington to alert members of Congress to their concerns. They held more than a hundred meetings in the capital, where they pressed for a solution that would preserve their special status. “There is real urgency about this,” Mr. Kenyon said. Anxiety is also high in corners of the moneyed financial world that have benefited mightily from the current system. Private equity has for years guarded the special treatment of “carried interest,” a loophole that lets billionaire fund managers pay low capital gains tax rates instead of higher income tax rates on the fees they charge clients. Mr. Trump, taking up a call from his predecessor, Barack Obama, campaigned to end the loophole, and because Mr. Ryan’s plan is silent on the matter, it could be in jeopardy. Another fear is the impact of a move away from the tax deduction for interest on corporate debt in favor of the immediate deductibility of business expenses. For private equity firms that rely heavily on borrowing to make deals, the shift could significantly alter the economics of many transactions by raising the cost of capital. “We are working to educate as many lawmakers as we can,” said James Maloney, vice president for public affairs at the American Investment Council, which represents the private equity industry. Both the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have said they will need to address the repeal of the Affordable Care Act before diving into tax legislation. Separating the two, however, is not so simple. One Republican plan that has already stirred controversy would cap the amount of employee health insurance costs that employers can deduct from their corporate taxes. Republicans say the exclusion, one of the largest tax breaks in the code, limits consumer choice and ties workers too tightly to their companies, even though it is economically no different from the “Cadillac tax” on expensive health plans in the health law.   groups swiftly moved to shoot down the limit on health care deductibility when it came up this month. In a letter to Gary Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council, lobbyists including the American Benefits Council, the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Staffing Association argued that the exclusion would represent a new tax on the middle class. And they reminded Mr. Cohn of the president’s promises to protect working class voters. “American voters want lower cost and high quality health care,” they wrote. “They do not want more taxes. ” Mr. Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday is expected shed new light on his thinking about a comprehensive tax plan, but thus far the signals from his administration remain unclear. This week, for example, Mr. Mnuchin offered a tepid response when asked on CNBC about the border adjustment tax, offering only that “there’s some interesting aspects of it” and that it remained an option for consideration. For his part, Mr. Trump, who previously described the concept as overly complex, seemed to express more openness to it in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. “It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States,” Mr. Trump said. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border,” he said. Regardless of Mr. Trump’s eventual position, Senate Republicans have been increasingly pessimistic about the border tax. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the proposal would not win the support of 10 Republican senators, essentially declaring it dead on arrival. Even if that is overstated, Republicans will struggle to lure a sufficient number of Democrats to sign on to a tax bill. It would be a struggle just assembling the simple majority needed to make changes to the tax code through a parliamentary gambit in the budget process that would shield a tax bill from a filibuster. The forces of outside resistance, meanwhile, show no sign of letting up. The conservative advocacy and political action committee Club for Growth this week unveiled a television commercial in South Dakota to pressure Representative Kristi Noem, a Republican from that state who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, to oppose the border adjustment tax. The ad claimed that the tax would cause the prices of clothes, food and gasoline to spike. David McIntosh, the group’s president, said that he thought the fixation on an import tax was going to scuttle the chance for a big tax overhaul and that Republicans were cornering themselves by essentially advocating a tax increase. More advertisements are scheduled to be released in other Republican districts to make this case. “We’re prepared to keep going,” he said, “even if it gets to the millions. ”",0
19004,Former Trump University Workers Call the School a ‘Lie’ and a ‘Scheme’ in Testimony - The New York Times,"In blunt testimony revealed on Tuesday, former managers of Trump University, the   school started by Donald J. Trump, portray it as an unscrupulous business that relied on   sales tactics, employed unqualified instructors, made deceptive claims and exploited vulnerable students willing to pay tens of thousands for Mr. Trump’s insights. One sales manager for Trump University, Ronald Schnackenberg, recounted how he was reprimanded for not pushing a financially struggling couple hard enough to sign up for a $35, 000 real estate class, despite his conclusion that it would endanger their economic future. He watched with disgust, he said, as a fellow Trump University salesman persuaded the couple to purchase the class anyway. “I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme,” Mr. Schnackenberg wrote in his testimony, “and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money. ” For Mr. Trump, whose presidential campaign hinges on his reputation as a businessman, the newly unsealed documents offer an unflattering snapshot of his career since branching out, over the past decade, from building skyscrapers into endeavors that cashed in on his name to sell everything from water and steaks to ties and education. The release of the documents on Tuesday, under court order, was the latest turn in a federal lawsuit, filed in California by dissatisfied former Trump University students, that has bedeviled the businessman since 2010 and could trail him into the White House if he is elected president. Mr. Trump, who started the university in 2005, owned 93 percent of the   company. From the start, he acted as its chief promoter, rather than    manager, selling it as a tool of financial empowerment that would improve life for thousands of ordinary Americans. It would, he said, “teach you better than the best business school,” according to the transcript of a Web video. Within the documents made public Tuesday were internal employee guides encouraging customers with little money to pay for the tuition with their credit cards. “We teach the technique of using OPM . .. Other People’s Money,” explained the internal instructions for salespeople. The documents pushed employees to exploit the emotions of potential customers. “Let them know you’ve found an answer to their problems,” read confidential instructions to salespeople. The most striking documents were written testimony from former employees of Trump University who said they had become disenchanted with the university’s tactics and culture. Corrine Sommer, an event manager, recounted how colleagues encouraged students to open up as many credit cards as possible to pay for classes that many of them could not afford. “It’s O. K. just max out your credit card,” Ms. Sommer recalled their saying. Jason Nicholas, a sales executive at Trump University, recalled a deceptive pitch used to lure students  —   that Mr. Trump would be “actively involved” in their education. “This was not true,” Mr. Nicholas testified, saying Mr. Trump was hardly involved at all. Trump University, Mr. Nicholas concluded, was “a facade, a total lie. ” Lawyers for Mr. Trump on Tuesday challenged those characterizations, saying that the testimony of the former Trump University employees “was completely discredited” in depositions taken for the California lawsuit. Lawyers for Mr. Trump declined to release those depositions on Tuesday. As he has in the past, Mr. Trump argued through representatives that the complaints emanated from a small number of former students and that the vast majority had offered positive reviews of their experience. “Trump University looks forward to using this evidence, along with much more, to win when the case is brought before a jury,” said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump. The court records show the role that Mr. Trump  —   and his outsize reputation  —   played in trying to sell the real estate classes to thousands of students. Marketing materials bearing his signature encouraged prospective students to take advantage of a downturn in the housing market to earn quick profits. He offered the kind of assurances that financial advisers have long cautioned consumers to be wary of. “How would you like to   your financial future,” Mr. Trump asked in one brochure. Mr. Trump started the   Trump University just as the overheated American housing market neared its peak, promising that its classes would impart his wisdom about real estate and moneymaking to the general public. But dozens of complaints about the school rolled into the offices of attorneys general in Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois, officials said, prompting multiple investigations and, eventually, the lawsuit from former students in California. Mr. Trump had fought Tuesday’s release of previously sealed documents in the case. In an apparent attempt to discredit the judge in the case, Gonzalo P. Curiel, Mr. Trump called him biased and a “hater of Donald Trump,” and he sought to draw attention to the judge’s ethnic background  —   “we believe Mexican,” Mr. Trump said. (Mr. Curiel was born in Indiana he is of Mexican descent.) On Friday, in response to a legal motion filed by The Washington Post, Judge Curiel ruled that the records be released. Some of the documents unsealed Tuesday were previously made public in connection with other lawsuits. The internal guidebooks for employees of Trump University provide a detailed set of instructions for how to sell the classes, even to skeptical and reluctant consumers, by tapping into their psychological needs. A chart outlines the stages of the “roller coaster of emotions” that a buyer will experience. (The “Blast” phase, it explains, is “giving your clients hope again. ” The “Probe” phase, it says, must “slowly bring the client back down to reality. ”) When it comes to selling the classes, the guidebooks leave little to chance. Inside the rooms where students are asked to enroll in classes, workers are asked to “confirm that room temperature is no more than 68 degrees. ” Of course, Mr. Trump and the promise of his engagement with the school was the biggest draw of all. In the documents released Tuesday, instructors described themselves as “ ” by Mr. Trump. But in a deposition related to the lawsuit, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he did not pick the instructors. Not all the documents made public on Tuesday were critical. Many former students said the classes delivered exactly what they had expected. “Trump University definitely made me more prepared to tackle the ‘real world’ of real estate investing,” wrote David Wright Jr. who signed up for a   program. “We really learned a lot of from Trump University and have found a modicum of success,” wrote another student, Kissy Gordon. Former employees like Ms. Sommer took a dimmer view of the school. In her testimony, she said she was startled by the qualifications of some Trump University instructors. Ms. Sommer recalled that a member of the Trump University sales team, who had previously sold jewelry, was promoted to become an instructor. He had “no real estate experience,” she said. She added that many of the instructors had the quality that the school seemed to value most: “They were skilled at   sales,” she said.",0
19005,New Yorkers fight to overturn ballot selfie ban,"New Yorkers fight to overturn ballot selfie ban New Yorkers fight to overturn ballot selfie ban By 0 119 
New York voters are suing the state, arguing it is unconstitutional to ban them from showing their completed ballots to others via social media. The ballot selfie ban is becoming a hot topic this election, affecting even celebrities like Justin Timberlake. 
The three New Yorkers – Eve Silber, Rebecca White, and Michael Emperor – filed the federal lawsuit in on Wednesday, seeking a judge to declare the election law banning “ballot selfies” unconstitutional, according to the attorney representing the group. 
“Taking a photograph of a filled out ballot is a powerful political statement that demonstrates the importance of voting. Without the photograph, the message loses its power,” says the lawsuit, filed by lawyer Leo Glickman in Manhattan Federal Court, according to the New York Daily News. 
Under the current state law, showing a marked ballot to another voter is considered a misdemeanor which can result in prison time and a hefty $1,000 fine, according to court papers. 
Glickman is seeking a court injunction to stop officials from enforcing the law before the November 8 election. 
Similar laws against “ballot selfies” have been struck down in Michigan, Indiana and New Hamsphire as a violation of the First Amendment guarantee of the freedom of speech. 
Selfies are being allowed at the polls in Connecticut, but officials will be watching for whether the practice becomes disruptive for voters. 
In New Jersey, Assemblyman Raj Mukherji is pushing for a bill that would protect voters’ right to take selfies at the ballot box, CBS radio reported. 
Singer-actor Justin Timberlake got into some trouble this week after posting a photo of himself voting in Tennessee on his Instagram page. The picture prompted a reminder of the law from state officials that such photography is against the law. 
Timberlake addressed the controversy during an appearance on ‘The Tonight Show’ Wednesday, telling host Jimmy Fallon he thought he was inspiring people with the picture and “had no idea” it was illegal. 
Taking photos inside a voting booth is illegal in Tennessee under a 2015 state law, as it is in 17 other states, according to a review of laws banning ballot selfies conducted by the Associated Press.

19006,"Even With Confession of Cheating, World’s Doping Watchdog Did Nothing - The New York Times","In December 2012, the World   Agency received an email from an Olympic athlete from Russia. She was asking for help. The athlete, a discus thrower named Darya Pishchalnikova, had won a silver medal four months earlier at the London Olympics. She said that she had taken banned drugs at the direction of Russian sports and antidoping authorities and that she had information on systematic doping in her country. Please investigate, she implored the agency in the email, which was written in English. “I want to cooperate with WADA,” the email said. But WADA, the global regulator of doping in Olympic sports, did not begin an inquiry, even though a staff lawyer circulated the message to three top officials, calling the accusations “relatively precise,” including names and facts. Instead, the agency did something that seemed antithetical to its mission to protect clean athletes. It sent Ms. Pishchalnikova’s email to Russian sports officials  —   the very people who she said were running the doping program. The tactics of the World   Agency, which is partly funded by United States taxpayers, have come under international scrutiny in recent months as major doping scandals emanating from Russia have escalated into the biggest crisis in global sports. The lab director of the 2014 Sochi Olympics told The New York Times that at least 15 Russian medal winners at those Winter Games had used banned substances as part of a   program. Only after years of mounting clues of widespread doping did WADA recommend barring Russia’s track and field program from international competition the global governing body for track and field is expected to decide Friday whether to bar Russia’s team from this summer’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Interviews with dozens of officials and athletes in the Olympic movement revealed that the global antidoping watchdog mishandled allegations of widespread corruption, failed to investigate rigorously and was hampered by politics to the point that it was largely ineffective in its mission to protect the integrity of sports. Multiple warnings about Russia, including Ms. Pishchalnikova’s email, were sent to WADA over the past several years, and its response has left athletes and officials questioning whether the agency is willing to aggressively combat doping. WADA’s   body is composed of government and Olympic representatives, an arrangement that presents possible conflicts because Olympic officials might not be inclined to reveal doping transgressions that could mar the integrity of the Games while government officials could be more inclined to protect athletes from their own countries. “There are conflicts all around the table,” said Adam Pengilly, an Olympic athlete from Britain who sits on the International Olympic Committee’s athletes’ commission. Some WADA officials defended their handling of Russian doping allegations. They said their powers to combat doping had been limited, with scant resources and, until recently, no defined responsibility to conduct investigations. But other officials and athletes expressed a growing distrust of the agency’s leadership and a concern that the agency has shirked its responsibility to ensure clean competition. “This systematic doping in Russia is being spread by WADA as sensational news, and it’s not the case,” said Arne Ljungqvist, a former medical commissioner for the International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body for track and field. “They could have made an investigation,” he said about the years during which WADA received repeated tips. “But they didn’t. ” Regarded as one of the pioneers of antidoping in the Olympic movement, Dr. Ljungqvist, 85, will soon have statues erected in his honor in Monaco, the home of the I. A. A. F. and Sweden, where he worked as a medical researcher. Yet Dr. Ljungqvist is confronted with the apparent futility of his efforts to put an end to   doping. “We all knew about the Russians,” Dr. Ljungqvist said over lunch in Bedminster, N. J. at the estate of the artist Sassona Norton, who has been commissioned to make the statues. Just days before the 2008 Beijing Games, seven female Russian track and field athletes were suspended for manipulating their urine samples for drug tests. An investigation conducted by the I. A. A. F. showed that the urine the athletes provided was not their own  —   the DNA of those samples did not match that of the athletes. One of those athletes was Ms. Pishchalnikova. “It seems to be an example of systematic doping,” Dr. Ljungqvist said at a news conference in Beijing at the time. “I find it frustrating that such planned cheating is still going on. I am very disappointed. ” A year later, Russian athletes were implicated again. This time, the biathlon world champion Ekaterina Iourieva and two of her teammates were barred from the world championships after testing positive for the   hormone EPO. “We are facing systematic doping on a large scale in one of the strongest teams of the world,” Anders Besseberg, the president of the International Biathlon Union, said at the time. The Russians were left to investigate themselves. The Russian Biathlon Union was fined and promised to scrutinize its own athletes. Dr. Ljungqvist, vice president of WADA from 2008 to 2013, said he repeatedly raised concerns about Russia. The agency considered penalties against the nation, but in the end, he said, the inherent conflicts of interests within WADA and the Olympic movement won: The matter was set aside because “it was too politically infected,” he said. “You could say I was to blame, too,” he said. “But I’ve been there, and I know how hard it is to prove doping on that scale. ” In 2011, a scientific paper written by six   experts carried further clues. Titled “Prevalence of Blood Doping in Samples Collected From Elite Track and Field Athletes,” it examined thousands of samples collected from 2001 to 2009. One nation  —   identified in the papers as Country A and known to WADA  —   stood out. Country A had a notably higher number of suspicious samples. According to an author of the report, Country A was Russia. “WADA always had an excuse as to why they wouldn’t move forward,” Dr. Ljungqvist said, citing limited money and investigative resources. “They expected Russia to clean up themselves. They hadn’t fully grasped that WADA had the responsibility to do this. ” Russian sports officials have acknowledged in recent months that the country has problems with doping, but they have emphatically denied charges of a   drug program and dismissed  ’ specific allegations. They have said that they are addressing their doping problems and that their track program should be allowed to compete in the Rio Games. When the World   Agency was created in 1999, its unstated purpose was to help win back the credibility of global sports in the wake of a huge drug bust at the 1998 Tour de France and a bribery scandal involving Salt Lake City’s bid to host the 2002 Olympics. Its official purpose was not to drug test or punish cheaters but rather to serve as an independent watchdog for Olympic sports worldwide. “They were afraid sponsor money would dry up if the Olympics were perceived as dirty,” said Robert Weiner, a former spokesman for WADA and, previously, the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy. Sports officials and national governments gathered in Switzerland, home to the I. O. C. to discuss funding the new agency. The United States government was especially wary about signing on to support an agency that did not appear independent. The International Olympic Committee is in charge of the Olympic Games and derives tremendous revenue from them. I. O. C. officials  —   specifically the head of the marketing commission  —   were going to lead WADA, a doping watchdog. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director at the time, objected loudly to what he saw as the I. O. C. ’s outsize influence and its lack of political will to unearth drug violations that could tarnish the Olympic brand. “The I. O. C. is hiding behind WADA,” General McCaffrey said in a recent phone interview, suggesting negative attention was deflected from one organization to another. “And WADA is hiding behind a flawed structure. ” In 1999, Richard W. Pound, WADA’s first president and an I. O. C. member, bristled when General McCaffrey accused WADA of not being independent. Of course it would be independent, Mr. Pound wrote in a letter the month before the agency was established in Switzerland. The I. O. C. hosted the agency’s first board meeting and paid for WADA’s first two years of existence. WADA started with simple pursuits. Its charge was to standardize doping rules worldwide and create and oversee individual countries’ antidoping programs. Investigative powers were not explicitly written into the agency’s code. As time went on, many expected the organization to evolve into a more active regulator and testing body, separate from the I. O. C. and the various world governing bodies overseeing Olympic sports. That never happened. Instead, drug testing was largely left to national laboratories. In Russia, that lab was run by Grigory Rodchenkov, who said he routinely covered up positive tests in his 10 years there. With a budget of $28 million, WADA is funded equally by sports bodies and governments. After the I. O. C. the United States is the agency’s single largest contributor, committing about $2 million a year from the national drug control budget. Andy Parkinson, the founding executive director of Britain’s antidoping agency, said WADA’s structure was good in theory but too often resulted in stalemates, with Olympic loyalists and national officials rarely agreeing. “It’s really hard to strip away the perception of that conflict,” Mr. Parkinson said. For years, Vitaly Stepanov, who worked for Russia’s antidoping agency, wondered about the motives of WADA officials. He was giving them insight into an elaborate,   doping program, urging them to stop it, but seemingly nothing was done. “Everyone was telling me WADA is not an organization that fights doping,” Mr. Stepanov said. “It’s politics. ” Mr. Stepanov, who was from Russia but studied at Pace University in Manhattan, began working in antidoping education at the Russian agency in 2008, the same year the agency was officially founded. The more he learned about how the agency operated, the more he realized that the Russian system was far from the accepted standard. Sports officials told him he did not need to test some athletes because they were clean, Mr. Stepanov said. Athletes and coaches offered him bribes to dispose of positive tests. Workers at the national antidoping lab were covering up failed drug tests, and   in the Russian sports ministry were part of that scheme. Mr. Stepanov learned even more about the ministry’s methods when, in 2009, he met and married Yuliya Rusanova, a Russian   runner who told him about her doping regimen. “The ministry’s goal is not to make sports clean but to win medals for the country,” Mr. Stepanov said in a phone interview. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Mr. Stepanov met several WADA officials in a hotel and secretly began blowing the whistle on Russia, as reported in 2015 by The Sunday Times of London. WADA’s first reaction, he said, was, “What do we do?” In subsequent years, he sent some 200 emails to WADA, he said, telling antidoping officials everything he knew. “I work at a Russian antidoping agency that actually helps athletes dope,” he said in the phone interview. “I’m writing to WADA what’s going on, and nothing is happening. ” WADA’s response to many of his emails was, “Message received. ” Inside WADA’s offices, on the 17th floor of the former stock exchange building in Montreal, the agency’s officials were not sure how to handle Mr. Stepanov’s claims. David Howman, the longtime director general, whose corner office overlooks the St. Lawrence River, wavered. A lawyer from New Zealand, Mr. Howman said he thought to himself: “We don’t want to be the police. We can’t be the police. ” But he was aware that doping was becoming a criminal enterprise, and investigations  —   perhaps more than drug testing  —   were a key to exposing cheaters. (For instance, in the sprawling steroids case involving the Bay Area Laboratory   or Balco, none of the athletes found to have been doping had failed drug tests.) When WADA was confronted with suggestions that the Russians had resurrected an East   system of doping, Mr. Howman said, his   staff seemed inadequate. The agency did not even have an investigator, and it claimed that it did not have the authority to conduct investigations. “It’s really up to us to monitor everyone that’s our job,” Mr. Howman said in an interview in Montreal last month. “The idea was not to do the investigations ourselves but to gather the information and share it with those who could actually do something about it. That’s how this whole thing started. ” But Mr. Howman eventually hired a top drug investigator from the United States: Jack Robertson, who would be the liaison between WADA and global law enforcement and who could also help WADA untangle complicated cases. In September 2011, Mr. Robertson was assigned to tackle doping investigations for WADA. His assignment was the entire world. Mr. Robertson, a former special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, had a résumé that would make any doper shudder. He ran some of the United States’ biggest doping investigations in recent history, including the case that helped bring down Lance Armstrong, the   Tour de France winner who was found to have doped for most of his career. In the months before his official hiring date, Mr. Robertson joined WADA’s legal director, Olivier Niggli, in meeting Mr. Stepanov at the Boston Marathon, to hear his account firsthand. Mr. Robertson and Mr. Stepanov met again, in Turkey, the next year. (Mr. Stepanov was fired from Russia’s antidoping agency after raising his concerns internally. He and his wife eventually fled Russia and are now living in an undisclosed location in the United States with their young son.) Mr. Robertson, who was gathering information, leads and potential witnesses, also encountered misfortune. His wife died of cancer, and he himself had throat cancer, losing weight so rapidly that he needed a feeding tube. But he pressed on with the case. Officially, WADA’s explicit power to investigate would begin with a new code, approved in 2013 to take effect two years later  —   four years after Mr. Robertson was hired as staff investigator. Still, there did not appear to be an appetite to look deeper into Russia, especially after a new president came on board in 2014. His name was Craig Reedie, a longtime I. O. C. official who had been involved with WADA from the start. When Mr. Reedie took over as head of the agency, things changed, several staffers said. At the same time, Russia began giving an extra donation to WADA, with no reason earmarked on WADA’s financial statements  —   an unusual move. In all, in the past three years, Russia has given an extra $1. 14 million on top of its annual contribution, which was $746, 000 in 2015. A spokesman for the agency confirmed Russia’s contributions and said countries that choose to make additional donations had never received special treatment. Mr. Reedie, a Scot who once led the international badminton federation, was a smooth and popular leader in the political world of the Olympics. In antidoping circles, he is not regarded as an aggressive crusader. “We’re not going to turn to people and say, ‘These are the rules obey them,’” Mr. Reedie said in the lounge of the   Lausanne Palace hotel in Switzerland this month. He explained that WADA was better suited to offer sports federations and countries advice when they asked for it rather than pursue accusations of cheating. Mr. Reedie’s predecessor, John Fahey, a politician from Australia, had given his blessing for Mr. Robertson to explore allegations involving Russia’s laboratories. “There was always in our mind a deep suspicion that the government was controlling Rusada,” Mr. Fahey said in a phone interview last month, using the acronym for the Russian   Agency, which employed Mr. Stepanov. When Mr. Reedie took over, the inquiry into Russia stalled, according to several people at WADA. Mr. Robertson needed help on the case. He needed more personnel and more money to conduct a thorough investigation. But again and again, he was met with a    attitude. Frustrated, he forced WADA’s hand, according to several people in the organization. He leaked information on the case to Hajo Seppelt, a journalist for the German broadcasting company ARD. Mr. Seppelt’s bombshell report, “The Secrets of Doping: How Russia Makes Its Winners,” aired on Dec. 3, 2014. At first, Mr. Reedie told his fellow WADA officials to stand back and see if the global media picked up the story, according to several people at WADA who were not authorized to speak to reporters. But during that delay, antidoping officials spoke out, urging WADA to investigate ARD’s claims. On Dec. 8, 2014, Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States   Agency, sent a letter to Mr. Reedie and Mr. Howman at WADA, insisting that the agency had investigative power and that it needed to apply it to Russia. WADA could not possibly hand over the case to the I. A. A. F. the track and field governing body, Mr. Tygart said, because multiple sports were implicated in the ARD report. In addition, he wrote, a vice president of the track organization was reported to be a part of the  . “For WADA to sit on the sidelines in the face of such allegations flies in the face of WADA’s mandate from sport, governments and clean athletes,” Mr. Tygart wrote. Days later, WADA commissioned an independent inquiry. Mr. Pound, who had a reputation as an aggressive antidoping crusader, was installed as the chairman. Needing investigative muscle, the agency hired 5 Stones intelligence, a private investigations firm based in Miami and staffed with former members of the D. E. A. the Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Four months into that investigation, Natalya Zhelanova, an adviser to the Russian sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, received an email from Mr. Reedie. It seemingly told her and Russia not to worry about the inquiry. Mr. Reedie assured Ms. Zhelanova that in his opinion the accusations of Russian doping stemmed from a time before Russia had implemented new laws and antidoping efforts. He gave his assurance that Russia was going to be fine because “there is no action being taken by WADA that is critical of the efforts that I know have been made, or are being made, to improve antidoping efforts in Russia. ” “On a personal level I value the relationship I have with Minister Mutko, and I shall be grateful if you will inform him that there is no intention in WADA to do anything to affect that relationship,” Mr. Reedie wrote. When The Daily Mail in London published the email in August 2015, antidoping officials, including Mr. Pound, were stunned. The president of WADA was seemingly undermining the credibility of the independent investigation. “Jeez, Craig, what are you doing?” Mr. Pound said he asked Mr. Reedie. “You know those people aren’t your friends, right? They’re the ones who released this to the media. ” Mr. Reedie offered a mea culpa in another London newspaper shortly after, saying that his note to Ms. Zhelanova had been misconstrued and that WADA was not interfering with the independent investigation. Mr. Reedie said he saw no conflicts in his dual allegiances to the Olympics and the antidoping agency. “I think we manage to do reasonably well,” he said of the current structure of the agency. “It works, and there is constant challenge from both sport and governments to everything WADA does. ” The inquiry’s findings were published in November 2015 in an explosive   report that centered on track and field. Russia was accused of widespread   doping. But not everything investigators had unearthed  —   including Ms. Pishchalnikova’s 2012 email, and WADA’s handling of it  —   made it into the report. Even so, the external pressure intensified for WADA to look beyond Russia’s track and field program and to scrutinize other countries that had come under suspicion. But Mr. Reedie was reluctant, according to several WADA officials. He said that WADA did not have the money and that there was not enough evidence to pursue another investigation. “You couldn’t go forward because he was in charge,” Mr. Howman said of Mr. Reedie. “You have to rely on the people in charge, and Craig was in charge of the political stuff. ” Two years earlier, however, Mr. Howman was among the top WADA officials who had received the email plea from Ms. Pishchalnikova. Mr. Reedie was on the agency’s Foundation Board at the time, but he was not yet president. In her 2012 email, Ms. Pishchalnikova named Dr. Rodchenkov, the antidoping lab director whose facility had recently been flagged by WADA for suspicious test results. She said he was substituting out athletes’   urine with clean urine. “I have proof,” the 2012 email said. The agency’s decision to forward the email to track and field officials  —   including Russian ones who were implicated in the allegations  —   was a function of protocol. In spite of having hired a staff investigator, WADA did not at that time see itself as capable of conducting investigations, the agency has said. Four months after Ms. Pishchalnikova wrote to WADA, the Russian track and field federation barred her for 10 years. She is retired from competition and living in Russia. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful. Mr. Reedie  —   who said he had never heard of Ms. Pishchalnikova’s email  —   said he required proof before initiating investigations. “We need people to come to us with evidence, and then we will investigate,” he said in an interview. He said the decision to allow Russian track and field athletes to compete in the Summer Games was entirely up to the sport’s governing body. “That’s their problem,” he said. “I’m one of the few people who doesn’t wake up in the morning and think only about Rio. ” In recent months, athletes have agitated for further inquiries. “Clean athletes are at the point where we can’t have faith in the system,” said Lauryn Williams, a United States sprinter and bobsledder. She added that she was disappointed that the November report had not immediately spurred a broader inquiry. “Who’s defending us?” she said. “Who’s on our side?” After Ms. Williams and other athletes from around the world sent a letter to WADA and the I. O. C. last month detailing their concerns, the agency announced a new independent investigation into the allegations about cheating at the Sochi Olympics made by Dr. Rodchenkov, the lab director. Other specialized inquiries, including one into accusations of doping by Chinese swimmers, have been opened. “Investigations have become the flavor of the month,” Mr. Reedie said. Mr. Howman, who is leaving WADA this month, said that only after the Sochi investigation was complete  —   roughly two weeks before the Rio Games are scheduled to begin, it is expected  —   should WADA be judged on how it had handled the cases. “It’s a really tense time because no one wants to mess it up,” Mr. Howman said. As for Mr. Reedie, his term as WADA president runs through the end of the year. Many antidoping experts and athletes see his dual role as a vice president of the I. O. C. as emblematic of the conflict they say is derailing WADA. After the recent interview in Lausanne, Mr. Reedie handed a reporter his business card. He apologized that, with its   Olympics rings logo, it was an official I. O. C. card, not a WADA one. “It’s the only one I can give you,” he said.",0
19007,Supreme Court Complicates Corruption Cases From New York to Illinois - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   After Dean G. Skelos, the   New York state senator, was sentenced last month on federal corruption charges, one of his lawyers asked the judge to allow Mr. Skelos to remain free on bail while he appealed his conviction. Her argument: A case pending in the United States Supreme Court, challenging the conviction of former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, could help undermine the criminal charges against Mr. Skelos. “It is extremely likely that the court will reverse the conviction in Governor McDonnell’s case,” Alexandra A. E. Shapiro, the lawyer, told the judge. Her prediction proved accurate. And within moments after the Supreme Court reversed Mr. McDonnell’s conviction on Monday, defense lawyers from Illinois to New York were citing the unanimous ruling as grounds to challenge past and pending criminal corruption cases brought by the Justice Department. “This is a sign of the court saying to prosecutors, ‘You are overreaching,’” said Leonard Goodman, a lawyer for former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2011 and is scheduled to be resentenced in August. “They think they have unfettered discretion to take down any elected officials. ” Current and former prosecutors strongly disagreed. In Manhattan, a spokesman for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney there, said in a statement on Monday, “While we are reviewing the McDonnell decision, the official actions that led to the convictions of Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos fall squarely within the definition set forth by the Supreme Court today. ” Mr. Bharara has repeatedly said he remains committed to ending a pattern of corrupt acts by elected officials, and most recently, his office won the convictions of Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver, a former State Assembly leader. Still, there was agreement among legal experts on Monday that the ruling would make it harder for the government to win corruption convictions. For the second time since 2010, the court narrowed the avenues that prosecutors have to file such charges. The decision could even discourage some cases from being brought in the first place. “The bar is now higher in terms of what you have to prove,” said Randall D. Eliason, a former chief of the public corruption section at the United States attorney’s office in Washington. “This will leave a lot of unsavory conduct unpunished. ” Mr. McDonnell was accused of accepting gifts, loans and vacations from an affluent Virginia businessman who wanted the governor’s help dealing with state officials. “Our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the court, adding that “setting up a meeting, talking to another official or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so)  —   without more”  —   does not fit the definition of an “official act. ” In 2010, in a decision also involving   honest services fraud, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction of Jeffrey K. Skilling  —   the former chief executive of Enron, the bankrupt energy company  —   ruling that the law could be used to prosecute only bribery or kickbacks, not more limited actions like “self dealing,” in which an official secretly takes an action for personal gain. Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group, said the combination of rulings was likely to have a major impact because elected officials involved in wrongdoing often did not have the power to personally deliver the favor that had been requested. Mr. Bookbinder said examples of cases that might now be harder to prosecute included those of Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, who pushed the Defense Department to select a particular contractor after receiving gifts and pleaded guilty in 2005, and Representative William J. Jefferson, Democrat of Louisiana, who was convicted in 2009 of taking bribes from a company that asked him to press executive branch officials to buy its products. “The Supreme Court seems to be giving people a way to go ahead with corrupt conduct, with kind of a wink and a nod,” Mr. Bookbinder said. Joel Bertocchi, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, cautioned against overstating the impact of Monday’s ruling. “Having the same set of facts, they may be able to file different charges,” he said. But defense lawyers and some conservative legal groups that have been critical of the Justice Department said they hoped the ruling would bring real change. They argued that the government had, in its zeal to win headlines, filed charges in recent years for activities that did not meet the standard for federal corruption. “Once again, it has taken the U. S. Supreme Court to remind prosecutors that they do not have a blank check to read all kinds of unintended and overly broad criminality into vaguely worded statutes passed by Congress,” said E. G. Morris, a lawyer in Austin, Tex. and the president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The precise impact of the McDonnell ruling on the Skelos and Silver cases was not immediately clear. Lawyers for Mr. Skelos, the former State Senate majority leader and a Republican, had no comment on the decision. But at Mr. Skelos’s sentencing last month, Rahul Mukhi, a prosecutor in Mr. Bharara’s office, argued that Mr. Skelos’s corrupt acts had gone far beyond those taken by Mr. McDonnell, and that the cases were not “factually analogous. ” “McDonnell involved only meetings,” Mr. Mukhi said. “This case involved, overwhelmingly, legislation. ” Mr. Bharara’s office had said, for example, that Mr. Skelos supported legislation in Albany to benefit companies that arranged payments to his son, Adam B. Skelos, who was convicted along with his father. The elder Mr. Skelos received a   prison term his son was sentenced to six and a half years. Lawyers for Mr. Silver, a Democrat who received a   sentence, said Monday that the McDonnell decision “will be central” to their client’s appeal. The lawyers, Steven F. Molo and Joel Cohen, said the decision “makes clear that the federal government has gone too far in prosecuting state officials for conduct that is part of the everyday functioning of those in elected office. ” Noel J. Francisco, who argued Mr. McDonnell’s case before the Supreme Court, said that he hoped the ruling would be the end of his client’s prosecution and that the charges would be dropped entirely. “They brought the case they brought,” he said, “because that was the most they could get a conviction on. That theory has been squarely rejected. ”",0
19008,Fred Fleitz: ‘We May Have Generations of Radical Islamists in the U.K. Unless the British Government Wakes Up’,"Senior Vice President for Policy and Programs Fred Fleitz of the Center for Security Policy joined SiriusXM host Joel Pollak on Monday’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the London Bridge terror attack. [Pollak began by asking if the London Bridge attack would finally provide the   call needed for those who underestimate or downplay the dangers of radical Islamic terrorism.  “A lot of people who were in denial almost say the right thing after these events. They sort of can’t help themselves,” Fleitz replied.  “But what really concerns me is that yes, it’s right we have to improve security  —   we need better outreach, we need better intelligence  —   but there’s something they’re not talking about in the U. K. that really needs to be focused on: the role that the failure to assimilate British Muslims has created the situation,” he said. “There are communities where British Muslims are deliberately not assimilating, are being taught to hate British society, and this is incubating radicalism. There’s actually a parallel system of sharia law courts in the U. K. that operate. ” “We may have generations of radical Islamists in the U. K. until the British government wakes up and stops the situation,” he warned. Pollak pointed out that the United States has unassimilated religious communities with their own internal systems of government that live peaceably alongside their neighbors, such as the Amish and Jewish communities in upstate New York. “It’s certainly true there are some communities in the United States that have not assimilated,” Fleitz agreed. “I’m not concerned about Amish or Jewish communities, but I will tell you that there are enclaves of Muslim communities in Michigan and Minnesota that concern me. We know that in Minnesota there’s a rising rate of measles because the community has not assimilated into the rest of the community, and is not vaccinating their children. This is wrong. This is a big problem. ”  “The problem with these Muslim communities is that it is making them susceptible to this radical worldview that wants to destroy modern society, create a global caliphate, and impose sharia law on everyone on Earth,” Fleitz contended. “These other communities aren’t trying to do that. They’re peaceful religious communities. ” “Also, when we have immigrants coming to a country from another country, I think they need to learn the practices and laws of the country where they’re coming to, the country that is accepting them and serving as a refuge for them. I think when people come to their new home country, they should understand and learn about the laws of this new country. That’s not happening in the U. K.,” he said. Pollak offered the converse observation that some of the worst terrorist murderers, such as the San Bernardino jihadis, appear to be fairly  .  “We can have homegrown radical Islamist terrorists  —   and I don’t really think they’re homegrown, I think they’re inspired or directed by foreign Islamist terrorist organizations  —   but it’s this ideology of hate that either is being communicated to them over the Internet, or is being passed on to members of separated communities in the U. K. It’s the ideology we have to confront, and I think this problem is worse in these separate communities,” Fleitz said. Fleitz argued that measures to hinder the ability of extremists to recruit and coordinate with the Internet should be explored, with due regard for civil liberties, but he is more concerned about “radical clerics and radical mosques who are promoting this type of hate and ideology firsthand. ” “I also want to stop these ISIS videos that we know homegrown radical Islamist terrorists are taking in, and it’s playing a role in radicalizing them,” he added. “I think   was a   call. You could just see how Republicans and Democrats in Washington were working together against the threat. Now we’re challenged by political correctness, and people who are in denial, and don’t want to the let the government take the steps it has to take to go after radical Islam,” Fleitz reflected. “Whenever there’s a radical Islamic terrorist attack, we get these lectures about Islamophobia from our leaders, leaders in the U. K. I think that is really hobbling the ability of our government to go after this threat, and that’s unfortunate. I hope what happened in London will be a   call, but I’m worried in a few weeks we’ll be lectured about Islamophobia again,” he said. “Anyone who raises concerns about radical Islam seems to be tarred and feathered as an Islamophobe in this country. I’ll let the people who peddle this term give a better explanation, but that’s my experience,” he replied when Pollak asked for a precise definition of “Islamophobia. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

19009,Опрос: Россияне одобряют действия президента Путина и правительства,"0 комментариев 4 поделились Фото: AP 
Как показало исследование, рейтинг одобрения деятельности президента с августа по октябрь вырос с 78,7 до 81,8%. Положительные оценки работы правительства также выросли: с 53,6 до 58,3%. 
Лучше стали жители страны относится и к работе Госдумы: в октябре рейтинг одобрения российского парламенте вырос с 39,7% в сентября до 45,5%. Также вырос и рейтинг Совета Федерации с 42,1% до 46,4%. При этом снизилась доля негативных оценок деятельности Госдумы и Совфеда: с 42,8% в сентябре до 34,8% в октябре, с 31,2% до 25,8%, соответственно. 
В сентябре на фоне парламентских выборов полюса оценок сместились (доля отрицательных ответов превысила долю положительных), а в октябре вернулись на прежние места, свидетельствует опрос. 
Практически не изменились за этот период рейтинги одобрения общественных институтов. Исключение - оппозиция - после всплеска в выборный месяц (36,4% в сентябре), оценки снизились, приблизившись к прежним значениям (31,6% в октябре). Работой политических партий в целом довольны 45,1% россиян, обратного мнения придерживаются 32,4%. 
Среди прочих институтов наибольшую поддержку и одобрение россияне выказывают Вооруженным силам страны (83,5%), причем за десять лет эта цифра выросла почти вдвое (с 44% в октябре 2006 года). Также большинство опрошенных положительно оценивают работу Русской Православной церкви (70,4%), средств массовой информации (60,5%). 
Комментируя результаты исследования, генеральный директор ВЦИОМ Валерий Федоров отметил снижение социального самочувствия россиян в январе-августе этого года на фоне ухудшающейся экономической ситуации и одновременное падение рейтингов органов государственной власти. 
""К лету экономическая ситуация стала стабилизироваться, вслед за этим, с лагом в пару месяцев, остановился процесс ухудшения социального самочувствия. В сентябре стабилизация повседневной жизни дошла до политики: тренд развернулся в сторону повышения"", сказал он. 
Опрос ВЦИОМ проведен 22-23 октября в 130 населенных пунктах в 46 областях, краях и республиках и 8 федеральных округах России. Объем выборки 1,6 тысячи человек. 
Напомним, согласно социологическому исследованию, также проведенному ВЦИОМ, несмотря на экономический кризис, число россиян, желающих эмигрировать за границу, за последние годы не увеличилось . 
Как сообщают исследователи, экономический кризис и санкционная политика не оказали влияния на эмиграционные настроения россиян. Доля россиян, желающих уехать за рубеж с 2011 по 2016 года колеблется в пределах 11-13%. При этом 63% из них слабо представляют, когда именно осуществят переезд, и ничего не предпринимают для переезда за границу.

19010,"Book burning for a digital age. Google CEO talks about ""fake news"" censorship","November 17, 2016 102 Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has responded to concerns about fake news stories, heightened since the US election. Share on Facebook 
Here we go with the liberal left’s latest boogeyman “fake news” . 
Let’s find anything, absolutely anything to blame on Hillary’s election loss…blame it on Putin, on not getting their way, on Brexit, on Farage, on not having enough safe spaces, on all the apparent injustices of the world. Now let’s blame it on the “fake news”. 
WTF is “fake news” even mean. The politically correct, crying liberal masses are reaching a point of stupid, that is beyond compare in the history of mankind. 
“Fake news” is right on up there with WMDs, barrel bombs, mansplaining, color revolutions, humanitarian wars, moderate rebels, gender fluidity, the patriarchy…all made up, destructive apparitions engineered to avoid confronting the man in the mirror. 
Here we go with the lying establishment media, and the “socially responsible” social media tech giants jumping on board censorship in disguise, telling the world what they should or should not read. Book burning for a digital age. 
Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai will “do no evil” , saying it is important for Google and other social media businesses to promote “accurate” stories to their billions of users …and Pichai is just the man to judge what is “real news” and what is “fake news”, because we the deplorables have neither the brains, nor the judgement, to discern between right and wrong, real and fake. 
Thank God for the liberal left, and their neo-liberal value system, to help us plebiscites make sense of such a mixed up world. 
We got conned into supporting Trump because the “fake news” seemed so real and was so enticing that we completely fell for it, and in the process prevented the the peace loving, saintly Hillary Clinton from keeping America great. 
Talking to the BBC’s Economics editor Kamal Ahmed in the wake of fake news controversies during the US election campaign, Mr Pichai said the firm had made some mistakes. 
“There have been a couple of incidences where… we didn’t get it right.” 
“It is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.” ",0

19012,A ‘Short-Circuit’ on F.B.I. Inquiry? Hillary Clinton Seeks to Explain - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Hillary Clinton on Friday sought to explain her recent mischaracterization of the F. B. I. investigation into her private email server, saying she “may have  ” in her remarks during a television interview on Sunday when she asserted that the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, had called her statements about her private email servers “truthful. ” Mrs. Clinton made the remarks while taking her most extensive questions from journalists in months  —   after going more than 200 days without holding a formal news conference. She has been under fire from Republicans and others since her remarks Sunday on Fox News about her use of a private email server as secretary of state and the resulting F. B. I. investigation. While Mr. Comey did not recommend charges in the case, he said Mrs. Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her use of a private email server and contradicted statements she made about her handling of her email. In her remarks here before the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Mrs. Clinton tried to explain the discrepancy with what Mr. Comey actually said. “I was pointing out in both of those instances that Director Comey had said that my answers in my F. B. I. interview were truthful,” she said. “That’s really the bottom line here. ” Mrs. Clinton reiterated her explanation that the classified emails the F. B. I. had identified as having passed over her private server were not marked classified at the time. The explanation did not appease Republicans. “It’s not hard to see why she hasn’t held a press conference in 244 days,” said the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus. “Hillary Clinton is once again proving herself incapable of telling the truth. ” During her remarks, Mrs. Clinton said she took “seriously” the problems she has had winning voters’ trust. Questioned about why a majority of voters do not trust her, Mrs. Clinton referred to her high approval ratings when she was secretary of state and a senator from New York. “Were 67 percent of the people in New York wrong? Were 66 percent of the American public wrong?” she asked. “Just maybe, when I’m actually running for a job, there is a real benefit to those on the other side with trying to stir up as much trouble as possible. ” And she explained that the economic frustration driving many of Donald J. Trump’s supporters should be taken seriously. When asked about what Mr. Trump’s millions of supporters, who are often drawn to language she and others have called racist and sexist, says about the electorate, Mrs. Clinton said that while some people were backing the businessman because of his “bigotry,” she acknowledged that many were motivated by economic hardships. “We have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive,” she said. “We have to acknowledge that  —   but let’s not lose sight of the real pain that many of Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind. ” Mrs. Clinton also criticized Mr. Trump on Friday as someone who would be a dangerous president and stressed that if elected, she would work on issues related to systemic racism and the economy that often hit black and Hispanic communities the hardest. “He is harkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society,” she said. “We need to stand up as a country and say that Donald Trump doesn’t represent who we are and what we believe. ” Mrs. Clinton also vowed to push hard to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill with a path toward citizenship for those in the country illegally, and said she would prioritize the issue during her first 100 days in office. Mrs. Clinton joins a long list of political leaders who have spoken at the groups’ conventions, which often focus on increasing diversity in newsrooms. President Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former president George W. Bush, Bob Dole and former Vice President Al Gore have all addressed past conventions. The groups invited Mr. Trump to speak, but he declined, according to the organizers. Before taking questions, Mrs. Clinton delivered a   address focused mostly on how her plans to improve the economy would especially benefit blacks and Latinos. “Rosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus,” she said. “Now we’ve got to open up every opportunity. ” Hovering over the address was the image of Mrs. Clinton addressing a room full of journalists. Although she occasionally holds informal sessions with the news media on campaign stops, Clinton aides have spent months explaining why she hasn’t held an official news conference, as most candidates, particularly Mr. Trump, do regularly. “We’ll have a press conference when we want to have a press conference,” Joel Benenson, the campaign’s chief strategist and pollster, told ABC News last month. She even had some words of encouragement for the Fourth Estate: “We need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable,” Mrs. Clinton told the hundreds of journalists attending the   conference here of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Near the end of the event, Mrs. Clinton talked about her   girlfriends, whom she rarely mentions in public. Asked what the most meaningful conversation she has had with one of them, she said she was “blessed to have a crew of great friends. ” These include some of her most senior aides, including Cheryl D. Mills, Maggie Williams and Minyon Moore. “I can’t compress it into one conversation,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They’ve supported me. They’ve chastised me. They’ve raised issues with me. ”",0
19013,Tom Ciccotta Shuts Down Feminist Bucknell Professor for Interrupting Guest Speaker - Breitbart,"Breitbart’s Tom Ciccotta shut down a feminist Bucknell University professor after she repeatedly interrupted guest speaker Christina Hoff Sommers during an event in Lewisburg, PA, on Thursday night.[  During the event’s QA, the professor identified herself as a feminist philosophy professor. Throughout the evening, she repeatedly interrupted and shouted down AEI resident scholar Christina Hoff Sommers, who was the guest speaker at the event. “Are you going to keep interrupting our speaker?” asked Ciccotta after the professor repeatedly interrupted. “How many progressive professors are at Bucknell? I think it’s like eighty percent. ” “I could never conduct myself in the classroom the way you’ve conducted yourself tonight,” he continued. When asked for comment, Ciccotta added that, “She came to our event with the intention of making a scene. She had no genuine interest in respectfully engaging with our speaker. She set a poor example for the students in attendance. ” “Considering that the Bucknell classroom is a safe space for progressivism, it’s disappointing that she felt so threatened by a   departure from the campus’ political orthodoxy,” he concluded.",0
19014,"In France, a Recipe Squabble over Marseille Soap - The New York Times","Marseille soap, or Savon de Marseille, is as French as wine and cheese, with a history that dates from the Middle Ages. Frenchwomen swear by the crude square blocks, which they use as a natural skin cleanser and, in a pinch, as anything from a toothpaste substitute to a moth repellent. In recent years, though, cheap Chinese and Turkish knockoffs have been flooding the market, and the soapmakers of Marseille are rallying to protect their product’s reputation. They banded together recently to ask the French government to grant them a label of authenticity, to distinguish the genuine stuff from the imitators. And that is where the trouble really began. The original Marseille soap had a specific    recipe that was considered so sacred that Louis XIV protected it with a royal edict. But a battle has erupted between two soapmaking factions over exactly what the modern rules should be for what constitutes a true Marseille soap. On one side are the soapmasters, based mainly in the Mediterranean port that gave the soap its name. They say that the label of authenticity should go only to products made strictly by the original Louis   recipe. It’s quite a process, involving heating a mix of soda ash, seawater and olive oil in large caldrons for several days, and then cooling it in open pits. The finished soap is   and odorless. On the other side are a group of 12 large companies, including L’Occitane, a global chain retailer of body and fragrance products. They want the government to certify their recipe, which allows the use of cheaper vegetable oils along with additives and perfumes to produce scented soap bars in a rainbow of colors. “The ancient recipe is outmoded,” said Emilie Grangeon, the general secretary of the Association of Makers of Savon de Marseille, which represents the companies. “We should be able to improve the quality. ” Each side is refusing to talk to the other, while trying to convince the government that its recipe should win. The government, for its part, is using its own   method to delay a decision: It has set up an investigative panel that is to deliver a recommendation in September.",0
19015,"West Bank Settlers Prepare for Clash, With Israeli Government - The New York Times","AMONA OUTPOST, West Bank  —   Thousands of Israeli police officers stormed this hilltop settler outpost in the occupied West Bank to raze nine illegally built homes. Settlers and their supporters hurled cinder blocks at the officers, who charged on horseback and beat protesters with batons. The homes were torn down, but 300 people were injured and the emotional scars ran deep. Some later called it a pogrom. That was a decade ago. Now the residents of Amona are readying for another battle with their own government and security forces, trying to thwart an Israeli Supreme Court order that the entire outpost be dismantled by Dec. 25. Barring an   compromise, organizers expect up to 20, 000 sympathizers to move into Amona, where 40 families live in prefabricated homes and trailers, to resist a forced evacuation. “I will sit down on my backside with my arms folded,” said Avichay Buaron, a lawyer who moved to the outpost a few months after it was established in 1996. “Thousands will sit down,” he added. “If they hit us, they hit us. ” A flagship of the settler enterprise, Amona is becoming a test of how far Israel’s   government will go to avoid a clash with its constituency and how vested it is in more than 100 outposts built without authorization across the West Bank. It is forcing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to balance the demands of his conservative coalition partners, the state’s judicial authorities and world leaders, who overwhelmingly view the settlements as violations of international law. The Obama administration on Wednesday condemned Israel’s plan to build 98 housing units east of Shilo, a settlement a few miles north of Amona, which are meant to accommodate the outpost’s evacuees. In an unusually sharp statement, the State Department said the plan, which Israel described as a new neighborhood of Shilo, was “deeply troubling” and would “create a significant new settlement deep in the West Bank. ” In the years since the bloody 2006 confrontation in Amona, the West Bank settler population has grown to nearly 400, 000 from about 250, 000. Support for removing settlements as a route to peace has dropped among an Israeli Jewish public jaded by failed negotiations with the Palestinians, recurring violence and the widespread perception that withdrawing from the Gaza Strip in 2005 only fomented terrorism. Mr. Netanyahu’s government has been working to retroactively legalize dozens of settler outposts that sit on public land. But Amona was built on privately owned Palestinian land, where Israel’s own judiciary insists the state cannot simply   construction. “It puts the government in a very uncomfortable spot,” said Yoaz Hendel, a former aide to Mr. Netanyahu who put the current impasse down to the inertia of successive   governments on the issue. Amona sits at the top of a narrow asphalt road winding up from Ofra, a vibrant settlement of about 3, 300 religious Jews near Ramallah, the Palestinian administrative capital. The outpost is strategically perched 3, 000 feet above sea level, with commanding views of the central West Bank, which the Palestinians envision as the heart of their future state. Mr. Buaron, who came as a student in his early 20s, said Amona’s founding residents were told at the time that the government wanted to set up a new neighborhood of Ofra. “We did not come as thieves in the night,” he insisted. “We were pioneers. ” Mr. Buaron married and had seven children in Amona, where his home has a slightly unkempt garden and a view of a picturesque Palestinian village in the rolling hills beyond. Now he is leading the campaign to save it. Leafing through a bound folio of maps, photographs and documents from the outpost’s early years, Mr. Buaron pointed out how the state helped provide its infrastructure: a   power line, Housing Ministry plans to prepare 40 plots for permanent homes, a road. If there are legal flaws in Amona’s location, he argued, it is up to the state to find a solution that would allow its residents  —   lawyers, teachers, a computer programmer and farmers who grow raspberries, olives and grapes or who raise sheep  —   to remain in place. The settlers are pushing for legislation that would force Palestinian owners to accept compensation rather than get their land back, arguing that the current legal strictures could be applied to thousands of settler homes beyond Amona. The attorney general has already ruled out that option, but 25 of the 30 Parliament members from Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud Party nonetheless signed a petition backing it last month. The Amona leaders have publicly rejected the idea of relocating to the alternative site on what the government declared to be state, or public, land near Shilo. In a letter addressed to Mr. Netanyahu and posted on  Facebook, they wrote, “We have nothing to lose. ” The prime minister’s office declined to comment on the options for Amona. Israel’s   defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman  —   a settler himself  —   has said that the outpost cannot remain where it stands. Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the settlers’ Yesha Council, said he still hoped the government and the residents could “find the middle ground. ” They have had plenty of time. The Supreme Court ruling, which followed more than a decade of legal wrangling, came in December 2014. The Palestinians who petitioned the court are now watching from the towns and villages in the surrounding hills. Atallah Abd   Hamed, 63, a resident of the Palestinian town of Silwad, said that he and his three siblings inherited an   plot on the edge of Amona from his father. “It was all grapevines,” he recalled. The family has not worked the land, where a single settler home sits, since the 1980s. Mr. Hamed said that was because the only access to it was through Ofra and, in any case, the grapes went bad from disease. Accusing settlers of setting fire to his fields soon after the blight, he said, “Within 10 minutes everything was black. ” If Amona is removed, as the court has mandated, Mr. Hamed said, “I am going to plant it all again with apples and almonds. ” “Not grapes,” he added, as if the vines would be somehow cursed. Mr. Buaron, the Amona leader, said there was nothing stopping Palestinians from coming to work their land, but Mr. Hamed’s wife, Nihad, 56, expressed a widely held fear. “They would shoot us,” she said, noting that an unarmed man from Silwad was killed by Israeli soldiers in August. “I wouldn’t send my sons. ” In a feverish search for a compromise, Israel’s attorney general has been examining the possibility of leasing to the settlers plots adjacent to Amona whose Palestinian owners appear to have abandoned. The Israeli military’s custodian of abandoned West Bank lands placed an advertisement in   in the Palestinian newspaper   along with a map, asking anybody claiming ownership to submit objections within 30 days. The United States State Department denounced that approach, saying it “would represent an unprecedented and troubling step that’s inconsistent with prior Israeli legal opinions and counter to longstanding Israeli policy to not seize private Palestinian land for Israeli settlements. ” Michael Sfard, an Israeli lawyer who represented the Palestinian landowners in the Amona case on behalf of the Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din, said this was an inversion of the Military Order of 1967, when the occupation began, meant to protect abandoned property until its owners returned. “If the army has a duty to preserve abandoned property,” he said, “is this the best way it can think of, giving it to people who are not ready to leave it and who have already shown that they have no problem with violating the property rights of others?” Alan Baker,   of a 2012 government report that recommended authorizing settler outposts built on public land, agreed that “privacy is holy” when it comes to property rights. But contrary to Mr. Sfard, Mr. Baker argued that absentee land “is placed in the hands of the government to use and enjoy the same way as public land,” as long as it remains registered as absentee property. Abdallah Abu Rahmeh, a Palestinian Authority official who focuses on settlements, saw the Israeli debate as hairsplitting that obscures the depth of the occupation. “It is not up to Israel to determine where each piece of land is going to go in our own country,” he said. In any case, Yesh Din, the Israeli rights group assisting the Palestinian landowners, said objections had been submitted regarding the “vast majority” of the plots. One is from Maryam Hassan Abd   Hamad, 81, of Silwad, whose husband, now dead, passed his property on to their six children. “The lawyer once told us they wanted to give us alternative land,” Ms. Hamad said, sitting in a domed room in her family’s compound, where chickens were running around in the yard. “We refused. We were raised there,” she said, reminiscing how her family would plant grains one year and vegetables  —   tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, okra  —   the next. “We put the blood of our hearts into our land. ” Rivka Nizri, who was born in Amona 18 years ago and was married late last month, has set up her home in a trailer that she and her new husband renovated in the outpost. She said she was trying not to think much about the possibility of being ousted before the end of the year. “I won’t go easily,” Ms. Nizri said of the impending evacuation. “They will have to take me. ”",0
19016,"""Реакция Венгрии на сюжет Киселева это не угроза России""","Мир » Европа » Восточная Европа Во вторник МИД Венгрии вызвал посла России в связи с ""пренебрежительными комментариями"" в российских государственных СМИ о событиях антисоветского восстания в Венгрии в 1956 году. МИД Венгрии заявил, что российские государственные СМИ описали венгерский бунт как ""погром"" и как первую из ""цветных революций"". Речь идет о сюжете ""Венгры ностальгируют по ""гуляш-социализму"" в программе ""Вести недели"" Дмитрия Киселева, вышедшей в эфир 23 октября. 0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Прокомментировал возникшее недоразумение для Pravda.Ru доктор социологических наук, директор Института междисциплинарных исследований Алексей Новоточинов. 
- Считаете ли вы реакцию Венгрии адекватной? А почему бы нам не вызвать венгерского посла и сказать, что не потерпим, как в венгерских СМИ освещаются итоги ВОВ и ее герои? 
— Мне жалко, что Дмитрий Киселев довольно недальновидно, со странным пафосом полез в очень трогательные и ощутимые сферы все еще довольно сложных отношений между Россией и Венгрией. Вот сейчас венгры вызвали посла, я догадываюсь, какие традиционные слова в этой связи могут сказать. Я квалифицирую их просто, как призыв осмотреться, вдуматься и больше этого не делать. 
Я родом из Курской области Касторенского района деревня Скакун, где венгры в годы войны зверствовали так, что даже немцы не выдерживали такого количества увиденного насилия. Наши отношения сейчас с Венгрией очень ранимые. Каждый позитивный шаг дается с колоссальным трудом. 
Хотя Венгрия сегодня смотрит на наши отношения сквозь призму вероятного экономического проекта АЭС Пакш-2 с надеждой на участие русских в этой работе — создание технопарка, реконструкция будапештского метро. 
Со стороны Венгрии, могу вам смело заявить, я работаю с ними не первый год, это совершенно адекватная венгерская реакция, но она не является угрозой, она является призывом цивилизованно остановиться и помалкивать, потому что иначе мы последнего союзника в Европе потеряем. У нас в Европе нет ни одного союзника такого класса, как венгры. 
И последнее, у меня был идеологический спор с довольно высокопоставленными венгерскими чиновниками, близкими к руководству Венгрии, относительно событий 1956 года. Ну, они выложили свой традиционный набор взаимных упреков, рассказов. А я им сказал в ответ, что радуйтесь, что не я там был, я бы вам там перца задал. 
Я пояснил, в чем заключается трагичность событий 1956 года. Она разделяется на две точки зрения. Вы пытались идти на поводу у американцев, которые подпитывали антикоммунистическую ситуацию изнутри. Андропов же, защищал результаты Второй мировой войны, не давая состояться переделу. Уже тогда было понятно, что вся затея с расширением НАТО на Восток будет тяготеть к проблеме передела Европы по отношению к решениям Тегеранской, Ялтинской и Потсдамской конференций. 
Могу сказать, что сегодня Венгрия ограблена, уничтожены такие идеалы экономических образчиков, как ""Икарус"", фирма ""Глобус"", уничтожена авиационная компания Малев (Malév). Фактически ликвидирована фармацевтическая группировка ""Гедеон Рихтер"" (Gedeon Richter Ltd) и многое-многое другое, что строилось на советские деньги. 
- Но, наверное, когда они будут про ""злодеяния Красной армии"" в СМИ вещать, нам ведь тоже молчать не надо? 
— Око за око всегда, в любом случае. Но не жить по принципу — ""сам дурак"". Что значит злодеяния армии? О каких миролюбивых намерениях мы ведем речь, если кадровая армия должна их молотить 24 часа в сутки. Это было и в 1956 году. Вы хотите, чтобы мы там с цветами и с мороженом ездили? Злодеяния придумали. Нужно четко держаться мысли, что Советский Союз на тот момент жестко защищал результаты Второй мировой войны, нашу победу. Нам навязывали другую точку зрения, которая сейчас вылилась просто в банальное расширение НАТО вплоть до нашей государственной границы. Нас обманули. Нас просто кинули благодаря болтунам типа Хрущева, Горбачева, Ельцина. Если венгры будут это продолжать, в чем я тоже глубоко сомневаюсь, то это будут делать люди, отнюдь не представляющие власть и не представляющие из себя ничего. 
Я думаю, что думающие люди на перспективу не допустят разжигание очередной фазы нервотрепки. Тем более, что можно смело утверждать, что в известной степени подобные вещи субсидируются никак не венграми, а тем же конопатым Соросом. Венгры миролюбиво настроены по отношению к России, с точки зрения живой экономики, социально-экономических отношений и усилению долгосрочных связей. Так что Киселев, что называется, не на ту лошадь сел или ставку сделал не на ту тарелку.

[Caroline Biden, 30, took a plea deal at the Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City and pleaded guilty to stealing $110, 810 with a borrowed credit card to go on a shopping spree, the New York Post reported.  In exchange for a guilty plea, a judge sentenced Caroline to two years probation under the condition that she stay out of trouble and pay back the money she stole. Her attorneys declined to comment on the plea. Biden’s niece asked to borrow a credit card from the unnamed victim so she could make a $672 purchase. Instead, Caroline opened an account at Bigelow Pharmacy in New York and spent over $100, 000 on store purchases from April 2015 to June 24, 2016. Police arrested Caroline May 5 and charged her with grand and petit larceny. She pleaded guilty to both charges Friday. Caroline, who has a history of abusing drugs and alcohol, also had a   with the law in 2013 when got into a fight with a roommate over rent and hit a police officer. She was arrested on charges of harassment, resisting arrest, and obstruction of justice.

19019,"Watching Doping Scandal, Fourth-Place Olympian Asks, ‘Am I a Bronze Medalist?’ - The New York Times","Katie Uhlaender was a   United States Olympian when she competed at the Sochi Games in February 2014. She was seeking her first Olympic medal, and after four runs down an icy 1.  skeleton course, she was sure she had succeeded. She had not. She placed fourth, finishing   of a second behind Elena Nikitina of Russia, who took third. Two years later, after replaying the competition in her mind countless times, Ms. Uhlaender learned that Ms. Nikitina was among dozens of Russian athletes at the Sochi Games who were part of a   doping program, according to the longtime director of Russia’s antidoping lab, Grigory Rodchenkov. “My gut just got all wrenchy,” Ms. Uhlaender said recently, tears welling up as she slowed her pedaling on a stationary bike. “It’s opening a wound. ” Dr. Rodchenkov’s account of how doping controls were breached at the 2014 Olympics has tarnished the performance of dozens of Russian athletes and marred the integrity of the Games. His claims also have left many athletes who finished behind Russians feeling cheated. “I’ll never know what it feels like to stand on the podium in Sochi, but I want to put this behind me,” Ms. Uhlaender said. “I want to know: Am I a bronze medalist?” Ms. Nikitina’s name appears on a spreadsheet provided to The New York Times by Dr. Rodchenkov. The document, which he said was sent to him by Russia’s sports ministry two weeks before the Sochi Games, lists key competition dates for each athlete  —   in Ms. Nikitina’s case, Feb. 14, the date of her final two races, in which she had some of the fastest running starts at the Games. That list, Dr. Rodchenkov said, guided him in his nightly ritual in Sochi: surreptitiously swapping out the   urine of Russia’s top athletes, at least 15 of whom won medals. An investigation into Dr. Rodchenkov’s account is expected to conclude within days, three weeks before the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro are set to begin, and the full results of the investigation, due on Monday, could prove explosive. Dr. Rodchenkov has cooperated with the inquiry, which was commissioned in May by the World   Agency and has been conducted by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer who was part of a commission that last fall accused Russia of systematic doping. In a preliminary report last month, Mr. McLaren, who received the Sochi spreadsheet, called Dr. Rodchenkov’s story “both credible and verifiable. ” Last month, global sports officials barred Russian track and field athletes from the Rio Games. WADA has said that if the allegations prove true, it will consider recommending all Russian athletes be barred from competition Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said he would resign if such a ban were imposed. In an interview in Moscow this week, Mr. Mutko denied that the government had been involved in any scheme, but expressed concern that his deputy was accused of giving Dr. Rodchenkov direct orders. Mr. Mutko was alternately confident in Russia’s athletes and contrite about their attitudes toward   drugs. “We have to persuade people you can win without doping,” he said. “It’s the culture. It’s a problem. ” Waiting for the Sochi inquiry to conclude, Ms. Uhlaender, who will turn 32 next week, has fought to keep her focus on the next Winter Olympics, in 2018 in South Korea. Still, she is concerned that sports officials will fail to deliver the rigorous and decisive result she craves. “I’m worried Sochi will be forgotten, and it scares me,” she said. “Rodchenkov said he tampered with the samples, and there are rules against that. I just want to see them follow the rules. ” Ms. Uhlaender is training in the desert, spending her days lifting weights in Arizona with fellow professional athletes at a   gym and sprinting alongside dozens of other Olympians, mostly track and field athletes preparing for Rio. Between workouts, there is conversation of all kinds  —   about   diets, “Game of Thrones,” the price of gas  —   but there is little mention of the allegations of widespread doping by the Russians. Ms. Uhlaender said she had talked about the situation twice with her coach. “What are you going to do about it?” he asked her before moving on. “The worst thing I can do is talk about it,” she said over a chicken lettuce wrap and four shots of espresso. When not training, she meditates works in education for a traumatic brain injury center, having recovered from a concussion herself watches Netflix and exchanges texts with two Navy SEAL friends who have helped keep her tough, she said. “When I come to train, I don’t want drama,” she said, fiddling with a National League championship ring belonging to her father, the former baseball player Ted Uhlaender. The ring, which she tucks into the back of her sports bra as she works out, hangs on a silver chain alongside a tiny baseball charm that holds his ashes. One of the few people Ms. Uhlaender has talked to about the doping scandal in recent months is Ms. Nikitina, her Russian competitor. In May, days after Dr. Rodchenkov’s account became public, Ms. Uhlaender and Ms. Nikitina exchanged more than a dozen messages on Facebook. Ms. Nikitina expressed shock at Dr. Rodchenkov’s statements. “We all think this is politics!” she wrote. “We basically joke about it. ” She added: “Each athlete sure of himself! As we say in Russia, ‘Such complex situations make us stronger. ’” Ms. Nikitina, who did not respond to messages from The Times, told Ms. Uhlaender her name was not on Dr. Rodchenkov’s spreadsheet, and she emphasized the sacrifices she had made to train twice a day to become a better athlete. When Ms. Uhlaender asked if Russian Olympians had doped at Sochi, Ms. Nikitina said that she could speak only for skeleton racers, and that the answer was no. Dr. Rodchenkov’s spreadsheet listed five Russian skeleton athletes, including Alexander Tretyakov, who won gold at the Games. Asked about the allegations this year, the Russian Bobsled and Skeleton Federation wrote in an email that all of its athletes “underwent doping control procedures in accordance to the rules,” adding, “All of them were clean, and not one positive result was found. ” Mr. Mutko said in Moscow this week that Mr. Tretyakov and other accused athletes had long careers with clean histories. “These athletes didn’t appear in sport all of a sudden,” he said. “No whiskey would be enough to stop them,” he said, referring to the mixture of steroids and liquor that Dr. Rodchenkov said he developed and distributed to coaches to help Russian athletes absorb drugs more quickly before traveling to international competitions for testing. Mr. Mutko said, however, that if Mr. McLaren’s inquiry proved Dr. Rodchenkov’s account true, the athletes in question would be disciplined. “I am not on the list!” Ms. Nikitina wrote to Ms. Uhlaender in a recent exchange. “I hope that the truth will prevail! And the perpetrators of this scandal will be punished!” Medalists like Ms. Nikitina received high praise for their performance at Sochi. After the Games, President Vladimir V. Putin presented Ms. Nikitina, a   Olympian, with a state award, the Order for Merit to the Fatherland. “Your amazing debut,” Mr. Putin said in a public statement to Ms. Nikitina at the time, “met the expectations of your fans, coaches and teammates. ” Regardless of what may come of the investigation, Ms. Uhlaender called herself more determined than ever to work toward the only major title she has yet to capture in her   career. “I want to win Korea,” she said. “If I’m first, I’ll know no one ahead of me doped. ” She said she felt sympathy for Ms. Nikitina, whether or not the claims against her were substantiated. “She’s going through something, too,” Ms. Uhlaender said. “The shininess has been dulled for both of us. ”",0

He went after WikiLeaks, where I serve as editor, as a “  hostile intelligence service. ” In Pompeo’s worldview, telling the truth about the administration can be a crime  —   as Attorney General Jeff Sessions quickly underscored when he described my arrest as a “priority. ”News organizations reported that federal prosecutors are weighing whether to bring charges against members of WikiLeaks, possibly including conspiracy, theft of government property and violating the Espionage Act. All this speech to stifle speech comes in reaction to the first publication in the start of WikiLeaks’ “Vault 7” series. Vault 7 has begun publishing evidence of remarkable CIA incompetence and other shortcomings. This includes the agency’s creation, at a cost of billions of taxpayer dollars, of an entire arsenal of cyber viruses and hacking programs  —   over which it promptly lost control and then tried to cover up the loss. These publications also revealed the CIA’s efforts to infect the public’s ubiquitous consumer products and automobiles with computer viruses. When the director of the CIA, an unelected public servant, publicly demonizes a publisher such as WikiLeaks as a “fraud,” “coward” and “enemy,” it puts all journalists on notice, or should. Pompeo’s next talking point, unsupported by fact, that WikiLeaks is a “  hostile intelligence service,” is a dagger aimed at Americans’ constitutional right to receive honest information about their government. This accusation mirrors attempts throughout history by bureaucrats seeking, and failing, to criminalize speech that reveals their own failings. Read the rest of the story at the Washington Post.",0
19023,In only 50 Years Humans Are Close To Killing Off Two-Thirds Of All Wildlife,"We Are Change 
Two-thirds of wild animals will vanish by 2020, largest mass extinction since dinosaurs. 
“At some point the earth is going to say ‘enough.” A damning new report from the World Wildlife Fund has found a precipitous decline in the world’s animal populations as thousands of species scramble to survive against a sole enemy: humans.
The 2016 version of WWF’s biennial Living Planet Report , published Thursday, found a 58 percent overall decline in vertebrate populations from 1970 to 2012, the latest year with available data. The nonprofit warned that if current trends continue, the world could lose more than two-thirds of wildlife by 2020.
“As humanity continues to demand more and more of the earth and puts pressures on our natural capital, what we’re seeing is the fraying of wildlife,” said Colby Loucks , senior director for the WWF’s Wildlife Conservation Program. 
Humans have affected the entire spectrum of vertebrate life ? fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, the report says. The document’s warning of vanishing wildlife refers to total population size, not the number of species that will go extinct. That’s an entirely different problem .

Loucks linked wildlife losses to what he called the “five horseman” of the environmental apocalypse: habitat loss, over exploitation, pollution, invasive species and climate change. Those factors have undercut the 3,706 species documented by the WWF on land and in ocean and freshwater habitats.
Freshwater species have been hit hardest, with populations declining 81 percent, according to the report. The freshwater biome covers less than a 0.01 percent of the planet’s surface, but holds about 1 in 10 known wildlife species.
“There’s less of the cuddly panda phenomenon going on there, because humans need water to survive, to grow crops,” Loucks said, noting that “oftentimes we see freshwater for human use,” and not for conservation. 
Why are there massive die offs of different species of animals around the world ? 
Humanity has expanded so much ? clear-cutting rainforests , poaching big game , overfishing the seas ? that it now requires the equivalent of “1.6 earths to provide the goods and services we use each year,” the report says.
WWF ranks what it calls the “ecological footprint” of this consumption ? basically the amount of resources a human lifestyle requires in a defined region. Rich nations, including the United States, Canada and Australia, have some of the biggest footprints in the world.
“I don’t think people really know the extent of these declines,” Loucks said. “Ultimately, we’re going to need collective action to try and maintain both humans and what we need, as well as the natural world.”

“I don’t think people really know the extent of these declines,” Loucks said. “Ultimately, we’re going to need collective action to try and maintain both humans and what we need, as well as the natural world.” 
Other major endeavors this year documenting animal populations have revealed similarly shocking declines. The first full census of African elephants found a 30 percent drop across the continent in just seven years. Wide swaths of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef have become a coral graveyard . Even the loneliest frog on Earth died , a symbol of “the extinction crisis.” 
The WWF report says there’s still time to stop mass extinction. Major worldwide initiatives to halt climate change and recent shifts toward renewable energy ensure we are not “starting from scratch,” the report says.
“The facts and figures in this report tend to paint a challenging picture, yet there is still considerable room for optimism,” the report reads. “If we manage to carry out critically needed transitions, the rewards will be immense.” 
Changes should include a revamped food system that balances human need with planetary capacity.
“Sustainability and resilience will be achieved much faster if the majority of the Earth’s population understand the value and needs of our increasingly fragile Earth,” the report says. “A shared understanding of the link between humanity and nature could induce a profound change that will allow all life to thrive.” 
Loucks noted that such changes are “really, really hard” and mandate long-term thinking.
“When we’re going to start seeing impacts more locally, your favorite lake dries up or your favorite species is no longer there, maybe at that point you start thinking longer term,” he said. “E ach individual is going to have their threshold when they’re going to start saying, ‘Wow, I care.’

19024,How World War III Could Start,"How World War III Could Start November 3, 2016 
The U.S. acts as if its military has an inalienable right to operate close to the borders of other nations and those nations have no right to see these actions as provocative, writes Jonathan Marshall. 
By Jonathan Marshall 
If humanity ever suffers a Third World War, chances are good it will start in some locale distant from the United States like the Baltic or South China Seas, the Persian Gulf, or Syria, where Washington and its rivals play daily games of “chicken” with lethal air and naval forces. 
Far from enhancing U.S. security, the aggressive deployment of U.S. armed forces in these and other hot spots around the world may be putting our very survival at risk by continuously testing and prodding other military powers. What our military gains from forward deployment, training exercises, and better intelligence may be more than offset by the unnecessary provocation of hostile responses that could escalate into uncontrollable conflicts. Lockheed-Martin’s F-35 war plane. 
The most obvious example is Russia, which top Pentagon officials like to remind us “poses an existential threat to the United States” by virtue of its huge nuclear arsenal. So it was discomforting to learn a few days ago that U.S. and Russian warplanes are experiencing near misses in Syrian airspace “once every 10 days-ish,” in the words of Air Force Lt. Gen. Jeff Harrigian. 
The risk of war with Russia would skyrocket , of course, if the United States were to try to impose a “no-fly-zone.” 
Potentially deadly incidents aren’t confined to Syria. In September , a Russian fighter jet flew within 10 feet of a U.S. Navy spy plane over the Black Sea. Six months ago, reacting to an increase in NATO war games and maneuvers, Russian aircraft buzzed a U.S. Navy destroyer conducting exercises with Poland in the Baltic Sea. 
  declared that the United States would have had every right to shoot down the plane. The Russians, noting that the exercises were taking place near the base of their Baltic Fleet, insisted they were simply exercising their rights to fly. 
A couple of days later, a Russian jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in the same region. A Pentagon spokesman condemned the Russian pilot’s “aggressive” and “unprofessional” maneuvers that could “escalate tensions between countries.” A Russian spokesman said its air defense forces had reacted prudently to “an unidentified target rapidly approaching the Russian border.” 
Indignant over Iran 
In the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy recorded 19 dangerous confrontations with Iranian vessels during the first half of this year, up from 10 in the same period in 2015. Another 11 such confrontations reportedly took place this July and August. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei speaks to a crowd. (Iranian government photo) 
The most notorious incident, of course, occurred this January, when Iranian gunboats detained 10 U.S. Navy sailors for a day after they strayed into Iranian waters. The Obama administration, which had recently negotiated a nuclear accord with Iran, chose not to inflate the incident. In contrast, a trivial engagement between a U.S. Navy vessel and unarmed Iranian patrol boats in January 2008 fired up   and came perilously close to triggering another Tonkin Gulf Incident. 
Although Iran is not a nuclear power, it could be a regional menace if drawn into war, with ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel and Saudi oil fields, and mines that could make the Persian Gulf virtually impassable. 
U.S. air and naval forces also engage in dangerous confrontations every few months with China, a nuclear state and the world’s fastest-rising conventional military power. 
In late October, China’s Defense Ministry protested an allegedly “illegal” and “intentionally provocative” patrol by the guided missile destroyer USS Decatur, which was sailing close to the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea to protest Chinese maritime claims. The Chinese vowed to increase their own air and maritime patrols to “resolutely defend national sovereignty and security.” 
This summer, in the space of less than a month, Chinese fighter jets twice intercepted U.S. Air Force RC-135 spy planes off of China’s coast. The Pentagon decried the Chinese response as dangerously “unsafe,” while the Chinese complained that U.S. insistence on carrying out “close reconnaissance activities against China . . . severely undermines China’s maritime security.” 
Similar confrontations and now commonplace . They offer frightening reminders of the infamous 2001 Hainan Incident, which was triggered when two Chinese fighter jets intercepted a Navy EP-3 spy plane operating near the Paracel Islands and Hainan Island. One Chinese pilot maneuvered too close to the American plane and died when his cockpit was crushed. The damaged EP-3 and its crew managed to make an unauthorized emergency landing on Hainan. The George W. Bush administration brought the crew — but not the spy plane — home only after sending a letter of regret to defuse the international incident. 
As geopolitical analyst Michael Moran observed at the time, “The drama of this aerial collision underscores an important and little-known post-Cold War reality: America’s surveillance network has grown so vast and formidable that in some respects it is feared as much as U.S. weaponry itself.” 
Trouble with Aerial Spying 
Of course, aerial spying first became a cause celèbre during the Cold War when the Soviets shot down Gary Powers and his U-2 spy plane in 1960. The resulting diplomatic crisis derailed a promising international summit on nuclear disarmament. Islands at the center of the territorial dispute between China and Japan. (Image credit: Jackopoid) 
Since then, the tempo of spy flights has dramatically increased , despite the availability of satellites to monitor the world. 
“On any given day, there are more than a dozen ‘strategic’ reconnaissance flights, supplemented by dozens of shorter range missions by tactical listening aircraft and helicopters,” reported William Arkin after the Hainan Incident. 
Unlike satellites, intrusive planes trigger their targets’ radar systems, light up their communications networks, and provoke military command responses. That’s why American military leaders value the tactical intelligence they provide. That’s also why countries like China view them with such hostility. 
The spy flight that triggered the Hainan Incident cost only one life, but history shows the risks can be far greater, especially during times of great political tension. 
For example, U.S. spy flights along the Soviet Union’s eastern border helped provoke the tragic downing of a Korean Air Lines passenger jet in September 1983, when it strayed into sensitive Soviet airspace over military facilities in the Far East. The loss of 269 lives was terrible enough, but the resulting propaganda barrage from the Reagan administration helped arouse fears in the Kremlin into that war with the United States might be imminent. 
The two jittery superpowers came dangerously close to nuclear war later that month when Soviet early warning systems falsely reported the launch of U.S. Minuteman missiles. 
Military professionals in the United States and many of its rivals generally contain these incidents rather than letting them get out of hand. But accidents, miscalculations, and political opportunism pose ever-present risks of escalating small engagements into much larger military confrontations. 
There’s plenty of blame to go around. But at the end of the day, what’s striking is that virtually every one of these dangerous incidents takes place as a result of U.S. military patrols or exercises near the borders of countries with whom we are ostensibly at peace, not while defending our own borders. 
Americans raised on a pervasive ideology of “exceptionalism” all too easily assume that our far-flung military presence is simply the natural order of things, and that any challenge to it must be countered. A little reflection, however, should suggest why countries — like Russia, China and Iran — grow hostile and even paranoid as they are tested almost daily by the air and naval forces of a superpower. Even if we do not appreciate their point of view, we should seriously ask whether our military really serves U.S. security interests by provoking new opportunities for deadly confrontations almost daily.",0

19026,Pentagon halts effort to recover Guard enlistment bonuses,"Reuters 
U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday suspended a Pentagon order that California National Guardsmen repay thousands of dollars in enlistment bonuses and tuition assistance they had received by mistake more than a decade ago. 
“While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,” Carter, who is in Europe meeting with U.S. allies, said in a statement. 
“This process has dragged on too long, for too many service members,” he said. “Too many cases have languished without action. That’s unfair to service members and to taxpayers.” 
Thousands of California National Guard troops had been ordered to repay enlistment bonuses – some of more than $15,000 – that were improperly given to them. The Los Angeles Times, which first reported on the bonuses last week, said audits revealed the California Guard had overpaid troops in order to entice them to join and meet enlistment targets. 
The Obama administration has been criticized by some military families and Republicans – including presidential candidate Donald Trump – for not doing enough for veterans. There also have been bipartisan calls in the U.S. Congress to forgive the overpayments. 
“The president has been pleased to see that in the last 24 hours the Department of Defense make specific commitments to ensuring that our service members are treated fairly,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said during a media briefing in Washington. 
Carter, speaking to reporters in Brussels as he announced the suspension, said the law required the Pentagon keep open the option of someday again seeking repayment. 
“But the point is that … there won’t be any more collections until we put in place a process that can expeditiously and fairly deal with these issues,” he said. 
Senior Defense Department officials have been told to assess the bonus situation and establish a “streamlined, centralized process” by the start of next year, Carter said in the statement. He added that about 2,000 people had been asked to repay erroneous payments. 
“The objective will be to complete the decision-making process on all cases as soon as possible – and no later than July 1,” he said. 
The streamlined process, which will build on existing processes, would evaluate each case individually, Peter Levine, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, told reporters in Washington. 
Levine said the amount of the improperly paid bonuses was unclear but a nationwide audit had found that the issue affected people outside California as well but the “numbers in other states are in the dozens, rather than the hundreds or the thousands.” 
“The process that we have allows us to correct our records and to correct our payment,” he said. “We do not have the authority or the ability to go and change people’s credit records.” 
U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement on Wednesday that Congress would “continue to work on any reforms necessary to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”",0
19027,Samsung to Recall 2.5 Million Galaxy Note 7s Over Battery Fires - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   A ubiquitous source of power in most modern technology,   batteries keep cellphones, laptops, electric cars and airplanes running. They are also the source of many problems, with some overheating, catching fire and even exploding. In a potentially damaging episode, Samsung, the world’s biggest maker of smartphones, announced on Friday that it would recall its Galaxy Note 7 model after discovering a flaw in the battery cell that could result in fires. The company will replace 2. 5 million phones sent to stores and consumers, in one of the industry’s largest recalls. The recall puts Samsung, which has been trying to match the success of the Apple iPhone, in a precarious position. The smartphone industry is grappling with slowing demand and intense competition. Samsung was regaining swagger with its   phone models, like the Note 7, in which the screens appear to spill off the side. But the battery fires threaten to undermine Samsung’s efforts, giving an edge to Apple. The recall comes just days before Apple is expected to unveil the latest version of its iPhone. The ultimate scale of the damage to Samsung’s reputation and finances will depend on how quickly the company deals with the issues and how costly they turn out to be. Along with the expense of fixing the phones, Samsung could face lost sales if consumers grow wary of its products. Samsung said it expected that manufacturing replacement phones would take two weeks. Consumers who have already bought the phones will receive replacements before new phones go on sale, the company said. Samsung did not indicate the cost of the recall. “If you look at previous instances in tech history where there have been recalls, as long as it doesn’t drag on to the point that the company becomes the butt of a joke, then it should be minor,” said Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm. “If it becomes like a Pinto, where you don’t want to buy it because it explodes, that would be a bad situation,” he said, referring to the 1971 Ford car that became famous for erupting in flames after   collisions. “But I think they’ll get past it. ” Samsung said that, so far, 35 battery episodes involving the Note 7 had been registered. Reports of the problem first started to emerge online, as consumers posted photographs and videos of the charred remains of phones they said had burst into flames, usually while being recharged. In one video, a customer shows a   phone, and explains: “Came home after work, put it to charge for a little bit before I had class, went to put it on my waist, and it caught fire. Yep, brand new phone, not even two weeks old. ” Samsung said it thought the problem came from a “minute flaw” in the production of the batteries. Samsung would not name the supplier involved. The recall covers 10 countries where the phones have been sold. Samsung said the recall would not affect China, since the models sold there used a battery from a different supplier. “We acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market, but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the   products to our customers,” the company said in a statement. “We are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible. ” The recall is a major blow to Samsung, which had just started to regain its competitive footing. The company faces pressures across its product line, with Apple on the high end and new Chinese brands on the lower end. Samsung was gaining traction with the latest Galaxy phones. The phones’ smooth, tapered edges, which make them more comfortable to hold, have been a hit with consumers. In the second quarter, Samsung’s global smartphone sales rose 5. 5 percent from a year earlier while Apple’s fell 15 percent, giving Samsung 22. 4 percent of the market compared to Apple’s 11. 8 percent, according to IDC. While some of that growth came from Samsung’s   phones, IDC said that a significant part had also come from new demand for its   phones, which contributed a disproportionate amount of profit. In a year that Samsung originally warned could be tough, the company has performed surprisingly well. In the most recent second quarter, the company said its operating profit rose 15 percent from a year earlier, to about $7 billion. Samsung had high expectations for the latest Galaxy phone, which was released last month, to help continue the momentum. The Note 7 is 5. 7 inches from corner to corner, making it a large phone sometimes referred to as a phablet  —   a combination of phone and tablet. It sells in the United States for about $900 to $1, 000 without subsidies from a wireless carrier. The phones were released just ahead of Apple’s traditional release time in autumn, before the important holiday shopping season. Apple is set to show off its latest iPhone on Sept. 7. With the new iPhone, Apple is expected to make major upgrades to both the hardware and software, as it generally does every two years. “You have to applaud Samsung for moving quickly,” said Ben Wood, mobile analyst at CCS Insight in Berlin. “But they can’t afford to miss the run up to the holiday season, so they have to fix this problem fast. ” Lightweight and powerful,   batteries are the   for technology, since they don’t take up much room and can quickly recharge repeatedly without wearing out. But they are also far from perfect. The batteries, which include volatile and flammable chemical compounds, can become unstable if overheated or punctured. If that happens, the battery can burst into flames or explode. Dell in 2006 recalled more than four million batteries for its notebook computers. American aviation authorities in 2013 reviewed the design of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner after a number of incidents involving   batteries and the plane’s electrical system. Tesla in 2014 had to reinforce the area protecting the batteries in its Model S after it became apparent that road debris striking the bottom of the car could cause a fire. More recently, battery problems have cropped up with increasing frequency among   devices. In America, airline companies began banning hoverboards from flights after it became apparent that some of the products would occasionally burst into flames. There have also been increased reports of   batteries spontaneously detonating. Analysts, in part, attribute the issues to the low standards and few regulations in the global electronics supply chain that sprawls across China. As smaller Chinese companies have jumped at opportunities to make their own devices, some have cut corners, leading to a number of problems, including the occasionally combusting battery. For Samsung, the recall strikes at the heart of what has long been considered its greatest strength: its management of the supply chain. Samsung owns the facilities that produce many of the components in its smartphones  —   including screens, chips and batteries. The system allows it to keep closer tabs on production. Yet much like Apple, Samsung also manages a large network of suppliers. That means it must coordinate the production of a high number of parts that come from factories in disparate places run on tight margins. It must also   the quality of each product, which can be exceptionally challenging given that production processes are complex and factories are sometimes known to sacrifice quality for profit. “What’s surprising is this comes from Samsung, who have such prowess and competence in manufacturing and supply chain,” Mr. Ma of IDC said. “You would think this wouldn’t happen to a company like that, but somehow it slipped through. ”",0
19029,Border Patrol Agent Tells Speaker Ryan the Wall ’Must Get Done’,"Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd, speaking in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council, pushed back against House Speaker Paul Ryan’s contention that funding for the border wall can be delayed. [Judd’s comments came during an interview with Fox Business Channel’s Stuart Varney where he addressed the dramatic impact the Trump Administration has already had on reducing illegal border crossings. “Speaker Paul Ryan is suggesting that Congress delay border wall funding until next year,” Varney stated. “What do you say about that?”  “I disagree,” Judd said flatly. “President Trump promised that he was going to secure the border, and part of securing the border is putting in place, the proper technology and resources that allows us to be successful and a border wall in strategic locations is one of those things that we must get done. ” Ryan’s comments that he may delay funding the border wall came during a March interview with Norah O’Donnell on “CBS This Morning”. “The big chunk of money for the border wall really is next year’s fiscal appropriations,” Ryan said. “Because they literally can’t start construction even this quickly. ” The Trump Administration is moving forward with the bidding process, Breitbart Texas reported. Officials are expected to choose 4 to 10 companies to build a prototype section of wall to demonstrate their bid’s viability and effectiveness. Officials with knowledge of the plan spoke to the Daily Mail on condition of anonymity and said contractors would build the prototypes on a   strip of   land near San Diego. Trump began seeking bids to build prototypes of the wall in February, Breitbart Texas reported.

19030,Presidential elections in Bulgaria and Moldova show a turn toward Moscow*,"November 14, 2016 - Fort Russ News - 

Fabrizio Poggi, in  Contropiano , translated from Italian by Tom Winter 

Igor Dodon, President-elect of Moldova 
Moldova and Bulgaria: Something new in the East 
Rumen Radev, President-elect of Bulgaria 
In the east - not everywhere, sadly - there is a turn towards Moscow. The newly elected presidents of Moldavia and Bulgaria seem to want to go in that direction. 

In Kishinev, where two weeks ago, no candidate had a majority in round one, the Socialist Party leader, Igor Dodon, has 52.6% of the votes (not including expatriate votes from US and Canada, but these can not overturn the result) against the pro-EU Maia Sandu, leader of the Action and Solidarity Party, with 47.3% and who, in Yankee fashion, is now threatening ""mass demonstrations,"" not recognizing the result. 
Maia Sandu  Dodon congratulated Sandu for the ""honorable result"" and invited her to discussions, without destabilizing the country. It seems (though not official at this time of writing) that the turnout was respectable; this was the first direct election of the president of the republic since 1996; since 2000 in fact, the President was elected by Parliament. There was even shortage of ballots, in particular in various stations abroad: Bologna, Parma, Paris, Moscow, Bucharest; Portugal appears to have lost the entire st of ballots. 

On the eve of the vote Dodon, an experienced office-holder, (Deputy Prime Minister in 2008-2009 and Minister of Economy in 2006-2009) said that if he won, his first visit abroad would would be to Moscow, ""to start working out a strategic partnership agreement"" and to renew exports to Russia, which were limited after the signing of the association and free trade agreement with the EU.  

Dodon has always said he was ""confident of victory. People are tired of the seven years of EU coalition, poverty, corruption, lawlessness, and want to live in a state of their own and not in some province of another country.""  

The socialist leader has also called for the Russian peacekeepers to remain in Transnistria, until the complete solution of the political events through the federalization of Moldova, which Sandu opposes. According to Tass, all candidates had based their election campaign primarily on foreign issues: pointing on one side to the ""hand of the Kremlin,"" and, on the other to ""Washington's Regional Committee,""  a side which was still floating a union with Romania. The Socialists pointed to Maia Sandu as ""a puppet of the US"" - where she studied and worked at the World Bank, and tied her to Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk, and Jean-Claude Juncker, apparently even to former Romanian President, Traian Băsescu, who got himself awarded Moldovan citizenship [! -tr] in order to vote for Maia Sandu.  

On the other side Sandu was proposing, along with strategic partnership with Washington, close contacts with Kiev, even a future union with Romania. 

As expected, there are the threats of yet another ""Orange Revolution,"" like the one in 2009 after the Communist Party won the election in Moldova, under the flags of EU and Romania, with rioting which brought broken windows and arson to the Parliament and the presidential residence.  

Obviously, Brussels was on the ""orange"" side: the results of seven years of EU-line coalition are also seen in the demonstrations a year ago against the oligarchy in power, in the rejection of government policy on the part of 80% of the population, and in those favoring integration with Brussels falling from 70% to 37%.  

In addition, the Donald Trump victory seems to have played a role also in Kishinev: ""The geopolitical color of the Moldovan leadership will become less important for the United States,"" Andrei Popov said in a NewsMaker interview. Popov, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Moldova, added that Washington will renounce a whole series of Moldovan projects that were initiated by the Clinton circle. 

Also, in Bulgaria, the coalition headed by the Socialist Party prevailed in the second presidential round of the general election: Air Force General Rumen Radev topped his opponent Tsetska Tsačeva by 4-5% (the result is not final). Tsačeva was the candidate of the pro-government coalition GERB (""Citizens for European development of Bulgaria).""  

In the first round, Sunday, Nov. 6, no candidate reached the 30% necessary for the election: Radev was at 25.4% and Tsačeva at 21.9%.  

The now president-elect said he was opposed to Bulgaria's permanence in NATO (of which the country has been a member since 2004) and in the EU, and has spoken out for closer relations with Russia.  

The Prime Minister, the hawk Boyko Borissov had promised to resign if Radev won, while he was still hoping for a Tsačeva victory, seems to have kept his word, opening a crisis that does not seem easy to solve. 

In opposition to the overtly anti-Russian, phil-atlantic policies of former President Rosen Plevneliev and Boyko Borissov, Radev said that ""deepening the dialogue with Russia will reduce confrontation and tension, and hopefully lead to the normalization of the situation in Syria and Ukraine.""  

With regard to the anti-Russian sanctions, he stressed that this ""is a matter of the government's responsibility. But, as President, I am committed to dialogue, to seek a solution with EU colleagues."" As for internal affairs, he said ""despite threats of the apocalypse,"" the voters ""voted for change and democracy, overcoming apathy and fear."" 

An entity that in contrast does not change policy towards Russia is the European Union.  Federica Mogherini,  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that Brussels does not intend to change its own position on Russia, even if the White House, after the arrival of Donald Trump, pursues a rapprochement with the Kremlin.  

The EU, as Mogherini spelled it out, ""has a principled stand on the issue of the annexation of the Crimea and on the situation in Ukraine, and will not change it, regardless of any changes of position by other countries, including the United States.  

""Ipse dixit et salvavit eos**; of course, the ""Russian aggression!

19031,Comment on BREAKING: Officer Charged for Killing Innocent Unarmed Father With His Hands Up on Video by Luke Yi,"Home / BREAKING NEWS / BREAKING: Officer Charged for Killing Innocent Unarmed Father With His Hands Up on Video BREAKING: Officer Charged for Killing Innocent Unarmed Father With His Hands Up on Video 
UPDATE: On Thursday afternoon, District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler directed his staff to file a first-degree manslaughter charge against Officer Betty Shelby in the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher. According to the Tulsa World report: 
A warrant has been issued for her arrest and arrangements made for her surrender. 
Kunzweiler filed the charge after reviewing dash cam video and helicopter video that captured the shooting. He also reviewed citizen 911 calls, witness interviews and other evidence, according to a news release from the District Attorney’s Office. 
“Officer Shelby, although now charged, is presumed to be innocent under the law until a judge or jury determines otherwise,” the release states. 
Tulsa, OK — Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot 40-year-old Terence Crutcher Friday night when he experienced car trouble after leaving night classes at Tulsa Community College — and now, dash cam video of the shooting shows the man’s arms were in the air when Shelby took his life. 
“His hands were in the air from all views,” pastor Rodney Goss of the Morning Star Baptist Church, who viewed footage from both dash cams and a police helicopter prior to the public release, told the Tulsa World . “It was not apparent from any angle at any point he lunged, came toward, aggressively attacked, or made any sudden movements that would have been considered a threat or life-threatening toward the officer.” 
Police had thus far claimed Crutcher — whose SUV broke down in the middle of the road — approached the officers aggressively while refusing to obey commands to raise his arms, an action the helicopter pilot notes would perhaps be worthy of deploying the Taser. 
“He’s got his hands up for her now,” the pilot says of Crutcher, adding a moment later the man appears uncooperative and may need to be tased. 
Officer Tyler Turnbough then deployed his Taser against Crutcher, but Shelby fired before the electric jolt could even knock him to the ground. Video from one patrol car’s dash can and that as seen from a police helicopter circling above clearly shows Crutcher not acting aggressively as the cops surround and then murder him. 
“It wasn’t a matter of minutes, it was a matter of moments,” Goss noted. “As quick as the officer released the Taser from his hand, Terence was falling to the ground having already been shot.” 
Worse, he explained, the officers seemed not to treat their victim with any concern, and made no moves to provide first aid after the tasing and shooting. 
“After having been shot, a couple minutes it appears, but it seemed like a lifetime, went by before anyone actually checked with him as far as pulse — as far as whatever the case may be,” Goss said. 
Police on scene indeed appear infinitely more concerned with the panicked Shelby than they do with the man they just shot for no apparent reason, and footage bears out Goss’ statement it takes minutes for officers even to approach the dying man. As Crutcher lies mortally wounded on the ground, officers back away like frightened children, supporting Shelby by the arms. As the helicopter circles overhead, audio of the pilot shows he is quite startled by the inexplicable shooting. 
Goss explained to the World that Crutcher moved slowly and deliberately throughout his brief interaction with the police. 
But the cops’ predilection to employ force might have been a forgone conclusion, as he said, one officer is overheard in audio inexplicably describing Crutcher — the father of four, who was taking a night class in music appreciation — as “one bad dude.” 
As Goss plainly summarized , “There was a perception problem before there was ever a shooting.” 
Although authorities had refused to say whether or not a weapon was recovered at the scene, Crutcher’s twin sister, Tiffany insists her brother would not have been armed. 
“One fact I do know is that my brother was unarmed,” she asserted in a news conference Saturday. “I’m just devastated.” 
In a press conference prior to the release of the video he called “very disturbing” and “hard to watch,” Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan finally confirmed, “I’m going to tell you right now, right now, there was no gun on the suspect or in the suspect’s vehicle.” 
Crutcher’s family, their attorneys, local pastors, and several activists were permitted to view the footage before police released it to the public. 
“We wanted them to see it before it was released so they wouldn’t be blindsided by it,” Tulsa Police Sgt. Shane Tuell confirmed, according to ABC News . “We wanted to be able to have that intimate time with them, with their attorney, to see if they had any questions or concerns. 
“With something of this magnitude, we’re trying an approach that we believe is necessary to further that transparency.” 
Shelby, on the force since 2011, and Turnbough, an officer since 2009 — who were named by police on Sunday — encountered Crutcher’s stalled SUV as they were responding to another call. Both have been given the paid vacation, otherwise known as administrative leave, customarily ‘rewarded’ after the use of fatal force. 
“We have to let justice take its course,” Goss said prior to the announcement the Department of Justice would conduct an investigation into the fatal shooting. 
Activists gathered outside the Tulsa County Courthouse to protest the killing of Crutcher and the ballooning epidemic of police violence, while community leaders urged the public to remain calm upon release of footage. 
“Protests are not a problem,” Chief Jordan told the press. “I grew up in the 60s and it’s a very valid way of people to protect their rights.” 
Whether calm and justice will ultimately prevail hinges on whether or not Shelby receives proportionate punishment for taking the life of a wholly and utterly innocent man whose only crime — apparently a capital offense — was having car trouble at an inopportune moment. 
This is what complying with police in America looks like. [ Editor’s note: While it was originally reported by multiple sources Terence Crutcher was a pastor , we have yet to confirm that information and have corrected the article to reflect this.] Share 
i wonder what that cop dropped? Tom Harder 
He didn’t drop anything. That was the suspect hitting the ground. Steve Smith 
funny how you call the victim a suspect and not a PASTOR Antonio Cruz 
pastor or not, it remain a suspect, until the end of the investigation. grapesodabanked 
Suspect of what? He was just a random guy whose car broke down and they ran into him on their way to another call. Antonio Cruz 
i do not know, what he is suspect of, I do know, in legal matters, is just a denomination for anyone, in any circunstance anywhere. Sillywilly 
so if your wife or your child breaks down on the side of the road they’re suspect of something huh? Antonio Cruz 
the answer is; yes anyone anywhere could be a suspect. Sevalo 
So, in your mind, inhaling and exhaling makes one a suspect. Antonio Cruz 
Please, for your own good, find a dictionary search for the word and then, come back, right now I am just wasting my time trying to make you understand, it is about semantics. Sevalo 
From your posts that are filled with bad grammar and spelling errors, I suggest you consult not only your dictionary but also William Strunk’s The Elements of Style. Antonio Cruz 
it might be because, english is not my first language, and my disability includes parcial hand movement and aphasia. in your case is just, the inability to understand your own language. Luke Yi 
If you are not familiar with terminology in English perhaps you ought neither correct others’ English, nor weigh in about the legal validity of certain language. 
Lawyers are experts in a very particular language. Luke Yi 
“person thought to be guilty of a crime or offense” 
Nice try but you ought to learn to use the dictionary yourself Sillywilly 
suspect of what?? Having car trouble? billdeserthills 
You must know cops refer to themselves as Us and they refer to us as Them–they lump anybody else with the criminals just like the bunch of stupid gang members they resemble Sillywilly 
now that I can agree with BigJohnConnor 
The answer is that you are a fucking moron who has no concept of the law or what it means to be a free citizen. Luke Yi 
“Could be” is distinct from “is” Jordan Manicom 
He was only a “suspect” to an assembly of fools. Steve Smith 
His morality when he joined the force. Butch Taylor 
Clearing Shelby and Turnbough of any wrong doing is promising to be the white wash cover up of all time. supersajin 
Looks like paid vacation and a GoFundMe page is in those cops future… TroothFairy 
Death penalty for cops who pull shit like this. Reaves 
We can start by comparing whatever initial statement they gave to the videos we have. If an officer is intentionally deceptive, that should be a felony in its own right. TroothFairy 
Completely agree. Cops need to be held to a much higher standard than ordinary citizens. d marino 
They aren’t being held to ANY damn standard in today’s society. They are literally “getting away with murder”. billdeserthills 
Much like our politicians, they both break their oath of office all the time Jan Miller Saylors 
I think some of the above comments would certainly apply to Hillary Clinton,talk about above the law……There is no excuse to shoot an unarmed person with his hands up in the air,that is cooperating with the officer. Kevin Rogers 
But he wasn’t cooperating with the officer… Officers don’t follow you to your vehicle when they feel threatened, they tell you to get on the ground. Christopher Pacella 
they are they take a oath and there word in a court of law means more then yours d marino 
They lie, a lot, even in court. Just like our high officials lie in court and nothing happens to the criminals of power (the cops, the lawyers, the Congressmen, the Judges, the President, etc.). edslides 
YE and that is NOT discrimination. its called respect. it is expected of citizens, BUT doubly so, righteously so, for a man that swears an oath to uphold the law. accident? accidents have consequences. I kill a guy, i go to jail, period. read a few of your comments lately tooth fairy. you head is bolted on solid. it nauseates me how the cop had more compassion for the stupid fucking cunt that killed an innocent man that he/she/they had for the man they just shot. i AM SO FUCKING PISSED. David Hall 
I am too, it just makes me want to puke. The sight of all the pussies cuddling up to the cunt that just murdered a man is beyond fucking words. All they cared about was her. The man is dying and they don’t give a fuck. And the low life scumbags wobder why America is against them and wants to kill all of them, every day we see why. This one takes it to a new low, even for the POS cowards and bullies. It really just makes me so fucking mad I could kill all of them POS and never lose a nights sleep. I used to wonder why guys would say when a cop was killed, good riddance…now I know why! What the fuck is the matter with the low IQ POS cops in the U.S. Thank God I don’t live in America. They have a real problem. soulshadow55 
David, I totally agree with you. Just out of curiosity, what country do you live in? Lliss 
Spoken by a guy who’s been arrested several times! lol Reinhold Von Kirschmann 
She was charged with murder. Where’s your big mouth now? Point 
Hmm… You sound like someone who would definitely leave a dying person unhelped – possibly even cause a person to die in the first place. Which makes essentially indistinguishable from the subjects your essay. Luke Yi 
That’s not a very careful reading of the text, or the subtext, of david hall’s comment Point 
I’m not certain there is much subtext to read from Mr. Hall’s post; I take his post as his pure and unadulterated feelings. He states the following: 
“It really just makes me so fucking mad I could kill all of them POS and never lose a nights sleep.” 
If I ever deliberately caused harm to a person, I know I’d never have a proper night’s sleep again. The idea that Mr. Hall would feel good about the killings of multiple people – let alone his own proposal to do it himself – seems to me precisely the mindset that supports the continued killing of people. Justsomeguy151 
It’s called justice, that’s why you hate it. Point 
Oh, that’s justice? Please, tell me more about your beliefs or opinions regarding justice. I am eager to hear them. 
It sounds suspiciously though, that if we all agreed to follow your concept of “justice,” that we would end up with one, solitary, very sad person. The last person, and the only one to actually experience this “justice.” And frankly, the only reason he’s left is because there’s no one left to blow his brains out. Luke Yi 
I think that was david halls point by the way–that this cycle of violence, which is being perpetrated in part under the auspices of the law, is leaving families bereaved, helpless, hopeless, sad, and alone. 
I myself feel this disconnection. I would rather it were any other way. 
But people, especially it seems white evangelicals, support “an eye for an eye” rather than the love and forgiveness suggested by the black families of the black victims at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church who were murdered by a white supremacist. Jan Honeycutt 
No one in my church supports that the goes against the Bible. Luke Yi 
I didn’t say anything about your church, Jan. I didn’t say anything about all Christians or all white people or all evangelicals. I said something that is true: some Christians advocate an eye for an eye. billdeserthills 
That ‘eye for an eye’ stuff is from the Torah–You need to figure out which bunch of people you are trying to c rap on sonny boy Luke Yi 
It’s in “Exodus” in the King James Bible. 
No one needs you to reinterpret my words 
But lies, distortions, and ad hominem as are par for the course aren’t you? Justsomeguy151 
Easy, hypocritical POS. You think thee should be zero consequences for pigs murdering civilians for nothing but if pigs got their traitorous heads blown off for murder, THEN its justice. get it, POS? Point 
I see. So to you, justice is blowing peoples’ heads off? 
I guess if either of us want to see justice in action, we’re going to have to go somewhere like China. I hear there is lots of justice there. Luke Yi 
He stated pretty clearly he’s upset by the situation. He employs the subjunctive tense rather than future tense to indicate a hypothetical. 
As I said you’re not reading text or subtext carefully. Subtext requires understanding the background, or where the author is arriving at this point from. 
David never said he was going to kill someone; he said he’s upset. 
Or perhaps you’re the kind of person who, when you say “I could just kill my brother for doing that!” is actually considering killing him. Justsomeguy151 
You must be fucking stupid to think that. Point 
Well then I guess you’re right, and I must be fucking stupid. 
Great chat, though. 
I feel the same way, so glad to hear of your impending departure billdeserthills 
I disagree, you aren’t related to a cop are you? Point 
No, I’m not. Should it make a difference? billdeserthills 
I don’t wanna be calling you a copsucker, if you aren’t one Point 
Well… I’m a scientist, so I guess I’d be a sciencesucker. 
Meanwhile, I’ve made my viewpoints pretty clear in this thread. You’ve reviewed it pretty carefully already, since you’ve replied to several of my comments individually. 
I suggest that we can talk about the ideas I’ve been representing (which are very interesting), or me (which is considerably less interesting) – but the topics are quite separate. Which would you prefer to discuss? billdeserthills 
You just done sucked the fun right outta this thread Point 
A draw, then? 
Who knows, if our viewpoints are so divergent, perhaps we can look forward to another go at it some other time. billdeserthills 
You for or against a man’s right to Demand Satisfaction? Point 
An interesting question: but I don’t know what you mean by “demanding satisfaction.” If it means you get to kill someone’s son because they killed your son, then no. I am against that. If satisfaction means that someone who harms or kills another person must answer for that in a court of law, then I am for it. 
I would also like to know, if it is a right, where that right is documented? The only rights that I am aware that I have come from my U.S. citizenship, and are bestowed by the U.S. Constitution and the tributaries of law that emanate from it. When I travel outside my country, I’m no longer protected by my constitution. 
I also believe strongly in the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Paris, 1948). While it is not a document with legal status, it serves to guide a fragmented and contentious world stage towards recognizing and acknowledging a series of “fundamental rights”– an ideal towards which we can strive. 
One thing I do know: one does not have a “right” to something just because they claim it’s their “right.” I’m betting that people misunderstanding what their rights are – and are not – is a component in many examples of the continuing violence and contention between people now. Luke Yi 
Those rights are actually not considered by the constitution or our founders to originate with the document or their ideas. 
The founders considered these to be natural rights, endowed to us merely by our existence. 
Of course, they thought only wealthy white males were actually human adults, and everyone else was an object for use, including women, children, and other races. billdeserthills 
Lawyers seem to have made off with my right to ‘demand satisfaction’ then Point 
…or, you never had such a right in the first place, and you simply invented it. billdeserthills 
The Right to Demand Satisfaction did exist at one time, it seems to have ended in the late 1800’s or early 1900’s as a so-called scientist I am surprised you never heard of it– I hope you don’t also think dueling pistols are something I made up as well, mr so-called fancypants scientist Point 
Hmm…“The Right to Demand Satisfaction.” Well, I guess we’ll just have to take your word on it. But honestly, it sounds like something you just made up. And “rights” simply don’t work like that. 
In regard to “dueling pistols,” I’m afraid the example is not related to your earlier claim of some sort of “right.” In fact, if I’m not mistaken, duels were a matter of a code of honor, and had very little to do with rights. 
It’s sort of interesting that you say your “Right to Demand Satisfaction” disappeared in “the late 1800’s or early 1900’s,” since it wasn’t long after that the modern concept of “rights” really began to enter our social consciousness. billdeserthills 
Too bad the schools don’t do much of a job educating you kids these days Point 
That’s fine. We’re done with our chat though, correct? billdeserthills 
I suppose, you don’t really seem intelligent enough to discuss much–You can’t even remember simple things others write, even when that writing would be easily referred to, you still get it wrong–Sounds like you are just a modern-made problem waiting to happen to your next employer, sucks to be that guy, I suppose Point 
Cheers. billdeserthills 
I’m thinking you should definitely invest in a helmet, so you don’t fall down and cause yourself some brain damage Sounds like you need to preserve all the brain cells you can get Point 
That’s also fine. I thought we were done with our discussion? 
Since you have had nothing to say regarding our original topic of discussion – despite your several ongoing comments – may I suggest that at this time, we allow others to express themselves, and our discussion can become part of the archive of this article’s comments? 
Cheers. billdeserthills 
This isn’t a piece of paper, there is plenty of room for saying nothing at all here–besides the mods need something to do. Point 
That’s going to be a problem for our friend, Billdeserthills, because he has indicated that a man has “a right to demand satisfaction.” He has also since indicated that “satisfaction” involves blowing someone’s head off. billdeserthills 
Actually I said nothing of the kind. So sad to see modern education at work– Point 
My bad – the person I intended to refer to is “Justsomeguy151.” billdeserthills 
Sounds like you are getting smarter, I hope it isn’t just more BS Point 
Cheers. billdeserthills 
Totally unfounded–Hard to believe that You are actually a ‘scientist’–Real scientist’s use facts, before they shoot off they’re mouths–You should try it sometime–Facts can be your friend Luke Yi 
We intentionally do not hire cops with IQs much above the mean. I understand the reasoning employed in that decision but believe it’s a moral error billdeserthills 
It’s not just a ‘moral’ error–The money these so-called ‘police’ cost taxpayers Every Year could buy us all something real nice–Or even a whole bunch of Real Police Point 
In many jurisdictions, it sort of depends on why you killed the guy. Christopher Pacella 
innocent??? that nigger had his hands up. that means he was high on crack. Annica 
Wow and your hate is the reason why there’s still racial tension. Unarmed, hands up don’t deserve to be shot dead in cold blood. Period. No human deserves that. No matter their race. Bigot. Justsomeguy151 
Bigoted fagot, you’re not funny. In fact, you deserve to be brutally murdered by the very same pig’s you suck off. Point 
Huh… so you do like blacks, but you don’t like gays? 
Do you have a list, or something so that we can know ahead of time who’s ok, and who’s not? 
It’s sort of weird, because usually people will either dislike both gays and blacks, or they won’t have a problem with either. But – eh – there’s no rules about these things. billdeserthills 
Are You taking notes? Point 
A list of the people who you don’t like. We’ve got blacks and gays so far. Anyone else? 
I’m honestly not sure what your argument regarding gays is – I’ve read your comment a couple times, and it’s clear you don’t like them. What’s the point, though? 
You’re welcome to like or to not like anyone you want, in my opinion. I don’t know if it’s a “right,” per se, but I treat it as though it is. But, if you’re going to say things that aren’t in fact true, then – if it’s a topic I am familiar with – I’ll probably say something to you about it. billdeserthills 
I don’t really know any black or gay people, so I can’t say I don’t like them Point 
Fair enough. Maybe I misinterpreted one of your earlier comments. Justsomeguy151 
I don’t dislike gays although I hate what they do and the Gay Agenda. A list for what? Are you an idiot? We are all responsible for own actions and gays always say “I just can’t help it, I was born this way” (even though there are former gays so yes, they can definitely choose), so their perversion should be OK. Well pedophiles say the same thing but not too many people are falling all over themselves to defend them. Luke Yi 
I’m certain you’re wrong about “kill a guy…go to jail”— the law has many different ways of treating killers depending on the particular circumstances. 
That said I agree with the sentiment behind your expression Jan Honeycutt 
If we shoot a criminal on our property we go to jail. Mike List 
Not sure ‘much higher’ is good, but the parameters of police conduct need to be communicated and understood in good faith, by police and their clients. Luke Yi 
Why wouldn’t higher standards be required of someone who in the course of their duties employs deadly force legally? Messier M41 
They aren’t held to any standard, except whatever one they decide they want to be held to that day. If the military is being honored, then the police will say “we are just like them and we should be honored like them.” When they shoot unarmed people, the standard is “I was a scared little bitch and I wanted to make sure I got home to my family! How dare you question me!” freewheelinfranklin543 
It is called Obstruction of Justice and it is a felony. Tmoney 
Obstruction of justice is a felony? The obstruction the officer was talking about was not answering questions which is bullshit because you don’t have to answer questions it’s called the 5th amendment. Even if he was charged and even if it went to court that type of obstruction would be a misdemeanor. Obstruction is a broad term and can be a felony, but things like people filming an encounter and interfering with an arrest is misdemeanor obstruction. James 
I’ve got a better idea. put them in the stocks and subject them to a lifetime of public humiliation and abuse. edslides 
death is too generous. put that useless twat n general population in a state penitentiary, remember how dahmer got justiced? shanked in the terlet. this shit has got to be nipped in the fuckin bud. sooner rather than later. i dont care what color you are, this is just straight up bullshit. looked down the barrel of a cop gun myself twice, once for walking, once for questioning a “cops” authoritah. Jordan Manicom 
I would have killed the pig billdeserthills 
No you wouldn’t, I’ve had many people draw down on me and not all of them cops by a long shot–That ‘keepin it real’ bs isn’t worth a trip to jail–However you might second my desire to bring back Our Right to Demand Satisfaction? There was honor in that, someone gets slapped with a glove and someone gets killed (maybe) for their beliefs–Next time your politician disappoints you voting for the wrong side–Pistols at dawn scumbag! Or of course they could just run away, and look like dishonorable scum… Lliss 
Did all of you guys on his blog get left back in at least one grade? You sound so infantile and dumb! billdeserthills 
Fuck off twat, I wasn’t talking to you Luke Yi 
Of course pistols were quite inaccurate then. Modern pistols would likely make that a death sentence. Also, the best shot gets their way, rather than the best person. billdeserthills 
Dueling pistols are generally smooth bore, without rifling–They look to be intentionally created to be slightly inaccurate — Anyhow if you can’t shoot you could always hire someone to be your champion Luke Yi 
Weapons were never designed to be intentionally inaccurate. Design of weapons has improved dramatically since the 1700s. billdeserthills 
Why weren’t the barrels rifled then? At the time rifle barrels were rifled, so the weapon makers knew about the accuracy potential of rifling a barrel–You are so smart, answer me that smarty pants freewheelinfranklin543 
Dahmer wasn’t shanked. He was beaten(to a bloody pulp) to death with barbells. Lliss 
Again, Spoken by a cop hating guy who’s been arrested several times. Shut up Jerome Taylor 
No you shut up!! Point 
Notice the number of people who so easily and blithely call for the death of other people. They’re sort of in the majority. 
And I walk around with these people on the street, every day, people thinking that there are people who need to be killed. And I’m sure some of them think that I need to be killed. 
When I realize how little respect my fellow Americans have for life, it makes me feel like we should have hyper-aggressive cops. 
If you’re calling for death, then I’m not even sure it matters why it should be so important whose death your calling for. The cops shot this man – he never bothered me, but you know what – there are plenty of people who he would have bothered. For example, America is filled with racists right now. They’ll be pleased. 
Maybe this week, there will be another attack against police officers. Some people will be happy that some of them died. 
I do know that there is almost no example where enough people were killed to solve whatever thing they thought was a problem. I know Hitler tried, but he missed some, and so whatever problem he thought existed because of jews, still exists. You – and a bunch of others – think that cops should be killed. Well, some folks think the same way, and have gone ahead and killed some cops. Turns out that we still have cop problems. 
You know what I don’t like about these cops? That they’re reckless with life. That’s who I don’t trust: people reckless with life. Those who call for violence, who support it, overtly or silently, are the foundation of many complex contemporary social ills. Luke Yi 
I think you lost track of your point when you called for hyper aggressive cops–wouldn’t they kill people? Doesn’t that mean you’re calling for killing people, which is the opposite of what you stayed you were for? 
And yes, killing people literally ended Hitler’s reign of terror, so that particular problem was solved in part by killing people. 
Your message is confused and mixed, you might just want to rewrite that post altogether for posterity. Point 
Quite fair; my prior comment got a little out of hand. 
To speak plainly: I am against all killing and injury of people. Regardless of reason. It’s an ethic I chose, and have developed based on what ultimately has been important to me, and in my honest opinion, to the long-term health of our society. 
My confusing post is in response to those who make the argument – and there are many here – that the cop should be killed. The essential theme I was attempting to communicate is that there is no situation where killing someone has ultimately lead to a better world. billdeserthills 
You are confused, the vast majority of people want to be peaceable and peaceful. Point 
If you need it pointed out to you, I’m glad to: the population I’m referring to in reference to the “number of people” are those who have commented on this story. Not the general population. Sorry you misunderstood. billdeserthills 
That just isn’t true, many people use these forums to blow off steam. I have blocked lots of people and even they had little actual desire to kill anyone. Put a gun in your pocket and you’ll see just how little it likely gets used Point 
I’m quite sure that your view is the more “correct,” or more in-line with the intent of those posters. In fact, I’m sure I’ve “blown off steam” in the past also. 
However: I consider that a very harmful steam. I consider it corrosive to the mind that creates the steam; I consider it poisonous to those who read it; and I feel that it is that very steam that – for a minority of us – eventually gives us the impetuous to harm another person. 
And – frankly – such attitudes tend to be divisive rather than unifying. This really is a problem – the cops killing people (or – depending on what flavor steam percolates through your mind, a problem with black people) – and the solution is even more complex than the problem. Mind you, this site seems to have a bias on the political spectrum. There are other sites where I’m having conversations on this very same topic, only instead of telling people it’s wrong to want to kill – or wish the death – of a cop, I’m trying to get racists to tell me, sanely and rationally, their rationale for disliking black people. 
See how it almost ruined our friendship? And neither of us blew off any steam – you and I had contention because of others’ steam. 
Anyway, I enjoy that we can have this chat. 
PS – you’re right, if I put a gun in my pocket, it wouldn’t get used. The same is true for many of us, even the steamy ones. My concern is the minority of folks who will use their gun. Luke Yi 
Different strokes for different folks, no? Sometimes people must express their anger or (as is common for men of my age) suffer stress related illnesses such as heart attack, stroke, or high blood pressure. Luke Yi 
I’m not convinced they are the majority, by any means. palvadore 
The only reason LEOs behave so egregiously is because they are allowed to get away with smaller crimes. 
Attacking the boot on our collective throat may help a little, but the solution is to look at those enabling the base corruption and immorality. The judges, DAs, Police Chiefs, and lawyers all have blood on their hands. Luke Yi 
It is ironic to me that the same folks who believe in arming up to defend themselves from the federal government, simultaneously seem to believe the local (poorly trained) police can do no wrong. Point 
I’ve always thought that the only people who deserve capital punishment are those who support capital punishment. Aleix 
“I’ve always thought that the only people who deserve capital punishment are those who support capital punishment”“I’ve always thought” 
so you support yourself being given capital punishment. 
Think about that 
Is deadly ain’t it? billdeserthills 
You scientist folks sound backwards and all mixed up Point 
I wouldn’t know. I only see one other person participating in our chat prepared to seriously discuss these issues, and I have no idea what he does for work. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s associated with science. Perhaps anthropology – he’s got a strong, strong insight to the human psyche. billdeserthills 
So how is it that a ‘scientist’ such as yourself never heard of the scientific method? Point 
Your question doesn’t really make any sense, I’m afraid. 
I’m also getting a little bored with you. If you want to talk about me, it’s a very different topic. Start it elsewhere. I’ll remind you that the original topic addresses the desire of a rather sociopathic-sounding individual to see more people die in response to people dying. I think that’s a more interesting topic. billdeserthills 
You can quit talking anytime you like Tmoney 
Can anyone sync up the helicopter video with the ground audio with the shot? Police stated they used a taser and then shot him. Could the taser caused him to drop his hand or was he shot and then dropped his hand as a result of that. Even if he dropped his hand his car broke down on the road. How did it even come to being at gun point surrounded by police and a helicopter. These are the questions people should be asking. Freethinker 
Mark my words. She will walk. They are all above the law. More than 1300 people were killed by cops last year. Out of 18 cases in 2015 in the US where cops were charged with manslaughter and or murder guess how many got convicted?…. [url=( http://thefreethoughtproject.com/record-number-cops-charged-murder-manslaughter-2015-single-officer-convicted )]ZERO[/url]Cops are untouchable and they know it. JW Mack 
A job well done. Xman3 
Why do you need some 5 officers, a helicopter to respond to a broken down vehicle and then kill the driver? And all of the high speed police cars endangering the public, again for a broken down vehicle? Tulsa obviously has too many police with nothing to do. Sillywilly 
remember the old days when hanging was all the rage and everyone from miles around would come for a little excitement on a hot Friday night…kinda the same principle. Luke Yi 
Tulsa was the home of the worst race riot in American history, during which whites destroyed an entire black community, literally the wealthiest black community in America, leaving ten thousand people homeless and killing many. 
No whites were killed or injured in the riots, and no whites faced criminal punishment for their behavior. 
6,000 blacks were arrested for trying to protect their homes and families and scores of blacks were killed 
never came across that story before 
thanks 
You’re welcome. I’m still blown away. 
Here’s a great documentary about the events: billdeserthills 
Cops are bored, they make their own drama–It’s their own version of a snuff film Lliss 
No you’re bored that’s why you are on a blog talking about people with real jobs. You would NEVER comprehend what it means to be a cop so just keep writing about shit you don’t understand billdeserthills 
Just because you are an experienced ‘useful idiot’ doesn’t mean you actually know anything Luke Yi 
https://youtu.be/2EeJ0U5pVi8 Lliss 
Tulsa is extremely busy. This man was on pcp and that amount of officers is necessary to attempt to diffuse a bad situation and cause the person to rethink their actions and comply. Obviously you know nothing about police work besides what you watch on tv Rena Aleman-Walker 
When did they release the results of there findings from the body and blood? Just because thats what she said it must be true….. I don’t think so. I have looked on a few news websites and they say that his her claim but IT DOESN’T SAY IT IS A FACT!!! Again you are looking with your rose colored glasses. pray58 
Lliss stop spreading lies, there has been no results from blood work, so where do you get your information, and you accuse people of excepting false information from the news and then you post hearsay! Luke Yi 
Symptoms of PCP use, for those who make claims without evidence: 
They have dilated pupils. They have developed a temporary speech impediment (This can occur even when they are not on the drug). They do not move from one spot for hours. They are extremely sensitive to sound. They are seeing and hearing things that are not real. Their balance is off and they cannot walk without falling. Their eyes keep rolling back in their head. Their vision is blurry. They continually stare at nothing and are in a stupor state. They are having uncontrollable and irrational behavioral outbursts for no apparent reason KKN4LIFE 
DAMN so Colin Kaepernick is STILL wrong and disrespectful grapesodabanked 
Kaepernick is just a racist who wants to make everything about black people vs white people. Hugh Culliton 
Actually, I think he just wants to see the law applied evenly, and to not see anymore unnecessary killings. I don’t think that meets the definition of “racist”. billdeserthills 
I don’t think what he is doing is any more serious than flying the american flag upside down, or lighting it on fire and far as I can tell those things are still legal. obama refuses to place his hand over his heart when the pledge of america is recited, nor will he salute his men, so who is the real disrespectful person here? edslides 
flying the flag upside down. do you understand why an AMERICAN might do that? billdeserthills 
It signals an emergency, far as I know, I bet google has all kinds of reasons It isn’t ‘sticks & stones’– it doesn’t hurt anyone Sungoddess 
I don’t salute the flag either because liberty and justice for all is bullshit ,second the president does salute his soldiers. I am a veteran and you only salute officers. A flag which is a piece of cloth, a song and a pledge to a nation that has screwed over many races of people does not make you a better person, the way you treat fellow human beings is what matters . Lliss 
What Kind of veteran are you? I think you’re lying billdeserthills 
That is all the bs I’m gonna read from you, twat–Begone palvadore 
I agree with his point and I was enlisted and officer. Sungoddess 
Not that I have to prove anything to you I served in the United States Army. I have no need to lie .what is your point anyway. Luke Yi 
Obama doesn’t refuse to put his hand over his heart during the pledge. In fact, he’s been photographed with hand over heart while reciting the pledge many times. 
Stop reading emails from your crazy great-uncle billdeserthills 
Plenty of other disrespectful things obama does Luke Yi 
Well then present the evidence of that, and I will answer that. 
But you’re wrong about what you said and now you’ve admitted it, though evidently you will continue to hold your unsubstantiated beliefs. billdeserthills 
You don’t find the thousands of lies obama has told to be disrespectful?–I suppose You think obama’s lies are unsubstantiated as well–What a wonderful ‘useful idiot’ you have become BigJohnConnor 
You are a fucking asshole. john 
Just say you don’t like black people and want us to die. Do you think this pastor deserved what he got? Yes or no KKN4LIFE 
White people have a 400 year head start on racism remember they are the one’s who created it DUH!! How is Kaep’s racism making YOU suffer? Luke Yi 
/s Yeah, there’s absolutely no history in America of any race or gender dividing the whole country up by race and gender and making laws preventing some races and genders from being able to equally participate in society. /s 
Honestly, anyone who still feels that way should match the $1,000,000 contribution Kaepernick made edslides 
I have one word for you bill. A-S-S-I-M-I-L-A-T-I-O-N. if i moved to afghanistan, i would feel remiss if i expected them to respect my freedom of choice. they wouldnt. he can protest all he wants. when an American physically calls him out on his bullshit, will you stand by your comment? this aint the middle east. we dont care how you do it over there. pulll that shit here, you WILL be taken to task. come to my country and disrespect my country , we will kill you. thats our policy. billdeserthills 
I don’t expect tolerance to intolerant muslim scum, and I don’t see what colin is physically hurting, by donating $1,000,000 towards people who have suffered. Why not put your money where your mouth is, get contributions from all your kkk and fake nazi friends & see if you can top $1,000,000?(mod please put barfing emoticon here) ThomasJefferson 
I’m still trying to figure out wtf point it was that ed was stressing bill.His analogy, (ASSuming there even IS one) STILL eludes me. But, if indeed you did figure it out, an excellent response I must say. Luke Yi 
I think there is a whole presidential campaign for that billdeserthills 
I think you are confused billdeserthills 
I just keep seeing more and more people the police kill & I’m not seeing anyone Else doing much about it–When You put up a million of your own money to fight this problem I may begin to pay attention. poopiepants 
thanks for your insight ed. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca3f6ec0bcffbe818b2a7f93e1b48f118316ea463ca54175b44ee47199e6de76.jpg john 
Just say you hate black people and we can call it a day. Do you defend this video or not? palvadore 
This has nothing to do with color. It’s just the latest example the media wants you to see. Cops kill more white men every year than blacks. The media just doesn’t want to show those examples. pray58 
Where is you statistics for that statement, show proof! And I mean innocent white men being killed! palvadore 
Can you meet your own demand and proove how many “innocent” Africans were shot by police? And please don’t use FBI statistics or anything that you can JUST fucking GOOGLE! Like the rest of us! 
I protest police misconduct not because I give a care about the poor, poor, little black man that chose to live life with the evil white man. No! I protest for all the other races! Black lives don’t matter to me at all. Luke Yi 
That’s not our policy. Our policy is ensconced in the constitution, and it’s most important amendment, the 1st, which provides freedom of expression FiuToYou 
I hope you’re being a satirist here! I feel you are. Colin is a patriotic hero!!!! KKN4LIFE 
HUH? Colin is a WARRIOR! Jerome Taylor 
My point exactly!!! Stay tuned!! This ish is getting old, you think? Richard Norgard 
“That looks like a bad dude, too. Must be on something’.” 
I guess that makes it ok to kill him. Whatever happened to protect and serve? billdeserthills 
The police protect & serve themselves Lliss 
They definitely serves, keeping that dude outa somebody’s back yard Tricornes 
I’ll take 10 dead idiots who won’t comply with police orders over one decent police officer getting a scratch on his pinkie. Reinhold Von Kirschmann 
Notice how in the helicopter video, the guy says he looks like a bad guy, and me must be on something.. Guilty till proven innocent. Hope this domestic terrorist goes to jail. She is a murderer plain and simple. Good Canadian Kid 
He’s black, so in the eyes of a cop that makes him a bad guy and a drug user. edslides 
not that it matters, but male pattern baldness is kind of a white thing. gonna revisit this point, but it doesnt matter. murder is murder. Lliss 
No he was considered a bad guy because he wasn’t complying and he was considered a drug user because of his erratic behavior and the drugs found at the scene. Please be fair and stop the cop hating bullshit. Yonnie Pietrovito-Moncrief 
Liar, liar, pants on fire. The usual excuses for cop killers. Jerome Taylor 
You noticed that too, huh?! Four cops with weapons drawn, because they felt endangered and their life threatened!! Now I’m convinced, Cops are pussies!! I’m sure their girlfriends are really proud of them!! ScarletPimpernil 
It’s common play – consider family court, for example. There, a girl says “he scares me and I’m afraid for our children. No evidence is provided to support the claim, but the guy is, often, forever ejected from his own children(‘s)(s’) lives. billdeserthills 
What erratic behavior or what drugs found at the scene?!! What video are you watching?!! Luke Yi 
Officers did report finding PCP in the car, and the victim had a history of addiction. 
However, according to this report, the vehicle had already been secured so officers knew there was no gun inside. 
Sad story all around: it seems a man with a medical problem driving home from a college class in music appreciation died for no good reason. 
You surmised all that from what’s not in the video. Good Canadian Kid 
And the helicopter pilot was able to determine this just by looking at him? I’ll stop hating cops when they stop killing people who are having car problems. Sungoddess 
What the hell us your deal are you just somebody who likes to chime in just to insult people with no facts ? Does that make you feel go about yourself you are exactly what I was talking about when I said bitch about not saluting a flag or standing for a song but can’t bother to be a decent human being. bumboclot 
Nobody on the ground would have heard that so it didn’t have anything to do with the shooting. But I did find it an interesting comment. Other than being a big black guy, and ignoring the cop’s commands, what made him a “bad guy” to that helicopter cop? I mean, he wasn’t a robbery suspect, he had a broken down car. I wonder what they were referring to. Lliss 
They were referring to the fact that 4 officers were trying to get him to comply with their orders to stop and instead he chose to keep walking away and reaching into his car for god knows what. That’s what they meant by seems like a bad guy. David Boccabella 
When you get 4 excited officers – all screaming different orders – which one to you follow. Luke Yi 
They could have heard it as all officers have radios on them. Lliss 
Yea, normal people keep walking away from officers and reachin into their cars after being told to stop! He’s a BAD GUY you lame idiot. Keep watching the biased liberal news, increasing their ratings and making them rich off your dumb racist ass when the truth WILL come to light! The news is using all of you to promote their cop hating agenda! Not because they believe it but because it hypes the people and makes them rich!!! Read between the lines. They are biased! using words like “murder” and “gunned down” doesn’t she get her day in court? Isn’t she innocent before proven guilty?” Please you all are so one sided. You don’t want peace! You don’t want justice!! You want to be treated well and to treat others as badly as you feel you’ve been treated. That’s not justice! Keep watching he news. They’ll love you for it. Rena Aleman-Walker 
You say that she deserves her day in court but did he get his? No, why? Because he was killed by another cop who for some reson didnt do there job. That’s not justice to be shot in a street, they developed less abrasive measures to bring a person to there knees. Number two did she see why or understand what was going on? NO, that is WHAT IS INJUSTICE.o you shut up because you are looking at the situation just as biase as the rest . So get off your soap box and shut up like you keep telling everyone else. palvadore 
No matter the criminality or deprecation of the act, police officers will always find an out for other police officers. Rena Aleman-Walker 
You are RIGHT!!! Because they have a alliance, a brotherhood if you will. They are NOT going to break because if one does that one will get SOOO MUCH flack for it. They would make that one LIFE SOO MISERABLE. THEY would NEVER!!!! Rena Aleman-Walker 
It is ALWAYS BEEN HARD TO DO THE RIGHT THING!!!! I know that people say anything worth doing is never EASY but i think doing the RIGHT THING in the amidst of OPPOSITION IS EVEN HARDER. ScarletPimpernil 
Where is the proof they did not tell him to put his hands on his car and he was complying? Reinhold Von Kirschmann 
The window was closed you racist cop appologist. The reaching in the window was a police lie. But you don’t care about that. palvadore 
A cop apologist doesn’t make someone a racist. Police misconduct is epidemic and against all citizens and non citizen alike. pray58 
Lliss did he get his day in court, was he innocent before proven guilty, why does she have more rights then he got. Why is it alway deadly force when it comes to black men! Why were they bothering him any ways his car was broke down why all the harassment! Stop trying to justify this madness. Nicholas Hoey 
WTF! All I am thinking is it shouldnt matter what you do for a living, if you kill anybody you must be judged just like everybody else! Luke Yi 
What do you mean by bad guy? I didn’t hear anyone tell him to stop in any of the video I watched. And the vehicle had already been secured, so officers knew there was no gun. 
Link the video and tell us the time code for when he is told to stop?

So you stupid idiot, what do you have to say now that she’s been charged with murder huh? Loser troll with a big mouth and no brains! Shut up an go hide in your delusional world. Reinhold Von Kirschmann 
She was charged with murder, how come I don’t hear you flapping your ignorant mouth now huh? Loser Reinhold Von Kirschmann 
How come after she was charged with murder, I don’t hear you flapping your ignorant mouth now. Why so quiet? Fool Susan Miele 
and so are all the cops with her and in the air above her; they passed judgement, failed to render aid to him and will now stay silent while the cops cook up their story. Rogue cops cost us money 
For all of their reckless behavior by these trigger happy fuck ups, It is time to start drug testing all cops. Training may be lacking but I will bet 5o percent of cops are on some type of illegal drug. Marc Tremmel 
wouldn’t be surprised …but alcohol is their drug because it is “legal” police have a high rate of alcoholism billdeserthills

Why is the police chief calling him a suspected? if all that happened was his car broke down???…what is he suspected of doing…the police are INSANE…talk about guilty before innocent…and the sentence is death no matter what the “crime” is ….Tulsa, ok are you kidding me!?! lmfao like that is a criminal hot bed for terrorists billdeserthills

>>>Minister Who Sought Peace Dies in a Botched Drug Raid 
BOSTON, March 27— The Rev. Accelynne Williams, who for decades had comforted and counseled people throughout the Caribbean, retired to Boston six years ago to be near his daughter and to study the Scriptures. On Friday a police SWAT team searching for drugs broke down his apartment door without warning and handcuffed him. Minutes later, the 75-year-old minister was dead of heart failure. 
The police, it turned out, had misread a floor plan provided by an informer; they had intended to raid an apartment on the floor above Mr. Williams. sfulmer 
It looks like they form a wall to block the view of the camera after the shooting. Guy 
In other words. Please don’t riot and burn down our town, while we decide what sort of spin we are going to put on it ! 
Broken down car in middle of road, = Death Penalty ! John Henry Gunderson 
I am in no way trying to condone this, but it appeared to me, the man walked to his car, lowered his hands, and attempted to open the door of his vehicle. Good Canadian Kid 
Watch the video again, their is more than ten seconds between the shot and when he falls to the ground. He lowered his hands AFTER he was shot! John Henry Gunderson 
I’ll be the first to admit, the cops had no business pulling their guns on this man in the first place, and because of this, they need to be held responsible for what happened. But your the one who needs to watch the video again (I already did, about five times) The man lowers his hands, grabs the door, and then you hear the shot go off. Good Canadian Kid 
Nope, watch it again and compare it to the video shot from the cop car, it sure looks to me like the killer shoots then steps to her right and Terence drops his arm. This is at the beginning of the 22 second mark of the helicopter video. 
Is there someone out there who can sync up both videos and play them at the same time? John Henry Gunderson 
On the dash cam you see him lowering his hands at the 50 sec. mark, then you here the shot fired and see smoke at the 52 sec. mark. Good Canadian Kid 
Watch this video, it shows both the helicopter and the dashcam side by side, he had his hands up when shot. (at approx. 17 seconds)

Damage Control–Just that thin blue line sticking together anarchyst 
…there WILL be a civil lawsuit…any award should be disbursed from the cops’ pension fund, NOT from the taxpayers. the cop should be charged and convicted just as any other civilian would be…with appropriate sentence carried out…it should be a felony, so he can never work in a police capacity ever again… Kurt Bailey 
You say ‘This is what complying with police in America looks like’??? Are you on drugs? He was not following orders because he was walking to his car and not getting on the ground. The officers had no idea what he had waiting inside that truck (gun, bomb) or if he would use that truck to ram them. This is BS race baiting media. Jordan Manicom 
So when the officers have no idea what is going on, they can shoot first and investigate later? They had no right to draw their weapons in the first place, anyone without their impunity would be charged for brandishing a weapon. DLHE

Looks like one major fucked up accident to me caused by the bullshit training of Officers and Police Protocols. Officer Shelby herself sounds surprised and frightened and I have a hunch she will quit whatsoever facing the reality she just murdered a very nice person and father with no criminal record or anything. And there is no point in demonizing Shelby. Sue the shit out of the City, make the Officials understand that Police Training and Protocols are the cause of innocent people getting murdered by Police. Only then will things change. Only then Officers will become responsible for their actions. Davida Sefireth

What they really want, it looks like to me, is to have everybody raise their arms and say yes boss, whatever you say boss. 
I just watched “Free State of Jones,”– great movie! in it there is this line: “…everybody at some point becomes the rich mans n….”! 
Point is, to the rich we are all slaves! But first, they make some persons more obviously the slave than others, to create the social conditions for breeding the instruments of totalitarianism. 
And, this black men kill more black men argument is just shit for distraction and excuse! – like what? – so maybe it isn’t that “bad” that white men kill some too?! Fuck that! These type of arguments use the fallout of systemic racism and poverty, to diffuse responsibility and confuse understanding about what systematic racism really is and how it metastasizes in a society. 
Racism is a fundamental tool of tyranny – it excuses and normalizes the unlawful control of portions of a population. It fractures a population and authorizes terror. The purpose is always to maintain the power of the few over the many. The rich establish the roots of tyranny within a society through racism – it manifests a form of class ownership, ultimately providing the rich with the power and means to control large segments of society, effectively giving them ownership over the many and maintaining their position at the top. 
The rich in their endless greed for more – wendigo spirits ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo ) – will eventually utilize the mechanisms of control established through the apartheid state to bring all of humanity under their yoke of ownership. 
This is called totalitarianism! 
Fighting racism is fighting the systemic roots of tyranny. 
In circumstances like we see world wide today, when liberal democracies begin their decent into totalitarianism, by design, through the rise of fanatical nationalist fervour personified through the cult of the populous leader – classical totalitarianism, or fascism – or through the inversion of a democratic state into rule by corporate oligarchy – inverted totalitarianism, you always see the institutions of law and law enforcement radicalized beyond the scope of constitutional law – they become rogue entities serving the powers of gross ownership, that is the elite. 
Therefore, I believe in what we see in the growing numbers of flagrant murders by police, is the transmutation of the police forces into the contemporary Gestapo. 
There are many subroutines effectively promoting this … like their training which proposes that police first must establish “compliance” and that any resistance or suggestion there-off is “disobedience” of authority legitimizing the use of lethal force. 
Cops are jacked up on the need to establish power and authority which subsequently turns citizens into victims!

You have just seen that your city is like every other city regarding above the law policing and killing of innocent citizen, the very citizens that pay their salaries.

Americans have no protection from a police officer no matter what crimes the police commit against you!

How does this even happen? “Hi, officer, my SUV broke down..what’s that? No, no, I don’t have any weapons or drugs on me. As I was saying, my SUV broke down just over there…sure, I can put my hands up, is there something wrong? No, I don’t have a dead body in the back of my car, what makes you think that I…okay, I will walk calmly to the side of my vehicle. Officer, I really just need a tow…no, tow isn’t a ‘street word’ for I’m going to kill you.” Then the officer, goes, well, he sure looks dangerous, let’s go ahead and shoot him and make sure he isn’t a zombie or something.

Hey, hands up or not, don’t walk away from the police and then reach into your car window. Nothin to see here. Move along. Point 
Interesting article. However, by injecting emotionally-charged language and patronizing metaphors, you have ostracized those who support a reduction in police powers and authority, and those who demand an increase for it, or otherwise feel that the current operations of police are acceptable. 
Examples include:“Police on scene indeed appear infinitely more concerned with the panicked Shelby than they do with the man they just shot for no apparent reason.” 
“As Crutcher lies mortally wounded on the ground, officers back away like frightened children…” 
“Both have been given the paid vacation, otherwise known as administrative leave, customarily ‘rewarded’ after the use of fatal force.” 
Usually, an argument featuring such a degree of bias and hyperbole is something I would ignore. Except I’m also accustomed to it from those whose primary arguments are in support of some form of racism, nationalism, or other form of bigotry. 
Unfortunately, though I agree with the theme of your article, the arguments presented serve to diminish its utility. Cheri 
I have so much respect for most police, they lay their lives on the line every day to keep us safe, but this video sure looks like murder, I saw his hands in the air, this must be treated as a murder. John Cokos 
I’m trying to sift thru the official bullshit scenario that gets presented at every cop related murder. Folks what you saw in that video was a Ritualistic Snuff Movie carried out In Cold Blood by uniformed Sociopaths. The level of cold blooded disregard at someone who’s life was pouring out of him is just about impossible to rationalize. This story has only three outcomes after all the usual spin down and parallel reconstruction of the event’s that took place: They circle the wagon and that bitch goes on getting a paycheck.Tulsa goes the way of Ferguson and all hell beaks loose. They throw her under the bus regardless because she is now a toxic asset. She is found guilty of reckless homicide, gets fired, goes to jail. STOP FUNDING PAID VACATIONS FOR COPS THAT MURDER PEOPLE IN COLD BLOOD. DAN BAILEY19 
THIS FOR THOSE OF YOU ALL WHO IS SEEM TO THINK SOMEHOW THESE OFFICER WAS IN THE RIGHT I WENT BACK AND FOUTH VIEWING THIS I WANTED TO BE SURE OF WHAT THE ONES IN THE AIR WAS SAYING AND I NOTICE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WILL HAVE TO RECORD THIS AND THEN HE SAID HE IS WALKING AND RIGHT AFTER THAT HE SAID HE ‘S FOLLOWING ORDERS BUT ONCE HE GETS CLOSE TO HIS VEHCILE THEN HE WANT TO SAY HE IS A BAD DUDE BUT ALL THE WHILE THEY LET HIM WALK WITH HIS HANDS UP UNTIL HE GETS TO HIS VEHCILE THAN ALL AT ONCE NOW HE IS A THREAT SO THEY TASE AND SHOOT HIM IF SHE FELT THEARTENED WHY THEN YOU WAIT UNTIL HE GETS TO THE VEHICLE TO EMPLOY THE TASE AND THEN SHOOT HIM.YELL AGAIN YOU WANT TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT YOU WAS WRONG IN WHAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE BE BLESS AnonGirl 
Nothing will happen to the cop. She’s get desk duty after coming back from PAID leave and then go back out onto the field. The murderess will continue to patrol and may one day kill again if it happens. 
The video shows the officer LIED about how things went down. LIED again when she claimed he was reaching into his vehicle because the video shows the window was CLOSED. Tim G Tim 
I’ve got to say, I love what the FTP does overall. But seriously, you are really stretching with this one and a few others in recent past. The police have an insanely difficult job (no dispute) and just to keep this simple…. the word “pastor” in the title of your article is strictly for shock value, hands down! It doesn’t matter if this man was a pastor, cartel hit man, or a saint. Do the police on scene know he’s a pastor?? And why in the fucks sake is he walking TO HIS OPEN VEHICLE WINDOW with guns pointed at him???? Just scratch your head with that one for bit. Plain and simple that is NOT an innocent behavior. I carry a concealed pistol and probably would have done the same thing. How could anyone justify walking to their open car window in that circumstance? This is insane. Those officers were justified. You are inciting hate and division and need to check yourself. Guy 
You’re wrong there dude ! The drivers side door window was up, proven because of the blood from the lung shot is both on the window and door ! 
So is you assumption of “Walking Away From A Cop, With Your Hands Up” Is justification for police murder. Unless, you are okay with the old adage, “I was in fear for my life” is ? 
Just as the new and improved bandage of words like “Transparency, Building Bridges and Community Trust, are the new spin words of justifiable homicide ! 
All that proves one thing. Cops can kill with out remorse, for things as simple as perception of fear, all the while relying on Legal Immunity, Blue Union Membership, DA’s, The Court Legal System Setup and D.O.J.’s backing them up, in killing us ! How is that a good enough reason ? Considering, in the country of England with a population of over 35 million people, there has not been the amount of police shootings in the last 20 years, that has yet to equaled one year here ! Or the 53.000 people put in hospitals and seriously injured as the results of contact with our police, this year alone and the year isn’t over yet ! 
No, you are dead wrong about justification of the War that cops are waging against the American People. Why do you carry a concealed weapon ? If you felt safe, you won’t need too, all you would ever need to do is call a cop ! steve_2 
You guys really should watch the video. When he was tazed and shot, his hands were not up, he was not complying with police commands to stop and raise his hands, and he reached inside the vehicle. As usual, obeying police commands is the way to not get shot. Good Canadian Kid 
You should really watch this video that syncs the dash-cam with the chopper-cam. His hands were clearly up when he was shot. BTW: his window was closed so I don’t even begin to understand where you come to the conclusion that he was reaching inside his vehicle… Donna Bohdanyk 
I want to puke. Joseph Mentor Nichols 
Well he’s obviously trying to open his car door for some reason. I don’t even know why he’s walking to his car unless they told him to lean against it. Still, why back to his driver seat? I’m so confused. 
I would hate to think that this dudes lack of common sense got him killed. It would be much more comforting to find out that the police shot him for no reason. Tmoney 
Can anyone sync up the helicopter video with the shot on the ground video. I believe he drops his hand only after being shot, but if the ground audio was in the helicopter video it would be a better view and catch the timing of the shot. SSJRomance 
Crutcher was not following officers commands and started walking back to his vehicle. That was his first mistake and made officers nervous. The second mistake was he reached into his vehicle. Do the officers have to wait until he pulls out a gun? 
That’s what happened with the NY terrorist. The cop was yelling “show me your hands” and gave the perp too much time that allowed him to grab his gun and shot the officer 2 times. That is what officers are up against. Damed if you do damed if you don’t. Good Canadian Kid 
How do you know he wasn’t following commands, the cop that shot him never bothered to turn on her recorder(s). He was just as likely returning to his vehicle as ordered to get his drivers license / registration / insurance. 
When she shot him, his hands were up, look at this video that syncs the dash-cam with the chopper-cam.",0
19032,"Brooks: Trump ’Lashing Out’ in ’Extremely Disturbing’ Ways, Not ’Projecting Mental Stability’ - Breitbart","On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that there is no “serious” evidence of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia, but the president is reacting in a disturbing manner.  Brooks stated, “[I]t may be a witchhunt, but he’s acting like a witch. You know, to me, we’ve had this  —   the idea that there’s been collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign has been investigated for a long time. And so far, we’ve had no really serious evidence that they did collude, and everything else seems to be leaking out. So, I begin to be a little suspicious —  and maybe I’m wrong —  we’ll see over the long term whether there was any actual act of collusion. There were certainly conversations maybe about some building and some investment, but so far, no evidence of an underlying crime. ” He continued, “But this, to me, is not a criminal story. It’s a psychological story. And it’s a story about a president who seems to feel under more pressure, under more threat, lashing out in ways that are painfully   but also extremely disturbing to anybody around him. And so, whether it’s the North Korean Cabinet hearing that he held recently, where they all had to praise him, or the tweets as late as this morning, this is not a president who’s projecting mental stability. And the idea that he’ll fire somebody, whether it’s Mueller or anybody else, seems very plausible. And so, to me, if there’s something really damaging here, it’s something that has not yet happened caused by the psychological pressure that he apparently feels. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
19033,Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline: ‘The Last Gasp Will Come In 2018’,"Home » Headlines » Finance News » Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline: ‘The Last Gasp Will Come In 2018’ 
You have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse… 

From Mac Slavo, SHTFPlan : 
It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the U.S. economy will collapse. That, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given. 
The only question now is “when” that moment will come. 
According to Christine Hughes, chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital, it will be very soon. Basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, Hughes says in her latest update to clients that we’re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 – 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 . 
First, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months: 
Hughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning: 
As the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. So let’s assume we’re like every other time in history and that happens. Then it moves forward to 2018… 
So, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. We’re closing in on 2016 now… we basically have a year… maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. 
So if you are levered personally or corporately… if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuff… the Canadian housing market comes to mind… You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself. 
Watch the video report: 
Wolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important: 
Since early July, the 30-year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 8.3%. It’s now called “the rout” in longer-dated government bonds. One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields. 
What has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? The US Treasury yield curve. It drives bank lending – which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. 
We know it is only a matter of time at this point. 
Greg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: 
So, when the debt bubble bursts we’re going to get a correction in population. It’s a mathematical certainty. 
Millions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. And I’m saying when not if… 
… 
When resources become more and more scarce we’re going to see countries at war with each other. People will be scrambling… in a worst case scenario… doing everything that they can to survive… to provide for their family and for themselves. 
There’s no way out of it. 
Source: Analyst: “Millions Upon Millions of People Are Going to Die on a World-Wide Scale When the Debt Bubble Bursts” 
If Mannarino and Hughes are right, you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse .

19034,False Flag? US Intelligence Warns Of Likely Al Qaeda Terror Attack Day Before Election,"By Whitney Webb 
Over the course of this year’s US presidential election, which has been nothing if not bizarre, some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment, leading to a suspension of the November election. Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. 
US authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News ’ sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an “abundance of caution.” 
Earlier this week, there were also warnings that “polling places” could be seen as “attractive targets” for “lone wolf” attackers by individuals motivated by “violent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity.” This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : 
The counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. 
However, what’s interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian “civil” war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch – the al Nusra Front – in with the “moderate rebels” they support. Therefore, al Qaeda’s ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. 
It’s also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. 
It is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist “bogeyman” of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. 
It is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks’ near constant releases of her campaign chair’s emails, but also due to the FBI’s “mutiny” which led them to re-open a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. 
However, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime.

19035,Twin Strands of Music and Compassion Run Through a Life - The New York Times,"The power of song has run through Benita Rudolph’s life. At 8, she joined the choir at the church in Malvern, Ark. where her father was a pastor. By 11, she was composing her own music on a small keyboard her father had given her. “There’s a joy that you feel when you see people’s faces,” Ms. Rudolph said. “It was kind of amazing to me, really, to see them thinking, ‘No, that cannot be you.’ They didn’t connect my voice to the little girl. ” Ms. Rudolph, 44, enjoyed a mostly happy childhood, but a sadness seeped into her life after her parents separated when she was a teenager. She felt a disconnection from her mother, which became more pronounced after the separation. “The teenage years, a daughter needs her mother there are things they want to ask about, they are curious about,” she said. She said she struggled without her mother’s guidance, sought out love where she should not have. She became pregnant at 18 with her daughter Deandra. Ms. Rudolph’s father absorbed the news with his signature grace he was always a source of unconditional support. In her early 20s, Ms. Rudolph joined a production of the gospel musical “My Grandmother Prayed for Me,” as an understudy in two roles. The job took her to New York City in the 1990s. Deandra was left in the care of her paternal grandparents. Ms. Rudolph’s excitement was as fleeting as her success. After a few months, Ms. Rudolph returned to Arkansas. She married and had a second daughter, Dominique. Music remained her passion, but she embarked on a different career, a decision made after her father died in 2004 of congestive heart failure related to his diabetes. He had encouraged her to share her compassionate nature with others. For years Ms. Rudolph worked as a nurse’s assistant, with hopes of eventually pursuing a nursing degree. One of her patients was an elderly man with skin cancer. She soothed his pain with song he taught her about the stock market. In early 2014, after years apart, she returned to his side when his cancer returned. His family asked Ms. Rudolph to sing at his funeral in Atlanta. She not only honored the request, but Ms. Rudolph also decided to remain in Georgia with Dominque to see what opportunities they might find. She and her husband had separated in 2010, and money became so scarce that the family was on the brink of homelessness. She did not want Dominique to experience that despair, so she sent her to live with her father in Arkansas. “That was the hardest decision I ever made, to see her go,” Ms. Rudolph said. “But all I could think about was her opportunities to come. I wanted her to have the best in life. ” A short time later, a former producer called her to say that “My Grandmother Prayed for Me” was restarting a national tour in January 2015. Ms. Rudolph returned to the roles she played as an understudy years ago and added a third, on a tour that ended in New York. After the show ended, Ms. Rudolph faced a choice: Return to the South or stay in New York. “I’m not going back,” Ms. Rudolph said. “There’s something here for me to do. I don’t know what it is I’m going to figure this thing out. ” Without a place to stay, she wound up in a shelter in the summer of 2015. The decision to remain in New York came with consequences, especially missing holidays with her family, but she does not regret it. Through a caseworker, Ms. Rudolph learned about ACE Programs for the Homeless, a partner organization of Community Service Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With the help of an employment training program, she got a job as a street cleaner and spent that summer picking up trash on sweltering, smelly streets. “It kept me humble, what I was doing,” she said. In August 2015, Ms. Rudolph landed a   job as a customer service agent for an airline at La Guardia Airport. Ms. Rudolph also completed a   certified nursing assistant program. Community Service Society used $394 in Neediest Cases funds to pay for the nursing classes at the Manhattan Institute. It also gave her $62 for MetroCards to commute to school. In the spring, she will begin a yearlong licensed practical nurse program at AMG School of Licensed Practical Nursing in Brooklyn. But before that, her focus is on the next big career step. Ms. Rudolph recently accepted an acting role in an independent film, “A Way With Anger,” which is set to begin shooting in Charlotte, N. C. later this month. “Looking back on my life, it’s amazing that I kept the faith and kept the courage and just kept moving forward despite different things that might set you back,” she said.",0
19036,Are Microwave Transmission Weapons Of Mass Destruction Being Used To Trigger Catastrophic Earthquakes?,"geoengineeringwatch.org 
Are unimaginably powerful microwave transmissions actively and aggressively being used as weapons of mass destruction? If all available evidence is examined, the logical conclusions are chilling. Understanding the full potential of the power that can be projected from the ionosphere heater installations (like HAARP) is difficult and complex. We all know and understand that microwave transmissions produced in our countertop ovens can heat a cup of water (or frozen TV dinners) at blinding speed. Unfortunately, most don't know and thus have never even considered (let alone investigated) what massively powerful and interlinked microwave transmissions can do to the planet . When immensely powerful microwave transmissions are bounced off the atmosphere (facilitated by the atmospheric aerosol saturation) and directed back into the Earth's strata (in a seismically sensitive location), the triggering of seismic activity becomes scientifically possible. The constant jet aircraft spraying of reflective and electrically conductive particles into the atmosphere (as part of the ongoing climate engineering/geoengineering assault) is a verifiable fact. Is New Zealand, yet again, the victim of microwave transmission super-weapons? There is a long list of shocking facts surrounding a number of recent catastrophic earthquakes. It is imperative to examine these facts without preconceptions or programmed denial. Let's start with the month leading up to the extremely destructive 2010 earthquake in Haiti, MIT satellite monitoring detected a radical increase in ULF (ultra low frequency/microwave) radio transmissions over the quake epicenter . 
Spacecraft Saw ULF Radio Emissions over Haiti before January Quake 
A French satellite observed a dramatic increase in ultra low frequency radio waves over Haiti in the month before the M7.0 earthquake earlier this year. 
DEMETER’s is an unusual mission. Its job is to monitor low frequency radio waves generated by earthquakes. 
Today, a group of geoscientists release the data associated with the M 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti in January. They say that DEMETER saw a clear increase in ultralow frequency radio waves being emitted from the Earth’s the crust in that region in the build up to the quake. 
The anecdotal evidence of electromagnetic effects associated with earthquakes is legion. Various accounts link earthquakes with mysterious light and heating effects. 
After the Haiti quake, the US military moved in and occupied the country. In addition, the long drawn-out Clinton Foundation reconstruction debacle began. The following year a deadly earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand. Many circumstances surrounding this disaster were also troubling. Did US officials know the earthquake was coming? Some excerpts from a report on the disaster are below. 
Was the Christchurch earthquake a terrible natural disaster, or was it a terrible MAN MADE disaster? 
9 members of US Congress were in Christchurch for a summit meeting on Feb 21 & 22 but left Christchurch 2.5 hours before the earthquake hit and relocated to Wellington even though the meeting was not due to finish until the evening of Feb 22nd. 
The US Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, was supposed to be visiting Christchurch and speaking at the summit meeting on Feb 22, but on Feb 18 announced she was cancelling her visit 3. The Deputy Administrator of FEMA (US Federal Emergency Management Agency), Timothy Manning, just happened to be in Christchurch at the time with a US delegation. 
All of the rest of the delegation left Christchurch shortly before the quake hit except for Mr Manning who stayed behind, and then after the quake hit he assisted with directing the emergency response. Exactly the same thing happened with FEMA delegates with the Haiti earthquake. In Haiti , the FEMA delegates just happened to be there at the time conducting training exercises for responding to major earthquakes. 
Recent releases from Wikileaks resulted in the headline below: 
Hillary Clinton Emails Show Advanced Warning of Christchurch Earthquake . 
In the days before the catastrophic Japanese Earthquake (that occurred on March 11, 2016), world renowned research institution, MIT, yet again, noted extremely profound and anomalous atmospheric heating directly over the quake epicenter . MIT published the following report: 
Atmosphere Above Japan Heated Rapidly Before M9 Earthquake 
Infrared emissions above the epicenter increased dramatically in the days before the devastating earthquake in Japan, say scientists. 
They say that before the M9 earthquake, the total electron content of the ionosphere increased dramatically over the epicentre, reaching a maximum three days before the quake struck. 
At the same time, satellite observations showed a big increase in infrared emissions from above the epicentre, which peaked in the hours before the quake. In other words, the atmosphere was heating up. 
Though the science community is desperately trying to link pre-quake atmospheric heating to some unknown phenomenon of an atmospheric coupling with the pressure buildup in the strata, is this a rational conclusion? The much more logical and straightforward conclusion is this, the atmospheric heating is being intentionally created by the global network of ionosphere heaters as immense microwave signals are bounced off of the atmosphere and back down into the planet. Unfortunately, the science community is not allowed to even consider this possibility, let alone talk about it. In the period preceding the decimating Japanese earthquake, US Japanese relations were very strained . The post-quake scenario of US/Japanese relations seemed to suddenly be unquestionable, was there a connection? Was the catastrophic quake just a natural event? Or an engineered warning to Japan? 
On the 13th of November, 2016, another catastrophic earthquake struck near Christchurch, New Zealand . The list of troubling questions surrounding this earthquake is long and growing. Below are some quotes from seismologist Anna Kaiser (who is investigating the latest New Zealand earthquake activity): 
We don't know what we are dealing with right now but it may be … it involves potentially more than one fault … we need to figure out what was going on before and after the 7.5 magnitude quake… 
Kaiser went on to say this: 
We're working very hard … this is looking quite complex. The epicenter was possibly just south of the Hope fault, but it did look like ""something else was going on. 
The seismologist statements are only the beginning, there are many more concerning factors surrounding the latest New Zealand Earthquake that should be considered. 
In spite of the unfolding US election circumstances, in the days before the latest New Zealand quake John Kerry first went to Christchurch, and then on to McMurdo Station, Antarctica . The stated purpose of Kerry's visit was to examine the effects of global warming and the record low sea ice, but this trip at this time was criticized by some. 
US Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to head back to New Zealand after checking out summer in Antarctica. 
He's been criticized for heading to such a remote place while the US election riveted the world 
He tweeted a photograph of himself boarding C-17 cargo plane in Christchurch saying ""headed to Antarctica to see firsthand some of the drastic effects of climate change"". 
In Antarctica he was scheduled to meet with scientists and researchers at McMurdo Station, the largest research station of the US Antarctic programme, as well as visit surrounding areas on Ross Island, and the US Government's Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. 
He is the first secretary of state and the most senior US government official to ever travel to Antarctica. 
He is hosted by the US National Science Foundation, which manages the US Antarctic program me. 
In fact Antarctica has just broken a new climate record, with record low winter sea ice . After a peak of 18.5 million square kilometers in late August , sea ice began retreating about a month ahead of schedule and has been setting daily low records through most of September. Though Antarctic sea ice (and global sea ice) are at record shattering low levels, why else might John Kerry go to McMurdo Station at this exact window of time? Could the ionosphere heater (microwave transmission) facility that is constructed at McMurdo be a factor? Noctilucent clouds in the skies above Antarctica are an ominous harbinger of the atmospheric damage that is occurring there. 
Many are under the belief that HAARP, now labeled IRI, no longer exists Operationally due to the Gakona, AK spin. One must understand that these Frequency Generators are Globally Ubiquitous. There are so many that are of dissimilar designs, and go by different acronyms, it is not seen as functionally one and the same. In the case of McMurdo’s Radome and all of the Radar equipment there ; Raytheon has had the contracts beginning to end. The National Science Foundation and Raytheon Polar Services Company are housed in the same building. For years the station has grown. It can house 1258 personnel and an average of 200 winter over. 
Raytheon is one of the largest private ""defense contractors"" on the planet, this corporation is also the holder of numerous climate engineering patents including some that relate directly to ionosphere heaters. The power structure is likely microwaving the skies for a multitude of reasons , none of those reasons are in the interest of the common good. 
Shocking atmospheric flashing lights were filmed in the skies above New Zealand as the massive Earthquake was occurring. 
Kerry returned to Christchurch from Antarctica, and then promptly (and conveniently) departed only hours before the catastrophic earthquake struck . 
The statement below is from CBS news. 
Sec. John Kerry had left the country before it struck, and just landed in Singapore on his way to Oman when news of the quake was reported. 
Is it just a coincidence that US officials always seem to safely depart quake impact zones just prior to the event? 
Then there is this headline to consider: 
World’s Biggest Seismic Testing “Blast” Ship – Amazon Warrior – Parked on top of New Zealand Fault Line 
Is this just a coincidence? 
The New Zealand Prime Minister's apparent apprehension about the US election results just days prior to the quake are also of interest. 
Microwave transmission signals/rings near Antarctica are clearly visible in the satellite composite image shown below. 
The regions of New Zealand near the epicenter have been constantly assaulted with aerosols spraying and microwave transmissions. 
The uniform ribbing of aerosolized cloud cover is a clear indication of microwave transmission exposure. Though some ""official"" sources try to explain this type of cloud pattern as being a result of the underlying land topography, this explanation is patently false. The same patterns are now regularly seen over oceans as well as land as is shown in the satellite photo below that was taken of New Zealand directly over the quake region. 
The image below bears testimony to what the global power structure does to those that try to get in the way of their agendas and operations. This photo is of the bridge of the Greenpeace ship ""The Rainbow Warrior"". It was bombed and sunk by the French Secret Service in order to prevent the ship and its crew from witnessing ongoing illegal and unimaginably destructive nuclear detonations. 
Over 2 decades ago I dove alone on the wreck of the Rainbow Warrior, as it laid on the seafloor off the coast of New Zealand. I swam through the area shown above, around the ship, and examined the gapping bomb blast hole in the hull of the once noble vessel. I hovered over the wreck and contemplated the tyranny of those who rule the world. We are all at a crossroads, and the horizon is darkening rapidly. The power structure wields weapons of unimaginable destruction, they can only do so because of the order-followers that carry out their insanity. As the saying goes, ""we have seen the enemy, and they are us"". It is up to us, the people, all of us, to refuse any further participation in the insanity. It is up to us to fully investigate and fully face the whole truth. It is up to us to prioritize the fight for the greater good because we owe that debt to our children, to the planet, and to the whole. Make your voice heard , while you can, while it can still matter.",0

19039,Voting Machine Caught Swapping Republican Ballot For Democrat,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News , US // 0 Comments 
A voting machine has been caught on camera casting a ballot for a Democrat after the voter selected a Republican. 
Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are going to steal the next election. “ I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest ,” he told a campaign rally last week. 
The mainstream media are trying to portray him as mad, but take a look at this evidence: 
This is attempted election theft through manipulation of the computerized voting machines – and it must be stopped. The party in power in a given state controls the programming of the voting machines. 
When the establishment asked Trump if he would accept the outcome of the election a whole three weeks before the event, it was like asking a sports coach if he thinks the game was refereed fairly before the game is played. 
And the Democrats are now attempting to cover all bases. They are sueing the RNC over Trump’s election rigging claims, and also suggesting if any evidence of voter fraud does emerge, then it is probably Russia’s fault . 
Do not believe that voter fraud does not exist. It’s real, the numbers are huge, and it’s undermining true democracy in the United States. We must fight to eradicate it.

19040,Islamic State ’Morality Police’ Behead Two Elderly ’Sorcerers’ in Egypt,"A video posted on an encrypted social media channel used by the Islamic State purportedly shows the beheading of two elderly men found guilty of “witchcraft and sorcery” in Egypt. [The killings are part of a campaign of persecution by Muslim extremist groups across the Middle East against adherents of Sufi Islam, which they see as both heretical and an obstacle to their political ambitions.  Foreign Desk News describes the video: Two elderly men appear in orange jumpsuits and are taken out of a black van and led to the desert, where they are beheaded. A man reads out what he says is a verdict from a Sharia court condemning them to death for “apostasy, sorcery, claiming the ability to tell the future, and leading people to polytheism. ” [  …    ] “Thanks be to God who has allowed the Islamic State’s soldiers in Sinai in applying his law and instituting religion in spite of all the infidels, apostates and envious Jews,” one fighter can be seen and heard saying. In the video, which is also notable for the fact that the men speaking in it are unmasked, fighters are shown seizing trucks full of cigarettes and drugs, and then burning them. Foreign Desk News notes that the Islamic State often levels charges of “sorcery” at followers of   and mystical Sufi Islam. In fact, other scenes in the video show the ISIS “religious police” blowing up Sufi shrines. ISIS and other Salafist Muslims accuse Sufis of violating Islamic law by practicing “divination”  —   in other words, appealing to saints or spirits for guidance, instead of demonstrating complete faith in Allah. Last November, ISIS released photos of the kidnapping and execution of    Sheikh Sulaiman Abu Haraz, a senior Sufi cleric in the Sinai Peninsula. Haraz was also accused of witchcraft and was beheaded with a sword. A newsletter published by the Islamic State in December included a warning to Egyptian Sufis from the “morality police” that they would be killed if they did not abandon their beliefs. The Islamic State also aggressively persecutes Sufis in Syria, as does  . As in Egypt, dynamiting Sufi shrines is a major component of this persecution. Sufis are a significant religious minority in Egypt. The Harvard Divinity School estimates their numbers as roughly 15 percent of the population, in a report that notes Muslim Brotherhood antipathy to Sufism grew more pronounced when Sufi political parties began forming in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. Professor Nile Green of the University of California postulates that in addition to profoundly opposing the Sufis’ more spiritual approach to Islam, groups like ISIS,   and the Muslim Brotherhood despise them because Sufi families have deep roots in their communities, and generally had decent working relationships with the governments displaced by the Arab Spring uprisings. Sufis are therefore denounced as collaborators with the systems radical groups intend to destroy. Indeed, he portrays Sufism as a highly organized school of Islam that may be the most significant political resistance to extremists in some communities, making them inevitable targets.",0

19043,"‘Always Agitated. Always Mad’: Omar Mateen, According to Those Who Knew Him - The New York Times","ORLANDO, Fla.  —   The brother of the bride arrived late for her reception. But soon enough he was mingling at the lakeside pavilion in West Palm Beach, where a diverse gathering of guests dined on chicken tikka masala and goat biryani while admiring the view of the Intracoastal Waterway just beyond the    windows. Then came the moment to join in a traditional Afghan dance called the attan, in which dancers form a circle and are led through a series of synchronized turns and moves. If well executed, the attan can create an almost trancelike sense of oneness. But here was the bride’s brother  —   stocky, bespectacled Omar Mateen  —   dancing in the group and yet dancing apart. Clumsy, out of sync, his head mostly down, the man dressed in black was following his own rhythm. Four months after this celebration of life in February, the awkward man in black caused wholesale death. Chuckling and declaring allegiance to the Islamic State, he opened fire at a gay and Latino nightclub here, leaving 49 people dead and wounding 53 others before he was killed by the police to end a protracted standoff. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub early last Sunday stands as the deadliest mass shooting by one person in United States history. Rising amid the international grief is the aching and obvious question of why. But the short life of Mr. Mateen, who was 29, provides no easy road map to motivation. He had shown occasional flashes of interest in radical Islam, enough to be investigated twice by the F. B. I. in recent years for possible extremist ties. But his professed embrace of the Islamic State and its call for disaffected Muslims to attack the West seem to have come suddenly, as if something snapped. And while some reports have suggested that he was gay, federal officials say they have found no evidence in his effects or online presence to back them up. Instead, the recollections of those who knew or encountered him conjure a man who could be charming, even   yet who also seemed forever aggrieved, forever not at peace, forever out of step. A chubby kid making inappropriate jokes about   in the fresh wake of that catastrophe. A leering misogynist whose pursuits could rattle women. An   employee who spoke casually of killing those who offended him. The security guard and wannabe cop whose scattershot anger made others feel unsafe. “He was just agitated about everything,” Daniel Gilroy, a former   in the security business, recalled. “Always shaken. Always agitated. Always mad. ” Omar Mateen was that chunky kid with glasses, remembered more for his scrapes with other classmates than for his academic performance. Early on, the same schoolboy who could wear a broad smile and a Power Rangers   in his school portrait could also engage in “much talk about violence  sex,” according to a school assessment. A   American, he was born in New York City’s   borough of Queens in 1986, and moved about four years later with his Afghan parents to Port St. Lucie in Florida, where he was quickly enrolled in an English for Speakers of Other Languages program. His father, Seddique Mateen, a refugee who became a naturalized American citizen, was a financial broker whose savvy investments allowed for a comfortable home appointed with tasteful furniture and expensive silk rugs. His wife, Shahla, stayed mostly in the background, while he set a tone of cultural conservatism, especially when it came to his three other children, all accomplished women. The son, though, enjoyed male privilege. The family assimilated. But as the United States became mired in the protracted war in Afghanistan, the elder Mr. Mateen became torn between his native and adopted homes. Over the years, he would become more politically active to a point of apparent delusion, posting videos, for example, of himself in military uniform, pretending to be Afghanistan’s president. For his children, family friends say, this meant navigating a fractured world in which their Afghan roots and Muslim faith could lead to divisiveness and ostracism. Two friends say that the Mateen children feared any perceived link to Islamic extremism, and so began saying, simply, that they were Persian. Omar Mateen was a disciplinary challenge in school, unafraid to push buttons. “Constantly moving, verbally abusive, rude, aggressive,” that school assessment noted. In the third grade, his rendition of the school song at Mariposa Elementary replaced “Mariposa, Mariposa” with “marijuana, marijuana. ” The boy was formally disciplined more than 30 times in elementary and middle schools as he pursued attention and occasional conflict rather than his studies. His father would later say that young Omar preferred drawing pictures in class to listening, which seems borne out by an assessment one of his teachers wrote at the time: “Unfortunately, Omar had great difficulty focusing on his classwork since he often seeks the attention of his classmates through some sort of noise, disruption, or distraction. ” So was Omar Mateen betraying his latent extremist sympathies  —   or was he just being    —   when, at 14, he shocked other students on his school bus by imitating an exploding plane so soon after the Sept. 11 attacks? “He got on, walked up the first couple of steps, held his arms out and made sounds like a motor and then made an explosion sound  —   and slipped into his seat,” Robert Zirkle, another student on the bus, remembered. “He did this three or four times, and was clearly not in the mood or the same state of mind that we were in. He seemed excited. ” His unsettling pantomimes ended when others told him there would be problems if he continued. Omar cycled through three high schools, collecting a string of suspensions  —   for fighting and other infractions  —   along the way. (In one case, a charge of battery was adjudicated and a charge of disturbing school function was dropped, he later wrote to a potential employer. “This was an experience of me growing up and I learned a big lesson from it. ”) Martin Bielicki, a former dean of students at Martin County High School, remembered in an email that this student “had issues with other students, in particular,” and “always would argue back and even defend himself. ” “I remember Omar as a    boy,” Mr. Bielicki wrote. “I look at that yearbook picture of him and it brings back memories of an innocent and likable young man. ” Omar matured with time. He took up soccer and skateboarding, became infatuated with weight lifting, and shed the flabbiness that had become a source of ridicule. He became so muscular that a friend, Sean Chagani, once asked him whether he was taking steroids. Recalled Mr. Chagani: “He kind of smirked and asked, ‘Can you tell? ’” The Mateen boy was more awkward than most teenagers, he recalled, but the two managed to find common ground. They played basketball, competed in video games and swam in the Chagani family’s pool. “I had plenty of friends growing up that I would consider kind of odd, and he was one of them,” Mr. Chagani said. “But certainly not aggressive, violent, homophobic, etc. ” Omar secured   jobs here and there, including at a Publix grocery store, and improved so strikingly in the classroom that he graduated from Stuart Adult Community High School in April 2003 in the top half of his class  —   at the age of 16. He moved from one   job to the next: a cashier and cook at a    a cashier at a Walgreens, a cashier at a Nutrition World, a floor watcher at a Gold’s Gym, a sales clerk at a GNC vitamin and supplement store. All the while, though, he was attending a community college, working toward an associate degree in criminal justice technology. His passion, it seems, was in law enforcement: Omar Mateen saw himself in uniform, buff and armed. In May 2005, the    requested to go on a   with a St. Lucie County deputy sheriff. But the ride that took place after he passed a background check now seems enveloped in an air of foreboding. The deputy sheriff’s car crashed, and the teenager was taken to a hospital to be checked out. After earning his degree, Mr. Mateen applied for an officer’s job with the Florida Department of Corrections, bolstering his application with an impressive letter of recommendation from Officer Steven J. Brown of the Port St. Lucie Police. “I would sleep soundly at night knowing that a person like Omar is protecting us. ” The young man’s dream was conditionally realized when he was sworn in as a Corrections Department employee and assigned as a trainee to the Martin Correctional Institution in Indiantown, not far from where he grew up. Four months in, he seemed on his way to a career in law enforcement, having received an evaluation of meeting expectations  —   of having the makings of one day becoming a “good correctional officer. ” But six months in, Mr. Mateen was fired. The unsettling reasons were revealed in documents released by the Department of Corrections on Friday. An officer reported in a memorandum that during training Mr. Mateen had laughingly asked him “if he was to bring a gun to school would I tell anybody. ” He posed his question on April 14, 2007, two days before a student named   Cho shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others on the campus of Virginia Tech. Mr. Mateen’s joke, if that is what it was, coupled with his penchant for sleeping in class and being absent without permission, prompted the warden, Powell H. Skipper, to recommend his termination. “In light of recent tragic events at Virginia Tech, Officer Mateen’s inquiry about bringing a weapon to class is at best extremely disturbing,” Mr. Skipper wrote at the time. Denied the right to wear one uniform, Mr. Mateen soon dressed in another  —   that of a security guard. He completed a training course, passed a background check, and began working for a security firm called G4S. At one point, perhaps as part of a G4S contract, he was working as an intake officer at a Florida juvenile assessment center. At another point, he was providing security after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, during which an undercover documentarian recorded a few of his cynical observations. “No one gives a shit here, like everyone is just out to get paid,” he is recorded as saying. “They’re like hoping for more oil to come out and more people to complain so they’ll have the jobs. Because once people get laid off here, it’s going to suck for them. They want more disaster to happen because that’s where their moneymaking is. ” Life continued. He had connected online with a young woman named Sitora Yusufiy, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, who initially found him to be a nice, funny man who treated his family well and had aspirations of becoming a police officer. He was religious  —   he made at least two Islamic pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia  —   but he never expressed sympathy for radical Islamists or terrorists, she said. And, yes, he could be homophobic. Soon after their marriage in April 2009, Ms. Yusufiy said, he began beating her and isolating her in their Florida home. With the help of her parents in New Jersey, she fled within the year. The next year, he was married again, to a woman he met online, this time to Noor Salman, in Rodeo, Calif. though he cultivated the persona of a man with a wandering eye. Mr. Mateen used a dating website to seek a relationship with a woman in Fort Pierce. He churned through usernames  —   “makeitlovelylol” among them  —   and lied about his age, according to the woman, who requested anonymity but who provided photos that she had saved from his dating profile. At one point, she said, Mr. Mateen’s pursuit veered toward stalking. He began messaging her to say he was nearby. He knew the color of her car and the general location of her place of employment. Other hints of a disturbed mind continued to emerge. In 2013, G4S removed Mr. Mateen from his security post at the St. Lucie County Courthouse after he had made “inflammatory comments” about being involved somehow in terrorism. Though   and even contradictory  —   he claimed connections to Al Qaeda, the Sunni extremist group, and ties to its near opposite, the Shiite Hezbollah  —   his comments were troubling enough for the county sheriff’s office to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The bureau’s subsequent inquiry was inconclusive. The next year, Mr. Mateen again attracted federal scrutiny, after an acquaintance from his mosque, the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, carried out a suicide bombing in Syria. According to F. B. I. Director James B. Comey, federal investigators concluded that Mr. Mateen knew the bomber only casually. The mosque’s imam, Syed Shafeeq Rahman, insisted that Mr. Mateen had never heard teachings at the mosque that would have radicalized him. “There is nothing that he is hearing from me to do killing, to do bloodshed, to do anything, because we never talk like that,” the imam said. By the end of 2014, Mr. Mateen  —   the bodybuilder who had once imagined a respected future in law enforcement  —   was working the guard’s booth at the entrance to PGA Village, a golf resort community in Port St. Lucie. But even in this   position, he managed to unnerve and upset, especially when he seemed to think that he had been disrespected. Heath Holtzclaw, who worked security at PGA Village a few years ago, has not forgotten how enraged Mr. Mateen became when he thought someone had given him an attitude. “You could tell he wanted to say something to whoever he felt had slighted him, but he never did,” Mr. Holtzclaw said. “He just slammed things around. ” Mr. Mateen would make people wait at the gate, sometimes causing delays, if he felt he had been disrespected, or if it was time for him to do his prayers. Jasmine Kalenuik, a frequent visitor to PGA Village, came to dread encountering the guard at the gate  —   who, she said, “acted like a   predator. ” “When I would go to grab my ID from his hand, he would cling to it and try to pull it back,” Ms. Kalenuik, 31, recalled. “He would hover over my car window and lean way in while breathing heavy on me with his teeth so clenched that you could see his jaw muscles sticking out. ” Ms. Kalenuik’s husband, Jerry, recently confronted the security guard, nearly nose to nose. But Mr. Mateen betrayed no emotion during the angry encounter. “It was like I was staring into the eyes of Ted Bundy,” Mr. Kalenuik, 27, said. “I was irate but he seemed completely detached. ” After that, he said, Mr. Mateen would grant him and his wife a curt nod as they passed through the checkpoint, but never looked them in the eye. Finally, it seems, rage consumed the man. Over what  —   infidels, gays, society’s failure to grant him proper deference, all of it  —   remains unclear. His father has suggested that Mr. Mateen was incensed by the sight of two men kissing in front of his young son, whose bedroom was   with all things Disney, all things America: a   helmet and bicycle, a Star Wars backpack, Star Wars drapes, a chair in the likeness of Tow Mater from “Cars,” and not one but three Mickey Mouses. Earlier this month, legally and with little wait, the man rejected by law enforcement purchased a Glock 9mm handgun and a SIG Sauer MCX   rifle. Then, early last Sunday morning, he carried his recent purchases into the Pulse nightclub, where hundreds of people were drinking and dancing and celebrating life, the way families do at weddings. And, following his own rhythm, he began to shoot.",0
19044,Students to Protest ‘Mikado’ for Lack of Engagement with Controversial Past,"Students to Protest ‘Mikado’ for Lack of Engagement with Controversial Past Derek G. Xiao, Harvard Crimson, October 27, 2016 
A group of Asian American students is planning to protest the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ upcoming production of “The Mikado” for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera. 
Organized by George S. Qiao ’18, the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists, describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the Japanese stereotypes and appropriation of Japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted production’s storyline. But later Qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the Players. 
“I fully believe that members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players put their blood, sweat, and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production,” Qiao said. “However, I believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement [with] this play’s history of Japanese cultural misrepresentation.” 
Penned in 1884, “The Mikado” is a comical opera, set in the fictional Japanese town of Titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of British political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated “Asian” names and stereotypical cultural caricatures. 
{snip} Hoping to avoid these issues in their own production, the board of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera, characterizing their rendition as a “reimagining” of the original production. 
“The board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, whose mission is to produce the full canon of Gilbert and Sullivan’s shows, faced a dilemma this past January,” Kathleen C. Zhou ’17, the president of the Players, wrote in an op-ed for The Crimson Tuesday. “Strike ‘The Mikado’ from our season, and ignore one of the most problematic but well-known G&S; shows, or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent.” 
The setting of their show is no longer the 19th century town of Titipu, and instead is now 20th century “Las Vegas themed Oriental hotel.” And, the opening number “Gentlemen of Japan” has been rewritten as “Gentlemen of the Strip.” 
{snip} 
Zhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical opera’s script, the complete omission of all of the original production’s issues was “an erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to [Asians].”

19045,"Iran, Once Quiet About Its Casualties in Syria and Iraq, Now Glorifies Them - The New York Times","TEHRAN  —   The first news report, to a nation usually kept in the dark about military matters, was shocking: 13 Iranian soldiers, all with links to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, had been killed in an ambush near the Syrian city of Aleppo. What followed this spring may have been even more surprising. Details about the soldiers appeared extensively in the Iranian news media, which not only gave the names of the dead but lionized them with sweeping life stories.   portraits were plastered all over their hometowns. For years, Iran covered up its military activities in Syria and Iraq, so the government could deny any official involvement on the ground. Coffins arrived with the bodies of soldiers who went unidentified, referred to only as “defenders of the shrines” of the Shiite saints. When the bodies began to come home in larger numbers, the state news media began calling them “volunteers. ” No longer. Now every Iranian killed in action is named, his picture published, his valor lauded in elaborate tributes in the   news media and on Instagram accounts dedicated to the fighters. The reason for the change, analysts say, is not some newfound dedication to transparency but a rift between the Iranian establishment’s   who control the military, and the moderates. The   they say, want to prevent any decline in Tehran’s absolute support for Syria’s president, Bashar   and to undermine the moderates, who they fear might be open to a political settlement in which Mr. Assad would step down. The Revolutionary Guards see publicizing the sacrifices of the fallen as a way to build domestic support for the current Syria policy and squelch any talk of compromise. The Instagram accounts have attracted tens of thousands of followers, most of them supporting the military effort. “By being open about our role, we can prevent a diplomatic solution in Syria,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a   political analyst close to Iran’s leaders. “First, we must defeat all terrorists in the battlefield. Only after that can we negotiate with them. ”   are promulgating Iran’s military successes  —   and even setbacks  —   in a variety of ways, including news reports and documentaries. An exhibit at the recent Tehran International Book Fair allowed ordinary Iranians to pose as “defenders of the shrines,” photographed sitting on a military motorcycle in front of a billboard showing a pulverized city street in Syria. The main focus, however, is on social media. Facebook and Twitter are blocked by the state in Iran, but the   app Instagram is freely accessible. Previously used mostly by   Iranians showing off new puppies or vacations on the Caspian Sea, the app is now suffused with images of “martyrs” and young men proudly wielding machine guns. One of the more prominent Instagram accounts is run by a reporter for Iranian state television, Hassan Shemshadi, who honors Iranian fighters and Afghans in the   Fatemiyoun brigade. Mr. Shemshadi’s more than 90, 000 followers are treated to selfies and other shots from the front lines in Syria. There are pictures of him doing a   for state television in front of an armored vehicle, of his passport and boarding pass for a flight to Damascus, and of the star officer of the Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Qassem Soleimani. But most of Mr. Shemshadi’s posts concern the increasing number of Iranian casualties in Syria and Iraq. Since he started posting news of soldiers’ deaths in 2015, he has published a total of 346   of Iranians and   Afghans in Syria and Iraq. That is a large majority of the 400 or so Iranian and Afghan soldiers thought to have died so far in the conflicts there. “In the name of the Lord of the Martyrs and the honest, the defenders of the shrine, Asadollah Ebrahimi and Saheb Nazari both from #Fatemiyoun, Mehdi Asgari from #Karaj, Mehdi Bidi from #Tehran, Mohammad Amin Karimian from #Mazandaran were martyred by takfiri terrorists in Syria,” Mr. Shemshadi wrote a week ago, using an Arabic word for infidels. Over 3, 700 people said they liked the post. Mr. Shemsadi continued, “They died while defending the pure Mohammedan Islam and the holy shrines and also maintaining the national security of our country, and ascended to the heavens. ” Mr. Shemshadi regularly posts images of those killed in action, like Abbas Daneshgar, who died at 23 in 2015, and two    one Iranian and one Afghan, both named Mostafa Mousavi and seen holding up guns. Some scenes are of everyday life on the front. In May, Mr. Shemshadi posted a picture of a man he called “martyr Belbasi,” cutting the hair of another fighter. In hindsight, a bad omen, he wrote in a caption. “The fighters who have returned from the battle of Khan Tuman say that whomever that was barbered by martyr Belbasi was martyred. ” Mr. Shemshadi declined to be interviewed for this article. He is not shy about describing Iran’s military activities in the region, a freedom of expression that would have to be permitted at the highest levels of the government. At a conference in Mashhad in February, for instance, Mr. Shemshadi said that Iran was directly involved in the Syrian conflict and that there was a danger that its Russian allies could one day stop supporting Mr. Assad. “They may abandon us,” Mr. Shemshadi said, as seen in videos of the event posted on the Shajar. ir website. “We cannot live in fear of what might happen. We should move forward. ” Iran is in Syria and Iraq not only to defend the shrines, Mr. Shemshadi said. “It is wrong to have a   view of what we are doing in Syria,” he said. Iran provides national security for the Syrians, too, and “we are there to show the real Islam,” meaning the Shiite strain. In February, he posted an image of Hadi Zolfaghari, who died fighting near the Iraqi city of Samarra. One of his followers, @fatima. baran. 110, nicknamed Isfahan Iran Muslim, wrote that she was tired of all the killing. “Are Iraq or Syria not able to defend themselves? So why should Iranian youths lose their lives for the sake of another country?” Mr. Shemshadi was quick to respond. “It is not for the sake of another country,” he said. “It is for the sake of Islam, religion, beliefs, Shiism, resistance, holy shrines and so much more. ”",0
19046,Fascism Over Farmers? The Troubling Priorities of the American Government,"[Photo: Corporate dairy Credit: Gunnar Richter Namenlos.net.] W itnesses to H istory CALEB T. MAUPIN Editor's Note Food, and the related agricultural, policies are complex and tied to both foreign and domestic policies. This is because the United States has been “the breadbasket of the world.” Unlike many nations, the US has remarkable amount of land (and until recently) climate suitable for production of a wide array of both crops and “livestock” (cruel humor to call it that). As Mr. Maupin discusses some of those complexities, it is important to remember that “large” agriculture is primarily corporate, and that is a different world than that of the small farmer. Since the advent of corporate agriculture, the small farmer has been fair game. The organic and clean food revolution saved many small farmers, but corporations are taking that over as well. Further, when we look at farm subsidies, those are also primarily geared towards (and benefit) agri-business.
Another side of this dreadful slide in food production is the closing of food outlets be those (continuously disappearing) small grocers and minute-marts, or the mega-stores of Wal-Mart, Safeway, etc. This creates a growing number of food deserts. These are essentially areas where wholesome, affordable food is available. Most ignored are the rural food deserts. The USDA has an interactive map of U.S. food deserts. Also problematic on the consumer side of the equation are the food subsidy programs. Most in kind (actual food) subsidies are destroyed, fed to livestock, or shipped out of the country EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A SURFEIT OF HUNGRY PEOPLE TO EAT THEY. The argument being that these surpluses would compete with the third part vendors making a profit. Therefore, we had food stamps, then SNAP (see sidebar). The later being a true insult – particularly if you are in the middle of a food desert. U S Foods Holding Corporation and Sysco, the two top American food distribution giants, are laying off thousands of workers. Wal-Mart is closing stores and terminating employees. As the price of eggs, beef, cheese, and almost all agricultural products have dropped, farmers across the United States are facing financial ruin.
The ongoing glut in agricultural products is not merely the natural cycle of the market at work. Policies of the US federal government are directly linked to the low food prices. While it is clear that the ongoing agricultural surplus is very bad for the US public, the government seems to have other priorities. Broken Promises From Politicians 
The agricultural prowess of the United States is known across the planet. The current president of China first visited the United States in 1985. He didn’t come to see the Statue of Liberty, or the Washington Monument. Rather, Xi Jinping visited Iowa in order to study the technology and farming techniques employed by some of the most advanced and efficient farmers in the world . The Holt family dairy. 
Love for the small farmers is voiced by almost all sectors of US political establishment, and almost always has been. The writings of Thomas Jefferson spoke at length about the “yeoman” and his role in an ideal republic. The left-wing folk singer Pete Seeger sang about how “the farmer is man who feeds them all .” Right-wing Radio host Paul Harvey plucked the heart strings of the American public with his “So God Made a Farmer” speech in 1978 . 
Each election year, American politicians devote special attention to the Iowa caucuses, the first vote in determining who will be the major parties’ respective nominees. As they travel across the Midwestern agricultural state, the presidential hopefuls routinely make all kinds of speeches championing “the hard working farmers.” 
While politicians are known to make promises to the farmers, and seem to recognize that agriculture is essential to the US economy, the policies of recent years, most of them having bipartisan support, have been anything but beneficial to those who work the land. In the current presidential race, Iowa is hotly contested, with Trump and Clinton very close in the polls. The farm glut, spawned by federal policies, is undoubtedly a big factor . 
In the first 8 months of 2016, 43 million gallons of milk were poured out due to the glut. According to the Wall Street Journal: “Farmers across the US are pouring out tens of millions of gallons of milk amid massive over glut that has reduced prices and filled warehouses with cheese .” 
Meanwhile, another WSJ article reports: “Cattle and hog prices hover near the lowest levels in years as U.S. meat packers produce the largest volume of meat in history .” Between July of 2016 and July of 2017, the price of milk has decreased by 11%. The price of eggs has decreased by 40% . SNAP was not implemented by Obama. It replaced food stamps in 2008 and the acronym was not accidental. It redefined food assistance to both “supplemental” and short term . The fact that for many the supplement is the mainstay of their family’s diet is apparently lost on the conservative(ly) compassionate republicons. The overproduction and under-consumption of agricultural products can be directly linked to federal policies. Throughout his administration, Barack Obama has repeatedly cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and reduced the amount of food that low income families are able to purchase. The cutting of this federal program directly takes food from the mouths of low-income Americans. Despite the fact that according to the US Department of Agriculture, 13% of American households are now food insecure, the cuts have continued, and hunger is rising among America’s poor .
In addition to the obvious impact on low-income Americans, the cuts in food stamps have also cut into food sales. Food producing corporations and small farmers have seen a decrease in their sales. Wal-Mart has laid off thousands of workers and closed thousands of stores. These losses and layoffs can be linked directly to the SNAP cuts . 
Congress has recently discussed a plan that would eventually take $150 billion out of the federal food assistance program, a move that would undoubtedly push a lot of food producers, retail employees, and meat packers over the edge, along with many others . 
The reductions in food assistance are not the only factor. The economic sanctions against Russia have played a dramatic role in creating the current food glut. The collapse and breaking up of the Soviet Union’s collective farm system during the Yeltsin era of the 1990s dramatically reduced Russia’s domestic food production. This opened up new markets for American farmers, who greatly increased their exports to the former USSR. 
However, the new sanctions imposed in 2014, which restrict US and EU agricultural sales to Russia, have dramatically changed the landscape of the global food market. American farmers have been deprived of 143.5 million potential customers due to the ban on selling to those living in the Russian Federation. Austerity & Fascism Leave Farmers Behind And why is it that “austerity” is always aimed at those who have the least first and most harshly? Why is food assistance to low income families being cut? The claim is that the US federal budget is too large, and that hard economic times mandate austerity. However, the United States still has the largest military budget on the planet. When it comes time to reduce spending, rather than cutting the amount of money spent on tanks, bombs, and drones, the politicians have opted to cut into the nutrition of low-income Americans, along with the livelihoods of farmers and agricultural workers. The thousands of military bases around the world, along with the billions given in foreign military aid to countries like Israel, all seem be far more important to US leaders.
And why has the US drastically restricted the exporting agricultural products to Russia? The sanctions were enacted in 2014, in response to the Ukraine crisis. The elected President of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovich, was toppled in orgy of street violence. The new government, with a base of support only in the western regions of the country, has within its ranks many open admirers of Adolf Hitler, and is very hostile to Russia. 
Since 2014, the people of Eastern Ukraine have taken up arms to resist the new regime. The people in the region of Crimea voted to become apart of the Russian Federation, whose military they had been hosting since the collapse of the USSR. Sanctions were imposed on Russia and continue, based on allegations that Russia is supporting the resistance of people in the Eastern regions against the new, pro-Western regime. US leaders tell us the sanctions are intended to punish Russia for “meddling” in Ukraine. 
Since the passing of the sanctions, Russia has revived its own domestic agricultural programs. Small farmers across Russia are producing beef, wheat, and other products no longer sold to them by the US and the EU. Russian agriculture has experienced a boom since 2014, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is even more popular than prior to the crisis . 
The decision of US leaders to wage economic warfare against Russia in support of a Ukrainian government that contains many with fascist sympathies, while at the same time cutting assistance to low-income American families, is contrary to values often displayed throughout American history. Both Lincoln and Roosevelt saw prosperity for the agricultural heartland of the United States and the millions who lived in it as vitally important for the entire country. These two most beloved Presidents in US history both worked closely in alliance with small farmers, often in opposition to Wall Street bankers with different interests. 
The rallying cry of the Republican Party in its early years, was “Free Land, Free Labor, Free Men!” The “Free Soilers,” farmers who wanted to halt the expansion of slavery in new US territories were an essential part of it. While slavery found support in the financial districts of London and New York, the small farmers had a material interest in ending the barbaric practice, and anti-slavery militias appeared in Iowa and Kansas years before the Civil War broke out. 
It was a broad coalition of small farmers, religious abolitionists, and organized labor that eventually put Abraham Lincoln into the White House where he was forced to battle the slaveholders. The process that unfolded recreated the country, in what is widely called “The Second American Revolution.” “An American Government Cannot Allow Americans To Starve” 
The programs that preceded the currently existing Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) were the brainchild of Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, who eventually became the Vice President. When the first “food stamps” were issued in 1939, the director of the program, Milo Perkins described it this way: “We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm .” 
While Roosevelt was universally hated by Wall Street bankers, he was very popular with organized labor, artists and musicians, as well as small farmers. As the unemployment councils and labor unions fought for a better life across the country, Roosevelt aligned himself with the mass movement in the streets. Essential in Roosevelt’s progressive coalition was the US Communist Party, an organization that sought to build a “Workers and Farmer’s Government.” When big business objected to Roosevelt’s dramatic economic reforms, he defended them by saying “an American government cannot allow Americans to s tarve .” 
Roosevelt later aligned with the Russian people in order to defeat Adolf Hitler. FDR’s opposition to fascism and his policies of feeding of hungry Americans while subsidizing farmers were not isolated from each other. They corresponded with his overall view of the world, expressed in 1944: “We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth- is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill housed, and insecure…. We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence…. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made .” 
In 2016, things are very different. While banks were bailed out without hesitation during the 2008 financial crisis, financial assistance to low income Americans continues to be cut. Wall Street and London see the Eurasian Bloc of Russia and China as a rising competitor to their financial hegemony. The wealthy financial elite largely support sanctions and further isolation of both countries despite whatever disastrous impact on American farmers, agricultural workers, and food distributors. 
Children across the United States are hungry, as 13% of households are food insecure, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Farm workers and those who work for food distributors and supermarkets are losing their jobs. Gallons of milk are at this moment being dumped out in hopes of raising the prices, while food warehouses sit filled with rotting, unsold cheese. 
Meanwhile, US and NATO forces are increasing their presence in Eastern Europe, threatening Russia. As agricultural sanctions on Russia continue, weapons and training are being provided to a Ukrainian military that is known to contain a number fascist sympathizers, including the infamous Azov Battalion. 
As discontent rises in the United States, it is largely centered in the agricultural and de-industrialized mid-western heartland. It is clear that many Americans desperately want something to change. A government that prioritizes fascistic elements in Ukraine over farmers in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ohio, is clearly out of touch. Caleb Maupin Is an American journalist and political analyst.

19047,"One Guantánamo Detainee Pleads for Release, but Another Does Not Appear - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Two longtime detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, made rare public appearances in separate military hearings on Thursday, including Mohamedou Ould Slahi, whose memoir recounting abuse by American interrogators became a   last year after he waged a yearslong battle with the government for permission to publish it. But the expected first public appearance of another, even more prominent Guantánamo captive, Abu Zubaydah, was abruptly postponed. Mr. Zubaydah is one of three terrorism suspects the Central Intelligence Agency is known to have tortured through a technique called waterboarding. The day began with a hearing for Mr. Slahi before a Periodic Review Board, offering him his first chance to make the case for why he should be released after nearly 14 years of imprisonment. Mr. Slahi, 45, has not been charged with a crime, and the review board is considering whether to recommend that he be released. Wearing glasses and a white shirt, Mr. Slahi did not speak during the part of the hearing that was not classified and was streamed to the Pentagon for reporters to observe. There was no word on when a decision would be made on whether to free Mr. Slahi, who would prefer to be sent to Germany or Mauritania, where he was born, according to his lawyers and representatives. Mr. Slahi fought with Al Qaeda in the 1990s against Afghanistan’s Communist government and later ended up in Germany, where he was arrested after crossing paths with one of the planners of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his book, “Guantánamo Diary,” Mr. Slahi says he was deprived of sleep for long stretches at the prison, shackled for days at a time in a freezing cell, beaten, doused with ice water and threatened by interrogators who said they could make him disappear. Interrogators also threatened to have his mother arrested and   he wrote. Despite the mistreatment, the impression that emerged of Mr. Slahi during the hearing was of an engaging and intellectually curious man eager to reconnect with the world. Mr. Slahi, said one of his American military representatives, is a model prisoner, and he “is uniquely talented, and speaks multiple languages, including English. ” The military representative, who was not identified, said he believed that Mr. Slahi genuinely intended to live a peaceful life and posed no threat to the United States if released. A   profile of Mr. Slahi said that if freed, he would most likely reunite with his family and travel the world to promote his book. But it also warned that releasing him was not without risks, given his old “terrorist contacts. ” The United States determined years ago that Mr. Slahi was a senior recruiter for Al Qaeda, and for some time it considered him the most dangerous person imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay. A federal judge saw the case differently, and ordered Mr. Slahi released in 2010, concluding that the government’s evidence against him was marred by coercion and mistreatment, or was “so classified” that it could not be used in court. But the Obama administration challenged the decision, which was overturned on appeal, leaving Mr. Slahi in legal limbo. Mr. Slahi’s lawyer, Theresa Duncan, said in her opening statement that her client had never taken any hostile action against the United States, noting that when he joined Al Qaeda in the early 1990s, the Islamist militants “and the United States were aligned. ” In his memoir, which was based on a handwritten diary he composed in 2005, Mr. Slahi detailed much of the treatment that tainted the government’s case, including a “special interrogation” that lasted for months. The interrogation was personally approved in 2003 by Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the defense secretary. Separately on Thursday, a pretrial hearing was convened in a   courtroom at Guantánamo in the yearslong effort to use a military commission to prosecute five detainees accused of aiding the Sept. 11 attacks. Reporters could watch a video feed of that hearing at Fort Meade, Md. The session focused on   complaints by one of the defendants, Ramzi bin   who says guards are making banging noises and making his cell vibrate so that he cannot sleep. The military has denied Mr. bin  ’s allegations. In November 2015, the judge overseeing the case, Col. James Pohl of the Army, issued an order not to harass him, but Mr. bin   says the commotion has continued. Mr. Bin   lives in Camp 7, a part of the prison complex where former C. I. A. “black site” prisoners are housed and which reporters are not permitted to visit. His lawyer, James Harrington, called as a witness another Camp 7 resident, Gouled Hassan Dourad, a Somali man who has been accused of being a member of Al Qaeda’s affiliate in East Africa and who had not been seen publicly since his capture. Mr. Dourad, bearded and dressed in white clothing and a checkered kaffiyeh, swiveled in the witness chair as he testified that he, too, had been subjected to continuous floor vibrations, bangs and bad smells since 2009. He said he had complained about the disruptions for a time, but had stopped because no one cared. “We have mental torture in Camp 7,” he said. During   a prosecutor, Edward Ryan, accused Mr. Dourad of lying. Saying that he wanted to establish that the witness was biased, Mr. Ryan grilled him about alleged Qaeda activities like evaluating a military base in Djibouti for a potential suicide bombing, which Mr. Dourad denied. Mr. Harrington had intended to call Mr. Zubaydah, who was once viewed as the first “high value” terrorism suspect captured by the C. I. A. after the Sept. 11 attacks but whose significance was later downgraded. However, as Mr. Zubaydah prepared to take the stand  —   he was said to be waiting outside the door  —   a lawyer representing him told the judge that he would object if questioning went beyond the conditions of confinement in Camp 7 and reached potentially incriminating topics. Mr. Ryan said he did intend to ask about his alleged terrorist activities, and the testimony was postponed.",0

The immigration rules for Canada are fairly strict, as Americans seeking refuge there will be unable to relocate there without first securing a job, a graduate study course, or another professional niche that meets Canadian work residency requirements. A thread on Quora explained the rigorous standards the Canadian government has for Americans relocating to their Northern neighbor. Tax rules are also complex for American expats seeking refuge from a Trump presidency. 
One viral phenomenon that spread earlier in the election season eerily predicted the rise in interest of American immigration to Canada if Donald Trump were to win the presidency. In July, a website promoted Cape Breton Island , on the Eastern shore of Canada, as a possible refuge for Americans fleeing a President Trump. 
Destination Cape Breton had to hire extra staff to field 5,000 questions from Americans who were either seriously interested in moving to the island or adjusting their summer travel plans to include a visit. Questions ranged from “What is the process to immigrate to your beautiful island?” to “What are real estate prices like?” 
As of 11:51 PM Eastern, Donald Trump currently has 232 electoral college votes to Hillary Clinton’s 209. The GOP nominee has won Florida, and is still leading in Michigan and Wisconsin, which were previously thought to be solidly Democratic.

19050,16 Arrested at North Dakota Pipeline Protest - The New York Times,"Tensions continued in North Dakota on Monday afternoon as law enforcement officials arrested 16 people at a demonstration, one day after hundreds clashed with the police over the Dakota Access Pipeline. During a news conference on Monday, officials also defended their use of fire hoses against protesters the night before, despite the   weather. “Some of the water was used to repel some of the protest activities that were occurring, and it was used at a time where they were aggressive towards the officers,” the Morton County sheriff, Kyle Kirchmeier, said at the news conference. In a statement  late on Sunday, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department characterized the demonstration as an “ongoing riot,” releasing photos that it said showed protesters “setting fires and using aggressive tactics” while trying to dismantle a police barricade on Backwater Bridge, which has for months been the site of a protest against the pipeline. The statement did not address what dispersal methods the department had used against what it estimated to be a crowd of 400 protesters. Rob Keller, a spokesman for the department, told The Bismarck Tribune that water was being used for crowd control, adding that water cannons had also been used to douse the fires. The paper reported that protesters had started a dozen fires and that officers from the sheriff’s department had said that rocks and logs were being thrown at them. One officer was struck on the head, it said. The Associated Press reported that at least one person was arrested. Dallas Goldtooth, a spokesman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, said in a phone interview on Monday that the Oceti Sakowin medical team, which had been working in tandem with medics from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, had reported that nearly 200 people were injured and 12 people were hospitalized for head injuries. One protester went into cardiac arrest and was revived by the medic team, he said. The medical teams attributed many of the injuries to rubber bullets, pepper spray and shrapnel from concussion grenades, according to Mr. Goldtooth, and said that water sprayed from cannons caused early signs of hypothermia. The air temperature in the area was about 23 degrees at 10:15 p. m. according to the National Weather Service. “I would love to emphasize here that this entire situation is ripe with irony,” Mr. Goldtooth said, adding that on Friday, Sheriff Kirchmeier had urged the protesters to leave their camps because they might be unfamiliar with the harshness of North Dakota winters. Late last month, tensions boiled over at a protest camp near Backwater Bridge when law enforcement officials forced demonstrators out of the area. That confrontation led to the arrests of more than 140 protesters and resulted in the setting of multiple fires. Reports coming out of the conflict have been highly contested, with law enforcement officials and protesters leveling substantive accusations of violence at each other. Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, said in a phone interview Monday that the measures law enforcement officials took on Sunday represented a clear escalation of violence. “The use of water in freezing temperatures just goes to show that they’re being more aggressive and they’re actually trying to hurt people,” he said. “This is far more threatening to human life than any other time of confrontation with law enforcement. ” A live video of Sunday’s protests was posted by a demonstrator named Kevin Gilbertt, who identifies himself on Facebook as a poet and videographer. Early Monday morning, the   and unclear video had been viewed over three million times. Senator Bernie Sanders shared Mr. Gilbertt’s video on his Facebook page and called for President Obama to “take all appropriate measures” to protect the protesters. Senator Sanders also reposted a tweet that said that law enforcement officials were spraying Native Americans with water cannons in   weather. The conflict over the $3. 7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline has lasted for months, as Energy Transfer Partners, a   company, attempts to finish construction of the   project In an interview with The Associated Press published on Friday, Kelcy Warren, the company’s chief executive, said that the company had no alternative but to stick to the plan for construction. “There’s not another way. We’re building at that location,” Mr. Warren said. Native Americans, environmental activists and others have said that the pipeline, which would carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois, threatens the local water supply and would also harm sacred Native American grounds. In an interview with NPR last month, Mr. Archambault, the tribal chairman, said that while protesters were asked to “remain prayerful and peaceful,” it was “hard to resist reacting” given the dual pressures coming from Energy Transfer Partners and law enforcement. “Our purpose is to protect the water,” he said. “And no matter what we do, nobody cares. They’re going to force this down our throats again. ”",0
19052,Matthews Thinks Trump Will Probably Face a Primary Challenge in 2018 Election - Breitbart,"On Thursday, MSNBC host Katy Tur seemed to confuse when the next presidential election will be held when she asked, “Is there any chance that Donald Trump will face a primary challenger in 2018 from the Republican side?”  Fellow host Chris Matthews answered, “Well probably, because he’s controversial, and there are people like George Will and his column today in the Washington Post, there’s a lot of true blue conservatives out there, and I mean that, true blue conservatives who don’t like him. And there are people in the party that see it as an opportunity to make hay. He’s going to have a tough   and a tough   fight. Who knows what’ll happen. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
19053,Judge Rejects Bid for Special Prosecutor to Investigate Christie in Bridge Scandal - The New York Times,"A New Jersey judge on Friday dismissed a bid to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Gov. Chris Christie’s involvement in the lane closings at the George Washington Bridge in 2013, leaving the case in the hands of a county prosecutor’s office that is led by one of Mr. Christie’s appointees. In her decision, Judge Bonnie J. Mizdol of Bergen County Superior Court wrote that the citizen who made the request, William J. Brennan, did not have standing to make such a motion. Mr. Brennan had petitioned the court to order the recusal of the Bergen County prosecutor’s office and the state attorney general’s office, which are both overseen by appointees of Mr. Christie, a Republican. But Judge Mizdol cited various precedents that indicated that Mr. Brennan did not have the legal right to file such motions in the case. “This court is mindful of the heightened concern for conflict when a governor is facing criminal prosecution by the very state he is tasked to govern,” Judge Mizdol wrote. “However, this court is   to uphold our Constitution, statutes, case law and court rules none of which convey standing upon Brennan. ” Gurbir S. Grewal, the Bergen County prosecutor and a Democrat, has recused himself and designated another prosecutor in his office, John L. Higgins III, to oversee the case. The office has the authority to decide whether to pursue the case further. Mr. Grewal’s office and the office of Christopher S. Porrino, the state attorney general and a Republican, submitted a joint brief opposing Mr. Brennan’s bid. Mr. Porrino, a former chief counsel to Mr. Christie, has also designated a subordinate to take over the case. It was not clear if either office would move forward with the matter. The Bergen County prosecutor’s office currently has control of the case, according to a spokesman for Mr. Porrino. State law requires that civilian complaints be turned over to the county prosecutor’s office if a municipal court finds there is probable cause. Mr. Brennan’s complaint was filed in Bergen County, which includes the borough where the lane closings occurred, Fort Lee. Mr. Grewal’s office did not respond to requests for comment or to questions about the case, including whether it planned to pursue it further. Mr. Brennan, an activist and retired firefighter from Teaneck, N. J. with a history of lawsuits against government agencies, called the judge’s decision “an act of judicial cowardice. ” “The only one with standing to raise a conflict of interest is the person compromised by the conflict?” he said in a statement. “This is not justice. ” Mr. Brennan filed the complaint in September, using an aspect of New Jersey law that allows citizens to bring criminal complaints. A municipal court judge had allowed it to proceed after finding probable cause in October. The basis for the case, which accuses Mr. Christie of official misconduct for failing to act to reopen access lanes to the bridge, emerged this fall during the federal trial of two of Mr. Christie’s allies involved in the closings, Mr. Brennan said. The two defendants, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, were found guilty by a jury in November of all charges related to the scheme to close the lanes to punish the mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Mr. Christie in his bid for  . Testimony during the trial indicated that the governor knew about the closings as they were happening, despite his assertions that he knew nothing about them until much later. Craig Carpenito, a lawyer for Mr. Christie, called Mr. Brennan’s complaint “baseless,” questioned his motives for filing it and lauded the judge’s opinion. He said it was appropriate that the decision about whether to pursue the case would be left to members of the Bergen County prosecutor’s office, “who have a profound obligation to ensure that justice is done. ” If the case were to proceed, it would be another challenge for Mr. Christie stemming from the lane closings, the fallout from which hurt his campaign for president and damaged his reputation as a surrogate for   Donald J. Trump. Mr. Christie was replaced by Vice   Mike Pence as the leader of Mr. Trump’s transition effort shortly after the election last month. In a separate legal matter on Friday involving another Christie ally, United Airlines agreed to pay a $2. 4 million settlement for reinstating a   flight to South Carolina from Newark. The flight had been operated at the behest of David Samson, who was the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time of the lane closings and had a home in Aiken, S. C. the Securities and Exchange Commission said. Mr. Samson, who was appointed to his post by Mr. Christie, his longtime friend, pleaded guilty in July to a felony count of bribery in the case.",0
19054,Ex-Admiral and Member of Navy SEALs Is Top Choice to Replace Flynn - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Robert S. Harward, the retired vice admiral who is President Trump’s top choice to replace his ousted national security adviser, is a   member of the Navy SEALs who rose through the ranks to top military positions and is close with Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense. Mr. Harward, 60, is a former deputy commander of the United States Central Command, the military’s busiest with management of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, where he was responsible for counterterrorism issues. He is currently a top executive at Lockheed Martin, the weapons and aerospace company, overseeing business with the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Harward’s career has closely tracked that of Mr. Mattis, from the time the two worked together in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 to his tour at Central Command from 2011 to 2013, which included an assignment heading detainee operations in Kabul. “He has faced down and defeated the world’s most ruthless and deadly enemies, and he has done all that by Mattis’s side,” said Fran Townsend, Mr. Bush’s former homeland security adviser, for whom Mr. Harward worked from 2003 to 2005. “He has been in tougher knife fights than this, and won. ” Still, it is not clear whether Mr. Harward would be willing to surrender his lucrative position and comfortable existence in Abu Dhabi to step into the tumult of the Trump White House. The new administration has been troubled by an unusual level of infighting, disorganization and grievance  —   including within the ranks of the National Security Council  —   capped off on Monday by the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser. Raised in prerevolutionary Tehran, Mr. Harward was known to startle his Afghan counterparts during his tours there by conversing with them fluently in Farsi, which is similar to their native Dari. Trained as an elite Special Operations officer, Mr. Harward is also known for his bravado and obsession with physical fitness. As the head of detainee operations in Afghanistan, he would lead weekly hikes in the mountains outside Kabul, outpacing colleagues who were 20 years younger, and has been known to challenge them to   contests that left them vomiting. Mr. Harward looks the part of a   military man, a crucial factor for a president who has made clear that he considers appearance an important indicator of a job candidate’s suitability for a role. With his bald head,   eyes and long scar of mysterious provenance down his cheek, Mr. Harward has the bearing of an officer who once carried out risky secret operations. But he is also an effective inside player, according to people who know him, having worked for some of the military’s top policy leaders and at the White House. James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former NATO commander, said Mr. Harward was “someone who will find a way to succeed no matter how daunting the task. ” “I have known him well for two decades, and have boundless admiration for his ingenuity, integrity and ability to navigate choppy seas  —   both operationally in the field and in the battlefield of Washington, D. C.,” said Mr. Stavridis, currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “The real question,” he added, “is whether he wants to take the job. ” Some question whether Mr. Harward’s decades of military experience are the right preparation for a senior   post. In a Twitter post Tuesday, Max Boot, a senior fellow in national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Mr. Harward “a great SEAL,” but said it was “not clear that running detainee ops in Afghanistan or being No 2 at Centcom is right background for this. ” Friends say Mr. Harward has experience with   military special operations, but also in navigating the arcane world of the National Security Council, which is charged with synthesizing recommendations from national security and intelligence agencies and advising the president on policy. The process frequently involves managing turf battles and balancing competing interests. “He’ll bring a buffering calm and balance, as well as his using his previous experience at the N. S. C. ,” said Douglas H. Wise, a former deputy director at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Mr. Mattis is widely seen as a force for steadiness within the Trump administration, and some Republicans who have expressed misgivings about the president’s policies and his attitude toward national security matters have looked to his defense secretary as an island of reliability in a sea of unpredictability. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump should name a new national security adviser “who is empowered by clear lines of authority and responsibility and possesses the skills and experience necessary to organize the national security system across our government. ” Mr. McCain said he looked forward “to working with the president’s administration, especially Secretary Mattis, to defend the nation and support our military service members. ” If he is chosen for the post and accepts, Mr. Harward would be reunited with his old boss and mentor, Mr. Mattis. But he would also have to contend with Mr. Trump’s inner circle, populated by political advisers with whom Mr. Harward is not familiar, including Steven K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist. In an executive order last month  —   which Mr. Trump later complained privately that he had not been fully briefed on  —   the president placed Mr. Bannon on the principals committee of the National Security Council, giving a political adviser a position of parity with the secretaries of state and defense, and with the national security adviser. Two former national security officials who have worked closely with Mr. Harward said he would be unlikely to take the position without strong assurances from Mr. Trump and his team that the council would not be driven by partisan considerations on national security policy, and that he would have the autonomy to provide principled counsel. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on Mr. Harward’s behalf. Mr. Harward’s name surfaced briefly in 2015 in connection to the scandal involving David H. Petraeus, the former general who was forced to resign as director of the Central Intelligence Agency after admitting that he had provided classified information to his lover, and who is now also said to be in the running to be Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. Jill Kelley, a Tampa socialite who had befriended Mr. Petraeus and then become a target of threatening emails from Mr. Petraeus’ lover, had also written gushing notes to Mr. Harward and Mr. Mattis. “You ROCK! !!” Ms. Kelley wrote to Mr. Harward in 2012 regarding his dealings with foreign heads of state at a social gathering, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. “YOU ROCK MORE! ,” Mr. Harward replied. There was no evidence of impropriety in the friendly correspondence, which would have been routine between top military commanders and civic leaders in the communities in which they were stationed.",0

19057,"Muhammad Ali Remembered, by Those Who Knew Him as Cassius - The New York Times","LOUISVILLE, Ky.  —   Muhammad Ali filled the middle of three screens in the small theater. In footage taken a few years after his 1960 Olympic gold medal performance, he was explaining his decision to sit out the Vietnam War to a group of white male college students. “You won’t even stand up for me in America for my religious beliefs,” said Ali, who had converted from Christianity to Islam, “and you want me to go somewhere and fight, but you won’t even stand up for me at home. ” From her seat in the darkened room at the Muhammad Ali Center on Saturday, Emma McElvaney Talbott heard Ali’s words and couldn’t hold back. “That’s right,” she exclaimed, not caring how far her voice carried. The hometown that McElvaney Talbott and Ali shared was staging a citywide   this weekend for its native son, who died late Friday after a   struggle with Parkinson’s disease. Outside the center, the flags had been lowered to  . Inside, McElvaney Talbott’s memories, triggered by the   film of Ali’s life, were going full tilt. All around her were people who had come to pay their respects, some bearing bouquets of flowers or boxing gloves, handmade signs or letters. Or, in some cases, just silent blessings. Kerry Borvan, who had been traveling with her nephews from Chicago to the Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. made an unplanned stop at the museum and cultural center after waking up to the news of Ali’s death. Dr. Saleem Seyal, a cardiologist who was born in Pakistan and is a longtime resident of the Louisville area, had once met Ali, and he produced photographs from his smartphone to prove it. He had come to say a Muslim prayer for the former heavyweight champion of the world. There were also those who were there from the start, who knew Ali as a kid in Louisville who raced school buses on foot and walked teenage girls home from school for the prospect of a kiss, who could testify to the sentiment that Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville had expressed at a Saturday morning memorial service when he said, “Muhammad Ali belongs to the world, but he only has one hometown. ” That rang true for McElvaney Talbott, a retired educator and a writer, and her husband, Cecil Talbott, an engineer, who are   members of the center, which was   by Ali and his wife, Lonnie. On Saturday, the waiving of admission fees was hardly what motivated them to join the steady procession of visitors. On a day when the weather  —   gray and glum with scattered sunshine between downpours  —   reflected the city’s collective emotions, they said they had come because each room in the center was like a page from a scrapbook. Like Ali, Cecil Talbott learned to box at a local gym run by Fred Stone, who is credited with helping to teach Ali the footwork that enabled him to flit around the ring like a dancer. With prodding from his wife, Talbott recounted a   sparring session he had with the much bigger Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, when both were teenagers. Talbott said he was scrawny and stood just 5 feet 7 inches when he climbed into the ring with Ali, who was well on his way to his adult height,  . Ali seemed not to care that the objective of sparring was to practice technique, not inflict torment, “In the first round, Cassius threw a hard right, and Fred warned him not to hit hard,” Cecil Talbott said. “In the second round, Cassius threw another hard right, and Freddie had to warn him again not to do it. “In my mind, I said, ‘This is not going to work,’ so in the third round, he threw another hard right, and I saw it coming. I blocked it and I threw a hard right back. Cassius looked at me and said, ‘Good shot.’ ” Talbott gave up boxing soon thereafter, but Ali was hooked. McElvaney Talbott, who was in the same class at Central High as Ali’s younger brother, recalled Ali shadowboxing in the halls as he made his way from one class to the next. He was smart, she said, but didn’t apply himself in school. “He was a cutup,” she said. “I just remember he was a lot of fun. ” Some mornings, he entertained his schoolmates by racing a dozen blocks or more as he tried to outrun the bus that McElvaney Talbott rode to school. “We’d be screaming and hollering and laughing,” she said. “We’d be yelling: ‘Go Cassius!’ ” McElvaney Talbott recalled with a laugh: “He’d always stop for the young ladies. I called him a big ol’ teddy bear. ” One day, she said, he walked her home from a skating rink, shadowboxing on the sidewalk and jabbering away. “When we got to my door, he asked me for a kiss,” she said. “I regretfully said no, and he didn’t push it. ” In 1960, the year Ali graduated from high school, he won the   gold at the Summer Olympics in Rome. Upon his return home, he received a hero’s welcome, but the local adulation, like the gold in his medal, did not run deep. Instead, discrimination did. One had to be a fighter to rise above the daily humiliations of life in a segregated city, McElvaney Talbott said. Some leaned on books and learning and religion. Ali used his fists and his wit. As a child of the segregated South, she said she understood the forces that had carried Ali into the embrace of the Nation of Islam, an American Muslim sect that advocated racial separation. (He would later convert to orthodox Islam.) She said she was proud when he refused to be drafted to fight in the Vietnam War and requested   status, which caused him to be stripped of his heavyweight title by boxing commissions around the country and put his career on hiatus for more than three years during his athletic prime. “We lived with him through all the injustices,” McElvaney Talbott said. “I remember feeling that he was right to refuse to go and feeling really sad when they stripped him of his title. ” She added, “He was the man for that time. ” As his fame grew, his trips home diminished. But during his visits, “he was always the hometown boy,” McElvaney Talbott said. “If you saw him, he was approachable. ” During one of those visits, she said, Ali ran into her older brother, Woody. “Give me your address,” she said Ali told her brother. An hour later, Ali showed up on his doorstep. “I ran into him at the center four years ago,” she said, “and I told him I was Woody’s sister. He was struggling with his speech, but his face lit up. ” Ali’s younger brother, who was born Rudolph but later converted to Islam and took the name Rahman Ali, spent part of Saturday receiving visitors at a house on Grand Street. It was next door to the carnation pink clapboard structure where he and his brother were raised by their mother, Odessa, a cook and house cleaner, and their father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. a sign painter and church muralist. The     home was restored and converted into a museum that opened last month. Visitors were greeted at the front door by Sonny Fishback, who was dressed in purple pants and a matching bowler’s shirt as if ready for the nightclub stages he once commanded. Fishback attended Central High with Ali and his brother and later became a singer and songwriter. Stories flowed freely from him as he controlled the tide of people streaming inside to buy an $8 admission ticket and pay their respects to Rahman Ali, who is as quiet as his brother was loquacious. In the bedroom the brothers shared, there are two paintings of Muhammad Ali by Rahman, who is an artist. Speaking softly, Rahman said that his brother’s physical suffering was over and that he had led a rich life. When it was suggested to him that Ali’s greatest currency was the love he gave away freely and, in his later years, was returned a thousandfold, Rah beckoned the visitor closer and kissed her on the cheek. Five miles from the house, at the Green Meadows Memorial Cemetery, which sits on the other side of the railroad tracks, a woman knelt in front of the granite gravestone shared by Ali’s parents, planting marigolds to spell out “Love. ” She identified herself as Diana Rupa but said she went by the surname Ali because the boxer embodied kindness and respect and dignity. As she was working the dirt around the flowers, she said she had never met Ali but felt a personal and spiritual connection to him. Earlier in the day, Rupa had added an elephant piñata to the makeshift shrine for Ali on the porch of his childhood home. She set another   elephant at his parents’ grave site. With their thick skins, their graceful way of moving on their toes and their ability to communicate to their herd without seeming to speak, elephants remind her of Ali. The boxer known for running his mouth became a humanitarian who did not have to say a word. Referring to his Parkinson’s disease, which so diminished Ali’s voice, Rupa said, “God had to shut him up,” she said, “so that we could hear his heart. ”",0
19058,Joe McKnight Shooting: Man Is Charged Days Later in Fatal ‘Road Rage’ - The New York Times,"Ronald Gasser, who admitted to the police that he had shot and killed the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight in Louisiana, was arrested on Monday and charged with manslaughter  —   four days after the authorities faced widespread criticism for initially freeing him. The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a former player for the New York Jets, after what the authorities described as a “road rage” confrontation has captured wide attention amid a national debate about shootings and race. Mr. Gasser is white, and Mr. McKnight was black. Mr. Gasser was charged after investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish said on Tuesday in an   news conference in which he defended the authorities’ actions. The sheriff, bristling over suggestions that officials had been   and had handled the case differently because of the race of the two men, read aloud obscene internet comments that had been directed at elected officials after Mr. Gasser’s release. He repeated two racial slurs for   an   slur and other crude language, and twice banged his fist on the lectern, chastising critics for what he said was a premature demand for justice. “For those who have criticized the men and women of this organization and the strategy decisions that we made relative to that: Tough. I don’t care,” he said. “Because what I know is I can put my head on the pillow every night, knowing that we’ve done the right thing for the right reasons. ” The sheriff also appeared to insinuate that the victim shared blame for the violent outcome, saying: “Two people engaged in bad behavior that day. Why? I don’t know, but they did. ” The sheriff said the charges against Mr. Gasser would be submitted to the district attorney. Mr. McKnight was shot three times at about 2:45 p. m. Thursday in Terrytown, La. about five miles southeast of New Orleans. Sheriff Normand said the confrontation began after both drivers were driving erratically, cutting each other off and zipping in front of each other, according to Mr. Gasser and witnesses. Mr. Gasser said he became irate and engaged in a “verbal altercation” with the football player. When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached Mr. Gasser’s car window. Mr. Gasser then pulled out a handgun from between his seat and the console and shot Mr. McKnight, Sheriff Normand said. Mr. Gasser told the police he had feared Mr. McKnight, but witnesses disputed elements of his account, Sheriff Normand said. Sheriff Normand revealed that Mr. McKnight had a gun in his car, but that both the gun and the car belonged to his stepfather. There was no indication that Mr. McKnight had suggested during the confrontation that he had a weapon, Sheriff Normand said. Local N. A. A. C. P. leaders, former football teammates of Mr. McKnight and social media users expressed anger over officials’ decision to free Mr. Gasser initially without charging him. They said they believed he would not have been freed if he were black and that justice would be less swift because Mr. McKnight was black. “We think a black man was lynched yesterday,” Morris Reed, the president of the New Orleans branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said at a news conference on Friday. “We are demanding some answers. ” Moe Reed Jr. a lawyer, said of Mr. Gasser on Friday, “There is nothing that could’ve happened yesterday at 3 p. m. in broad daylight on a Louisiana highway, in front of many people passing back and forth in front of a gas station, that would make this man feel that he was in danger of losing his life. ” Sheriff Normand said that on Thursday night, investigators had only a statement from Mr. Gasser and no corroborating or contradictory statements from witnesses. A key witness did not come forward until Saturday, he said, and officials were still trying to find others. Charging Mr. Gasser Thursday would have compromised the ability to prosecute him. Mr. Gasser did not have a lawyer at the time, he said. “In this state, whether we like it or not, we have a very   ‘stand your ground’   justifiable homicide laws,” he said. “That creates for us an obligation to make sure that we get it right. ” Investigators have conducted crime scene   talked to more witnesses, located videos and interviewed Mr. Gasser again with the benefit of forensic evidence, Sheriff Normand said. “Justice has no time period,” he said. “Justice is not a sprint. It is a marathon. These investigations are marathons. ” Critics have pointed to a similar case from April, when Will Smith, a former defensive end for the New Orleans Saints who was black, was shot and killed after a vehicle collision. In that case, Cardell Hayes, who is black, was arrested at the scene and charged with   murder. He is currently on trial. The sheriff angrily pushed back at the suggestion that race was a factor in Mr. Gasser’s case. When a reporter asked if he understood the concerns of the black community, he cited statistics on “black on black murders” and said that people should not “make this out to be something that it is not. ” “If we’re just going to look statistically, your fear, what you’re trying to articulate right now, is misdirected,” he said. Mr. McKnight dominated high school football in River Ridge, La. a suburb of New Orleans. His speed and versatility at the University of Southern California impressed the New York Jets enough for the team to select him in the fourth round of the 2010 N. F. L. Draft. Mr. McKnight played three years for the Jets. He was released in 2013, playing two more N. F. L. games for the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014. In February, he signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, and most recently played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Mr. McKnight had been in contact with the Minnesota Vikings about a possible N. F. L. comeback and was working at a mental health facility, Jonathan McKnight, his brother, told WGNO, a local TV station. His sister, Johanna McKnight, described him to WDSU as a “family man. ” “We knew our brother touched a lot of people,” she said. “We just want everyone to remember the good that my brother has done, and remember who he was. ” Mr. Gasser is the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, according to The New Orleans Advocate. In February 2006, he was charged with simple battery after a confrontation with another driver that began at the same intersection in Louisiana where Mr. McKnight was shot. A    man had called 911 to report that a man behind the wheel of a red pickup was driving unsafely. The man turned out to be Mr. Gasser, and a “verbal altercation” ensued. Mr. Gasser followed the man to a service station, where Mr. Gasser “confronted him and began to strike him with a closed fist several times,” the police said. The charge was later dismissed.",0

19060,"Never Trump Movement Leader, Former Jeb Bush Staffer Helen Aguirre Ferre Infiltrates White House - Breitbart","A Never Trump movement leader who once blamed   Donald Trump for violent riots in Chicago has miraculously infiltrated President Trump’s White House, Breitbart News has learned. [Helen Aguirre Ferre, now the White House’s Director of Media Relations, previously very publicly —  as an adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s failed 2016 presidential campaign and as a GOP consultant after Bush dropped out of the race —  bashed Trump repeatedly on the campaign trail, leading the Never Trump movement.  Aguirre Ferre’s perhaps most egregious Never Trump comments came via Twitter on March 11, 2016, in a   Tweet in which she said now President Trump “bears responsibility” for violent riots in Chicago that forced him to shut down a campaign event there ahead of the Illinois primary —  which he handily won on March 15, sweeping out many of the other states that day. Then Trump rivals Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) inaccurately suggested that Trump was responsible for the violence in Chicago that caused him to cancel his planned March 11, 2016, campaign rally downtown at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence —  to punch people in the face. The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance,” Cruz said at the time, for instance. But Aguirre Ferre took it a step further on her Twitter account, saying that Cruz and Rubio “agree that” Trump “bears responsibility for violence in Chicago today” on March 11, 2016. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has not answered whether Aguirre Ferre still believes that, or why she deleted that Tweet and many others —  and has not answered a detailed set of questions from Breitbart News on Aguirre Ferre’s history of   and who is responsible for hiring her at the White House in the first place. But Spicer asked a deputy in the White House to ask Breitbart News to delay publication of this article. Breitbart News accommodated the White House, giving Spicer and his team several extra hours to answer the questions sent to them —  including who was responsible for hiring Aguirre Ferre, whether that person who hired her informed the president of these comments she made about him before giving her a senior position in the White House communications office, and whether Aguirre Ferre still believes all these criticisms she made about Trump but has never publicly retracted other than deleting Tweets. Spicer, Breitbart News was told hours after the original scheduled publication of this investigation —   which was delayed at his request —  was supposed to call Breitbart News to answer these questions and others about Aguirre Ferre. But he never called. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, appearing on Breitbart News Daily on Tuesday morning, defended Aguirre Ferre when asked about her demonstrably   positions before joining the administration. Huckabee Sanders said: I think it’s sad that any individual reporter or outlet would try to attack a member of the president’s staff and diminish them maybe based on some of their previous jobs and try to disqualify or discredit them because of that. We’ve got an incredible team here working really hard to carry out the president’s agenda that he laid out during the campaign, that he continues to lay out day in day out here in the White House. And we are all committed to helping move that agenda forward and we are working day and night to do that, and again we’ve got a great team doing that all focused on helping support the president and his agenda.  Aguirre Ferre made many more   comments on Twitter and television, including promoting a Politifact article in late 2015 that accused Donald Trump’s campaign of making “misstatements” that amounted to that publication’s “2015 Lie of the Year. ” She has also questioned whether now Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a U. S. Senator from Alabama, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie “regret supporting Trump” or whether “the means justify the end. ” The answer to such a question, she said in a now deleted Tweet, was “telling either way. ” In February 2016, she said her   Jeb Bush was “clearly  …     in Trump’s head” and accused the   of the United States of “babbling more than usual. ” In September 2015, she praised Jeb Bush for standing up for Carly Fiorina —  another Trump rival —  from Trump’s “insults,” arguing that Fiorina, all women, and the whole country “deserve better” than Donald Trump as president. Aguirre Ferre also once said that President Trump’s campaign style is “not flattering” and that his aggressivness on the campaign trail was “all he’ll ever be. ” Perhaps most damning is the fact that Aguirre Ferre deleted most of these comments from her Twitter account, an action for which she, Spicer, and other White House staff have provided no explanation —  or that it was the   Clinton, George   and David   Media Matters for America (MMfA) organization that took screen shots of them and published them online months ago during the campaign. But those Tweets are not the only places she has made   comments. In April 2016, according to a translation offered by Politico, Aguirre Ferre appeared on Univision’s Al Punto program to bash Donald Trump. That was long after her preferred candidate, Jeb Bush, dropped out of the race. Aguirre Ferre said in Spanish, according to Politico’s translation: There’s a side of Donald Trump that is  . I’m not going to tell you he’s a misogynist   …     but I do think there’s something that bothers him about strong and independent women. In the case of abortion, Donald Trump held every viewpoint possible   …     including supporting   abortion, something even many who are   oppose   …     Donald Trump is trying so hard to win the nomination from conservative voters that he’s trying to say what he thinks the conservative voter wants to hear. And that’s why he ends up messing up, constantly. While Aguirre Ferre did go on to work for   National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus —  now the White House chief of staff —  at the RNC later in the general election cycle, she even made disparaging comments about President Trump during the time after which he became the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. One Tweet was a link to a Washington Examiner story detailing how Trump had issues with winning over Hispanic Republicans, and she commented that Hispanic GOP members were “caught in 2016 meat grinder” with Trump as the   GOP nominee. That Tweet, which was sent on May 10, 2016, came seven days after Trump won the primaries once and for all in Indiana on May 3, 2016. Another Tweet she sent out that day —  a week after Trump became the nominee —  was pushing a poll that argued Trump would “drive Miami Cuban Americans from GOP. A couple days earlier, she Tweeted that the GOP was “neither” Donald Trump’s nor House Speaker Paul Ryan’s party, but that Ryan “represents and lives the values of the Republican Party,” implying that Trump does not. Many people close to the president are shocked someone as   could make it into a senior position in the White House like this. “The sheer contempt for the president shown by staffers like Helen Aguirre Ferre is utterly reprehensible but unsurprising given that the RNC and establishment hacks running the administration have decided to staff this administration as if it were Bush’s third term,” one said. “It is completely and utterly demoralizing to know that Donald Trump didn’t actually beat Jeb Bush after all. ” It is worth noting that most of the   things Aguirre Ferre said appear on her Wikipedia page.",0

19062,Republican Convention Night 4: What You Missed - The New York Times,"Night 4 of the Republican National Convention was Donald J. Trump’s night: He was introduced after a speech by his daughter Ivanka. Mr. Trump’s speech  —   and the balloons that follow his acceptance of the Republican nomination  —   kicked off the final phase in his quest for the presidency. Some of the highlights of the night:  • A taste from our main story on Mr. Trump’s speech (and check out what we   in it): • Ivanka Trump offered a softer, less harsh portrait of her father in a speech introducing him. She said that as a daughter and an employee of the Trump Organization, she “witnessed his empathy and generosity. ” She said Mr. Trump is “  and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period. ” And she pledged that Mr. Trump will fight for “equal pay for equal work,” noting that at Mr. Trump’s company, there are “more female than male executives” and that “when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out. ” Her father, she promised, will be “your greatest, your truest and your most loyal champion. ” _____ • “I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. ” Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist and entrepreneur, took the Republican Party to task over what he called “fake culture wars. ” He recalled that when he was a kid, the great debate was defeating the Soviet Union, but “now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. ” Focusing on these debates, he said, “distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump. ” Fact Check: Among Mr. Thiel’s claims was that “our government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. ” That, in fact, is true, according to a report by the General Accounting Office this year. According to the report: “Department of Defense uses   floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation’s nuclear forces. ” _____ • Jerry Falwell Jr. the evangelical leader of the top Christian university, made both a   and populist case for Mr. Trump, calling him a “  billionaire” who he has known for over 20 years. His evangelical argument for Mr. Trump centered on a plank in the platform to repeal a tax law banning churches from political organizing, as well as a pledge to appoint “conservative,   justices” to the Supreme Court. And he included perhaps a thinly veiled message to Senator Ted Cruz, who spoke last night and declined to endorse Mr. Trump: “If you are a conservative, a decision not to vote or to vote for a third candidate is a de facto vote for Hillary Clinton. ” _____ • With the playful tone of a wedding toast, Tom Barrack, a billionaire businessman and longtime friend of Mr. Trump, used most of his speech to share stories and memories. He told the crowd that he had “nothing negative to say about Hillary” and “only amazing things to tell you about Donald. ” His personal anecdotes revealed a    unseen side of the Mr. Trump that few other speakers touched on during the convention. _____ • Joe Arpaio’s support for Mr. Trump might be boiled down to this: You had me at illegal immigrant. Mr. Arpaio is the Arizona sheriff who became famous for his aggressive,   tactics in that state. And Mr. Trump started his campaign more than a year ago by focusing on the danger that illegal immigrants pose to Americans. On Thursday, Mr. Arpaio said his experience at the border convinced him that “we have terrorists coming over our borders, infiltrating our communities and causing massive destruction and mayhem. ” He said Mr. Trump was the only candidate willing to confront that issue. _____ • Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee struck a mostly optimistic note amid remarks that focused on problems. She proclaimed that electing Mr. Trump would return the country to greatness and spoke broadly about Mr. Trump’s leadership qualities and record as a businessman who “has seen challenges” and “learned his lessons. ” And with a turn of phrase, linked his real estate successes to the potential of a Trump presidency: “Not only can they change a skyline, they can change the world. ” _____ • Mary Fallin, the governor of Oklahoma,   the pattern of pessimism, but she said that Mr. Trump is the one to provide optimism  —   even if some Republicans might not agree with everything he says. “As Ronald Reagan said, ‘the person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and ally,’ ” she said. • Reince Preibus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, hammered Mrs. Clinton for a lack of personal and professional ethics. She “lied over and over and over and over” about her email server, he said. “Perhaps worst of all, Hillary Clinton has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. She reads ethics rules as carefully as Americans read their junk mail. ” He accused Mrs. Clinton of using her position as secretary of state to “grease the wheels for Democrat lobbyists, special interests and political insiders connected to the corrupt Clinton machine. ” With Mr. Trump, he said, “help is coming. ”",0

19066,Bellwether? Trump kippas outselling Hillary yarmulkes,"Bellwether? Trump kippas outselling Hillary yarmulkes Company sees preference as 'early exit poll of Orthodox Jews' Published: 24 mins ago Print 
WASHINGTON – The campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the White House in January. 
A company that makes Trump and Hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls – Trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the Orthodox Jewish clientele. 
So far, the company, Pic-A-Kippa, has sold 331 Trump yarmulkes to 65 for Clinton. 
“My kippa (yarmulke) company sells Trump and Hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more,” Uri Turk, founder and “chief kippa officer,” told WND. “We see it as an early exit poll of the Orthodox Jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. Once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the Trump kippas.” 
Pic-A-Kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret IDF soldiers from Miami. Turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling Trump and Hillary custom kippas on its site since August, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
“Our mission is to help Jews everywhere show and wear their Jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas,” the company says on its website. 
It donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the Lone Soldier Center in Israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
Turk said while American Jews have leaned heavily Democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen Orthodox Jews, who make up over 10 percent of American Jewry, vote Republican in ever increasing numbers. He attributes that fact to the Democrats putting “daylight between America and Israel.” 
A number of influential Jewish pro-Trump organizations have emerged, chief among them “Jews Choose Trump” and “Jewish Democrats For Trump.” A recent poll of Florida Jews showed Orthodox voters are leaning toward Trump by a 3-1 margin. 
According to Turk, Pic-A-Kippa has sold many Trump kippas to a congregant of Ivanka Trump’s synagogue on the liberal Upper East Side of Manhattan and has gotten orders for Trump kippas from Israel, Australia, Britain and even Mexico. Pic-A-Kippa has also gotten hate mail from Jews unhappy they are selling the Trump designs, he says.",0
19067,Clash Between Philippine Forces and Abu Sayyaf Leaves 9 Dead - The New York Times,"MANILA  —   Philippine soldiers clashed Tuesday with members of a militant group known for beheading foreign hostages, leaving five rebels and four members of the security forces dead at a popular tourist destination in the central Philippines, the police and military said. Soldiers and the provincial police clashed with rebels on the island of Bohol, about 400 miles south of Manila, after spotting 10 armed members of Abu Sayyaf on three boats, the military said in a statement. The firefight came a day after the American and Australian Embassies warned their citizens against traveling to areas in the central Philippine region of Visayas, particularly the islands of Cebu and Bohol. They said they had received “unsubstantiated yet credible information that terrorist groups may attempt to conduct kidnapping. ” The embassies did not identify the source of the information, nor did they cite Abu Sayyaf, a small group of Islamic militants that once was an affiliate of Al Qaeda but that has since pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, according to Philippine intelligence officials. Col. Edgard Arevalo, a spokesman for the armed forces, said the troops cornered the militants in an isolated section of the coastal town of Inabanga, prompting the clashes. The rebels, who were heavily armed, he said, were “believed to be” members of Abu Sayyaf. “As of this time, five were killed on the enemy side,” Colonel Arevalo said, adding that troops had recovered four firearms and a homemade bomb from the militants. He said three soldiers and one police officer also died. Numbering around 400, Abu Sayyaf is known for abducting foreign and local tourists for ransoms. In 2004, the militants bombed a passenger ferry off Manila Bay, killing more than 100 people in the country’s worst terrorist attack. In February, the group beheaded Jürgen Kantner, 70, a yachtsman from Germany, after his government did not pay a $600, 000 ransom. They did so after seizing his boat in November as he and his partner, a woman who was reportedly fatally shot, sailed in southern Philippine waters. Last year, Abu Sayyaf beheaded two Canadian hostages they had seized from a beach resort on Samal Island, also in the south. The group operates in mostly poor areas on the southern islands of Basilan and Sulu. Despite its small size, it has rebuffed countless military offensives and remains a serious threat. Rommel Banlaoi, the director of the Center for Intelligence and National Security Studies, based in Manila, said Abu Sayyaf had survived by working with other criminal groups around the archipelago. “It remains highly capable, because it has followers in Visayas,” he said. “The core of the Abu Sayyaf group remains small, but its network with criminal groups nationwide is huge, established through arms smuggling and money laundering. ” He said intelligence data indicated that the militants had established terrorist cells in the central Philippines, with its overall commander, Alhabsi Misaya, known to have followers in Bohol. A suspect in the bombing of a night market in the southern city of Davao last year that killed 15 people was also an Abu Sayyaf associate who once worked in the central Philippines.",0
19068,Should Athletes Stick to Sports? - The New York Times,"For the past few months, the sports media has been embroiled in a fight over “stick to sports. ” The phrase comes from a common online rebuke directed at sportswriters and pundits and players and coaches and anyone in the world of sports, really, who takes a political stance on anything that doesn’t occur on a field or a court or in a locker room or front office. The dividing line is predictable: Many jocks and traditionalists argue for a separation of church and state many young fans say that sports, just like everything else, is politics. But as the sports media critic Bryan Curtis has pointed out in The Ringer, the debate is mostly moot now: Trump’s presidency, with its daily explosions, has made it impossible to cover pro sports, even in the simplest   ways, without detouring onto the White House lawn. This comes, in part, from the way basic sports coverage works. Reporters ask questions before and after every game, and when the only thing anyone wants to talk about is Trump, some of those questions will be about the president. In the past, a paradoxical yet symbiotic relationship generally characterized whatever relationship existed between sports and politics. The big American leagues, especially the N. F. L. and Major League Baseball, gave every indication of wanting to distance themselves from partisan frictions. They typically prefer to honor troops, fly fighter jets over stadiums and hold moments of silence to honor the victims of tragedies. When they tackle overtly political issues, it’s through selective editing and legacy building. The settled politics of the past, where details can be kept few and the tone nostalgic, are fine. We know, for example, that Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color line, stole home and wore 42 on his back. Muhammad Ali championed equality and said some funny stuff to Howard Cosell. Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs. Their lionization reassures us that the stands they took were good  —   and can now be consigned to bygone eras. But the latest intrusion of political talk into sports  —   whether you deem it excessive or welcome  —   has had a drastic effect on coverage. It has brought with it a currency and immediacy that we haven’t seen since the ’60s and early ’70s, when athletes like Jim Brown, Kareem   and Curt Flood openly talked about civil rights. The day the White House declared its immigration and travel ban in January, the Milwaukee Bucks played the Toronto Raptors in Canada, and there was some concern that the Bucks’ rookie center, Thon Maker, would not be let back into the United States after the game: Maker is a citizen of Australia, but his family emigrated there from Sudan. The day after the game, Alex Lasry, a Bucks executive and the son of one of the team’s owners, tweeted: “I appreciate all the fans’ concerns and prayers for Thon. And today a Sudanese refugee who fled oppression and is an incredible young man will make his second N. B. A. start. I’m incredibly excited and proud of him. He’s a symbol of what makes America great and all immigrants believe about America. ” Maker was directly affected by Trump’s policies (though he   the United States without problem) and his teammates, fellow players and coaches in the N. B. A. publicized their support. This was not surprising, given the N. B. A. ’s wealth of international players and its cosmopolitan fan base in recent years, the league has encouraged its stars to speak out on matters important to them. More unexpected was the Super Bowl’s inability to avoid the fray. During this year’s   media day, usually a hollow parading of the players before the microphones and cameras, Tom Brady’s continued refusal to talk about his presidential friend was big news. Brady had been ignoring these questions for almost a year and a half now, ever since reporters saw a red “Make America Great Again” hat in his locker, but he finally gave in. All he could muster was: “What’s going on in the world? I haven’t paid much attention. I’m just a positive person. ” Brady’s   elisions were hardly surprising  —   he, perhaps more than any athlete since Tiger Woods, has doggedly confronted us with his right to never publicly say anything interesting to anyone. But the fact that his act hasn’t quite kept the inquisitors at bay suggests that the days of Woods, Derek Jeter and Michael Jordan just grinning through any edgy conversation are over, at least for now. Athletes, especially famous ones, are less likely to be left to stand alone as ciphers of sporting excellence. Their images will be shaded by their politics, even if these have to be assigned to them. And as players continue to be asked about their political beliefs by reporters  —   especially as the international players in basketball and baseball are prompted to talk about immigration  —   they have an opportunity to give voice to resistance. If they want a model, they should look toward the W. N. B. A. whose players have been exemplifying thoughtful political expression. Last summer, the W. N. B. A. fined several players for wearing black   in support of Black Lives Matter at pregame practices following the next game after the fine was announced, some players refused to discuss basketball, instead using the postgame news conference to talk about police shootings. (The W. N. B. A. rescinded the fines soon after.) Last month, Breanna Stewart, the league’s reigning Rookie of the Year, attended the airport protest at LAX. Stephen Curry, arguably the world’s most popular basketball player, may be following the W. N. B. A. lead. After the chief executive of Under Armour recently referred to Trump as a “great asset” for the country, Curry, whose endorsement deal with the company runs through 2024, said, “There is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off, if it wasn’t in line with who I am. ” Perhaps more than any other N. B. A. star lately, Curry has tended to project a charming blandness, but in putting his sponsorships and money at risk  —   however improbable the prospect of his losing any  —   he went further than most outspoken athletes. In the week following the Super Bowl, at least six Patriots players  —   including Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty, who earlier in the season raised fists in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick’s   protest  —   said they would not make the traditional victory visit to the White House. (Brady went to Washington after his first three championships, when George W. Bush was president, but skipped the fourth trip during the Obama presidency.) “I was a black man yesterday, and I’m going to be a black man tomorrow,” Bennett tweeted in response to the predictable storm his announcement kicked up from the “stick to sports” crowd. “My wife and daughter are women today and will be women tomorrow. ” The Patriots absent from the White House photo op will be the most conspicuous part of what usually is a goofy, perfunctory moment in the N. F. L. ’s   and reporters will reach out to them for comment, which will provide another occasion for criticism. Those athletes who do speak out might find a curiously receptive ear in the White House. Let’s remember that Trump, perhaps even more than his   predecessor, is a sports fan. He owned a team in the United States Football League (while almost   running the league into the ground) he hosted fights at his Atlantic City casinos he tried to buy the Buffalo Bills he brags about his friendship with Brady. Above all, he has shown a crippling sensitivity to the opinions of his fellow celebrities. Professional sports usually provides a poor, inaccurate reflection of politics, but sometimes elements of that imagery  —   the machismo, the posturing, the adoration of stars  —   align exactly. Jocks, if nothing else, know how to get the president’s attention.",0
19069,"In the Clear, Phil Mickelson Can Thank an Insider Trading Ruling - The New York Times","Phil Mickelson, meet Todd Newman. It’s unlikely that the famous golfer knows the former portfolio manager for Diamondback Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Stamford, Conn. that went out of business in 2013. But Mickelson ought to consider reaching out to thank him. Newman is quite likely a key reason Mickelson was not charged Thursday with insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Newman and another hedge fund manager, Anthony Chiasson, were indicted in 2012 on insider trading charges by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. (The S. E. C. also brought civil charges.) Newman was accused of regularly receiving information about two stocks  —   Dell, the computer company, and Nvidia, a chip maker  —   from company insiders, allowing him to make what amounted to illegal trades. When Newman was convicted of the charges in December 2012, he appeared to be just another Wall Street scalp for federal prosecutors, part of their aggressive, continuing effort to crack down on insider trading. In all, some 71 people had either pleaded guilty or been convicted of insider trading by Bharara’s office by the time Newman was found guilty. (Chiasson was also convicted.) But then something strange happened  —   or at least it seemed strange to those who had assumed that Bharara and the S. E. C. would continue to rack up insider trading convictions. In 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned Newman’s conviction (and Chiasson’s too) and tossed the original indictments. In effect, the appeals court ruled that Newman had not been guilty of insider trading. Why? Because, the court said, for a crime to have been committed, the company insider  —   the   tipper  —   had to have received a personal benefit in return for offering up inside information. In addition, the person who received the tip  —   the “tippee”  —   had to know that the tipper was receiving that personal benefit. By all appearances, Newman didn’t even know who the tippers were the information got to him through a series of intermediaries, the last of whom was an analyst at Diamondback. Without that knowledge of a personal benefit, Newman had not committed a crime. Critics of the appeals court’s Newman decision, including Bharara, say that the judges essentially redefined what constituted insider trading, making it much more difficult to bring cases even when it is obvious that wrongful behavior has taken place. Defenders, including many lawyers in the   defense bar, say the court was simply reiterating the law as the Supreme Court had always intended it to be, and was finally reining in overly aggressive prosecutions by Bharara. Whichever the case, the Newman decision sent an unmistakable message: “It told prosecutors they had to be cautious,” said Peter J. Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University who writes the White Collar Watch column for DealBook in The New York Times. “It has had a chilling effect. ” With that context, let’s take a closer look at what the government said about Phil Mickelson’s behavior when it announced its indictment of his friend William T. Walters, a Las Vegas businessman and successful sports gambler. The facts, as laid out by the S. E. C. are not pretty. (Mickelson is not mentioned in the indictment, only in the S. E. C. ’s civil charges against Walters.) Walters, the government said, had been trading for years on insider information provided by Thomas C. Davis, a retired investment banker who was the chairman of Dean Foods. For a number of months in the spring and summer of 2012, Davis had been engaged in confidential Dean Foods board discussions about spinning off its organic food subsidiary, WhiteWave, a move Wall Street was encouraging. Davis  —   who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government  —   had kept Walters informed about the discussions, and Walters had loaded up on the stock in anticipation of the spinoff. At the time, Mickelson owed Walters gambling debts. Although he was a serious gambler, Mickelson was not a big stock trader, with only about $250, 000 in the market, according to the S. E. C. Yet on July 30 and 31, 2012, after a series of phone calls and texts with Walters, Mickelson bought $2. 4 million worth of Dean Foods stock  —   some of it with money he borrowed. “These were his first ever Dean Foods purchases,” the S. E. C. noted. You know, of course, what happened next: A week later, Dean Foods announced the WhiteWave spinoff. The stock jumped 40 percent. The very next day, Mickelson sold his Dean Foods stock, reaping a profit of $931, 000. The case against Walters, as outlined by the S. E. C. and the United States attorney’s office, appears to be strong. In all, the government says, the inside information Walters got from Davis was worth $40 million. The government goes out of its way to play up the personal benefit Davis received in return. An inveterate gambler trying to keep up an unsustainable lifestyle, he owed money to the I. R. S. and others, including Walters. More than once, Walters bailed him out by either lending him money or arranging for a loan. The loans totaled nearly $2 million. It is also clear that Walters, who is alleged to have tipped off Mickelson in turn, got a benefit from his tippee. According to the S. E. C. Mickelson used some of his Dean Foods profits to pay back his gambling debt to Walters. But did Mickelson know about the personal benefit the original tipper, Davis, was receiving? I know it sounds a little strange, but that really is the key legal question in the wake of the Newman decision. If he didn’t know that Davis was receiving a personal benefit in return for giving inside information to Walters, he’s off the hook. (A quick aside: According to Forbes, Mickelson has reaped around $500 million in career earnings, and gets some $50 million a year in endorsement income. The fact that he was trading in Dean Foods to repay a debt to Walters surely raises questions about Mickelson’s financial   well apart from whether he traded on inside information.) In its complaint against Walters, the S. E. C. seems to have highlighted Mickelson’s involvement in the case. But ultimately, it merely named him a “relief defendant,” meaning that all he had to do was return the money he had made from the Dean Foods trade, plus interest. He readily agreed. (The total is about $1. 03 million.) A spokesman for Mickelson issued a statement Thursday in which he said that Mickelson didn’t want to “benefit from any transaction that the S. E. C. sees as questionable. ” He added that Mickelson regretted any “appearance” that he had fallen short of “the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and Phil himself. ” That should do the trick: Several of the companies Mickelson endorses have already said they’ll stick with him. For Mickelson, this too shall pass  —   and probably pretty quickly. Still, given the set of facts laid out by the government, it’s a little hard to believe that he didn’t know what he was doing. The government won’t explicitly say the Newman case caused the government to back away from bringing charges against Mickelson. But at his news conference on Thursday, after declining to comment on that very question, Bharara did say this: “Conduct we think is nefarious, and undermines faith in the market and the fairness of the markets, will not be able to be prosecuted because of the Newman decision. ” On Thursday, Phil Mickelson became Exhibit A.",0
19070,"Leonard B. Sand, Judge in Landmark Yonkers Segregation Case, Dies at 88 - The New York Times","Leonard B. Sand, a federal judge in New York who presided over a   landmark case in which he found that city officials in Yonkers had intentionally segregated public housing and schools along racial lines, died on Saturday at his home in Sleepy Hollow, N. Y. He was 88. His death was confirmed by his son David. The Yonkers case, which received national attention, was hardly the only lawsuit in which local governments in the Northeast had been charged with racial discrimination, but it was one of the most bitterly contested. The charges against Yonkers were brought in a lawsuit that the Justice Department filed in 1980 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The case was assigned to Judge Sand, who had joined the court two years earlier. Though Judge Sand presided over other prominent cases in his long judicial tenure, including terrorism and financial fraud cases, the marathon Yonkers litigation loomed largest in defining his public image. Or images. Some applauded him as rightly following precedents when, in 1986, he ordered that the city remedy the housing portion of its violations by adopting a plan for building up to 1, 000 units of   and   housing in predominantly white neighborhoods. They praised him again when he imposed potentially bankrupting fines on Yonkers to overcome its City Council’s repeated defiance of his mandated remedy. One coalition of civil rights and religious groups cited “his courageous effort to enforce the rule of law in Yonkers. ” Critics, however, viewed him as engaging in “social engineering,” and some called him a “judicial tyrant. ” Yonkers officials, who denied they were responsible for the segregation, denounced the judge, as did many white residents, some of whom picketed his weekend home in northern Westchester County. The clash of wills was dramatized last year in the HBO   “Show Me a Hero,” based on the book of the same title by Lisa Belkin, a former reporter for The New York Times. Bob Balaban portrayed Judge Sand. Judge Sand, who had a reputation as   and patient on the bench, said in an interview with The Times in 1988: “I like to think I have a reasonable perspective on what a judge’s role is in our society. I don’t let it get under my skin. I have a job to do. I think I know what that job is. I find my work satisfying. ” He had been in private law practice in New York City for nearly 20 years when President Jimmy Carter nominated him for the federal court in Manhattan in 1978. After the Justice Department filed its lawsuit against Yonkers  —   the N. A. A. C. P. joined as a plaintiff later  —   the judge tried over the next three and a half years to get the parties to reach a settlement, but the effort failed. After conducting a trial, he ruled in 1985 that “the extreme concentration of subsidized housing that exists in southwest Yonkers today is the result of a pattern and practice of racial discrimination by city officials, pursued in response to constituent pressures to select or support only sites that would preserve existing patterns of racial segregation. ” That pattern, he said, had contributed over three decades to the 1980 census finding that 80 percent of the city’s   population lived in southwest Yonkers. And, he said, it contributed to a segregated school system in which minority students attended “generally inferior facilities” that provided a lesser “quality of educational opportunity. ” The school desegregation program he ordered, including academically enriched magnet schools and busing, was quickly put into effect. But his housing order was fought for two years by what he called “obstructive and dilatory tactics,” and in August 1988 he imposed the fines: $100 the first day, doubling each subsequent day. Within a month they would total more than the city’s annual budget, $337 million. An appeals court capped the fines at $1 million a day, but they would still be crippling, and in September the City Council voted to accept the order when two of the defiant Council members reversed their previous votes. But with further litigation over financing and sites, the last of the required housing was not completed  —   and the case not concluded  —   until 2007. Other widely noted decisions by Judge Sand included a 1990 ruling that overturned a ban on panhandling in the New York City subway system. It was the first time a federal court found that panhandling was a   right protected by the First Amendment. “A true test of one’s commitment to constitutional principles is the extent to which recognition is given to the rights of those in our midst who are the least affluent, least powerful and least welcome,” Judge Sand wrote. Though Judge Sand said the begging could be restricted by keeping it out of the subway cars, an appeals court reversed his ruling and kept the systemwide ban intact. Judge Sand was one of the authors of “Modern Federal Jury Instructions,” which since its publication three decades ago has become a leading treatise in federal courts on what judges should tell juries about the law before they begin to deliberate. Leonard Burke Solomon was born in the Bronx on May 24, 1928. His father, Frank Solomon, was a textile manufacturer, and his mother, the former Dora Sado, was involved in the business. He changed his name to Sand as a young man. He graduated from New York University and, in 1951, from Harvard Law School. In 1952 he was a clerk to Judge Irving R. Kaufman, who gained national attention a year earlier when he sentenced Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to the electric chair. In the 1950s Mr. Sand was an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan and an assistant to the United States solicitor general. In 1955, he married Ann Sulzberger, a first cousin of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the former publisher of The Times. Besides his son David, his immediate survivors include his wife another son, Robert a daughter, Peggy Sand and six grandchildren. Perhaps Judge Sand’s most prominent criminal trial was that in 2001 of four terrorists who were convicted of conspiring in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, which killed 224 people. Two defendants then faced a death penalty hearing, which resulted in life sentences after the jury could not agree on imposing a death sentence. Daniel L. Stein, a former law clerk to Judge Sand, said the judge recalled years later that in a special verdict form, some jurors noted that the terrorists “were suicide bombers, so why give them what they want?” Mr. Stein said Judge Sand told him: “Juries get it right. There’s a lot of wisdom in a   jury. ”",0
19071,The key concerns of Russian foreign policy heading into 2017,"The key concerns of Russian foreign policy heading into 2017 RD Interview: Chatham House expert James Sherr explains how a variety of global crises, particularly in the Middle East and Ukraine, are impacting Russian foreign policy RD Interview: Chatham House expert James Sherr explains how a variety of global crises, particularly in the Middle East and Ukraine, are impacting Russian foreign policy. One big variable to consider: the results of elections in the U.S., France and Germany. 

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Athens, on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. Photo: AP 
Major international actors are currently preoccupied with all kinds of regional crises: crises in the Middle East – including Syria , Iraq, Yemen and Libya, the rise of radical extremism, the refugee crisis , the crisis of European integration after Brexit and the rise of right-wing political parties in Europe. Moreover, the situation is exacerbated by the ongoing tensions between Russia and the West, which could take on a new dimension after elections in the U.S., France and Germany.
With that in mind, Russia Direct talked with James Sherr , an associate fellow and former head ;of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), about the possibilities for a change in Europe’s Russia policy, the prospects of the Minsk agreements and Russia’s aims in Syria.
RD: Given the crisis in the European Union, which is considered the most serious since its very beginning, how do you assess the prospects for the rise of a more independent foreign policy decision-making process within the European Union? How could a potential change of the political elites, keeping in mind elections in France and Germany, affect Europe’s Russia policy? James Sherr: Against the backdrop of uncertainty, the only thing we can say with confidence is that we should not be complacent that things will remain the same. If either Marine le Pen or, more probably, Nicolas Sarkozy becomes president of France, there will be extremely strong pressure, at least in France, to move in a different direction vis-à-vis Russia.
Also read: "" The crisis of European identity and rapprochement with Russia "" Nevertheless, there is a contradictory factor. Russia, in my view, is today under strong pressure to realize its objectives in Syria and the humanitarian consequences of this are already inflaming European opinion against Russia. So if you factor this in with the other variables, it would be far too optimistic for the Russians to conclude that the sanctions regime will diminish.
Look at the example of France, where President Francois Hollande a few months ago was saying that Europe should think about how to diminish sanctions, and now he is talking about increasing them. Well, I do not think they will increase, but I think it is unrealistic to assume that sanctions are going to be reduced either.
RD: What we should expect in terms of the Western policy towards Russia? 
So, it is really very uncertain, but broadly speaking, many of these developments like Brexit, like the migration crisis, the evident discontent of a leader like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, make Russia more comfortable. However, this is not time to be dizzied with success. There is no basis for that.
RD: After the recent Normandy Format meeting in Berlin, is there any hope for some positive developments of the Minsk agreements? Do you believe Germany and France will increase their pressure on Kiev in order to implement their part of the agreement? J.S.: In my view, and I believe this is also the view of Kiev, Russia’s aim is not to preserve a frozen conflict – it is to use the warlords [in Eastern Ukraine] as a vehicle, a means to neutralize Ukraine with Western consent . All of the demands of the warlords, and informally those of the Russian leadership, concerning “special status” stipulate first of all absolute autonomy for these regions, something that exists in no federal state in the world.
But secondly, and even more controversially, they stipulate a right of this entity, which is four percent of Ukraine’s territory, to exert a right of veto over Ukraine’s foreign and defense policy. And this is all has been stated explicitly and it’s been reinforced in discussions on a very high level. This is absolutely unacceptable in Kiev.
RD: What about Germany and France? What is their stance on that? J.S.: Berlin and Paris are not yet ready to accept it, so they keep looking for a compromise, they keep hoping that if Ukraine compromises, the other side (the rebels in Eastern Ukraine – Editor’s note) will compromise, but I see no evidence of this and from my perspective, they don’t have any reason to do that because the West keeps putting pressure on Kiev to make compromises. So, this leads to what I think is one very dangerous possibility for Ukraine and the West, though it is very encouraging for Russia.
If Ukrainian President Poroshenko is put under pressure by the Ukrainian Parliament, and he insists on legislation that would be harmful to Ukraine’s national interests, the Parliament will reject it. The president will then have to exercise his financial or administrative resources to try to deal with this. He might do that successfully or not: if he does it successfully, then the street will revolt. In my view, this is exactly what Moscow wants to happen.
The problem is that in Europe there is not enough clarity about this situation and the West can blunder into a situation with an endangered Poroshenko regime. They do not want to do that, but after this recent Normandy meeting in Berlin , the risk of such a sequence of errors is more likely than it was before.
And therefore, I would predict the Ukrainians would do everything that is necessary to stall, resist, divert until they can talk to a new set of players in Washington after the November presidential election .
So, the Normandy Format meeting has not solved anything, it is not going to solve anything, it is an awkward bump on the road. It is going to continue until facts are created that no party can question anymore.
RD: Many experts say that one of Russia’s major goals in Syria is to divert attention from Ukraine in order to compel the West to cooperate and thus to prove that Russia is an inevitable partner, which the West has to deal with. So, do you think that it is legitimate to say so and did Russia achieve its goals in Syria? J.S.: Russia today is not only militarily but intellectually a very capable state, a very serious opponent . A great power like Russia never does something as significant as this for only one reason.
So, the strongest motivation for Russia to deploy its forces to Syria in the fall of 2015 is to recognize the Assad regime and to preserve it and preserve it on Russian terms, which means preserve it in a “usable” Syria. Russia is not interested in whether or not Syrian President Bashar al-Assad re-establishes control over all of Syria. What they want is a “usable” Syria, which means the Alawites areas, the Western areas on the coast – areas where Russia’s air base and naval facility are located and so on. This is one reason.
Also read: "" The rivalry between Moscow and Washington for the right to defeat ISIS "" The second is to enjoy regional dividends. The expenses do not break Russia, but if it goes on for five more years then you can talk about it. The U.S. Obama Administration created the power vacuum in the Middle East and this was for many reasons. They came into office and said the Middle East would be less important. In 2012 they decided on the “pivot to Asia,” there are all sorts of new priorities. So, Russia is enjoying now increased authority in the region, including tangible results in Turkey . This is the second.
The third is to show the West that there is no global question Russia is interested in that can’t be solved without Russia and without Russia’s opinion being accepted. In other words, there is no solution to any international problem that will be legitimate or workable without Russia’s participation.
And the fourth factor is to divert the West’s attention from everything that is going on in Europe . And that’s it.
So, this are four factors there. They each reinforce the other but again, the certain paradox is that, the more Russia does to accomplish its aims in Syria, the bigger the humanitarian consequences, the more Russia’s image suffers in the West, the more pressure there is for sanctions for tough policy and everything else. So, it does not all mesh perfectly.
But this is a very well thought-through, powerful policy which I think in the short-to mid-term is likely to succeed, but not over the long-term. This is because the fundamental factor is that Syria is a country where 60-65 percent of its population is Sunni and it’s true that the Sunni elites are in a sense part of the state’s structure, but others are not; this insurgency is very strong and even after Aleppo, the insurgency is going to remain very strong. I don’t think it will go away.",0
19072,Donald Trump Sends Executive Order Lawsuit to Higher Court - Breitbart,"The Department of Justice is formally objecting to the March 15 claim by a District Court judge in Maryland that President Donald Trump’s violated the religious freedom clauses of the constitution with his March 6 Executive Order on immigration reform. [The objection goes to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose   panel includes ten judges nominated by Democratic presidents and only five nominated by GOP presidents. It will likely be sent to the Supreme Court later this year.  “President Trump’s Muslim ban has fared miserably in the courts, and for good reason  —   it violates fundamental provisions of our Constitution,” said a response from the plaintiff’s lawyer, Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “We look forward to defending this careful and   decision in the appeals court. ” The Maryland decision targeted Trump’s March 6 E. O. 13780, titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. ” Much of the judge’s   decision is a complaint about the President’s political statements and promised policies, for which he was elected to implement. The judge declares: [Plaintiff] John Doe No. 1 has stated that the travel ban has “created significant fear, anxiety, and insecurity” for him and his wife and that the “  views” underlying the Executive Orders have caused him “significant stress and anxiety” to the point that he “worr( ies] that I may not be safe in this country. ”   …     John Doe NO. 3 has stated that the “  attitudes that are driving” the Executive Orders cause him “stress and anxiety” and lead him to “question whether I even belong in this country. ” The judge developed his claim that Trump’s policy is an illicit restraint on the religious freedom of Muslims in the United States to get visas for their foreign  . “Plaintiffs, comprised of six individuals and three organizations, assert that they will be harmed by the implementation of the Second Executive Order. Collectively, they assert that because the Individual Plaintiffs are Muslim and the Organizational Plaintiffs serve or represent Muslim clients or members, the   animus underlying the Second Executive Order inflicts stigmatizing injuries on them all. The Individual Plaintiffs, who each have one or more relatives who are nationals of one of the Designated Countries and are currently in the process of seeking permission to enter the United States, also claim that if the Second Executive Order is allowed to go into effect, their separation from their loved ones, many of whom live in dangerous conditions, will be unnecessarily prolonged   …     The judge cited Trump’s campaign promise, plus cited leaks from the Department of Homeland Security, and claims from officials who were in former President Barack Obama’s administration, to justify his claim that: In this highly unique case, the record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban  …     even if the Second Executive Order has a national security purpose, it is likely that its primary purpose remains the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban. Accordingly, there is a likelihood that the travel ban violates the Establishment Clause. The judge also revealed his proposal to reverse Trump’s reduction of refugee inflow, via a footnote in his March 15 decision where he denounced Trump’s reformist Executive Orders. Trump’s E. O. cited Section 212( f) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, which gives the President   power over who gets into the United States, according to a January 2017 report by Congress’ Congressional Research Service. The critical language declares, at 8 U. S. C. § 1182 (f)  that: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate, Federal law also allows the president to exclude   threats, including communists and people who wish to overthrow the U. S. Constitution. For example, 212( f) section of the law says the president and his deputies can exclude: Read the decision here.  ",0
19073,Want Proof of Voter Fraud? Look at What’s Happening in Chicago…,"Voter fraud is all too real — particularly so in Chicago, Illinois, where it seems dead Americans have been voting for decades. 
How many dead Americans? A lot. 
In fact, an investigation by local news station WBBM showed that “119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade.” 
Here are just a few examples: Susan Sallee, who died in 1998 but voted in 2010 … Victor Crosswell, who died in 1994 but has voted six times since his death … Floyd Stevens, who died in 1993 but has voted 11 times since his death … Earl Smith, who died in 1997 but has voted twice since his death … Tadeusz Cielsa, who died in 1998 yet managed to somehow cast a ballot in 2010 … 
Who the heck is going to vote next, huh — Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, JESUS!? 
This sort of voter fraud exists because state governments refuse to do their due diligence and remove deceased voters from their records. Susan Sallee’s son would know. He claimed that despite having reported his mother’s death numerous times, she still remains on the voter roll. 
“They’re just not taking her off the rolls,” he said. 
Wonderful … 
Obviously, 119 dead Americans voting 229 times seems like a small number, correct? Multiply that by 35,000 cities and towns, as estimated by The National Map , and suddenly those 119 Americans and 229 votes transform into 4.165 million Americans and 8.015 million votes. 
See the problem? 
Of course, the easiest way to remedy this dilemma would be to simply implement voter ID laws across the board, thus making it nearly impossible for cheaters and frauds to cast ballots on behalf of deceased Americans. 
Unless the fraudsters were to look identical to the dead individuals whose identities they desire to co-opt, they would simply be out of luck. Case closed. 
Except that liberals keep fighting voter ID laws tooth and nail, trying their hardest to prevent such laws from taking hold across the nation. 
Why? Because they refuse to even acknowledge the existence of voter fraud, claiming instead that it “is very rare” and “nearly non-existent,” in the words of the liberal Brennan Center for Justice . 
Just like with every other issue that divides Republicans and Democrats, the left refuses to recognize the facts, which are that voter fraud is real, and voter ID laws represent a reasonable solution to this problem. 
Even worse, they have taken to outputting phony arguments such as this: “Voter ID laws are racist!”

19074,Life Span of South Korean Women Is Headed Toward 90 - The New York Times,"Life spans in the world’s wealthiest countries will continue to increase in the future, and women in South Korea may be the first to live longer than 90 years on average, a new study has found. The study  —   a mathematical model blending 21 other forecasts and published in The Lancet  —   gave South Korean women born in 2030 a 57 percent chance of hitting the   longevity mark. The surest bet was that they would exceed age 86 on average. Compared with women from 34 other industrialized nations the study assessed, South Korean women generally smoke less, weigh less, have lower blood pressure and see doctors more often because most have health insurance. Women in France, Japan and Spain also were expected to live longer. Currently Japanese women live the longest, but their progress will probably stagnate, the study said. South Korea also led the list for longevity in men, followed by Australia, Switzerland, Canada and the Netherlands men from all of those countries were expected to live beyond 80 on average. The United States, as usual, fared badly. American men and women are in 23rd and 27th place, respectively, in terms of life expectancy, and they were expected to fall farther as other countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, improve. Although the United States has advanced medicine, it has an obesity epidemic, little focus on preventive care, relatively high mortality among babies of uninsured mothers, and high male death rates from gunshot wounds and car accidents. American men live on average about as long as men in Slovenia and Portugal, and average longevity in other countries, including South Korea, the Czech Republic and Hungary, is improving faster. The model assumes that current trends will continue. History often invalidates that assumption, however, because health is tied to political events. Longevity in Africa rose rapidly in the 1950s and ’60s with the spread of antibiotics and vaccines, flattened as the collapse of colonialism bankrupted health care systems, plummeted in the 1990s with the spread of AIDS, and is now rising again as donors pay for AIDS drugs. Among wealthier nations, progress in Eastern Europe followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. South Korea’s projected gains would most likely be seriously compromised if the current tensions with North Korea were to lead to war.",0

(It) hit at 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) between Perugia and Macerata, according to ANSA. The second quake -- with a magnitude of 6.1 -- was 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) north of Visso and 58 km (36 miles) from Perugia, the USGS reported. The depth of both is 10 km.

19076,Russia's top economic minister faces criminal charges for bribe solicitation,"Russia's top economic minister faces criminal charges for bribe solicitation Russia’s high-profile Economic Development Minister, Alexei Ulyukaev, has been arrested on corruption charges. Who or what is behind this new anti-corruption probe? Russia’s high-profile Economic Development Minister, Alexei Ulyukaev, has been arrested on corruption charges. Who or what is behind this new anti-corruption probe?

The surprising detention of Russia’s Economic Development Minister, Alexei Ulyukaev, on corruption charges comes as yet another sign of sweeping changes within the Kremlin’s inner circle . Recent dismissals and unexpected appointments have led some to suggest that a reshuffle has been going on at the highest levels.
On Nov. 15, Russia’s Investigative Committee announced that Ulyukaev had been arrested under the suspicion of corruption. Law enforcement authorities claim he solicited a bribe in the amount of $2 million to approve the purchase of 50 percent of the assets of the Bashneft oil company by Russian oil giant Rosneft.
In fact, this is the first case when such a high-profile official has been accused of corruption during Vladimir Putin’s presidency. The Russian president and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev did not release any comments shortly after the detention. However, the parliamentary opposition called for the dismissal of the entire government of Russia.
Meanwhile, experts are mulling over one primary question: What role did Rosneft head Igor Sechin play in this scandalous case? Specifically, did Sechin orchestrate this case and did Ulyukaev really pose a threat to Rosneft? ;
Ulyukaev vs Sechin According to Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko, the Economic Development Minister tried to implicate his “patrons,” but failed. Moreover, the Investigative Committee claims that Ulyukaev threatened the representatives of Rosneft. Currently, the official is expecting a decision from the court as to his status. Most likely, he will be placed under house arrest. ;
One of the most striking incongruities in the Investigative Committee’s narrative is the fact that the deal between Rosneft and Bashneft was conducted in accordance with the law. It is legitimate and, thus, cannot be the object of the probe, many experts argue.
The privatization of Bashneft took place in October 2016 without a tender, even though several companies expressed their interest in the deal and offered their bids . In late July, Ulyukaev made no bones about his disapproval of the purchase of the oil company by Rosneft. In fact, at that time he described Rosneft as “an ineligible client” for Bashneft. Likewise, Vice Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich and presidential adviser Arkady Belousov were against the deal. Nevertheless, it still took place. ;
“Probably, it is not the best option, when one company controlled by the state, acquires the other one,” said Putin following the deal. “I was surprised myself a bit by such position of the Russian government and, first and foremost, by its financial and economic department.”
It is not ruled out that today’s arrest of Ulyukaev can be linked to the direct implementation of Putin’s words, according to Mikhail Vinogradov, the president of the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation.
“The sale of Bashneft obviously became the key political event of this year, even more important than Bashneft itself. What is happening now might be the continuation of what Putin said about this deal earlier. I don’t rule out that there will be an attempt to suspend the privatization.”
At the same time, the expert speculates that there might be a political game. By hitting one official, the orchestrators will land a blow in the gut of the entire government. To quote Vinogradov, Medvedev “has been in favor for the last year, but now he is facing a very stressful moment.”
The prime minister himself called for a thorough investigation of this, and the Kremlin’s press service announced that Medvedev is currently discussing the situation with Putin. Regarding the president, he made it clear that he has been aware of the Ulyukaev case since its inception.
Also read Russia Direct's report: "" Russia's political drama heading into 2018 "" Some representatives of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) admitted that they have been tracking Ulyukaev’s activities for a year, with eavesdropping of his telephone calls becoming a routine. Amidst this background, the alleged bribe to Rosneft became a pretext for his detention, because there were no talks on Bashneft a year ago. ;
“Despite the fact that FSB has been conducting this work, it is the Investigative Committee that plays the role of the headliner,” Evgeny Minchenko told Russia Direct . “I see it as an additional instrument of strengthening the clout of its head, Alexander Bastrykin. If the probe has been conducted for about a year, I would assume that the investigation started [earlier], when the current vice president responsible for Rosneft’s security was working for the FSB.”
Likewise, newspaper Novaya Gazeta argues that Oleg Feoktistov, a former high-profile FSB official, who is currently dealing with security of Rosneft, could have started the investigation. At the same time, Vinogradov believes that the tug of war between Russia’s law enforcement agencies might have resulted in the arrest of Ulyukaev. In such a way, the Ulyukaev affair became the continuation of the reshuffle within the Kremlin’s inner circle .
All experts agree that the size of the bribe is too small for such a minister like Ulyukaev in comparison with the bribes of other high-profile officials, who have been accused of corruption. A former employee of the law enforcement agencies, Kirill Kabanov, who currently works as the chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Committee, argues that the alleged bribe became a good pretext for the arrest of Ulyukaev, because the probe has supposedly been going on for at least one year.
Also read: "" Inside the power struggle within the Russian elite "" “After all, we understand that it is a comparably small bribe for Ulyukaev to resolve such an elementary procedure [like the sale of Bashneft to Rosneft],” he told Russia Direct . “There could have been more information regarding other aspects of his activity, which led to his arrest.”
Other pundits also agree that the $2 million bribe was only a pretext. However, they don’t believe that the probe has been ongoing for a year.
“It is highly likely that there was no investigation that lasted for a year. There was a conflict with Igor Sechin and then law enforcement forces found out all the information,” a source in the special services told Russia Direct on the condition of anonymity. His colleague confirmed this view: “If there was no personal conflict, he’d be dismissed quietly or due to the loss of trust.”
Another source close to the investigation said that Ulyukaev was not fulfilling his responsibility professionally. “Let’s remember his controversial statements on the economic situation in Russia,” he said.
“With regard to Rosneft he failed to demonstrate political instincts by challenging Igor Sechin. Rosneft is not the kind of organization where one can request ‘money for a service’ even through mediators. As a result, there was an arrest, which the Kremlin will use to show that there is no impunity even for high-profile officials when it concerns fighting corruption,” he added.
First reaction Indeed, high-ranking officials might have been losing their impunity gradually ever since the start of the reshuffle. And it became a matter of fact for politicians at all levels. Numerous reports claim that Ulyukaev was caught red-handed but, according to some sources, the money was held in a bank and the minister did not touch the funds.
Recommended: "" 25 years after liberalization, Russians are cautious of democratic reforms "" “Serious allegations were put forward against the minister of the Russian government,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma. “We live in a law-governed state and everyone is equal before the law, but at the same time, we need to wait for a court trial before making any conclusions on whether he is responsible or not. There is an investigation going on and one should not interfere with it.”
Yet a number of experts argue that Volodin himself, as a powerful former first deputy head of the Presidential Administration, surely was aware of the case.
At the same time, the leaders of the parliamentary opposition – the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) and the Communist Party ¬– called for dismissing the whole government.
“The fight against corruption has been launched at all levels of the power vertical,” said Vladimir Zhirinovsky, chairman of the LDPR. “Everyone should feel insecure now. Ideally, every person at a senior position — be it a minister, a governor, or a mayor — should have a deputy representing a different political faction. Now we are likely to have a new Minister of Economic Development.”
Previously Ulyukaev worked in the government and the Central Bank of Russia. As Minister of Economic Development, he supported reforms decreasing the state’s role in the country’s economy and promoted privatization, even in an unfavorable financial environment.
His ministry never abstained from giving difficult forecasts about the Russian economy. In October, the ministry announced that the national economy would stagnate over the next 20 years and that GDP growth would be lower than global rates. On Nov. 9 in an interview with Die Welt , Ulyukaev said that the economy had more or less adapted to sanctions.
The minister himself denies the accusations and sees the case as “a provocation against a government official,” according to his lawyer Timofey Gridnev.

Standing Rock, ND — Dramatic video from Intercept reporter, Jihan Hafiz , was released this week from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests showing a full on assault by militarized police on peaceful people. The video is from Saturday but took several days to be released as cops confiscated the camera used to film it. 
The video was taken as water protectors and reporters covering the protests marched toward the construction site. However, their peaceful walk was swiftly interrupted by militarized shock troops armed with massive cans of pepper spray, batons, rubber bullets, and assault rifles. 
According to Hafiz, the march was undertaken in solidarity with several protesters who had chained themselves to bulldozers and pipeline machinery at the construction site. But the marchers never made it to their destination. Instead, they were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons. Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns, and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning. 
“Don’t move, everyone is under arrest,” a voice says from the military vehicle that appears to be equipped with a Long Range Acoustic Hailing Device, or LRAD. 
As protesters attempted to leave, the police surrounded them and began their attack. According to Hafiz, several women were targeted for leading the march and dragged from the crowd to be arrested. Police body slammed one man and another woman’s ankle was broken as she ran. 
The militarized police then circled the protesters in an apparent move to ‘kettle’ them — a tactic usually reserved for urban protests in which riot police force large crowds into corners to seemingly provoke them. However, the protesters stayed entirely peaceful. 
Police continued their mass arrests even though the people were trying to leave. Some natives were seen running for the hills as the assault began. 
One officer is seen in military camouflage with a ski mask and a tear gas grenade launcher — as if he were going to war. In total, reports Hafiz, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. It was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. A majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer. 
Among those arrested were journalists, a teen child who was also pregnant, and an elderly woman. 
They were all brought to the jail where protesters were forced to sit in the jail’s common area as police had no other place to put them. According to Hafiz, women were strip searched, protesters were refused phone calls, and no one received food or water. One woman even had her medication confiscated by police, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. 
When Hafiz was finally released, she attempted to get back her camera and was told that she could not have it back. “Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime,” they said. 
In the land of the free, filming cops assault peaceful men, women, and children is considered a ‘crime.’ 
Over the past several weeks, the police state has come out in full force as Native Americans fight to protect their water sources from the threat of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Mainstream media has remained largely silent as federal, state and local authorities worked on behalf of Energy Transfer Partners to squash dissent. 
Even prominent journalists, like Hafiz, have found themselves targets of the State, charged with dubious “crimes” such as “ inciting a riot ” and “ conspiracy to theft of services ” – for doing nothing more than filming protests and the ensuing violent crackdowns.

19078,Big Business Lobby Praises H-2B Expansion Plan,"The big business and open borders lobbies are praising an expansion of the   foreign guest worker visa included in the 2017 budget. [The budget, promoted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, will allow Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to expand the number of foreign workers who come to the U. S. for   jobs by at least 20, 000.  The   visa brings foreign nationals to the U. S. for   nonagricultural jobs. The visa impacts   and poor Americans most, as jobs in the hotel industry, theme parks, retail, and restaurants can insource jobs to foreign workers under the program. More than half a million jobs in the U. S. have been filled by   visa workers in the last five years. Now, the key organization which lobbied members of Congress to pass the expansion of the   visa is praising the move, according to POLITICOPro’s Ted Hesson, as their business allies and   associates will profit from the continued insourcing of   work in the U. S. The   Workforce Coalition lobbied Congress to include a   expansion of the   visa where returning foreign workers would be exempt from the annual cap of 66, 000, quadrupling the number of foreign workers entering the U. S. and taking jobs from American workers. Instead, the   Workforce Coalition got an expansion in the form of leaving the decision up to Kelly, which they are regarding as a win for business and immigration interests. As Breitbart Texas reported, claims of “labor shortages” in the U. S. workforce by   advocates are unfounded, according to critics. “Missing workers,” as the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) calls them, are discouraged American workers who are either unemployed or no longer looking for work because they see a weak job market, whether that be low wages, bad working conditions, or other reasons. Currently, there are 1. 37 million “missing workers” in the American labor force between the ages of 45 and   . These workers are not included in the monthly unemployment rate, but if they were, the unemployment rate would be 5. 3 percent, according to EPI. Additionally, the   visa keeps American workers’ wages stagnant, and in some cases, have actually decreased their wages. According to EPI analysis, for landscaping and   jobs given to   foreign workers, wages decreased by 3. 4 percent between 2004 and 2014. For jobs in the amusement and recreation industry, which also employs a multitude of   foreign workers, wages between 2004 and 2014 fell by 1. 3 percent.

The half hour relatively free of racist abuse happened between 2.34 and 3.03pm yesterday afternoon, at which point a ranting prick on a bus in Kidderminster told another passenger to fuck of back to his own country and that he looked like a paedophile. 
“This is a truly momentous and special day for the UK,” said Home Secretary Amber Rudd.

19081,Jewish Groups Hail Trump’s Condemnation Of Anti-Semitism,"TEL AVIV  —   U. S. Jewish groups hailed President Donald Trump’s opening remarks in his address to Congress slamming the recent spate of   acts of “hate and evil. ”[“Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms,” the president said at the joint session to wide applause.  The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights group, called the speech “pivotal” in its condemnation of  . “We are grateful that the president condemned antisemitism during this pivotal speech to the American people before both houses of Congress. American Jewry now looks forward to robust action to combat history’s oldest scourge at home and abroad,” Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper, the dean and associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said in a joint statement Wednesday. The rabbis further suggested that the administration commit to fully funding the U. S. State Department’s special envoy on   in addition to elevating that role to the status of ambassador.

19082,Freezing Migrant Rescued by Border Patrol Agents,"A migrant attempting to cross the border into Texas had to be rescued by Border Patrol agents after succumbing to frigid water in Rio Grande River. [Border Patrol agents assigned to the Eagle Pass Sector in south Texas responded to possible illegal activity along the river. When they arrived, they discovered a man stranded in the frigid water having failed to make a successful crossing.  An agent who is also an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and others rescued the man from the river and determined he was suffering from hypothermia  —   a potentially deadly condition where the person’s core body temperature drops, causing the brain to shut down critical organs. The man was transported to Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center for treatment, information obtained from U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials stated. The rescue took place around sunrise on Monday. The man, later identified only as a    Honduran national, was released from the hospital following treatment. Agents took custody of the illegal immigrant and transported him to the Eagle Pass South Border Patrol Station where he will be processed in accordance with local policies. Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials warned that while the climate in south Texas is generally warm, the cold water can act quickly on the body creating a dangerous situation. “The winter months can bring about environmental hazards that all individuals must heed,” CBP officials wrote. “Immersion in water and exposure to cool air will accelerate the progression of hypothermia and possible death. ” “This event highlights the environmental hazards that undocumented immigrants face,” Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J. Hudak said in a written statement. “Thanks to the agents’ quick thinking and training this story didn’t end in tragedy. ” “Being a Border Patrol agent means more than just enforcing the law,” Hudak continued. “It means being able to handle any situation with the commitment to preserve human life. ” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

19083,Trump Wants To Appoint Alt-Right Propagandist Steve Bannon As His Chief Of Staff,"  
Now that the election is over, Donald Trump is deciding who he will appoint to fill his cabinet. Although most the names on his list are fairly horrifying, none more so than who he is considering for White House Chief of Staff. Trump’s top pick is reportedly former Breitbart bigwig, Steve Bannon. 
So what does a chief of staff do ? Well, the person holding this position is often called “the most powerful man in Washington.” 
“The duties of the White House chief of staff vary, yet traditionally encompass the following, such as: select and supervise key White House staff, control access to the Oval Office and the president, manage communications and information flow, and negotiate with Congress, executive branch agencies, and external political groups to implement the president’s agenda.” 
“In fulfilling these duties, the chief of Staff oversees and coordinates the efforts of the following offices within the EOP and White House Office: the Council of Economic Advisers, National Security staff, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Legislative Affairs, and Office of Management and Administration, to name a few.” 
Okay, so that’s an important job. So who the hell is Steve Bannon? Not surprisingly, he is the worst of the worst. 
David Badash over at The New Civil Rights Movement summed it up quite nicely: Bannon “stepped down at Breitbart to run the final few months of Trump’s campaign, but for years he has run one of the most popular far, far right wing websites, Breitbart. It masquerades as a news site but it’s home to the alt-right, as Bannon has bragged. In other words, the white supremacists and white nationalists, the anti-Semites, the anti-LGBT crowd, the anti-Black crowd, the anti-diversity, anti-feminism, anti-Obama movement. Racists, homophobes, bigots of every stripe get their ‘news’ at Breitbart. And it got Trump elected.” 
According to court filings from his divorce proceedings, Bannon is not only a sadistic wife beater , but he is also every bit as anti-Semitic as Breitbart itself. His wife testified that he fought against allowing his daughters to attend an upscale school because of the number of Jewish children that attended. 
“He said that he doesn’t like the way they raise their kids to be ‘whiny brats’ and that he didn’t want the girls going to school with Jews.” 
This man , this is who Trump wants to have serving as the White House Chief of Staff. His advisors are encouraging him to choose RNC Chair Reince Priebus, but we all know how Trump is with taking advice from people who might actually know what they’re talking about. Who cares if Bannon actually knows anything about how to run the damn country, Trump just wants the biggest bigot he can find.

19085,Will the anti-Clinton revolt among American elites gain momentum?,"Will the anti-Clinton revolt among American elites gain momentum? November 7, 2016 - Fort Russ Mikhail Khazin , one of the top Russian economists- Translated from Russian by Kristina Kharlova There are rumors of revolt in the US state apparatus in the broad sense of the word against Hillary Clinton. Note that the top layer of the US establishment still supports Clinton, squashing any signs of disobedience: FBI closes cases, newspapers stop printing nasty things about her and so on. But one way or the other the issue floats to the surface. One of the likely reasons for this, is that Hillary Clinton is actively trading the national sovereignty of the United States in the framework of the activities of her foundation. In other words, American patriots consider her a traitor. And, as it turned out, this factor may play a decisive role. Previously it was not so obvious. In particular, the latest issue — the sale by Lockheed Martin to Turkey of a few dozen fighters of the fifth generation. Clinton is an old lobbyist for this company, so there is no doubt that it's her achievement. The problem is that Turkey under the current circumstances may cease to be a US ally, and no one can guarantee that these fighters do not fall into the hands of potential adversaries. For this reason, I do not exclude that these actions led to the resumption of the case against Clinton by the FBI. The results of tomorrow's elections remain unclear. But one thing is for sure: there are many people in the US who do not advertise their fondness of Trump, but in reality are ready to support him in the election. That is why the result of the vote may be surprising. Follow us on Facebook!",0
19086,How to Close a Gender Gap: Let Employees Control Their Schedules - The New York Times,"The main reason for the gender gaps at work  —   why women are paid less, why they’re less likely to reach the top levels of companies, and why they’re more likely to stop working after having children  —   is employers’ expectation that people spend long hours at their desks, research has shown. It’s especially difficult for women because they have disproportionate responsibility for caregiving. Flexibility regarding the time and place that work gets done would go a long way toward closing the gaps, economists say. Yet when people ask for it, especially parents, they can be penalized in pay and promotions. Social scientists call it the flexibility stigma, and it’s the reason that even when companies offer such policies, they’re not widely used. A new job search company, Werk, is trying to address the problem by negotiating for flexibility with employers before posting jobs, so employees don’t have to. All the positions listed on the Werk site, including some from Facebook, Uber and Samsung, are highly skilled jobs that offer some sort of control over the time and place of work. People can apply to jobs that let them work away from the office all the time or some of the time, and at hours other than    part time or with minimal travel. Another option gives workers the freedom to adjust their schedules, no questions asked, because of unpredictable obligations, like a sleepless night with a toddler or a trip to the emergency room with an older parent. “Nobody wants to be the female in the department who says, ‘My kid threw up on me this morning I can’t come in,’ ” said Annie Dean, who worked as a lawyer before starting Werk with Anna Auerbach, a former consultant. “Eighty percent of companies say they offer flexibility, but it’s a black market topic. You raise it and you’re not taken seriously. ” For now, Werk is a limited experiment. Most of the employers are small companies, and it is aimed at an elite group of women  —   highly educated and on a leadership track. But it could provide lessons for how to improve work and make it more equal for a broader group. Women who have less education or are paid hourly wages have significantly less flexibility than professional women to begin with. It makes working and caregiving that much harder. Motherhood presents a different challenge for the elite women that Werk was made for. The careers that pay the most and require the most education, like business and law, also have the most gender inequality. Why? Economists have found it’s a result of the long hours and limited flexibility. When educated mothers leave their jobs, it’s often because they feel pushed out by inflexible employers, according to sociologists. It’s a big reason the top of corporate America is still so male 4 percent of the chief executives of companies in the S. P. 500 are women. “They want top leadership roles,” said Ms. Dean, who thought of the idea for Werk with Ms. Auerbach after they each had children. “The only reason they’re not getting there is they’re going through this phase in their life where working 16 hours at a single desk is incompatible with their life. ” Seventy percent of working mothers say having a flexible work schedule is extremely important to them, according to a Pew survey. So do 48 percent of working fathers. Workplace flexibility reduces turnover and   conflict, according to much of the research, including a study by 10 researchers from seven universities published in December. Yet when people get flexible work arrangements, they’re generally isolated cases  —   for longtime employees whom companies trust and don’t want to lose. The employers using Werk say they get access to highly skilled employees who might not otherwise apply. Gerard Masci, founder and chief executive of Lowercase, a   eyeglass maker in Brooklyn, just hired a vice president for communications on Werk. She works   and remotely, except for monthly   meetings. “I don’t care if this week you work less if in a month you work more, and whether they work in the space or not is irrelevant,” Mr. Masci said. “All I care about is the productivity in the end. ” “The happier she is in her flexibility,” he said, “the more engaged she’s going to be in her work. ” Erin Fahs turned to Werk after her husband was transferred to Fort Myers, Fla. and she needed to find a new job. She wanted to work part time and from home because she was pregnant and the primary caregiver for their    daughter. She found three jobs on Werk that would let her do that, and took one as the business manager for the Collective Good, which does consulting for nonprofits. “Getting to have those direct conversations with the C. E. O. about what matters made it so much different from when I was applying for jobs earlier in my career,” Ms. Fahs, 33, said. She has a baby sitter 10 hours a week and works the other 10 hours when her daughter is sleeping. She has a few set meetings, which she attends via Google Hangouts  —   and gives her daughter an iPad for a diversion if there is a work emergency. She plans to expand to   work after maternity leave. This type of flexibility, while valuable, would not magically solve workplace problems. For one, any solution would need to be for both women and men. Some jobs have to be done at a certain time and place, like teaching and food service. And even at companies where it’s possible to let employees work at the time and place of their choosing, a different type of manager is required. Best Buy tried it for corporate employees, then revoked it. “There are a vast number of jobs that could be handled in an    way, but it’s just easier to measure performance by presence,” said   Slaughter, the chief executive of the think tank New America, who has written about gender and work and advises Werk. “So it is a real adjustment for managers. ”",0
19087,"Donn Fendler, Who Was Lost in Wilds of Maine as a Boy, Dies at 90 - The New York Times","July 1939. The world teetered on the brink of war as Hitler menaced Poland. The 11 millionth visitor passed through the turnstiles of the New York World’s Fair. Baseball fans still reeled after Lou Gehrig’s “luckiest man” speech at Yankee Stadium. But many Americans could think only of Donn Fendler, a    boy lost on Mount Katahdin in Maine, the object of a frantic search and rescue operation that dragged on for nine days, monopolizing the radio airwaves and newspaper headlines. Thousands of mothers sent prayers by Western Union to the boy’s mother. Boy Scouts joined the search, along with workers from the Millinocket paper mill. The New York State Police dispatched two of their best bloodhounds by air. Hearts sank when Donn’s footprints disappeared at the edge of a sheer   precipice called Saddle Slip. “I’m still trying to make myself believe there’s a faint thread of hope,” his despondent father, Donald, told The Boston Globe. Spirits lifted when new footprints appeared near the mountain’s base two days later. Finally, on the ninth day, a miracle. “Stripped naked by eight days of fearful battling with the Maine wilderness on the slopes of   Mount Katahdin, Donn Fendler came back to civilization this afternoon  —   wan, cruelly bitten and scratched, delirious with joy at hearing a human voice again,” The Globe reported on July 26, under the headline “Boy Found in Maine Wilds. ” The national ordeal was over. Donn Fendler died on Sunday in Bangor, Me. his son, Dennis, said. Mr. Fendler was 90. The Fendlers, from Rye, N. Y. had spent the previous four summers vacationing on Sebasticook Lake in Newport, in the center of Maine. On July 17, Donald Fendler and his sons, Ryan, Donn and Tommy, Donn’s twin, headed out after lunch to ascend Mount Katahdin, at 5, 267 feet the state’s highest peak. They were accompanied by Henry Condon, the    son of a local guide, and Fred Eaton, a young family friend. Eager to climb, Donn left his father and brothers behind, pushing on with Henry and Fred, when bad weather set in. “Just as we reached the summit, the mist closed in around us and shut off our view of the mountain below,” he said in “Lost on a Mountain in Maine” (1939) an    account of his adventure written with Joseph B. Egan. Ignoring the advice of his climbing mates, Donn headed back to rejoin his family. Lashed by rain and disoriented by the enveloping mist, he quickly became lost. And thus began his weeklong odyssey. Recalling his Boy Scout training, he decided to follow a small stream toward what he hoped would be a camp or town. At night, he curled up between tree roots and covered himself with moss. He ate wild berries. On the second day, tripping as he walked in the stream, he lost his sneakers, which he had tied together and carried over his shoulder. Not long after, trying to throw his soaked jeans onto a rock in the stream, he misjudged and watched as the water carried them away. “I couldn’t believe it,” he recalled in his book. “My pants were gone. There I was like a Kewpie or something. ” Small stones cut his feet.   temperatures at night stiffened his limbs. Mosquitoes, black flies and moose flies bit. “Somebody ought to do something about those black flies,” Mr. Fendler said in “Lost on a Mountain in Maine. ” “They’re terrible  —   around your forehead, under your hair, in your eyebrows and in the corners of your eyes and in the corners of your mouth, and they get up your nose like dust and make you sneeze, and you keep digging them out of your ears. ” He prayed. He hallucinated. One day, he heard a plane circling overhead but could not find a clearing to wave at it. Twice he encountered bears, foraging, as he was, for berries. He began to lose strength and hope, before the sight of telephone wires suggested to him that he was on the right track. On July 25, he came to a clearing and saw, across a lake, two canoes and a small cabin, part of a remote camp on the east branch of the Penobscot River run by Nelson McMoarn. Mr. McMoarn emerged from the cabin and did a double take. “I crawled out on the big log so the man could see me, and began to yell,” Mr. Fendler said in his book. “I guess that yelling was pretty funny, for Mr. McMoarn told me later it sounded like a screech owl. ” After being carried to bed by Lena McMoarn, Nelson’s wife, and revived with coffee and soup, Donn was handed a telephone receiver. His mother was on the other end of the line. “Mama, I’m all right,” he told her. Scratched, swollen and eaten alive by insects, 16 pounds lighter, he had wandered 35 miles from his starting point. But he was alive. The news ran on the front page of The New York Times, above the fold. Life magazine published a photo spread. A little more than one year later, Donn was in the White House, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt awarded him the Army and Navy Legion of Valor medal, recognizing him as the outstanding youth hero of 1939. Donn Conner Fendler was born in Rye on Aug. 29, 1926. His father helped run a family business, C. M. Almy, which made clerical vestments and church goods. His mother, the former Ruth Ryan, was a homemaker. After being transported by canoe from the McMoarn camp to Grindstone and spending several days in the hospital in Bangor, Donn quickly resumed his adolescent routine. After graduating from the New Hampton School in New Hampshire, he enlisted in the Navy in 1944 and served as a Seabee in the Pacific theater during World War II. He studied forestry at the University of Maine for two years and briefly attended the University of Georgia before making a career in the Army. Trained as a Green Beret, he served in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division. In 1962, he was posted to West Germany. With the rank of lieutenant colonel, he later assumed command of a battalion at Fort Campbell, Ky. He retired in 1978 and moved to Clarksville, Tenn. not far from the Army base. In addition to his son, he is survived by three daughters, Bridget Fendler, Judith King and Joan Bedwell his brothers, Ryan and Thomas and six grandchildren. For the rest of his life, Mr. Fendler spent summers in Maine and, in the fall, visited schools there to talk about his exploits in the woods. “I hope the message that I give sinks in,” he told The Bangor Daily News in 2008. “It’s really about faith and determination. That’s the whole message. ” Visitors to Baxter State Park still hear his story, a cautionary tale that rangers know full well. For years, his book was required reading for Maine schoolchildren. In 2011, Mr. Fendler told his story in a graphic novel, “Lost Trail,” scripted by Lynn Plourde and illustrated by Ben Bishop. “When I die, my ashes are going over Mount Katahdin,” he told The Bangor Daily News in 2014. “My brother said he’d fly or get someone to fly,” he continued. “Yup, they’re going to put me in a bean can. ”",0

19089,The Syrian town shattered by war that may finally have seen an end to the fighting,"By Robert Fisk on October 29, 2016 Robert Fisk — The Independent Oct 26, 2016 The rubble of the smashed town of Mouadamiya. Click to enlarge 
From the moment you cross the bridge over the old steam train railway line to Deraa, you can see what happened to this little town south-west of Damascus . It’s not just the bullet holes, the smashed buildings, the toppled mosque with its minaret lying in pathetic chunks, nor the apartment blocks that have slid into the streets after two years of Syrian tank fire and helicopter bombing. Nor the underground hospital. It’s not even the women walking with their children again through the scarred streets, nor the street-sellers outside the blitzed buildings. 
It’s the young men, some bearded, eyes alert, the men of the old Liwa al-Fatah, the Liberation Brigade militia that fought the Syrian army, queuing up without their weapons to register at the checkpoint. Still proud but now working with the government to keep the government’s enemies out of Mouadamiya, they are a guarantee, of sorts, that their town will stay rebel-free. The regime still holds 800 of their relatives and friends in unknown prisons; another guarantee, of sorts, that they will remain loyal. 
What also happened was a change of heart. And a phone call to the opposition from a man identified as a British “officer” called Ford. The government also realised it should never have taken the land from the people of Mouadamiya before the war, nor dismissed their peaceful protests with such arrogance in 2011. And then the men who took up arms realised, two years later, that they had been betrayed. 
Such a moment came to 27-year old Mahmoud Khalifa when he took a phone call in November 2013 from the “Military Operations Centre” in Jordan, whence the West’s agents and Arab allies have tried to direct, coerce and arm the tens of thousands of men who want to destroy President Bashar al-Assad. 
“There was a Saudi on the phone and he handed me over to a British officer who said his name was Ford, Dr Khalifa recalls. “We asked for help, we called for arms, weapons, money. And the answer from Ford was: ‘We can send ammunition for light weapons. We can’t send heavy or sophisticated weapons.’ I asked why, and the answer came back: ‘You are in an area so close to the capital that we will not allow you to advance.’ 
“They were playing with us. I insulted the two officers. I told them: ‘We will not allow you to use us like an instrument – and this is the last time you call us.’” Dr Khalifa, who is a medical doctor, narrows his eyes when he says this. His “allies”, it seems, wanted the war to continue – to destroy Syria rather than the regime. And he is a man with another burden. His older brother is one of the 800 prisoners, arrested in Damascus because the army realised his family connection to the doctor. 
The Military Operations Centre is real enough. Captured rebels have talked about the “MOC” in Jordan, and Syrian intelligence officers have for months monitored communications between the MOC and elements of Jabhat al-Nusra (aka al-Qaeda) and the febrile Free Syrian Army around the southern city of Deraa. The Syrian army believes it is located close to the Jordanian-Syrian border. It is a worthy subject of investigation. 
But when the war ended in Mouadamiya, promises were kept. The government agreed that Syrian militiamen in the town would remain free – and allowed to travel anywhere in Syria under government control, providing they surrendered their weapons. According to 45-year old Khaled Khodr – the head of the Liwa al-Fatah and nicknamed the Mayor by his fighting men – 600 fighters along with their families, a total of 1,500 who did not trust the government, were permitted to leave with their side-arms for rebel-held areas in Idlib province. 
Dr Khalifa has been told that 95 of them are now gathered near the Turkish border, keener to become refugees in safety than carry on the fight. 
But sides call this a reconciliation and it’s a miniature version of what the Syrian government must intend for eastern Aleppo: the surrender of their enemies and the expulsion of those who will not give up their weapons and the gradual restoration of life for the surviving civilians after months of ruthless bombardment. There’s even a “reconciliation committee” in Mouadamiya – one of dozens operating in other townships around Damascus and Homs – to oversee the new peace, with local mukhtars – town leaders – and former fighters and Syrian military intelligence officers on the committee. 
Peace must come in stages. The electricity and water in Mouadamiya was never cut by the government, a smart move by someone in authority who realised that there were limits to a siege – albeit scarcely applied in Aleppo – which might lead to submission at a later date. Syrian troops have not entered Mouadamiya and the men who defended it believe the 800 prisoners will be freed after the new governor arrives to hoist the Syrian flag over the municipal buildings in a few days’ time and to declare the town safe. A Syrian intelligence man, a big beefy figure who refused to give his name or talk publicly, admitted that this was the intention: the prisoners would be freed “step by step”. 
Could this be a model for eastern Aleppo if the slaughter ends? The ex-fighters here have their doubts. Too many of the armed groups in Aleppo are foreigners who would prefer to fight on. Too many are Islamists. In Mouadamiya, Khaled Khodr’s Liwa stepped in at once when Nusra Islamists arrived from the suburb of Ghouta and tried to join their fight – he told them to leave. But this did not spare the town. Among the buildings destroyed in the long battle was the largest school – never a rebel base, according to the former fighters – and in all 1,800 of its people were killed in the siege, most of them from the Liwa. Only just over 2,000 civilians lived on amid the wreckage. Mouadamiya’s mukhtar, Mohamed Jallab, reckons that 40,000 of its inhabitants who fled three years ago have now returned. 
And reconciliation seems to work, at least publicly. The former Syrian fighters talk with government soldiers on the edge of the town, even sharing their cigarettes, queuing up to sign a register to visit Damascus and talking freely – in and out of the hearing of the soldiers — of their battle against the regime. They were, like all militiamen, civilians when there was no war to fight: I met a painter, two truck drivers, a barber, three students – one of them studying Arabic literature in Damascus, who was a nurse during the fighting – a car mechanic and a former government soldier who has agreed to rejoin the ranks of the army he fought against for so many months. 
Although the “reconciliation opening” of Mouadamiya commenced less than two weeks ago, there had been a de facto truce holding – on and off – for two years, and many of the combatants knew each other. It’s always that way in a civil war – or “the crisis”, as both sides refer to the Syrian bloodbath here. There was a kind of honour during the siege. At the start, there had been Free Syrian Army men, mostly regime defectors with little heart in the battle, but the local fighters lost many of their comrades during the siege. Dr Khalifa says he lost 20 of his relatives and friends. 
At the hospital – operating rooms underground, wards one floor above – Dr Ratep Daoud displayed the three primitive tables with cardiac equipment and ventilators and green sheets and flaking walls where he and his internist and pediatrician and Dr Khalifa tried to save so many lives amid the bombardment. The hospital was never hit, but 1,600 of the doctors’ patients died in this cramped building. Eighty per cent of them were fighters. Just as in eastern Aleppo, the local civil defence men pulled wounded and corpses from the rubble. They did indeed wear “white helmets” – though they were not called that – and several of them could be found resting in their trucks and office near the hospital. For them, the war is also over. 
Mouadamiya is a curious town. The vegetable gardens that the 2,000 or so civilians nurtured to ward off starvation are still there. So are the plastic screens to prevent government snipers shooting at the people of Mouadamiya. There are massive ramparts of earth around the old front lines. Twenty years ago, most of this was rich farmland: prosperous families lived in the stone villas, the remnants of which stand on the outskirts. Ancient olive groves still snake their way into the town and stand behind scorched apartment blocks, their gnarled trunks and swaying branches a faintly ironic balm amid so much destruction. 
These were the lands appropriated before the war, when the townspeople demanded their restitution and a new state governor. The regime did not listen to them. The same happened in Deraa. And in Homs and other cities. And of course, eventually, protest turned into war. And foreigners, who neither knew nor cared where Mouadamiya was, sent in their guns and agents to keep it running.",0
19090,"Trump, Asked Again About Putin, Suggests U.S. Isn’t ‘So Innocent’ - The New York Times","President Trump, asked by an interviewer on Saturday why he respected President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia even though he is “a killer,” seemed to equate Mr. Putin’s actions with those of the United States. “You got a lot of killers,” he told the interviewer, Bill O’Reilly of Fox News. “What, you think our country’s so innocent?” Mr. Trump has long expressed his admiration for the Russian leader’s strength. But his willingness to seemingly draw a moral equivalence to actions by Mr. Putin, who has brutally suppressed dissent by eliminating political enemies, led to an eruption on social media. Many asked how conservatives would have reacted had President Barack Obama, or other Democrats, compared American actions to Mr. Putin’s. The exchange surfaced on Saturday night in an excerpt from the interview, which is to be broadcast on Sunday before the Super Bowl. What Mr. Trump was specifically referring to or whether there was added context that came after his comment was not immediately clear based on the excerpt that was made available. In the interview, Mr. Trump was asked if he respected Mr. Putin. He said he did, adding that he respected “a lot of people, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him. ” Mr. Trump continued: “He’s a leader of his country. I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS  —   which is a major fight  —   and Islamic terrorism all over the world  —   major fight  —   that’s a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. It’s very possible that I won’t. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to mend ties with Moscow has raised questions over his administration’s commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for its involvement in the fighting and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. He said he was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, after a telephone call on Saturday with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, Reuters reported. The call was the first direct contact between the two leaders since Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “We will work with Ukraine, Russia and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border,” Mr. Trump said in a White House statement. His comments contrasted with those of Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, who on Thursday condemned Russia for its “aggressive actions” in eastern Ukraine. She said the United States wanted improved relations with Russia, but added that American sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea would remain in place. She said “the dire situation” demanded “clear and strong condemnation” of Russia’s actions. In another excerpt from the Fox interview, Mr. Trump was asked whether it was irresponsible for him to say that three million illegal immigrants voted in the election while lacking the evidence to support that assertion. “When you see illegals, people that are not citizens and they’re on the registration rolls,” he started to say before shifting. “Look, Bill, we can be babies, but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this  —   it’s really a bad situation, it’s really bad. ”",0
19091,Moment in Convention Glare Shakes Up Khans’ American Life - The New York Times,"Six minutes and one second. That was all it took for the 66 years of Khizr Khan’s life to become an American moment. It was not something that he could have anticipated. For years, he and his wife, Ghazala, had lived a rather quiet existence of common obscurity in Charlottesville, Va. He was known in circles that dealt with electronic discovery in legal proceedings. Another overlapping sphere was the rotating cast of cadets that passed through the Army R. O. T. C. program at the University of Virginia. His wife was a welcoming face to the customers of a local fabric store. And the last dozen years for the Khans were darkened by their heartbreak over the death of a military son, Humayun, whose body lies in Arlington National Cemetery, his tombstone adorned with an Islamic crescent. Their grief brought them closer to a university and to a young woman in Germany whom their son loved. It also gave them a conviction and expanded the borders of their lives. Some of their neighbors knew Mr. Khan liked to carry a $1 pocket Constitution around with him. In the Khan home, a stack of them always lay at the ready. Guests showed up and they were handed one, in the way other hosts might distribute a party favor. Mr. Khan wanted it to stimulate a conversation about liberty, a cherished topic of his. He liked to point out that he lives nearly in the shadow of Monticello, home of one of his heroes, Thomas Jefferson. Mrs. Khan liked to say, “We need Thomas Jefferson. ” And then the Khans stepped into a sports arena in Philadelphia and left as household names. In a passionate speech at the Democratic National Convention, the bespectacled Mr. Khan stingingly criticized Donald J. Trump and his stance on Muslim immigration, scolding him, “You have sacrificed nothing and no one. ” Quickly enough, both Khans felt the verbal lashings of Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate. And just like that, they found themselves a pivot point in the twisting drama that is American politics. This is another moment in the lives of Khizr and Ghazala Khan. In 1972, he was studying law at the University of the Punjab in Lahore, the largest public university in his native Pakistan. He was intrigued by Persian literature. Learning of a Persian book reading, he went. Ghazala was the host. He was raised in Gujranwala in Punjab Province, the oldest of 10 children. His parents had a poultry farm. “My life was very ordinary,” he said in an interview this week. “There was nothing special. I grew up as every other Pakistani. No extra   events took place during my lifetime, and we were modest people. ” But, he said, he had the ambition “to keep moving forward. ” The university reading was one thing, but what enchanted him was the host. She was from Faisalabad and was studying the Persian language. He engaged in some decorous maneuvering and decided that she was the woman he wanted to marry. He enlisted the help of his parents, who reached out to her parents. Then the real courtship began. In 1973, he graduated from law school and he was licensed with the Punjab bar in 1974. Already, his goal was to move to the United States. “Everybody’s dreams come true if you are able to study and complete higher education abroad,” he said. “That’s the plan we grew up with: that it makes your future better if you have a postgraduate degree from overseas, England or United States. ” But he did not have enough money. And so after the Khans were married, they moved to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. For three years, Mr. Khan worked for an American oil field company as the lawyer who handled the affairs of the expatriate workers. Their first two sons were born, Shaharyar and Humayun. In 1980, the Khans came to the United States. First, they went to Houston to save up more money. The four of them squeezed into a $     apartment. Once he had the savings, he enrolled at Harvard Law School. He graduated in 1986 with a master of laws degree and became a citizen, as did his wife. They moved to Silver Spring, Md. and he found work reviewing mortgage documents. It was not his dream job, but a third son, Omer, had been born. Mouths had to be fed. In time, he moved on to several large law firms, where he specialized in the emerging area of electronic discovery. It involved finding information that was stored electronically to answer discovery requests from opposing sides in lawsuits. Robert Eisenberg, a consultant who is a pioneer of the field, came to know Mr. Khan well and found him highly proficient at his work and immensely likable. “There is an   gentility about him,” he said. “He has this veneer of formality. But under it is kindness. ” And so the Khans settled in, and they became an American life. There are different vantages from which to understand the Khans’ middle son, Humayun, and one of them is through Amir Ali Guerami. He was born in Iran and he happened to come to the Maryland middle school that Humayun attended. There were few Muslims, and that made Mr. Guerami different. And he was very overweight. He was taunted and beaten up. His middle name was Patrick. As he walked down the school hallways, bullies would bellow, “Fat Rick. ” And Humayun would hear this and step in. He would walk alongside him, a sentry staring the bullies down, deflecting them. And he intervened when Mr. Guerami was being roughed up outside the library. When he was punched in the throat in gym class and could not breathe. This cemented a friendship that continued throughout high school. Humayun was Mr. Guerami’s defender and his motivator. He urged him to exercise and to diet. And after his sophomore year, Mr. Guerami was 60 pounds lighter. As a high school student, Humayun swam and played basketball, and he taught swimming to children with disabilities. In his middle son, Mr. Khan saw the traits of his mother  —   farsighted and “much more balanced in her thinking and gestures. ” “I’m a little more emotional and shortsighted,” Mr. Khan said. Mr. Guerami saw this, too. “You always knew he had a plan,” Mr. Guerami said. “He wasn’t just stumbling through life like the rest of us. He was planning college from Day 1. ” They lost contact after high school. Mr. Guerami now lives in California and owns a mortgage company. He was watching the Democratic convention when the video came on about Captain Khan. And that was when Mr. Guerami learned that he had been an R. O. T. C. cadet at the University of Virginia and had joined the Army and had gone to Iraq and become a hero. That his life was frozen at age 27. The memories returned. “He had an impact on my life,” he said. “You read about kids being bullied in school and then their hurting themselves. He owed me nothing, a complete stranger. Yet he stood up for me. He was a savior. ” A German woman named Irene Auer sat down in a cafe in the Bavarian town of Amberg, and a man approached her. This was another moment in the life of Humayun Khan. He was stationed in the barracks at nearby Vilseck. This was 2002. She liked his manner, and she especially liked his English. ”There were many who spoke English very badly, or with a lot of slang, but not him,” she said. “He spoke beautiful English and had a very beautiful voice. ” They started dating. In time, she began studying international management but stayed with him in his apartment off base on weekends. His mother went to Germany in 2003, and the two became acquainted. In September 2003, Ms. Auer flew with Captain Khan to the United States to meet his father. This was serious stuff. Captain Khan loved to have a good debate with Ms. Auer, her family and her friends. One of his favorite topics was the meaning of life. As it happens, she opposed the war in Iraq. But he accepted his duty and was proud to be a soldier. “Once he even said to me, ‘You know that I am married,’ ” she said. “I asked him, ‘What do you mean you’re married?’ and he told me, ‘Yes, I am married to the U. S. Army.’ ” On Feb. 9, 2004, he left for Iraq. They planned to get married the following year and eventually settle in the United States. His intention was to go to law school. In one of the last emails she received from him, he told her to go pick out an engagement ring. It was his day off but he was not much for days off. He was the commander of the Force Protection Team of the 201st Forward Support Battalion, First Infantry Division, at Camp Warhorse in Diyala Province, Iraq. Sgt. Crystal Selby, one of the team’s drivers, went to pick him up that morning. June 8, 2004. He said he wanted to check the compound’s gate. On a day off? She told him to stay in his room. He was her boss. She could not order him to, and he got in. It was funny how she had known Captain Khan only a couple of months and yet it seemed like she had known him so much longer. It was the way he treated her and all of the soldiers. “He didn’t talk to you like he was in charge of you, but like a friend,” she said. “He taught you how to be better. Not better tanker or better fueler. Better human being. ” He made sandwiches for his soldiers when there was no time to get to lunch. He had such an easy sense of humor. “I read where someone called him a soldier’s officer,” she said. “To me, he was a human’s human. ” The drive took three or four minutes. She dropped him off outside the gate and headed to the office. An    taxi carrying two suicide bombers was creeping toward the gate. Captain Khan shouted for his men to hit the dirt. That may well have saved their lives. He moved toward the taxi, trying to halt it. Sergeant Selby was still in the truck, not even to the office, when she heard the explosion. When she arrived, the news of his death was already on the radio. The Army R. O. T. C. center at the University of Virginia is on the first floor of the Astronomy Building. The program is not large  —   a typical Army cadet class commissions 10 to 20 people. When you walk into the offices, it is the first room on the left. The Khan Room. There are several pictures of Captain Khan. Clippings about him. One of his uniforms. A letter of condolence from the Seven Society, one of the university’s secret societies. Memorial plaques. The piece he wrote for his commissioning. It is where who he was endures. It is a functional space, serving as a conference room, a place where prospective cadets might get interviewed or meetings held. When it is empty, cadets use it to study for exams. A few months after their son’s death, the Khans moved to Charlottesville, where their other two sons were living, so they could try to recover as a family. Shaharyar, their oldest son,   a biotech firm that Omer, their youngest son, works at. The Army R. O. T. C. program became a part of their restoration. Tim Leroux, who was the commander from 2009 to 2012 and retired a lieutenant colonel, saw them as the “mom and pop of the department. ” It became one of their rocks. They attended all its formal events. At the annual commissioning ceremony, Mr. Khan always spoke. When the cadets took the oath, he told them, they needed to think hard about their pledge to defend the Constitution, to reflect on what they were pledging to defend, because his son died for that document. And he would give each graduate one of his pocket Constitutions. Then there would be an award presented, the Khan award, that went to that year’s outstanding  . “For years, I’ve been telling people he’s the most patriotic person I’ve ever met, and I’ve met quite a few,” Mr. Leroux said of Mr. Khan. “There are people who will put on cutoffs of the American flag and say they’re patriotic. Or they’ll put on bumper stickers  —   America, Love It or Leave It  —   and say they’re patriotic. He has a much more profound idea of being patriotic. It’s a complete understanding of what liberty and democracy mean. ” Mrs. Khan came to these commissioning ceremonies, too. They were hard for her. Her grief over her son’s death reached deep. One day not long after moving to Charlottesville, she stopped at a local fabric store, Les Fabriques. She makes her own clothing and needed fabric. Carla Quenneville, the store’s owner, waited on her. Mrs. Khan told her the story of her son’s death. “She said she came in because she was so depressed and she said, ‘I have to get off my couch and stop crying,’ ” Ms. Quenneville said. “She had cried for a solid year. And we cried together that day. ” Ms. Quenneville wanted to bring sun back into her life. She told her, if she wished, she could spend time in the store, help out if she wanted. And so she did. Pretty much every Monday, she began showing up and assisting customers, giving them tips on the sewing machines that the store sold. Since she prayed five times a day, she sometimes used a back room to pray. The fabric store helped her mend her own life. The sorrow, though, persists. “A new staff person comes on, she tells the story of her son,” Ms. Quenneville said. “And she cries. She can’t get through this. ” There was other healing to be done in the circle of their son’s life. When Ms. Auer, the woman Captain Khan planned to marry, came to his funeral, Mrs. Khan presented her with his favorite quilt. She asked her to return it when she got married, so they would know she was happy again. Two years later, Ms. Auer was still adrift. The Khans invited her to stay with them, and she did, from May until August 2006. “They said to me, come, we need you here by us,” she said. After returning to Germany, she met a man who became her husband. They have two daughters. She realizes she should return that quilt. It was important to the Khans to know the R. O. T. C. cadets, really know them, and so they began the ritual of the dinners at their house. There would be one dinner each year for the freshmen cadets and one for the seniors. A front room was filled with mementos and objects no parent ever wants  —   the letter of condolence from President George W. Bush, the American flag that had covered the coffin. Often, the Khans would show the cadets the room for them to understand the magnitude of the step they were taking. “The Khans didn’t become bitter when they lost their son or become angry with the military,” said Joe Riley, a cadet who graduated in 2013. “The exact opposite. They showed tremendous pride in us. ” He remembered how Mr. Khan pulled him aside and told him how he felt blessed to be in this country and how much he admired the American military. The focus at these dinners would swivel to the cadets  —   who they were, why they wanted to join the Army, what future they envisioned. As they shared, Mrs. Khan, always the R. O. T. C. mom, would remind them to eat their vegetables. At one dinner, he told of how he had pictures of himself as a boy wearing an Army uniform and digging tiny foxholes on the farm he lived on in Tennessee. As he got older, he just felt it was the correct thing to do, the only thing to do. He said he felt that if you live in your country and enjoy its wonders, you should give back. For him, the Army was the way to fulfill that obligation. His parents had a different view. When they learned of his plans, they did not speak to him for eight weeks. And, oh, how the Khans loved hearing this conviction in a young man, this resolute belief in guarding American democracy. In 2011, Joe Riley won the Khan Award. He went on to become a Rhodes Scholar and is now stationed in Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, Wash. an Army lieutenant. Everything had happened in the space of a week, and it was so much. The Khans were on “Meet the Press” and “State of the Union” and “PBS NewsHour,” some dozen news shows in all, fresh arrivals in the political process. All from the dominoes of chance. Months ago, Mr. Khan was quoted in an article in Vocativ, an online publication, criticizing Mr. Trump’s position on Muslims. When asked about Muslim extremism in the United States, he recounted a conversation with his older son about the need to root out “traitors” among them. Seeing the article, campaign officials for Hillary Clinton wanted to put his son in a video to be shown at the convention, and then asked the Khans if they wished to say a few words. And now all this. Mr. Khan was on “Anderson Cooper 360” this week, and he seemed spent. He said they would not become silent but they were withdrawing. “I will continue to remind you what your behavior for the whole year had been,” he said addressing Mr. Trump. “I am not going to continue to appear on television. It is really disturbing because it is emotionally disturbing. It is   disturbing. ” He told The Times this week that he was exhausted from talking to reporters and that it was harming his health. In recent years, he had gone out on his own as a legal consultant. A few days ago, he took down the website promoting his law work. He said that he was getting hateful messages and that he was worried about it being hacked. Insinuations were being made, that he was involved in shady immigration cases. He said he has had no clients come to him for that sort of work. He said he did commercial law, especially electronic discovery work. The Khans had been one sort of family and now they are another. In the   way that it can happen in modern society, they have become public figures. They were put up in Washington hotels for their TV appearances. People floated up to them on the street. Took selfies with them. They wanted to be themselves again, mingle with cadets and talk about sewing at the fabric store. A few days ago, done with a round of interviews in Washington, they stopped at Arlington National Cemetery to visit the grave of their son. Then they went home.",0
19092,"Dear Neoliberal Democrats: This is Your Mess, Own It","George Ciccariello-Maher | November 9, 2016 
The final election results are not in, but one thing is crystal clear: Hillary Clinton is a failure. And so is the neoliberal establishment. 
Even if she narrowly manages to defeat Donald Trump, she has still lost. Her failure is not individual, however, but a failure of Clintonism, the Democratic Party, and decades of failed economic policies. According to some exit polls, Clinton is losing half of union households and getting routed in a rust belt abandoned by Clintonism: in Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, a state that she took so much for granted that she didn’t make a single campaign stop there . 
All this against a racist misogynist with no ground game, hemorrhaging the support of his own party leadership, with far fewer resources and a thousand character flaws and weaknesses to be exploited. All polls show that even many Trump voters doubted his qualifications and character, but they voted for him anyway. 
Confronted with this reality, Clintonite liberals have been willfully ignorant, managing to both write poor whites off as racist deplorables while simultaneously underestimating their potential to swing to the Right. Neglecting poor whites, Clintonism holds Black and Latino Americans hostage, offering no solution to police murder and promising more deportations to boot. 
The blame game is already in full swing: Democratic apparatchiks are already preparing to blame FBI director James Comey, third party candidates, and it wouldn’t be surprising to hear Vladimir Putin’s name come up—the Red Scare never gets old. But the ire of a wounded Clintonism will no doubt be directed above all at the Left. 
But the liberal establishment and its neoliberal economic policies have failed, and it’s time for liberals to own that. The pundits, the talking heads, the press, and the pollsters are admitting that they had no idea what they were talking about and flailing for explanations. Maybe if liberal and conservative elites alike don’t have answers, it’s time to build a fighting left that can offer real solutions. 
The left needs to directly confront the racism that Trump harnessed, but it also needs to better understand what caused the Trump phenomenon to begin with. For all of his flaws, Bernie Sanders did the second, and you don’t have to like Sanders to admit that there’s no way he would have fucked this up so bad. 
But Sanders’ failure to capture the Democratic Party was no accident. If Trump wins, the same Democratic Party has been calling him a fascist and would-be dictator will demand that we recognize his legitimacy. They will suddenly discover that, instead of fighting back, they can reach across the aisle and work with this eccentric leader. 
But the reality is this: if you really believe that Trump is a fascist, you’d better be prepared to do more than just vote.

19093,Freedom Caucus Rep Jordan: Obamacare Bill ’Not Repeal’ - But It’s ’Pretty Darn Good’ and ’the Best’ We Can Get Out of the House - Breitbart,"On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “New Day,” House Freedom Caucus Chairman Emeritus Representative Jim Jordan ( ) argued that the latest Obamacare bill isn’t a repeal of Obamacare, but is “a pretty darn good bill” and “the best bill we can get out of the House. ”  Jordan said that he thinks the bill will get a vote this week, adding, “I feel this is a pretty darn good bill that we made better because we engaged in this debate. I think that the tax increases are gone right away. The Obamacare tax increases are now gone right away in this bill.   adults in the Medicaid expansion population, there’s now a work requirement for them. And this waiver option that states can seek to get out from under those key Obamacare regulations that are driving up premiums for   families, I think when you look at those, this is the best bill we can get out of the House. But frankly, we should be clear, this is not repeal of Obamacare. If it was repeal, you wouldn’t need the option for a waiver option for states to seek. So, we have to be clear with the voters about that, and continue to work on it. ” Jordan later said that the bill isn’t a complete repeal of Obamacare, but is a “good step, and it’s —  I think —  the best step. ” He added that “States can get out of some of the regulations that are driving up premium costs.   conditions —  as the president mentioned —  is specifically covered in the legislation. And there’s $125 billion of taxpayer money that goes to the states to make sure there’s that safety net provision that we call   pools available for states to use. They have to have that set up first before they can actually seek the waiver. ” Jordan further stated, “If you maintain continuous coverage, you can’t lose coverage and coverage can’t be jumped up to a higher rate if you have some tough illness happen to you or your family. That is clear. What we’re trying to do, is reward responsible behavior. You maintain coverage, that’s the right thing to do. You don’t get bumped up because something serious happens to you or your family. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
19094,NBC Moving Ahead with Megyn Kelly-Alex Jones Interview Despite Backlash,"NEW YORK (AP)  —   NBC News is moving ahead with plans to air Megyn Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones this weekend despite a backlash that has cost the show advertisers and led to Kelly being dropped as host for an event by an organization founded by parents of children killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. [The network has been taken aback by the response to booking Jones, the “Infowars” host who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people in 2012 at the school in Newton, Connecticut, was a hoax. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said the story will be edited with the sensitivity of its critics in mind.  “It’s important to get it right,” Lack said. Reporters have interviewed controversial characters like Syrian President Bashar Assad and child molesters in the past without getting this kind of a reaction, Kelly said in an interview Tuesday. “What I think we’re doing is journalism,” she said. “The bottom line is that while it’s not always popular, it’s important. I would submit to you that neither I nor NBC News has elevated Alex Jones in any way. He’s been elevated by 5 or 6 million viewers or listeners, and by the president of the United States. As you know, journalists don’t get the choice over who has power or influence in our country. ” Sandy Hook Promise, an   violence group, said it had asked Kelly to step down as host of its   gala in Washington. The group cannot support Kelly or NBC’s decision to give a platform to Jones and hopes NBC reconsiders its plan to broadcast the interview, said Nicole Hockley,   and managing director. Hockley, whose    son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the organization with Mark Barden, who lost his    son Daniel. Kelly said she understood and respected the decision, but was disappointed. NBC’s plans have cost it some advertisers for this week’s edition of “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. ” It was not immediately clear how many only the financial firm JPMorgan Chase has been publicly identified. “That comes with the territory,” Lack said. “It’s not unusual. We kind of know when we’re doing controversial stories, that’s going to happen. It doesn’t stop us from doing controversial stories. ” To some critics, NBC’s timing makes the decision worse  —   airing on Father’s Day an interview that has been publicly denounced by parents who lost young children at Sandy Hook. NBC said it was scheduled for competitive reasons, because Jones had been booked to appear on ABC’s daytime show “The View” next week. A representative of “The View” said Jones had canceled his appearance there and he will not be rescheduled. Lack noted that he had suggested approaching Jones for an interview to David Corvo, the NBC News executive who supervises the network’s newsmagazines. He said there’s nothing new about putting people on the air even if they’re unpopular or have views that are deplorable to many. “I’ve got tremendous understanding of why they’re so upset, as they have every right to be,” he said. “Of course we’re looking at it. We’re looking at the editorial process. ” The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines the New York Daily News called it “Nutwork News” on its front page Tuesday. She was one of Trump’s favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a   debate. Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as “fake news” and said it was purposeful hit job on him. “I knew in my gut this was going to blow up in their face,” he said on his show.",0
19095,Trump Gathers GOP Congressmen at WH: ’Unbelievable Victory When We Get It Through the Senate’ - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Standing in front of a host of Republican House lawmakers gathered for a victory lap in the Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump declared that passing the American Health Care Act would be an “unbelievable victory when we get it through the Senate. ”[After weeks of heated debate over repealing and replacing Obamacare, the House very narrowly passed what the Vice President called the first step in repealing President Obama’s signature health insurance law, Obamacare. President Trump called a press conference with House Republicans at the White House to commemorate the   passage of the bill.  President Trump entered the Rose Garden to a standing ovation: President Trump enters the Rose Garden greeting Republican House members after House passing American Health Care Act #AHCA #ACA #Obamacare pic. twitter.   —   Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) May 4, 2017,  “Welcome to the beginning of the end of Obamacare,” said Vice President Mike Pence, as he credited the leadership and persistent work of President Trump for the bill’s passage. Pence recalled the March 2010 passage of Obamacare and Republican promises that the law “would not stand” as he stood in front of an overflowing crowd of Republican lawmakers who had rushed down to the White House from Capitol Hill. “We’ve taken a historic first step to repeal and replace Obamacare and finally give the American people the kind of health care they deserve. ” President Trump spoke of Americans suffering under the “ravages” of Obamacare. He declared confidence that the bill would pass in the U. S. Senate, that it would “get even better. ” He promised that premiums and deductibles will come down under the AHCA. “It’s gonna be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate,” said Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan said that, after serving during four presidential administrations, he had never seen the level of involvement from the White House as he has with this President and Vice President. As Ryan spoke, Trump and Rep. Mark Meadows could be seen leaning in for a few friendly words that seemed to make each of them smile. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy then took the podium, stating that it would have been easy to watch Obamacare collapse, but that wouldn’t be right, “Today is a start of a new beginning. ” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise spoke of stories from Americans in his district who have seen double digit increases in their health insurance premiums every year under Obamacare. This isn’t about a political goal, said Scalise, this is “about families. ” Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden said they reached out to Governors, Insurance Commissioners, and “innovators of this space. ” “We have the opportunity now to rescue people, to give them the opportunity to truly get the kind of care that they want, they deserve, with the doctors that they choose, and a price they can afford,” said House Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said, “I know this is just a first step, but make no mistake, this is a giant step toward the day when Americans aren’t struggling under one trillion of dollars of tax hikes that hurt small businesses, that land on families, that drag our economy down, that hurt patients. ” Brady thanked Congressman Mark Meadows for remaining “at the table, worked to bring our conference together. ” Freedom Caucus Chairman Meadows then took to the podium saying, “There are three numbers that matter today, 217, 1, and 318. ” Meadows continued: Today we had a vote in the House and 217 votes actually came together from different districts, from all across the country. From Maine to California, from Michigan to Florida and in between and all of those 217 members came from different districts that represented a different kind of people. It’s a good day because of the number one, a president who wouldn’t give up, a president who got engaged, a president who said you know I don’t care what the mainstream media is saying, we’re gonna get this done and we’re gonna make it better for the American people. And Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for those late night calls i’m glad that i’ll get some rest, but I want to thank you on behalf of the most critical number and that’s the 318 million Americans who now, once again will be able to get affordable healthcare, to allow those decisions to be made between them and their doctor and once again, make sure that they don’t have to go begging and figuring out how to pay for their healthcare premium instead of their mortgage. So Mr. President it’s a great day for America, it’s a great day for this Administration and it’s a truly great day for the American people.

19096,Elizabeth Warren Is Invited to Speak on Democratic Convention’s First Night - The New York Times,"In an apparent sign that Senator Elizabeth Warren will not be named Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Ms. Warren was invited by Mrs. Clinton’s campaign on Tuesday to deliver a   address on the first night of the Democratic convention this month  —   a marquee speaking slot but one that is earlier than   picks typically appear. Such nominees usually speak later in the convention week to build anticipation for the top of the ticket. Two Democrats briefed on the invitation to Mrs. Warren, however, cautioned that Mrs. Clinton had not yet made a decision about a running mate and that asking Ms. Warren to take the stage on the first night did not preclude her from being tapped as the   nominee. Ms. Warren and other individuals who received invitations on Tuesday to address the Philadelphia convention were told that their speaking times were subject to change depending on who was selected for vice president, according to the two Democrats, one with ties to Mrs. Clinton and the other to Ms. Warren, who both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss convention planning. But even Ms. Warren’s allies are now increasingly skeptical that she will join the ticket as the famously cautious Mrs. Clinton enjoys a steady lead in the polls over Donald J. Trump and is eyeing Democrats who are less dynamic than Ms. Warren but would not overshadow her on the campaign trail or in the White House. Mrs. Clinton’s meetings with the remaining   candidates are continuing: She has met with or is expected to meet soon with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey Representative Xavier Becerra of California Julian Castro and Tom Perez, who both serve in President Obama’s cabinet and James G. Stavridis, a retired   Navy admiral, at her Washington home. She will also campaign on Thursday alongside another potential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, in his home state. Ms. Warren had initially handed over paperwork and met with the Washington lawyer overseeing Mrs. Clinton’s   search. And at a   joint rally in Cincinnati last month that fueled speculation about an   ticket, Ms. Warren drew loud applause for a stinging indictment of Mr. Trump as “a small, insecure money grubber. ” But any political necessity of putting Ms. Warren on the ticket to placate liberals diminished after Senator Bernie Sanders pledged to support Mrs. Clinton, and the progressive voters who flocked to his candidacy continued to coalesce around Mrs. Clinton. Some 63 percent of people who voted for Mr. Sanders during the Democratic primaries said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton in the fall, according to a CBS News poll conducted last month.",0
19097,Italy’s Last Bastion of Catalan Language Struggles to Keep It Alive - The New York Times,"ALGHERO, Italy  —   The first Catalans reached Sardinia in the 14th century, when troops sailed from the eastern coast of what is now Spain as part of an expansion into the Mediterranean. After an uprising slaughtered the forces garrisoned in this northern port on the island, King Peter IV expelled many of the locals. In their place, he populated Alghero mostly with convicts, prostitutes and other undesirables, many of them Catalans. Today, Alghero is a linguistic anomaly. This walled and picturesque city is, quite literally, the last bastion of Catalan in Italy. In an age when people cling ever more tightly to national identity, the lingering use of Catalan in Alghero is a reminder of the ways Mediterranean cultures have blended for centuries, rendering identity a fluid thing. But while the traditional insularity of Alghero has helped to preserve Catalan, the language is struggling to survive even here. Only about   of the 43, 000 inhabitants of Alghero speak Catalan as a main language, according to local officials. It is hardly spoken among younger people and barely taught in schools. Nearly a century ago, almost everyone spoke Catalan, according to a census conducted in 1921. “You can organize conferences, publish books and do many other things, but speaking is the only thing that really keeps a language alive,” said Sara Alivesi, a journalist who writes for the newspaper group behind Alghero’s only online publication in Catalan. “The sad reality is that I think people here have other worries and don’t value how much the language is really a unique characteristic of our city,” Ms. Alivesi said. After Sardinia was taken over by the   House of Savoy in 1720, eventually becoming part of what is   Italy, the Catalan language virtually disappeared on the island. Now, Catalan is not only overshadowed by Italian, but it must also compete for recognition with a handful of other languages and dialects, including the dominant indigenous language, Sardinian. Catalan is rarely heard on the streets in Alghero, though many signs are written in the language. Restaurants also label some of their dishes as Catalan, including a local version of paella. The language’s decline here stands in contrast to its status in the Iberian Peninsula, where it has seen  a revival  since the late 1970s, when Spain’s return to democracy ended a ban on Catalan imposed during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Franco’s ban did not snuff out the language. In fact, the private use of Catalan became a form of quiet resistance to the dictatorship. In Italy, meanwhile, the use of Catalan was neither prohibited nor encouraged. In 1999, Italy adopted a law to defend 12 historic minority languages, including Catalan. But local officials complain that it has not helped expand the use of the language, particularly within Italy’s heavily centralized education system. “The Italian education system has long spread the idea that it’s not useful and perhaps confusing to teach such a language alongside Italian,” said   Adell, who leads the office of the Catalan regional government in Alghero, which has the task of promoting Catalan culture. “It can be harder to overcome such an idea than oppression,” said Mr. Adell, whose office has a pile of unused Catalan textbooks. “The books are not lost and could still be used, whenever Catalan actually gets taught more here,” he added. As part of a trial state project, some schools in Alghero now offer lessons in Catalan. Three associations give weekly Catalan classes to about 150 adults, but they are run by volunteers and operate only half the year. Mr. Adell noted that some schoolchildren went on to study in Barcelona, the main city in Catalonia. But he acknowledged that, for Catalan to be safeguarded, “people have to start understanding that they risk losing a unique cultural treasure. ” Experts, however, sounded despondent about Catalan’s future in Alghero, and about the way the Italian authorities have handled minority languages in general. “For a certain period, they faked it, because it was politically correct to say that you wanted to enhance languages,” said Francesco Ballone, a local linguist who has a doctorate in applied phonetics from the Autonomous University of Barcelona. “Now, that period is finished. ” Still, some here are hoping to fan the embers of the language. Claudia Crabuzza, 41, a singer from Alghero, said she did not speak Catalan with her partner and their three children. But she decided to release her latest album this year in Catalan, and won one of Italy’s most prestigious music awards in the process. She recorded her songs in Catalonia, with musicians from Spain’s northeastern region. Learning Catalan, she hoped, would take her on a cultural and personal journey back to her roots. “Like many other people from my generation, I had grandparents who spoke Catalan, but the family language transmission was then broken once my parents spoke Italian to me,” Ms. Crabuzza said. “But I knew that I had Catalan deep inside me, like a treasure worth making the effort to rediscover,” she said, adding that Catalan enabled her to “express my feelings in a different and probably more intimate way than using Italian. ” But few seem to share Ms. Crabuzza’s passion for rediscovering their Catalan identity. Even if children are not taught Catalan at school, some could still learn the language from older residents like Gavino Monte, 80, who keeps fit by cycling around the city every morning. Mr. Monte said that he spoke only Algherese, which is what the locals call their dialect of Catalan, to his five grandchildren. “It should stay our family language,” he said.",0

Oil prices eased on Tuesday, paring earlier gains as voting in the U.S. presidential election got underway, in line with a retreat in U.S. stock index futures and a pickup in the dollar. In a swell of investor risk appetite, U.S. stocks racked up their biggest one-day gain since March on Monday, but this boost, which lifted oil, copper and European equities earlier on Tuesday faded. The most recent polls have put Democrat Hillary Clinton ahead of Republican rival Donald Trump in Tuesday's election. Clinton is seen by investors as offering greater certainty and stability. Brent January crude oil futures were down 19 cents at $45.96 a barrel by 1308 GMT, off a session peak of $46.69, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 22 cents to $44.67, after the U.S. dollar pared losses and S&P futures turned negative.

19102,Here's What I'll Do the Day After Election Day,"License DMCA 
I am currently working as hard as I can to see that Donald Trump is defeated, that Hillary Clinton is elected president, and that Democrats gain control of the US House and Senate. The day after the election, working with millions of grass-roots activists, I intend to do everything possible to make certain that the new president and Congress implement the Democratic platform, the most progressive agenda of any major political party in the history of the United States. 
That agenda includes overturning the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expanding Social Security, breaking up ""too-big-to-fail banks,"" making public colleges and universities tuition-free for the middle class, and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. It also includes pay equity for women, a new approach toward trade, aggressive action to combat climate change, raising taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, lowering prescription drug prices, a significant movement toward universal health care, and major reforms in our criminal justice and immigration systems. 
If this election has taught us anything, it is that the American people are sick and tired of the economic, political, and media status quo. They are tired of a rigged economy in which millions work longer hours for lower wages while 52 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. They are tired of billionaires like Trump and large profitable corporations not paying a nickel in federal income taxes while the middle class pays their fair share to support governmental services. They are tired of a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires like the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and others to spend hundreds of millions to elect candidates who will represent the wealthy and the powerful. They are tired of corporate media that focus on political gossip and look at elections as personality contests, rather than provide for a serious discussion of the major crises facing our country. 
The anger and frustration of the American people, all across the political spectrum, is palpable. They want a government that represents the needs of working families and not just billionaires. They want bold action to rebuild the shrinking middle class, not inside-the-beltway palliatives written by corporate lobbyists. 
At a time of massive political discontent, when millions not only are contemptuous of the major political parties but are also actually giving up on democracy, we need a new administration that has both vision and courage. We need vision from the top to point the way toward a new America that is more inclusive and egalitarian -- which boldly addresses income and wealth inequality, poverty, and the needs of the uninsured. We need an administration that has the courage to take on the powerful special interests -- corporate America, Wall Street, the insurance and drug companies, the fossil fuel industry -- who stand in the way of real change and whose greed is destroying this country. - Advertisement - 
There is no moral excuse for the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, for one family (the Waltons) having more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of our population, for the number of billionaires increasing by ten-fold since 2000 while we continue to have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any industrialized country on earth. 
There is no rational reason why we remain the only major country not to guarantee health care to all as a right or provide paid family and medical leave, or why we have more people in jail than any other country on earth at the same time as we have outrageously high levels of youth unemployment in minority communities. 
Too many Americans are living in despair and hopelessness. Too many of our brothers and sisters are turning to drugs, alcohol and suicide to avoid the painful economic realities of their lives. Too many others are turning to rage and bigotry as they try to make sense of their declining standard of living. 
At a time of hateful political division, a new president can bring our people together by leading and appointing an administration that will fight for working people. We need a secretary of treasury who is prepared to take on the greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street, not someone who comes from Wall Street or will leave office to go to Wall Street. We need a trade representative who understands that our current trade policies have failed, and that we must adopt a trade approach that represents workers and not the CEOs of large corporations. We need an attorney general who is prepared to vigorously enforce antitrust laws and prosecute bankers and corporate leaders who break the law. 
This is an historic and pivotal moment in American history. Now is the time for our next president to rally the American people against Wall Street and corporate greed and stand up vigorously for the declining middle class. - Advertisement -",0

19107,SWEDEN HELP WANTED: Activities Coordinator for bored illegal alien Muslim freeloaders and rapists,"SWEDEN HELP WANTED: Activities Coordinator for bored illegal alien Muslim freeloaders and rapists Muslim illegal alien invaders taking up space in Sweden and living off the government dole, say they are vandalizing and burning cars (not to mention gang-raping Swedish girls) because they do not have enough “activities” to keep them busy. Friatider “It is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here,” one of the illegals living in Skallberget in Vasteras writes in a letter to the editor in the local newspaper VLT. Vasteras has recently been subjected to a long series of car fires. The submitter tries the young man, who wishes to remain anonymous, explain what the phenomenon is due. He writes that he came to Sweden when he was young and admittedly had “good potential” but that he was subject to persistent “racism” by the authorities. (What “race” is Islam?) “Already at an early age became a man treated differently. Sometimes it was because of ethnicity, sometimes because they were at a certain place, and sometimes just to those very people who were in power felt to fuck with us. So many times I had been propped up against the wall and strip-searched in front of my loved ones. It really depressed me and my value, “he writes. The man writes that the young people in the area feel “oppressed” and that they are burning cars to “get the environment to react and listen.” Among other things, he complains that the objectives of the local football field does not have a network and that it is not organized enough “activities” for young people. “In short, it is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here. There is neither good fellowship, activities and things / objects we can make use of.” Submitters have received several responses from readers who are critical of the reasoning. “It’s just a matter of time before someone of obtained or ‘the others’ die if this continues.

19109,Tiny Homes Banned in U.S. at Increasing Rate as Govt Criminalizes Sustainable Living,". Tiny Homes Banned in U.S. at Increasing Rate as Govt Criminalizes Sustainable Living As the corporatocracy tightens its grip on the masses – finding ever more ways to funnel wealth to t... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/tiny-homes-banned-in-us-at-increasing.html As the corporatocracy tightens its grip on the masses – finding ever more ways to funnel wealth to the top – humanity responds in a number of ways, including the rising popularity of tiny houses. These dwellings, typically defined as less than 500 square feet, are a way for people to break free of mortgages, taxes, utility bills and the general trappings of “stuff.” They’re especially attractive to millennials and retirees, or those seeking to live off-grid. But government and corporations depend on rampant consumerism and people being connected to the grid.Seeking actual freedom through minimalist living should seem like a natural fit for the American dream, but the reality is that many governments around the country either ban tiny homes or force them to be connected to the utility grid.“As of now, few cities allow stand-alone tiny houses. Most communities have minimum square footage requirements for single-family homes mandating that smaller dwellings be an “accessory” to a larger, traditional house. “Many also have rules requiring that dwellings be hooked up to utilities, which is a problem for tiny-house enthusiasts who want to live off the grid by using alternative energy sources such as solar panels and rainwater catchment systems.” Some of the more recent examples of explicit bans include Etowah, TN and Wasilla, AK , which don’t allow homes less than 600 square feet and 700 square feet, respectively. Boise, ID doesn’t allow homes less than a few hundred square feet, as Shaun Wheeler of Wheeler Homes found when he built a perfectly good and safe 310 sq. ft. home. Lawmakers spout slippery slope fallacies, saying that allowing tiny homes will lead to decay and “unsightly little cabins plunked down next to traditional homes.” Using government force to stamp out societal change in response to financial factors is this councilman’s idea of conservatism. Granted, some cities are actually encouraging tiny homes as a means of freedom or as a solution to homelessness, as in Detroit, MI . Some Los Angeles lawmakers don’t see it that way , calling tiny homes for the homeless “a threat in many ways to our public safety.” Wasilla residents are baffled by the tiny home ban, which seems to run contrary to Alaska’s wild and free nature. Tundra Tiny Houses is leading a new market of small home construction using renewable energy, and now they’ll have to tell customers Wasilla is not an option, in addition to Anchorage to Eagle River. A big priority for tiny home dwellers is their reduced environmental impact. Many are capable of producing all their own energy from solar and wind, collecting rainwater and reusing graywater. Not depending on utility inputs naturally makes a lot of sense, especially for a tiny home on wheels. Even those who put their tiny home on a piece of land away from crowded spaces – with the intention of living off-grid through renewable inputs – are considered outlaws if they don’t hook to the utility grid. This of course ensures that utility companies, which are big donors to political campaigns and profit immensely from government-enabled monopolies, will always get their cut from every household. In January we reported that sunny Nevada essentially killed its solar industry by increasing their tax on solar customers by 40 percent, causing solar providers to leave the state. The only beneficiary was NV Energy, whose energy monopoly was protected. Spur, TX was the first city to advertise being “tiny house friendly” as a “town that welcomes new pioneers”– proudly supporting “reducing costs and gaining freedom to operate according to your own plan, unfettered by onerous and unnecessary costs.” To have this “freedom,” you must secure your properly permitted tiny home to an approved foundation and be connected to city utilities. The property must always be mowed and the prime responsibility is “of course, paying your taxes!” “When cities require the same permitting for tiny houses on foundations as they do for traditional houses, it often doesn’t make financial sense to build tiny. “At that point it’s really more of a lifestyle choice than an economic choice,” said Nick Krautter, a real estate agent in Portland, Oregon, who abandoned plans for a tiny house development. 23-year-old college graduate, Sarah Hastings, built a 190-square-foot home on three acres of farmland in Hadley, MA, complete with a garden next to it. But the town found she was not in compliance with zoning ordinances, and now her home is in storage. Hastings proposed a change to the town’s laws to allow for her tiny home, but the measure was vote down “because some residents were afraid the town would be overrun with them.” There will be no minimalist, environmentally friendly living in Hadley. Clearly, the emergence of tiny homes is being met with fear, and the resulting banishment of freedom, by too many towns and cities across America that can’t quite fathom this shift in the way people think about living. It’s one thing to be concerned about safety issues, but the imposition of minimum square footage requirements and mandatory connections to city utilities is mindless authoritarianism. Let’s hope places like Fresno, CA and Rockledge, FL, which are specifically allowing tiny homes on wheels, can help their more “traditional” counterparts embrace the future.

19110,Politico: Democrats in the Wilderness - Breitbart,"The 2016 presidential election was a day reckoning for the Democratic party. According to an article in Politico, the party is experiencing unfathomable desolation and dissolution from which they are neither prepared nor equipped to recover:  As Trump takes over the GOP and starts remaking its new identity as a nationalist, populist party, creating a new political pole in American politics for the first time in generations, all eyes are on the Democrats. How will they confront a suddenly awakened, and galvanized, white majority? What’s to stop Trump from doing whatever he wants? Who’s going to pull a coherent new vision together? Worried liberals are watching with trepidation, fearful that Trump is just the beginning of worse to come, desperate for a comeback strategy that can work. What’s clear from interviews with several dozen top Democratic politicians and operatives at all levels, however, is that there is no comeback strategy —  just a collection of   ideas, all of them challenged by reality. And for whatever scheme they come up with, Democrats don’t even have a  . Barack Obama? He doesn’t want the job. Hillary Clinton? Too damaged. Bernie Sanders? Too socialist. Joe Biden? Too tied to Obama. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer? Too Washington. Elizabeth Warren? Maybe. And all of them old, old, old. The Democrats’ desolation is staggering. But part of the problem is that it’s easy to point to signs that maybe things aren’t so bad. After all, Clinton did beat Trump by 2. 8 million votes, Obama’s approval rating is nearly 60 percent, polls show Democrats way ahead of the GOP on many issues and demographics suggest that gap will only grow. But they are stuck in the minority in Congress with no end in sight, have only 16 governors left and face 32 state legislatures fully under GOP control. Their top leaders in the House are all over 70. Their top leaders in the Senate are all over 60. Under Obama, Democrats have lost 1, 034 seats at the state and federal level —  there’s no bench, no bench for a bench, virtually no one able to speak for the party as a whole.

19111,For All Democrats to Ponder: the Real Reasons Hillary Clinton Lost,"For All Democrats to Ponder: the Real Reasons Hillary Clinton Lost Beyond the media spin, the four reasons for this defeat. By Tony Brasunas / medium.com As the aphorism goes, if we don’t learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. While the corporate media continues to peddle hysteria, the most important thing right now is to rationally understand why Clinton and the Democrats lost this eminently winnable 2016 race for the White House. Having taken some time to look back over the past six months, I list below what I believe are the four main underlying reasons for this defeat. As it turns out, none of the reasons is particularly complicated, but each will require consideration and systemic change by the party over the next two years. 1. The DNC subverted democracy. This was an anti-establishment year in politics, and there was an anti-establishment candidate running in both major parties. Trump was (barely) allowed to win the primary on the Republican side. On the Democratic side, despite Bernie’s obvious strength and the clear preference of the grassroots, the primary was rigged to put the less popular, establishment candidate forward. It was a colossal risk to take, but the party leadership in the DNC chose to advance their favored candidate so as to maintain their power inside the party and their fundraising with big banks and supranational corporations. The risk backfired. Free and fair democracy would have given Bernie the nomination, likely the White House, and even better, leadership in an expanding and exciting party positioned to win elections for years to come. 2. The media and the DNC deliberately elevated Trump. The wikileaks reveal that the DNC chose to deliberately use the Clinton campaign and the media to elevate Trump (as well as Ted Cruz and Ben Carson) as a candidate, thinking he would be the easiest to beat. They utilized this “pied piper” strategy for months. This was another colossal risk the DNC took, and it backfired horribly. Partly in tandem with the DNC — but largely of their own volition — the corporate media lavished hour upon hour of free coverage on Trump, daily, for a solid year. It is the height of irony today for corporate media pundits to bemoan with shock and consternation Trump’s victory, when his candidacy is truly their creation. If any candidate receives hours of coverage by the major media, for free, every single night, for a year, he or she will win elections, and possibly the presidency. 3. Clinton ran a weak and uninspired campaign. Once she had the nomination, Clinton ran a campaign without an inspiring message — other than perhaps voting for a woman for president. She courted conservatives like the Bushes, the Kochs, and Henry Kissinger, she picked corporate centrists for vice president and other prominent roles, she never connected with a base that after all of Bernie’s amazing campaigning was ripe for engagement, and she turned her back on progressive issues time and again. She stopped talking about climate change and racial justice and corruption in government, and she never addressed the pressing progressive issues of the day, such as Standing Rock and TPP. Seemingly she hoped to coast to victory with little more than platitudes and scare-tactics about Russians reminiscent of the 1950s. All of this while barely escaping two FBI indictments. She became a weak and unpopular candidate holding on to a narrow lead merely because Trump was so ridiculously bad. Trump’s inadequacy as a candidate masked the weaknesses in Clinton’s sinking campaign. For its part, as a slogan, “Stronger Together” never resonated with people who haven’t recovered yet from the Great Recession and who continue to get by with less everyday; indeed for poor and working class people who feel on the outside of the country’s latest wealth generation, this slogan seemed at best ironic and at worst to deliberately exclude them. 4. The complete failure of neoliberalism. This is perhaps the most important thing to understand. Trump didn’t win because of racism; that only got him, generously, 20% of the vote. Trump won by — like Bernie — offering everyday people an alternative to the utterly failed policies of neoliberalism. Not to scare you with this big word, but we are hearing (hopefully) the final death knell of the fancy idea, born under the Clintons, that the country could pass corporate-supremacy laws, call them “free trade” deals, and allow corporations to seek the cheapest, least regulated labor, anywhere in the world, and leave the country that supports these corporations high and dry. It’s a fabulous deal for corporations — their profits have soared — but it’s a wretched deal for working class people, the environment, unions, towns and cities, and long-term national sovereignty for the nations of the earth. People were bound to finally wake up to this, and now they have. If you don’t know what the TPP is, please go learn; Hillary and Obama want to pass this crown jewel of corporate supremacy; Bernie and Trump oppose it. There are your real reasons. Getting this right does matter, so let me know if I’ve missed anything. Honorable mentions not making the top four: Fraudulent voter purges in Florida and Ohio that favored Republicans. Voting machine election fraud. More research on this topic forthcoming. The electoral college. Clinton did win the popular vote nationwide but will lose the count of state delegates in this undemocratic system. Independent voters, progressive voters, and libertarian voters who didn’t vote, or who voted for other candidates because the DNC’s candidate didn’t inspire them should be considered symptoms of the above, not reasons unto themselves. If you run an unpopular candidate on a platform of failed policies and simultaneously elevate your opponent, you will lose any remotely fair democratic election. If you run an unpopular candidate on a platform of failed policies and simultaneously elevate your opponent, you will lose. The question now is whether the Democratic Party can right its ship and finally turn away from neoliberalism and corrupt corporate politics. Can the DNC, over the next two years, relinquish its corrupt role in guiding the party and allow the grassroots to return the party to its best historic role as genunine representatives for poor and working class people, the environment, democracy, and the rule of law? Personally I’m skeptical , but I am ready and happy to be proven wrong. Liberals, progressives, and peaceful revolutionaries of all stripes: There are many more battles ahead. Keep fighting, keep learning, and above all keep paying attention. We must learn from this election so as not to repeat it. Tony Brasunas - Where rationalism and idealism meet. 0.0 ·",0
19112,Erdogan Checks in with Obama Before Bombing Syria,"Erdogan Checks in with Obama Before Bombing Syria October 27, 2016 Erdogan Checks in with Obama Before Bombing Syria 
Turkey's military operation in northern Syria will target the town of Manbij, recently liberated from ISIS by Kurdish-led forces, and the jihadists' stronghold of Raqqa, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday. In a speech in Ankara broadcast live, Erdogan said he had informed U.S. President Barack Hussein Obama about his plans for the operation in a telephone call. Syrian rebels, backed by Turkish warplanes, tanks and artillery, launched an operation dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"" in August to push Islamic State and Kurdish militia forces away from the border area of northern Syria. In a speech in Ankara broadcast live, Erdogan said he had informed U.S. President Barack Obama about his plans for the operation in a telephone call on Wednesday. Before Manbij and Raqqa, the operation will target the town of al-Bab, he said. 
(ANKARA) - Turkey has been angered at Washington's support for the Kurdish YPG militia in its battle against ISIS in Syria, with Ankara regarding it as a hostile force with deep ties to Kurdish militants fighting in southeast Turkey. 
A top U.S. military commander said on Wednesday YPG fighters will be included in the force to isolate Raqqa. Arab forces, and not Kurdish ones, are expected to be the ones to take the city itself, U.S. officials say.

Defence Minister Fikri Isik told state broadcaster TRT on Thursday that Turkey had asked the United States not to allow the YPG to enter Raqqa, saying it was ready to provide the necessary military support to take over the town. 
Erdogan also said that the Iraqi region of Sinjar, west of Mosul, was on its way to becoming a new base for Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants and that Turkey would not allow this to happen.

19114,Border Patrol Union: Trump’s Border Plan ’Gives Us the Tools We Need’,"As President Donald J. Trump prepares to kick off his new border security plan, various news outlets have begun to criticize the effort by focusing on the border wall. However, members from the union representing the men and women from the U. S. Border Patrol stated that the proposal comes from listening to agents instead of politicians. [Various outlets have continued to question the notion of building a border wall and have focused on the perceived challenges of such an enterprise. Other outlets have criticized the effectiveness of the measure claiming that it does not address the current immigration crisis. The various news organizations have failed to mention the complete control that Mexican drug cartels have over human smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and other illicit activities along both sides of the border.  The executive orders that President Trump will be signing provides border security agents with the tools that they have been denied for too long, said Hector Garza, a U. S. Border Patrol agent and the President for the Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council. As part of the union’s leadership, Garza is able to speak about issues affecting the men and women that he represents. Despite the many misconceptions by pundits and individuals who have not been to the border, a wall with the addition of new manpower, surveillance technology and other equipment will be an effective tool in slowing down illegal immigration and drug smuggling, Garza said.  “We know we won’t have a wall along the 2, 000 miles of border,” he said. “What we will have is a wall where it is needed.

19115,"Dish Network and Viacom Sign a Deal, Ending a Standoff - The New York Times","Dish Network wanted its MTV after all. On Thursday morning, Dish, the satellite TV provider, and Viacom announced that they had struck a multiyear agreement for Dish to continue to carry Viacom’s bundle of television networks, averting a threatened blackout. Dish’s 14 million customers will have uninterrupted access to 18 Viacom channels, including MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. In addition, select Viacom content will be added to Dish’s Sling TV streaming services, which offer a slimmer bundle of networks starting at $20 a month.   packages for specific genres of programming also are available for an additional monthly fee. Specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. Striking the agreement was especially crucial for Viacom, which has faced several business woes in recent months. The company has reported persistently weak earnings and faced questions over its management. The looming threat that Dish could drop Viacom channels from its service added to the uncertainty about the company’s fate. The announcement that Dish and Viacom had reached an agreement reassured investors, as more than 80 percent of the company’s distribution is now locked up with   deals. In the last year, Viacom has closed   domestic distribution agreements with a series of satellite and cable companies, including ATT, Charter, Frontier, Mediacom and others that represent more than 44 million total subscribers. Viacom’s stock surged with the news. By midday Thursday, Viacom shares were up nearly 10 percent. Shares in Dish Network were about flat. “Today’s renewal, together with several additional affiliate agreements announced over the past year, will enable Viacom to drive growth and deliver better, more engaging viewer experiences for years to come,” Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, said in a statement. Viacom said that the various distribution deals would fuel growth in the company’s affiliate revenue  —   the money it receives from cable, satellite and other digital distributors  —   in the “solid   ” rates in 2017 and beyond. In February, Viacom set off investor concern when it cut expectations for affiliate revenue growth to the “low    range” for the 2016 fiscal year after previously stating that it would be in the high single digits. Charles W. Ergen, chief executive of Dish, said in a statement that the deal extended a nearly   relationship between the companies. “We appreciate Viacom’s willingness to continue with us on our journey as we work to deliver the best, most innovative television services available,” he said.",0
19116,Bill Simmons Prepares to Stand Up to Sports Incorporated - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Corporate media giants always want what’s cool and edgy until what’s cool and edgy threatens the status quo that keeps the billions flooding in. The comedian Bill Maher was the textbook case for the bygone era of the   universe, after ABC bought his hit show, “Politically Incorrect,” away from Comedy Central. Just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Maher said that it was wrong to refer to the hijackers as cowards, and that the United States was more cowardly for its strategy of going after enemies with cruise missiles from afar. The White House denounced him, advertisers and affiliates flipped out, and a few months later ABC cut him loose. HBO swept in to give him a   home where he continues to joke, inform and offend to this day. I headed West last week to investigate what looked to me like a   version of the Maher tale, involving something more powerful than the White House: the National Football League. In this case, our protagonist, Bill Simmons, is not a bitingly funny comedian, but a bitingly influential sportswriter and commentator, who for 14 years was one of ESPN’s biggest stars. ESPN, which spends some $1. 9 billion a year for N. F. L. rights, let Mr. Simmons go last year, after he repeatedly, and colorfully, criticized Roger Goodell, the N. F. L. commissioner, over his handling of two embarrassing scandals  —   the New England Patriots’ alleged cheating case, known as “Deflategate,” and the league’s lackluster domestic violence investigation of the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. Once again, HBO swept in, giving Mr. Simmons a new talk show about sports and pop culture called “Any Given Wednesday” that makes its debut on June 22. And this month Mr. Simmons introduced his new multimedia company, The Ringer, whose main site is inspired by the   sports and pop culture hub he founded at ESPN, Grantland, and features much of its main editorial team. Mr. Maher’s story was about government’s potential to chill free speech during war and the redemptive power of television when it is freed from advertising pressures. Mr. Simmons’s situation is a bit more complicated, especially when you take ESPN’s version of it into account, which I’ll get to. But it does raise questions about how media conglomerates that rely on the N. F. L. for ratings and revenue handle criticism of the league as it faces deepening concerns about its culture and the health of its players. Yet, Mr. Simmons’s story also offers hope that firebrands like him can find ways to operate independently at this opportune time in media. When I visited Mr. Simmons in his suite at the Sunset Gower Studios last week, he was excited for his fresh start, but still a little raw about ESPN. He had just issued a public apology to his old colleagues there for his quote in The Hollywood Reporter asking, “Who would work there that you respect right now?” “I read it and I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t feel that way, I wish I hadn’t said that,’” Mr. Simmons said. The incident played into criticism from ESPN executives that Mr. Simmons can be petulant and disrespectful of rival colleagues. Yet it was also in keeping with the   style that ESPN hired him for. Mr. Simmons, 46, came to ESPN from AOL’s Boston “Digital City” site, where he wrote a column called “Boston’s Sports Guy. ” In that job, he could not get press passes, he said, because, “It was the internet. They were like, ‘What? No. ’” So he set out to write about sports the way he was watching them, on the tube, and in the brutally honest and sometimes   language of the sports bar  —   as an outsider. It meant breaking from tradition with contemporary pop culture references (if a scene from “90210” came to mind, he’d say so) praise for players he loved, contempt for owners, players and commissioners he didn’t. ESPN first noticed him after he eviscerated the company’s own sports awards program, the ESPYs, which he called a “TV holocaust. ” Over all, it was a fruitful relationship that earned him accolades and made him millions. He starred on “NBA Countdown,” helped to create the successful ESPN documentary series “30 for 30” and founded Grantland, which earned three national magazine award nominations in 2015. His podcast, “The B. S. Report,” was ESPN’s most popular. Yet Mr. Simmons’s   feral side often broke glass inside ESPN, which blanched at some of his stunts  —   a porn star in his fantasy basketball league?  —   and twice banned him from using Twitter after he wrote posts criticizing colleagues. Things started falling apart after Mr. Simmons called Mr. Goodell “a liar” for saying the league had not known what was contained in a damning video of Mr. Rice punching his fiancée unconscious when it initially handed Mr. Rice a light,   suspension. (The tape had been leaked to TMZ.) Mr. Simmons followed that by daring ESPN to “Call me and say I’m in trouble. ” His   suspension followed. Mr. Simmons says he now regrets the dare. But, he said, he was just fulfilling his role as a “disrupter,” if an imperfect one. That was what he planned to tell Disney’s chief executive, Robert A. Iger  —   a proponent of disruption  —   when he went to Mr. Iger’s office several months after his suspension. Mr. Simmons did not get to make his point. “He was like, ‘You know, when you go after Roger, it’s really hard for us we want you to do it respectfully,’” Mr. Simmons said of Mr. Iger’s counsel. “And I was like, ‘I think that’s fair. I can be relentless on him but I’ve got to do it respectfully. ”’ “Respectfully” is not what came to mind when, a few weeks later, Mr. Simmons questioned Mr. Goodell’s “testicular fortitude” in his handling of Deflategate. The next day, ESPN’s president, John Skipper, announced that Mr. Simmons’ contract would not be renewed. Mr. Simmons says he wonders if something else was at play. A few months after his ouster, Mr. Iger emerged as a champion of a proposed new stadium near Los Angeles that would have been shared by the San Diego Chargers and a relocated Oakland Raiders team  —   with an option to buy a stake in either team. “One of my working theories was, maybe this was driven by Iger because he wants a team. ” Disney declined to comment. But when I reached out to ESPN for a response, Mr. Skipper sent me this: “Bill would rather spin conspiracy theories and be perceived as a martyr than take responsibility for his own actions. Let me be unequivocal and clear and take responsibility for my actions: I alone made the decision, and it had nothing to do with his comments about the commissioner. I severed our relationship with Bill because of his repeated lack of respect for this company and, more importantly, the people who work here. ” The network, which has beefed up its investigative reporting staff in recent years, also disputed any notion that it goes easy on the N. F. L. sending me citations for some 70 critical items about the league. And the “Outside the Lines” investigation of the Rice case by Don Van Natta Jr. and Kevin Van Valkenburg, which influenced Mr. Simmons by describing “a pattern of misinformation and misdirection” at the league, was as tough as they come. That work is definitely worth noting. But so is ESPN’s decision in 2013 to withdraw from a   documentary with “Frontline” about the N. F. L. ’s “concussion crisis” under pressure from the league, as my colleagues James Andrew Miller and Ken Belson reported then. (ESPN denied it was buckling to the N. F. L.) Surely, when a large part of your business rests with the most powerful sports league in the country, you’re probably going to watch your p’s and q’s. Mr. Simmons said he came up against this when he was seeking new partners and met with Showtime’s president, David Nevins, and Mr. Nevins’s boss, the CBS chairman Les Moonves. “I really liked Moonves, and he was totally honest,” Mr. Simmons said. “He was just like, you know, this is my biggest partner”  —   meaning the N. F. L. “I can’t figure out how we would make this work. ” CBS had no comment. One presumes neither Mr. Moonves nor Mr. Iger would ask their news divisions to stand down from real N. F. L. reporting. And ESPN says it keeps a “church and state” wall between business and journalism. But where’s the line between being “respectful” and being overly sparing with necessary criticism? The question is important, given the current national discussion about football and concussions. That conversation is taking place in a media environment in which the N. F. L. is that rare content producer that can deliver huge audiences for live programming, where the power of the   ad endures. Expelled from the monolith, Mr. Simmons is undergoing recovery in a media market hungry for fresh programming. “I’m a proven content maker at a time when it’s great to be that,” he said. Mr. Simmons says he will cover a range of topics, including football, when he joins the same program lineup as Mr. Maher on HBO  —   a network with no commercials, no boundaries and no slate of N. F. L. games.",0
19117,New Ontario Law Enables Gov’t to Seize Children from Parents Opposing Gender Transition,"The Canadian government may legally remove children from families that refuse to accept their child’s chosen “gender identity” thanks to new legislation passed by the Ontario province. [Bill 89, “Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act, 2017,” was approved on June 1 by a vote of 63 to 23.  The Minister of Children and Youth Services, Michael Coteau, who introduced the bill, said earlier this year that a parent’s failure to recognize and support a child’s gender   is a form of child abuse, and a child in these circumstances should be removed from the situation and placed into protection. “I would consider that a form of abuse, when a child identifies one way and a caregiver is saying no, you need to do this differently,” Coteau said. “If it’s abuse, and if it’s within the definition, a child can be removed from that environment and placed into protection where the abuse stops. ” The new bill replaces the Child and Family Services Act, or Bill 28, which governed child protection, foster care and adoption services. While “gender identity” and “gender expression” are included in the new legislation as important factors to be considered in determining “the best interests of the child,” the religious faith in which the parents are raising the child —  present in former laws —  has been removed from consideration for assessing the child’s best interests. Child protection agents, adoption service providers and judges are now required to take into account and respect a child’s “race, ancestry, place of origin, color, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. ” The former law stated that the parent of a child in care has the right “to direct the child’s education and religious upbringing. ” The new law has removed that consideration, saying parents can direct the child’s education and upbringing “in accordance with the child’s or young person’s creed, community identity and cultural identity. ” Some Christians have reacted strongly to the new bill, calling it a violation of parents’ primordial rights to educate their children and a direct assault on Christian beliefs. “With the passage of Bill 89, we’ve entered an era of totalitarian power by the state, such as never witnessed before in Canada’s history,” said Jack Fonseca, senior political strategist for Campaign Life Coalition. “Make no mistake, Bill 89 is a grave threat to Christians and all people of faith who have children, or who hope to grow their family through adoption. ” Canadian child protection services are no stranger to invasive micromanagement of   according to a predetermined worldview. In April of this year, a Christian couple filed a lawsuit against Hamilton Children’s Aid Society after two foster children were removed from their care because they refused tell the children that the Easter bunny is real. “We have a   policy,” said Derek Baars, one of the foster parents, as the motivation for disobeying a child support worker who ordered him and his wife to tell the two girls in their care, aged 3 and 4, that the Easter bunny is real. “We explained to the agency that we are not prepared to tell the children a lie. If the children asked, we would not lie to them, but we wouldn’t bring it up ourselves,” Baars said. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome",0
19118,Obama and E.U. Leaders Agree to Keep Sanctions on Russia - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   President Obama and several European leaders “unanimously agreed” on Friday to keep sanctions in place against Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, amid concern that   Donald J. Trump would soften the United States’ stance against Moscow. The show of solidarity came as American allies  —   and Ukrainians themselves  —   have been unsettled by uncertainty regarding what kind of foreign policy Mr. Trump will pursue. With surging populist movements straining alliances and Mr. Trump’s election upending the political calculations of many countries, Ukraine may be among the most vulnerable to the shifting political winds. Fighting in Ukraine has continued since Moscow stealthily fomented an uprising among ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine with the help of undercover Russian forces, and then annexed Crimea in March 2014. As a candidate and as   Mr. Trump has frequently expressed admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and a former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, previously worked for a former Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who is now exiled in Russia. Meeting in Berlin, Mr. Obama and the European leaders agreed that the sanctions should stay until Moscow upheld its pledge for a   and to withdraw heavy weapons from front lines in eastern Ukraine, according to the White House. Those in attendance on Friday included the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, François Hollande, as well as the prime ministers of Britain (Theresa May) Italy (Matteo Renzi) and Spain (Mariano Rajoy). The agreement on Ukraine followed remarks by Mr. Obama on Thursday warning Mr. Trump to “stand up” to Moscow when it violated international agreements. Ms. Merkel also reminded Russia that peace in Europe had been possible over the past several years only because all nations respected the boundaries drawn after World War II. Friday’s meeting concluded a weeklong visit to European allies by Mr. Obama, whose terms ends in January. But what was supposed to be a valedictory lap turned into an exercise in calming anxieties about the future of   relations spurred by the victory of Mr. Trump, who repeatedly called the NATO alliance into question during his election campaign. The group also discussed tensions in the Middle East, including the situation in Syria, the White House said. The leaders agreed that attacks on the city of Aleppo should be halted immediately, and they called on Russia and Iran to end their support for the government of President Bashar  . “On Syria, of course looking at Aleppo, we were united in our condemnation of the atrocities that are taking place there,” Mrs. May told reporters, standing alongside Ms. Merkel after Mr. Obama had departed. “We agreed the need to keep up pressure on Russia, including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law. ” That consensus, too, was another potential point of departure from the incoming Mr. Trump, who has signaled that he may side with Russia in backing the Assad government against the opponents trying to unseat it, including the Islamic State. After the meeting in Berlin, Mr. Obama left Germany for Latin America.",0
19119,Southern Cities Split With States on Social Issues - The New York Times,"JACKSON, Miss.  —   It was not that long ago that Victoria Fortenberry figured she would mark her 18th birthday by getting on a bus and getting out of Mississippi. But here she was,   tattooed and 19 years old, singing at a party for a new line of craft beer to a crowd that included her girlfriend. Ms. Fortenberry came here to attend a Christian college and found a place where she could be unashamedly Southern and openly gay in a way not possible in her conservative suburban hometown, or even in the Jackson of a decade ago. And so: “At some point,” she said, “I decided I won’t just leave. ” Jackson may not register nationally as an outpost of bohemianism or urbane liberalism. But its city government, which is majority black and Democratic, refuses to fly the   state flag at municipal buildings, and this month voted unanimously to oppose a new state law that creates special legal protections for opponents of   marriage. And it has a place for   singers  —   and their girlfriends. Jackson is among a group of Southern cities from Dallas to Durham, N. C. where the digital commons, economic growth and a rising cohort of millennials have helped remake the culture. Many of these cities have found themselves increasingly at odds with their states, and here in a region that remains the most conservative in the country, the conflicts are growing more frequent and particularly pitched. Fights are raging over gay rights here and in North Carolina, where a new law limits transgender bathroom access and   local governments from passing their own   ordinances. The resistance has been fierce in North Carolina, where companies have called off expansion plans and Ringo Starr and Bruce Springsteen have canceled concerts. The potential consequences of these boycotts point up the complications, though: In a South dominated by the politics of rural and suburban conservatives, a canceled rock concert or technology project is likely to punish the places that oppose the legislation, and have little effect on the areas that support it. “We’ve got this divide,” said Ferrel Guillory, the director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “The divide between the cultural conservatism of older suburbs and older rural areas, and these new, thriving, modern economy, diverse cities. ” The skirmishes over gay rights are only part of the growing rift between Southern cities, with their mostly Democratic municipal governments, and Southern state legislatures, which have come to be dominated by Republicans. Lawmakers in Alabama recently blocked cities from setting their own minimum wages, while Charlotte and Jackson have fought with the states over control of their airports. North Carolina’s Republican legislature has redrawn city council districts and tried to stop municipalities from becoming “sanctuary cities” for immigrants. The Arkansas and Tennessee legislatures have passed laws that, like North Carolina’s, ban local   ordinances that differ from state law. This version of a civil war even extends to the Civil War. Alabama is considering a law that would prevent local jurisdictions from removing Confederate symbols without state approval. Similar efforts were proposed but have so far failed in Virginia and Louisiana. But Southern cities have pushed back with vigor. Birmingham tried to go forward with a minimum wage law even after the state made it clear it would be overruled. Several cities in Arkansas passed   ordinances despite the state law that was meant to ban them. Across Mississippi, cities, counties and public institutions have responded to the Legislature’s unwillingness to take the Confederate battle cross out of the state flag by refusing to fly the flag altogether. For decades, the cultural gap between Southern cities and cities on the East and West Coasts has been narrowing to the point where the cultural riches of a place like Oxford, Miss.  —   with its literary scene and high end regional cuisine  —   are almost taken for granted. But commerce and the Internet have pushed global sophistication into new frontiers. In Starkville, Miss. an unassuming college town that Oxford sophisticates deride with the ironic nickname “StarkVegas,” a coffee bar called   serves an affogato prepared with espresso from Intelligentsia, the vaunted artisanal coffee brand. With these cultural markers have come expressions of unblushing liberalism that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. In January, Bernie Sanders drew thousands to a rally in Birmingham, Ala. Last June, after the Supreme Court affirmed the right to   marriage, the city government in Knoxville, Tenn. lit up a bridge in rainbow colors. The result has been a kind of overlapping series of secessions, with states trying to safeguard themselves from national cultural trends and federal mandates, and cities increasingly trying to carve out their own places within the states. All of this exasperates conservative lawmakers like State Senator Bart Hester, an Arkansas Republican, who says he is constantly playing defense against a rapidly changing culture. “Ten years ago, no one would have ever imagined someone would have deserved protections under civil rights because they didn’t know what gender they were,” he said. His biggest frustrations, he continued, are dealing with municipalities, on everything from gay rights to taxes. “It just shocks me every day how different our opinions and basic core values are,” he said. Fourteen of the 20   metro areas in the nation between 2010 and 2015 were in the South, according to an analysis of census data by the Institute for Southern Studies. That boom has not been driven by heavy industry, but by banking, insurance, health care and, increasingly, technology. Mr. Guillory, at the University of North Carolina, noted that the companies fueling the booms are often national or global, and cannot afford to brook sentiments that even begin to smack of bigotry. “It isn’t that these cities are elevating New Deal liberalism,” he said. “It’s much more of a cultural political liberalism. It’s a different kind of mixture. ” At a rally on Wednesday at the Mississippi state Capitol, thousands came in on church buses from around the state to hear the Rev. Franklin Graham, the evangelist, inveigh against   marriage and secularism. Greg Smith, 64, who had come to the rally from Tylertown, did not see any fundamental change in the fact that many Mississippians, even some Republican mayors, had come out against the new law. They just feared losing out on the almighty dollar, he said. “I think the state’s basically conservative, but we’ve let money become our god,” Mr. Smith said. Melvin Priester Jr. a member of the Jackson City Council, did not agree. “It’s a completely different world,” he said, recalling how he returned home several years ago to find artists and musicians not all that different from friends in his adopted San Francisco. “Technology has ended the isolation. ” Mr. Priester, who is black, also described how gay communities in Deep South cities have steadily gained allies among urban black leaders, many of whom had traditionally been skeptical of the gay rights movement. In Greensboro, N. C. Sharon Hightower, an   council member, joined in an    vote recently for a resolution condemning the state law limiting bathroom access. “We know what it’s like to be discriminated against,” she said. Still, many evangelical blacks remain hesitant to support the gamut of socially liberal causes. And indeed even some of the trendiest Southern cities have a strong traditionalist streak. The city of Chattanooga, a hub of tech activity, handily rejected an ordinance establishing domestic partner benefits in 2014 Houston voted three times for an openly gay mayor, and then last fall voted overwhelmingly against a broad   ordinance. But with liberals still outnumbered in most parts of the South, some worry that the boycotts and concert cancellations by opponents of certain state laws will end up doing the most economic harm to those who despise those laws. “The people who would go to those shows from a few hours away now aren’t going to go to the restaurants, or go to the bar and drink craft beer,” said Grayson Haver Currin, an editor of a North Carolina alternative weekly. He and his wife, Tina, recently started a website encouraging artists to keep their commitments in the state, but to donate proceeds to gay rights groups. On Monday afternoon in Raleigh, Carla Merritt, a transgender woman who has felt happy and accepted in this city, watched as hundreds of evangelicals  —   whom she called “the real country folk”  —   staged a boisterous rally on the Capitol lawn in favor of the new law that includes the provision limiting transgender bathroom access. Two days later, Ms. Merritt, over lunch at a downtown cafe, said she regretted using the words “country folk. ” “That sounded bigoted,” she said, “and I certainly didn’t mean it that way. ” That evening, the Currins were in front of the residence of Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, directing protesters who were blowing air horns to object to the new law. The Currins called it their “Air Horn Orchestra”  —   a piercing clamor of defiance that doubled, they said, as a homage to the   composers they love.",0
19120,When Does Our Consciousness Transform From Being Purely Intuitive to Linear Thought?,". When Does Our Consciousness Transform From Being Purely Intuitive to Linear Thought? Rather than looking at consciousness as belonging to a child or an adult, let us look at the idea of... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/when-does-our-consciousness-transform.html Rather than looking at consciousness as belonging to a child or an adult, let us look at the idea of consciousness being both an energy and at the same time a state of being. There are two states: one state is becoming, when we use the potential, the activity and the power to change what we are at present to something else. The other state is being. We become, we are.In consciousness both these possibilities exist, of becoming and of being, and these possibilities actualize themselves when in the right environment. When we are born, our consciousness is pure, without any influences or impressions of the present day environment.That pure consciousness remains with us in our young days until the age of eight. This state of consciousness is like a sponge, it is simply absorbing everything, absorbing the information received through the senses, absorbing the information received through the interactions, absorbing the information received through the intellectual and emotional inputs.In this manner the consciousness conditions itself to survive and to exist in this material plane.Until the age of eight, the information received by the consciousness is purely intuitive. Non-linear information, non-sequential information, is received — the idea of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. A child grows in our society conditioned to believe that happiness is perpetually postponed for tomorrow.When we begin our school education, a change happens in the pattern of consciousness and we begin a sequential learning process , a linear learning process. The moment the sequential and linear learning process begins, our personality changes. We become fixed in certain ideas, that A comes before B, C follows B, and in this way an understanding is developed. That understanding is a very set understanding, and this is where the personality undergoes a major transformation in life.You can give consciousness any shape you want. The family contributes to giving shape to that consciousness. The culture in which we live, the social environment, the religious environment, the educational environment, all contribute to the formation of human consciousness.Development of consciousness in all levels — intuitive, spiritual, cultural, social, personal, psychic — happens before the age of eight, before the child actually joins the first class of primary school. The day we join the first class of primary school this development stops and linear development begins.The education received by consciousness until the age of eight is a system of impressions which superimpose themselves on consciousness. They are concepts of imprints left on the mind by experience. Many traditions and philosophies have greatly emphasized the need for greater awareness during our stages of spiritual development before the age of eight, because in your future life, when you grow up, when you are thirty or forty or sixty, you become that person. You express those qualities and habits which you imbibed before the age of eight. What you are today is what you were made before the age of eight. What you were made after the age of eight is seen in the degrees and diplomas you have in your homes, in your bags and in your workplaces. That is your qualification to survive in the world, which you received after the age of eight. But the nature, the mind and the responses of the mind, the ability to manage situations in life and to deal with people, all these abilities you gained in your childhood, in that subtle education which was imbibed by the consciousness.And it is this consciousness which has to be nurtured more and more.There is a different mind beyond the rational, intellectual mind, which we call the psychic mind, or the intuitive mind, or the higher mind. When that higher mind kicks in, the mental faculties open up and manifest. It is this nature which has to be cultivated in a child.It has been the experience of people who have been working with children for many years that the receptivity of children is much greater than that of grownups. They understand things in a different way and in a better way because their mind is not cluttered with impressions, ideas and concepts. Their mind is free. While saying a little, they understand a lot. There is the limitation that they are not able to express themselves, not able to convey what they desire or feel or need or want, but their mental frequencies are much higher than the pre-defined frequencies of grownups. Grownups function in pre-defined frequencies according to their education, but children are intuitive. The main thrust of yoga education for children is to provide them with the appropriate consciousness which can be useful for them in their lives. Classification of Consciousness Normal consciousness is classified in four compartments: Waking, dreaming, sleeping and spiritually awakened. But the consciousness of children functions at a different level, at the intuitive level, until the age of eight. So for children the classification is different. It is intuitive and awake, intuitive and dreaming, intuitive and sleeping and intuitive and creative. This is the division of consciousness in a child.That is the major difference between a child's expression of the conscious faculties and a grownup's expression of the conscious faculties. In the course of time psychologists and psychoanalysts will come to this understanding that the consciousness of children has a different set, which is the flowering spiritually awakened, the highest intuitive spiritual awareness. We have lost that intuitive ability with the sequential and linear understanding of education that we have received. So we need to move from the so-called present waking state, to being spiritually awakened. We have to learn how to become like a child again.

19121,Preet Bharara: ’There’s Absolutely Evidence to Begin a Case’ for Obstruction of Justice Against Trump - Breitbart,"Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” former U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, who was fired by President Donald Trump earlier this year, said he believed there was “absolutely evidence to begin a case” for obstruction of justice against Trump.  Partial transcript as follows: And our first guest is a former prosecutor who’s worked with both Comey and Mueller, Preet Bharara, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York until March when he was fired by President Trump. Now he’s a distinguished scholar at NYU. And this is his first television interview since the firing. Welcome to THIS WEEK. PREET BHARARA, FORMER U. S. ATTORNEY: Thank you, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: So I want to ask you about your encounters with President Trump later, but let’s begin with that hearing. You were in the hearing room  …     BHARARA: I was. STEPHANOPOULOS:  —   on Thursday. We have a picture of you right behind James Comey right there. And you’ve heard the president since coming out and saying  —   claiming vindication from James Comey, essentially, though, saying that James Comey lied under oath. Did he? BHARARA: It doesn’t appear that way. I mean you’ve got someone who has a reputation for probity, someone who has a reputation for telling the truth, someone who has contemporaneous notes of what happened in these meetings and in these conversations. On the other hand, I think a lot of people will tell you that the president himself sometimes makes accusations that turn out not to be true. I think he seems to have done that in a Tweet this morning. And when it comes down to who’s telling the truth and who’s not, I think most people would side reasonably with James Comey. STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked about the Tweets. The president did put out a Tweet this morning. I want to put it up on the screen right now. “I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal. Very cowardly. ” What’s the lie there? BHARARA: There’s a  —   there’s speculation and an accusation that there are other leaks and that’s going to come out at some point in the future. I think there have been other accusations that are made in a haphazard and unsubstantiated way by the president, including that his office was tapped or wiretapped and no evidence of that has ever materialized. He suggested on at least one occasion that maybe he had recorded conversations, refuses to answer questions about whether or not that is true. But I think the point is that accusations made in the heat of the moment in 140 characters on Twitter, based on the track record and history, are not to be taken very seriously. STEPHANOPOULOS: His whole team is doubling down on this idea that the leak that James Comey admitted to could be illegal. Corey Lewandowski told me on Friday on “GMA” that it’s possible that he could be prosecuted for this. Anything illegal in that leak to “The New York Times?” BHARARA: Yes. So I’m not in the business of making legal pronouncements on what is  —   what’s legal or what’s criminal anymore. But I will say, it sounds like more of a distraction. First of all, I think nothing that was in the memo or in the conversations that he had with his friend at Columbia Law School was classified. Second, I don’t understand what the privilege argument is. You know, the president’s team fully was aware that the memo was going to be discussed, and the conversations were going to be discussed at the hearing and had the opportunity, when many reporters asked if they would invoke executive power to try to prevent some of that from being talked about and they declined that opportunity. So I think the main point that people should be focusing on, from what I can see, is that you have  —   you have uncontroverted from someone who was under oath that on at least one occasion, the president of the United States cleared a room of his vice president and his attorney general, and told his director of the FBI that he should essentially drop a case against his former national security adviser. And whether or not that is impeachable or that’s indictable, that’s a very serious thing. And I’m not sure that people, you know, fully get that the standard is not just whether something is a crime or not, but there should  —   you know, whether or not it can be charged as a crime or Congress will impeach, it’s a very serious thing. And there’s a lot to be frightened about and a lot to be outraged about if you have a president who, A, may have done it, although I know he denies it, but he hasn’t done it under oath yet. And, B, he seems to suggest that even if he had done it or said words to that effect, there’s nothing wrong with that. And you have other people who seem to be excusing it. That’s an incredibly serious thing if people think that the president of the United States can tell heads of law enforcement agencies, based on his own whim or his own personal preferences or friendships, that they should or should not pursue particular criminal cases against individuals. That’s not how America works. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to dig into that more in a minute. But let me just stay on this leak for just a second. Even if the going to a friend at “The New York Times” wasn’t illegal, was it a violation of FBI regulations, which would, in some cases, people say, require  —   before that revelation  —   getting advanced authorization from the FBI? BHARARA: Yes, you know, I don’t know. It doesn’t seem to be. You know, one could make the argument that it was not the best way to go about trying to bring this story into the open. I mean obviously, Jim Comey was comfortable, after being called to testify, to testify about the memos and about the conversations. And it was just his recollection. So, you know, I don’t really see what the major issue is. It may be that there was a better way to bring the information out like he did in the hearing ultimately. STEPHANOPOULOS: One of the other things the president’s supporters have said is that James Comey, if he really thought something was wrong in that meeting you just referred to, that Oval Office meeting where everybody else was kicked out, he should have said no to the president right there, or he should have reported this evidence of a crime back to the FBI or the Justice Department. BHARARA: Yes, but the  —   but  —   as I understand it, he did say no. And the no that he said was that  —   to himself and to his people that we were not going to do what the president had asked. He wasn’t going to drop the investigation. So I think, you know, he decided in his own mind he wasn’t going to follow the direction of the president. And he says he took it as a direction and that was that. STEPHANOPOULOS: One other thing on James Comey. He talked about that encounter with Loretta Lynch and the email investigation. She wanted it described as a “matter. ” He wanted it described as an investigation. He said that made him queasy. Does that make you queasy, too? BHARARA: Well, it wasn’t said to me. I think if you’re  —   if it’s true and you’re listening to it as a third party, it’s not the greatest instruction in the world. But if I could just say one other point on this issue of whether or not Donald Trump knew what he was doing, and I saw, I think, over the weekend, that Paul Ryan, who is, I think, in line to be president of the United States  —   he’s in the succession line  —   has been trying to excuse this behavior  —   again, putting aside whether it’s obstruction or impeachable  —   that the president of the United States is new to this and he’s new to protocols makes very, very little sense when the president became the president, in part, by campaigning at rally after rally after rally that I saw and Americans saw, on the issue of whether or not it was appropriate for the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, to have a meeting on a tarmac with Bill Clinton. So he very well knew what the optics of that were and what the protocols were. And even though there is no evidence and no one has come forward to say anything untoward was discussed on that airplane at the tarmac, when an ongoing investigation was underway with respect to Hillary Clinton, he nevertheless said this is a reason why you should vote for me and not for that person. And for people to turn around and say now that there is evidence that the president of the United States himself had a private conversation, after kicking other high officials out of the room and told his FBI director confidentiality to do something about a criminal case that’s pending, I think that’s a big deal. And it can’t be excused as simply being a novice or new. STEPHANOPOULOS: The president’s defenders, like Alan Dershowitz, say there’s no grounds for obstruction. You talked about that. And he, in fact, says that presidents have the constitutional right to fire FBI directors and investigations as much as they want. One of the president’s attorneys, Jay Sekulow, is coming up next. He says there’s no there there, no basis for obstruction. You are a former prosecutor. Is there evidence there that  —   to begin a case for obstruction? BHARARA: I think there’s absolutely evidence to begin a case. I think it’s very important for all sorts of armchair speculators in the law to be clear that no one knows right now whether there is a provable case of obstruction. It’s also true I think from based on what I see as a third party and out of government that there’s no basis to say there’s no obstruction. And this point on whether or not the president has legal authority to fire or to direct an investigation, I don’t really get it. It’s a little silly to me. The fact that you have authority to remove someone from office doesn’t automatically immunize that act from criminal responsibility. And I’ll give you an example of something from a different context. If it were to be true, and this is all made up for the sake of argument, if it were to be true that Michael Flynn offered a million dollars to Donald Trump and said I’m going to give you this million dollars and I’m giving it to you because I want you to fire Jim Comey and then Donald Trump fired Jim Comey, which everyone agrees he has the absolute authorization and authority to do, that would be an open and shut federal criminal case. It’s a quid pro quo and he be could charged (inaudible) president of the United States. So this argument that you keep hearing on the TV shows that the mere fact that the president can fire an official at will doesn’t solve the problem. STEPHANOPOULOS: In the end, though, as a prosecutor, what gets this beyond a he   said case? BHARARA: I don’t know if there’s other evidence. I mean, we are heard people talk abouttapes and there’s a lot of cute game playing about whether or not there are tapes. That could prove it. But you have this in court all the time. And look at the surrounding circumstances and the indicia of truthfulness and those things include contemporaneous statements to other people. They include the track record of the witness. They include whether or not one of the hes in the he   said has a track record for lying or not both on the air and in legal proceedings like depositions, and I believe there is such a track record with respect to one of the parties. So you make your arguments as you can. And it may be the case, like I’ve said, that no ultimate actual legal proceeding can be brought. I think people should keep an open mind about that. And I’m the first to say it and the only people, and we’ve going to make that decision, are the team that Bob Mueller is assembling. STEPHANOPOULOS: So, are you pretty confident now that there’s no question that President Trump will be investigating for obstruction by Bob Mueller? BHARARA: I don’t know. I’m not part of that team, but it seems  —   it seems reasonable that if Bob Mueller is looking at everything that you would expect him to look at, and good prosecutors look at everything. And this would seem to be one of those things that he was looking at. STEPHANOPOULOS: How far does the scope of a special prosecutor go in a situation like this? How far beyond the questions, the underlying collusion charges with Russia, the question of obstruction, is this something that could eventually get into the Trump Corporation businesses? Does the special counsel have that kind of leeway? BHARARA: I don’t know where he’ll go. I think that Bob Mueller by reputation is  —   proceeds with caution and doesn’t get over his skis ever, so I think he’ll have confidence that there will be a responsible investigation that goes where it needs to go and not beyond. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we heard the president say he wanted to testify, or willing to testify under oath. Any doubt that Bob Mueller would take him up on that. MUELLER: No, I think the way you do any kind of investigation that involves somebody who is a high official is you gather all the other evidence. We did investigations like this of high officials in New York State all the time. And what you do is you painfully and painstakingly gather evidence from as many witnesses as possible and documents and everything else and at the end of that typically, then, you interview the principal. STEPHANOPOULOS: You had several encounters with   Trump before you were fired by President Trump back in March starting at the  —   during the transition he invited to youTrump Tower, asked you to stay on as U. S. attorney. BHARARA: He did. STEPHANOPOULOS: And then he followed that up with two phone calls as  . BHARARA: He did. STEPHANOPOULOS: What happened in those phone calls? BHARARA: So they’re unusual phone calls and it sort of  —   when I’ve been reading the stories of how the president has been contacting Jim Comey over time, felt a little bit like deja vu. And I’m not the FBI director, but I was the chief federal law enforcement officer in Manhattan with jurisdiction over a lot of things including, you know, business interests and other things in New York. The number of times that President Obama called me in     years was zero. The number of types I would have been expected to be called by the president of the United States would be zero because there has to be some kind of arm’s length relationship given the jurisdiction that various people had. STEPHANOPOULOS: What did he say? BHARARA: So he called me in December, ostensibly just to shoot the breeze and asked me how I was doing and wanted to make sure I was OK. It was similar to what Jim Comey testified to with respect to a call he got when he was getting on the helicopter. I didn’t say anything at the time to him. It was a little bit uncomfortable, but he was not the president, he was only the  . He called me again two days before the inauguration, again seemingly to check in and shoot the breeze and then he called me a third time when he  —   after he became president and I refused to return the call. STEPHANOPOULOS That you didn’t take because he was president. But on those other phone calls, James Comey talked about the president trying to develop what he called a patronage relationship. Is that what you think was happening with you? BHARARA: That’s not the word I use. I was in discussions with my own folks, and in reporting the phone call to the chief of staff to the attorney general I said, it appeared to be that he was trying to cultivate some kind of relationship. And it may be hard for viewers of yours to understand if you’re a layperson and not in the Justice Department, you know, what’s wrong with that. The CEO of a company wants to call a field manager somewhere in the country because he thinks he’s an    what’s wrong with that? The problem is the Justice Department is different. And for the same reasons that Donald Trump emphasized how it looked when there was that tarmac incident and you had a private conversation between someone who had an interest in an investigation and the person who was responsible for, you know, advancing or ending that investigation, it’s a very weird and peculiar thing for a    conversation without the attorney general, without warning between the president and me or any United States attorney who has been asked to investigate various things and is in a position hypothetically to investigate business interests and associates of the president. STEPHANOPOULOS: Trump Corporation based in New York. BHARARA: Hypothetically there is the authority to investigate all sorts of interests relating to a president which is why there are strict guidelines in place about what can or cannot be talked about. Now I’m not saying that he was going to ask me about a case, although there was some evidence in the record now that after a period of time, given the Jim Comey testimony, there’s some evidence that Donald Trump didn’t think anything of asking a high level law enforcement official to take a particular action that he wanted for himself on a criminal case. STEPHANOPOULOS: And then when you were actual  —   when he was actually president, you refused to take the call, and I guess the next day you were fired. BHARARA: So the call came in. I got a message. We deliberated over it, thought it was inappropriate to return the call. And 22 hours later I was asked to resign along with 45 other people. STEPHANOPOULOS: And some Democrats, notably Elizabeth Warren, connecting that to the fact that you did have jurisdiction over Trump Tower. Do you think there’s any connection? BHARARA: I’m not drawing the connection. I’ve lived long enough to know that anything is possible and we’re seeing a lot of things going on now with respect to accusations that Jim Comey made under oath in a congressional hearing. So I don’t know. To this day I have no idea why I was fired. You know, it doesn’t bother me. I’m living a great good life, and very happily. But I have no idea. STEPHANOPOULOS: Preet Bharara, thanks for coming in today. BHARARA: Thank you. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN ",0
19122,The Director of the FBI Reopens the Hillary Case,"License DMCA 
Word has reached me from Washington that the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself. 
I myself do not know what precisely to think. Having been at the top of the Washington hierarchy for a quarter century, I have seen many mistaken judgments. At one time I had subpoena power over the CIA and was able to inform President Reagan that the CIA had misled him. He took note and proceeded with his policy of ending the Cold War with the Soviets. On other issues I have been mistaken, because I assumed that there was more integrity in government than actually exists. 
However, FBI director Comey did not need to reopen the case against Hillary simply because some new incriminating emails appeared. Having dismissed the other incriminating evidence, these emails could have passed unremarked. 
The problem for the FBI, which once was a trusted American institution, but no longer is, is that there is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote for president of the United States. His appearances are so heavily attended that thousands are turned away by local fire/occupancy regulations. In contrast, Hillary has curtailed her appearances, because she doesn't draw more than 30 or 40 people. 
Americans are sick to death of the corrupt Clintons and the corrupt American media. The Clintons are so completely bought-and-paid-for by the Oligarchy that they were able to outspend Hollywood on their daughter's wedding, dropping $3,000,000 on the event. - Advertisement - 
Nevertheless, I don't underestimate the power of the Oligarchy. As Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury I experienced the Oligarchy's power. If I had not been backed by the President of the United States, I would have been destroyed. 
Indeed, the Oligarchy is still trying to destroy me. 
Possibly Trump, as his enemies allege, is just another fake, like Obama who misled the electorate. However, Trump attacks the Oligarchy so strongly that it is hard to believe that Trump isn't real. Trump is asking for a bullet like John F. Kennedy, like Robert Kennedy, like Martin Luther King, like George Wallace. 
In Amerika, dissidents are exterminated. 
Trump is against voting machines over which he has no control. If there are no INDEPENDENT exit polls, Trump can easily be robbed of the election, as the Texas early voting scandal indicates, with the electronic machines assigning Trump votes to Hillary. The ""glitch"" doesn't assign any Hillary votes to Trump. - Advertisement - 
My expectation is that, unless Trump's popular vote is so overwhelming, the electoral collage vote will be stolen. Because of the absence of any valid reporting by the presstitutes, I don't know what impact the orchestrated election of Hillary would have on the electorate. Possibly, Americans will break out of The Matrix and take to the streets. 
I believe that Hillary in the Oval Office would convince the Russians and the Chinese that their national survival requires a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the crazed, insane government of the United States, the complete narcissistic state that in the words of Hillary and Obama is ""the exceptional, indispensable country,"" empowered by History to impose its will on the world. This crazed American agenda is not something that Russia and China will accept. 
Here is Donald Trump speaking to Americans in words Americans have been waiting to hear. Notice that Trump doesn't need teleprompters. 
I do not agree with Trump on many issues, but the American people do. For me and for the world, the importance of Trump is the prospect of peace with Russia. Nuclear war makes every other problem irrelevant.",0
19123,Progressives Find ‘White Trash’ More Threatening Than Nuclear War,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
The American electorate’s preference for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the “progressives” and “liberals” who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes. 
Trump’s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today. 
From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Trump. This is their propaganda, the intention of which is to discredit a Trump administration before it is inaugerated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Obama twice previously. 
Truthout has lost it completely. John Knefel declares “The David Dukes of the World Prevail.” 
Kelly Hayes declares “White Supremacy Elected Donald Trump.” 
William Rivers Pitt declares “We have elected a fascist that Mussolini would have recognized on sight.” 
Hillary carried only a handful of states, the states that comprise the One Percent’s stomping grounds. Yet Amy Goodman of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer John Nichols claim that as Hillary carried New York and California, she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. I remember a few days ago George Soros saying that Trump would win the popular vote, but that the electoral vote would go to Hillary, thus ridding the oligarchs of Trump. 
Earth Justice promises to hold Trump accountable. Trump who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China, thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations, is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction. 
The ACLU, of which I am a member, has also put “on notice” the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU, I will not renew my membership. 
Feminists tell us that we are “grieving, scared, and in shock,” and that “it is critical that we stand together and support each other.” 
Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is “an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance, decency and social justice, the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment, we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election, J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.” 
Van Jones, a CNN commentator, said that Trump’s election is a nightmare, “a deeply painful moment,” a “whitelash” against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones, he didn’t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all, Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative. 
And so, the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Hillary, despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China, provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria, attack Iran and other of Israel’s targets, further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security, and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If William Rivers Pitt sees Trump as a Mussolini fascist, Trump is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Hillary, a Hitler to the third power. 
The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions, they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans. 
These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters. 
If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. (Reprinted from PaulCraigRoberts.org by permission of author or representative)",0

19125,California Braces for More Rain. How Bad Can It Get? - The New York Times,"It’s raining in California. Again. A storm system hitting north and central California on Monday and Tuesday will deliver two to three inches of rain to the Central Valley, and up to 10 inches of rain to the mountains, said Eric Kurth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento. The service has issued a flood warning through Wednesday across most of the Sacramento River Valley and the surrounding areas. It is the latest in a string of storms this winter that have dropped an unusually high amount of water on the state, which had spent more than five years under dire drought conditions. “On its own, this system wouldn’t be much of a concern,” Mr. Kurth said. “But we have elevated stream levels, river levels. We are seeing some of the rivers up at flood levels. ” Last week, more than 180, 000 residents were ordered to evacuate from below the Oroville Dam when a damaged emergency spillway and a swollen reservoir raised concerns about a collapse. Crews rushed to fix the damaged embankment at the dam, 70 miles north of Sacramento, and to prepare it for more rain. On Saturday, a storm with winds near hurricane strength swept through Southern California, killing at least two people, flooding roads and triggering mudslides. A sinkhole in Studio City swallowed a car. Interstate 5 in the central Sacramento Valley was flooded briefly over the weekend. “That was an area that typically we don’t see much flooding,” Mr. Kurth said. “But things are so saturated. ” Across the northern part of the state, swollen rivers were lapping over their banks and reservoirs were close to flood stage. The National Weather Service reported nearly a dozen rivers were at their flood stage on Sunday. The San Joaquin River was at “danger stage” on Sunday and nearing the top of its levees at a measuring station near Vernalis, Tim Daly, a spokesman with San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services, told The Associated Press. In Colusa County, about 60 miles north of Sacramento, Jim Saso, the assistant sheriff, told The A. P. that he was warning residents to be prepared for evacuation. “We’re telling those people to keep a bag close by and get ready to leave again,” he said. The Don Pedro Reservoir in Tuolumne County, southeast of Sacramento, was at 826 feet on Sunday  —   four feet below its flood level, CBS 13 reported. Authorities were preparing to release water through its spillway as early as Monday afternoon, the first time in 20 years that would have happened, CBS 13 said. The ultimate effect of the storm depends on how much of the moisture lands as rain in the valleys as opposed to snow higher up in the mountains, Mr. Kurth said. “That set of storms previously that brought a lot of trouble, the issues with the Oroville Dam, that system was very warm,” he said. This storm is not quite as warm, meaning that some of the higher amounts of moisture could be in the form of snow in the mountains and would not affect the rivers immediately. “If we get water locked up in the form of snowpack and that stays through the spring, we get a gradual water flow into the spring months and maybe into the summer,” he said. “If we get it all in the form of rain, maybe like those other storms, it’s all running down into the streams and maybe into the rivers causing some flooding. ” “We do need water. Water is good. But it’s better in the form of snow,” he said. This latest storm is what’s called an “atmospheric river”  —   a weather event more commonly known as the “pineapple express. ” It is moist tropical air from the central Pacific trapped in a band between different pressure systems, Mr. Kurth said. When it hits California, it unleashes a high amount of rain. “It’s like a fire hose of moisture when we get these atmospheric rivers,” he said. An atmospheric river is not especially unusual. “We usually get a couple every year,” he said. “On average we get maybe three to five or so. This year we’ve gotten quite a few more. ” How many more? “More than a dozen prior to this one,” he said. This storm also brings “pretty strong winds,” which could potentially top 60 miles an hour on Monday evening, Mr. Kurth said. The wind, when combined with the oversaturated ground, means that trees tend to topple more frequently  —   and when they do, they often take powers lines with them. Or they fall across highways, snarling traffic in regions that were spared flooding. ”I’ve seen more of that this year than I’ve ever seen by far,” Mr. Kurth said. The saturation also leaves areas vulnerable to mudslides. “Major arteries over the Sierras have been blocked for long periods of time, and I expect we’ll see much more of that today, too,” he said. California has been in a drought for more than five years, resulting in mandatory conservation. Reservoirs were parched, and the snowpack that helps feed the state’s rivers and streams with its spring thaw had been nearly nonexistent at times. But this year has brought a tremendous amount of rain and snow, and that has helped. “You would be   to say we have a surface water drought right now,” Jay Lund, a water expert at the University of California, Davis, told The New York Times last week. Aided by the recent storms, the snowpack for the central Sierra mountains was at 182 percent of its normal level on Sunday. And the United States Drought Monitor reported that nearly 44 percent of the state was free of a drought warning last week, compared to less than 1 percent at this time a year ago. But that still leaves more than 20 million people that it estimates are living in an area affected by drought, the monitor reported. The brunt of this storm will hit on Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Kurth said, with showers continuing on Wednesday. Thursday will be “relatively dry,” he said, but warned of another potential storm arriving on Friday or Saturday. “We’re not going to see a real   period. Maybe just a day or two,” he said.",0
19126,Harlem Deer Caught in City-State Tussle Has Died - The New York Times,"A   deer that went from being a minor celebrity in Harlem to a cause célèbre after its capture, died in captivity on Friday, moments before it was to be driven upstate and released. The preliminary causes of death, according to a New York City parks spokesman, were stress and the day and a half that the deer spent at a city animal shelter in East Harlem. But that did not begin to tell the absurd tale of how the buck, known as J. R. for Jackie Robinson, and Lefty, because of his crumpled left antler, came to die. The deer had become the latest and most unlikely casualty of the feud between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, an animosity that has manifested itself mostly on big issues like education, safety at homeless shelters and funding mass transit. But the tussle over the deer was extraordinary even by the standards set by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio. All day Thursday and into Friday, the city and state issued competing and sometimes   updates on the deer and what should be done with him. The buck had spent two weeks  attracting adoring,   crowds at Jackie Robinson Park, where he often was seen near a   fence across the street from a bodega. How he traveled to a park in the middle of a crowded Manhattan neighborhood remains unclear. Around 4 a. m. Thursday, the buck jumped a fence into the courtyard of the Polo Grounds Towers, a public housing complex north of the park. The police were called, and they tranquilized and captured him, calling him a danger to traffic and public safety. The city announced plans on Thursday afternoon to kill the deer, citing advice from state wildlife officials. But that evening, Mr. Cuomo offered to help the city move the deer, despite the state’s policy not to issue permits to relocate deer “because acceptable release sites are not available and because the poor chances for deer survival do not warrant the risks. ” The city initially spurned the governor’s offer, saying that after the deer’s time in captivity, it would not be able to survive. “If a deer is already in a natural location and you can leave them there, then they have a chance of survival, but if not, you don’t really have another option,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on the Brian Lehrer radio show on Friday morning. “It’s a question of is it going to be a quick and merciful death versus potentially a very long painful process. ” But Mr. Cuomo then took to Twitter, posting a statement from the state Department of Environmental Conservation saying, “We want to do everything we can to save the Harlem deer. ” And just before noon came word that officials from the conservation department were coming to get the deer, and that the city would not stand in the way. After it looked like the deer might live, allies of the mayor and governor took the opportunity to throw a few jabs. “Bureaucracy lost,” Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, wrote on Twitter. “Andrew Cuomo is an idiot,” posted  Bill Hyers, who managed Mr. de Blasio’s 2013 mayoral campaign. For Mr. de Blasio’s supporters, the state’s intervention seemed to be yet another instance of Mr. Cuomo’s penchant for attempting to outmaneuver and undermine Mr. de Blasio on his own turf. Last year, for example, Mr. Cuomo took credit for bringing universal   to the city, one of the mayor’s signature programs. Mr. Cuomo directed a campaign to support protections for charter schools even as Mr. de Blasio was pledging to cut their space. The mayor has accused the governor of a “vendetta” against him. The life of one   deer is not normally something the state values highly. Deer have overrun the state in recent years, including on Staten Island, where the animals now numbers many hundreds and regularly cause car accidents. The state endorses various plans to reduce the deer population, including “bait and shoot,” and last year, New York State hunters legally killed more than 200, 000 deer. Nor is Mr. Cuomo personally opposed to the killing of wild animals. He is an avid outdoorsman and sometime pheasant hunter. (Then again, Mayor de Blasio has not had an exemplary track record with animals his encounter with a groundhog in 2014 did not end well.) But the Harlem deer was no ordinary deer. He was beloved, a   gift to a beleaguered city, a surrogate reindeer camped out just a block from St. Nicholas Avenue. As he languished on death row on Thursday, the outcry for him to be saved grew louder. And the barrage of statements from the city and state took on a confounding,   quality. The deer could not be moved out of densely populated Harlem  —   “Bottom line is the options are release back into Harlem or euthanasia,” a state biologist wrote to a city parks official Thursday afternoon  —   until suddenly he could. He could not be moved across county lines, then he could. The deer was condemned to die, then he was not, then he was, then he was not. For a few surreal minutes Thursday night, the deer, like Schrödinger’s cat, was both alive and dead, with a city official insisting he had already been euthanized and the state insisting he had not. Then, just before 2 p. m. with workers from the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the federal Department of Agriculture gathering at the Animal Care Centers of NYC shelter on East 110th Street, a city parks spokesman announced that the deer had died. The spokesman, Sam Biederman, blamed the state. “Unfortunately because of the time we had to wait for D. E. C. to come and transport the deer, the deer has perished,” he told reporters, adding that the city had wanted to euthanize the deer all along. “This was an animal that was under a great deal of stress for the past 24 hours and had been tranquilized for much of that time. ” The state, naturally, blamed the delay on the city. “We offered yesterday to take possession of the deer and transport it to a suitable habitat,” the Environmental Conservation Department said in a statement. “The city did not accept our offer until just before noon today, and while we were arriving on scene the deer died in the city’s possession. ” After Mr. Biederman’s brief news conference in front of the shelter, a worker from the shelter came into the lobby, seemingly exhausted. “It’s been a long day,” she said.",0

In all likelihood, the Democrats and media in the D.C. establishment are furious about Trump’s new hotel because it serves as a nightmarish reminder of the utter failure of a job they have done in the nation’s capital. 
In stark contrast to how things typically proceed in the corrupt swamp known as D.C., Trump’s hotel was completed “under budget and ahead of schedule,” something Trump is quick to remind Americans of. 
“We don’t hear those words too often in government — but you will,” he said, alluding to the change he intends to bring to D.C. should he win the election.   
Trump proceeded to run through a litany of failures by the government, most especially that of Obamacare , which he has been hitting hard in recent days. 
“The American people know what this election is about, and they see it every time they get their health care bills in the mailbox, or ride down a highway that’s broken, or go to an airport that looks like it’s in a third world country,” Trump stated.

19129,"Trump Claims, With No Evidence, That ‘Millions of People’ Voted Illegally - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump said on Sunday that he had fallen short in the popular vote in the general election only because millions of people had voted illegally, leveling the baseless claim as part of a daylong storm of Twitter posts voicing anger about a   recount push. “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Mr. Trump wrote Sunday afternoon. The series of posts came one day after Hillary Clinton’s campaign said it would participate in a recount effort being undertaken in Wisconsin, and potentially in similar pushes in Michigan and Pennsylvania, by Jill Stein, who was the Green Party candidate. Mr. Trump’s statements revived claims he made during the campaign, as polls suggested he was losing to Mrs. Clinton, about a rigged and corrupt system. The Twitter outburst also came as Mr. Trump is laboring to fill crucial positions in his cabinet, with his advisers enmeshed in a rift over whom he should select as secretary of state. On Sunday morning, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser, extended a public campaign to undermine one contender, Mitt Romney  —   a remarkable display by a member of a  ’s team. In television appearances, she accused Mr. Romney of having gone “out of his way to hurt” Mr. Trump during the Republican primary contests. Claims of   voter fraud have been advanced for years by Republicans, though virtually no evidence of such improprieties has been discovered  —   especially on the scale of “millions” that Mr. Trump claimed. Late on Sunday, again without providing evidence, he referred in a Twitter post to “serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California. ” A day earlier, Mr. Trump’s transition team ridiculed the idea that recounts were needed. “This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded,” it said in a statement, “and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused. ” That message runs counter to the one Mr. Trump sent on Sunday with his fraud claims  —   if millions of people voted illegally, presumably officials across the country would want to pursue   ballot recounts and fraud investigations. But the Twitter posts could energize some of his supporters, who have claimed online that Mrs. Clinton’s two   lead in the popular vote has been faked. Mr. Trump at times promoted other conspiracy theories during the campaign, including claiming that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was somehow tied to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Many of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters have been galvanized by the notion that vote recounts in the three states  —   where Mr. Trump leads by a combined total of about 100, 000 votes  —   could somehow overturn Mr. Trump’s commanding Electoral College victory. By announcing, three weeks after Mrs. Clinton conceded, that it would participate in the Wisconsin recount, her team has helped reignite the contentious atmosphere of the campaign, of which Mr. Trump’s Twitter barrages were a fixture. (By all accounts, Mr. Trump types out many, though not all, of his own Twitter posts.) After spending almost five days in Palm Beach, Fla. where he celebrated Thanksgiving at his    resort, Mr. Trump made no public statements on Sunday other than those via Twitter. He returned in the afternoon to Trump Tower in Manhattan. Through the day, Mr. Trump appeared fixated on the recount and his electoral performance. In a series of midafternoon Twitter posts, not long before he boarded his flight, Mr. Trump boasted that he could have easily won the “  popular vote” if he had campaigned only in “3 or 4” states, presumably populous ones. “I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!” he wrote. The afternoon messages followed a string of   Twitter posts in which Mr. Trump railed against the recount efforts. In an initial post at 7:19, he wrote: “Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change. ” He went on to quote a comment by Mrs. Clinton during one of their debates, in which she said she was horrified by Mr. Trump’s refusal to say that he would accept the outcome of the election. And he noted that in her concession speech, she had urged people to respect the vote results. “‘We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald Trump is going to be our President,’” Mr. Trump wrote, quoting Mrs. Clinton. One person who spoke with Mr. Trump over the holiday weekend said the   had appeared to be preoccupied by suggestions that a recount might be started, even as his aides played down any concerns. Another friend said Mr. Trump felt crossed by Mrs. Clinton, who he believed had conceded the race and accepted the results. In a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the Clinton team’s general counsel, said the campaign would participate in Ms. Stein’s recount effort with little expectation that it would change the result, partly out of a sense of duty to the millions who voted for Mrs. Clinton. “We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states  —   Michigan  —   well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount,” Mr. Elias said, noting that Clinton campaign officials had found no “actionable evidence” of hacking or attempts to tamper with the vote. Late Sunday night, Mr. Elias responded on Twitter to Mr. Trump’s allegations, writing, “We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn’t ask for by the man who won election but thinks there was massive fraud. ” In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump leads by 22, 177 votes. In Michigan, he has a lead of 10, 704 votes, and in Pennsylvania, his advantage is 70, 638 votes. Mr. Trump’s aides echoed his concerns about the recount effort in appearances on Sunday morning television news programs. Ms. Conway, who was his campaign manager, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Mrs. Clinton and her campaign advisers would have to decide “whether they’re going to be a bunch of crybabies. ” As for the debate over Mr. Romney, Ms. Conway, echoing comments she posted last week on Twitter, made clear that she opposed choosing Mr. Romney as secretary of state. “There was the ‘Never Trump’ movement, and then there was Gov. Mitt Romney,” she said on ABC. During the primaries, Mr. Romney called Mr. Trump a “fraud” and a “phony. ” Ms. Conway said it was important for Mr. Trump to seek to unify the Republican Party by making gestures to those who opposed his candidacy. But, she added, “I don’t think the cost of party unity has to be the secretary of state position. ” Moments after appearing on the show, Ms. Conway, who is under consideration to be Mr. Trump’s press secretary, wrote on Twitter that she had told Mr. Trump her opinion privately, “and I’ll respect his decision. ” On “Meet the Press,” she said people felt “betrayed” by the idea that Mr. Romney could get a top cabinet job. “I’m not campaigning against anyone,” she said. “I’m just a concerned citizen. ” “We don’t even know if he voted for Donald Trump,” she added.",0
19130,US Feigns Human Rights Concerns in Philippines | New Eastern Outlook,"Column: Politics Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is heading a controversial campaign against crime, embodied in his “war on drugs” which has led to violence spanning the nation’s troubled urban centers. President Duterte’s comments have ranged from reasonable, to utterly indifferent regarding fears of extrajudicial executions, vigilantism, and very real human rights abuses – opening a door of opportunity for his political opponents both at home and abroad. President Duterte’s inability to clearly condemn extrajudicial executions and vigilante violence, along with his inflammatory, provocative, even dangerously demagogic statements both invites further abuses, as well as both legitimate and opportunistic criticism of him, his administration, and his policies. While legitimate criticism is both necessary and justified, it is undermined by disingenuous political opportunism, wielded by hypocrites who only stand to compound the Philippines’ current crisis, not solve it. America the Humane? Among President Duterte’s more opportunistic political opponents is the United States. While the United States would otherwise be justified and morally grounded in its criticism of President Duterte’s administration, there are some current and past complications that reveal such criticism as stark hypocrisy, crass opportunism, and even the cynical political exploitation of abuse, rather than any genuine attempt to constructively address or stop it. The most recent manifestation of America’s feigned concern regarding the Philippines’ ongoing campaign against accused illicit narcotic dealers was the blocking of a shipment of US-made rifles destined for Philippine police units. Some 26,000 rifles were on order before being blocked by the US Senate based on “concerns about human rights violations.” These concerns, however, have not prevented the US from selling billions of dollars worth of weapons, including warplanes, munitions, tanks, and helicopters to Saudi Arabia, who is using this vast US-made arsenal to oppress its own people and execute a war of aggression against neighboring Yemen. Saudi Arabia is also admittedly involved in arming and funding terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq, including with US-made weapons – particularly anti-tank TOW missiles. This hypocrisy exposes US “concerns” as merely politically motivated, designed to put pressure on Manila in an effort to reassert US influence over the Southeast Asian state. Not only has the US previously enjoyed greater influence over the Philippines since the end of World War II, but before the war, and for half a century, the United States literally controlled the Philippines as a US territory. It seized the Philippines in a bloody 1899-1902 war that claimed the lives of over a quarter of a million people ( some sources estimate over half a million ), and initiated an occupation marked by brutality, oppression, and torture, including the introduction of water boarding (then called “water curing”) conducted by the US as a means of attitude adjustment for local Philippine leaders. It is ironic and telling that both water boarding and attempts by the US to maintain influence over the Philippines both persist to this day. Attempts by the US to predicate its desire to control Manila on “concerns about human rights violations” not only is bitterly ironic, it undermines those genuinely attempting to expose and stop real abuses taking place amid the Philippines’ current crisis. President Duterte has been able to insulate himself from criticism precisely because of US hypocrisy and meddling. Had independent, local activists and media platforms – networked with regional and international organizations – attempted to expose and rein in President Duterte’s anti-crime campaign, it would have been immeasurably more difficult to dismiss the facts and continue with impunity. The US has in essence discredited genuine human rights concerns by hijacking them for self-serving political objectives. Extrajudicial executions, vigilante violence, and President Duterte’s indifference, even defense of both, needs to be opposed – but by the people of the Philippines – not disingenuous, exploitative, and self-serving foreign interests who are not only notorious human rights abusers today – worldwide – but who have carried out campaigns of extermination, torture, and human rights abuses in the Philippines itself, as a foreign conqueror and occupier. For President Duterte, it is more than possible for him to lead a more dignified and just campaign against criminals operating across the Philippines. Nations like Singapore have used stern, popular, but legitimate judicial measures to rein in the drug trade and organized crime, so can the Philippines. Doing so would close this door of opportunity President Duterte himself opened to the Americans, and leaves open with his current policies.

19131,"One Of Trump’s Deplorables Escaped From His Basket, Injuring Poll Worker In Texas (VIDEO)","On Tuesday, an election volunteer was injured at a polling location at Collin College in Plano, TX when he was sliced by box-cutter blades intentionally planted in a Trump/Pence sign. 
Collin College spokeswoman Lisa Vasquez said in a statement: 
“The man stopped as he left the campus to help re-position the sign to the correct location because it was blocking the official polling site sign. When he did so, box-cutter blades attached to the Trump-Pence sign cut his hands.” 
Steve Spainhouer, Collin County Democratic Campaign Chair, told reporters at KTVT that the incident was “deplorable.” 
“It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who’s probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other. 
I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they’re going to vote and so there’s nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.” 
Thankfully, the injured poll worker was not seriously hurt, but this could have been much worse. Clearly, the people who did this have listened to Trump’s violent rhetoric — they knew putting a razor blade in a misplaced sign was dangerous. And in placing the sign in the wrong place, they deliberately injured someone. 
Texas Rangers are investigating the incident. Let’s hope they find the people/person who did this.

19133,"Evidence: Eating Raw Cannabis PREVENTS Cancer, Does NOT Get You High","There is evidence out there, supporting that cannabis oil destroys cancer , cures severe epilepsy , treats muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, and saves lives . The National Cancer Institute has admitted cannabis oil kills cancer cells . It is widely acknowledged that natural compounds of the cannabis — a plant that the use, sale, and possession of is still illegal in the United States — can prevent, treat and manage inflammation; neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis; brain disorders such as epilepsy; lifestyle related diseases such as diabetes and cancer; chronic liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis; and medical conditions such as fibromyalgia.
Meanwhile, experts have come forward to make a strong case for eating unheated raw cannabis for maximum health benefits. While smoked or vaporized cannabis can be used as a medicinal therapy, they claim, eating raw cannabis can help prevent health issues from arising altogether — without psychoactive effect.
Dr. William Courtney, a California-based physician and a dietary raw cannabis specialist , says we are actually walking away from 99% of the benefits cannabis provides when we cook or smoke cannabis. He explains:
“In its raw form, the cannabis plant contains both THCA (Tetra Hydro Cannabinolic-Acid) and CBDA (Cannabidiolic-Acid), two cannabinoids known for their medicinal benefits; each of which must be heated in order to produce THC and CBD, respectively. Only when you decarboxylate THCA, turning it into THC, does it cause psychoactive effects or “the high” most associated with smoking cannabis.
“Additionally, the body is able to tolerate larger dosages of cannabinoids when cannabis is consumed in the raw form. This is because when you smoke cannabis, the THC actually acts as a CB1 receptor agonist and your body can only absorb 10 mg at a time.
“If you don’t heat cannabis, you can go up to five or six hundred milligrams and use the plant strictly as a dietary supplement by upping the anti-oxidant and neuro-protective levels which come into play at hundreds of milligrams of CBDA and THCA. It is this dramatic increase in dose from 10 mg of psychoactive THC to the 500 mg – 1,000 mg of non-psychoactive THCA, CBDA, and CBGA that comprises the primary difference between traditional medical cannabis treatments and using cannabis as a dietary supplement.”
It is no secret that cannabis contains a wealth of nutrients , proteins, vitamins, terpenes, Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, essential amino acids, and antioxidants. When eaten raw, our body is able to process much larger amounts of THCA and CBDA — which possess anti-inflammatory properties, anti-diabetic properties, and anti-ischemic properties — and converts these cannabinoid acids — linked to the prevention of chronic diseases such as migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, glaucoma, and fibromyalgia — into essential nutrients through its metabolism.",0
19134,Warriors Edge Thunder to Extend Dream Season to N.B.A. Finals - The New York Times,"OAKLAND, Calif.  —   The Golden State Warriors entered the N. B. A. playoffs having spent months chasing basketball magic. As they overwhelmed a conga line of opponents, the Warriors went about the uncharitable business of obliterating records, each new number more impressive than the last. Yet the Warriors have remained aware that all their feats would be meaningless without an opportunity to vie for another championship, their victories consigned to the dustbin of near renown, their records reduced to footnotes of almost greatness. They have always wanted the whole package: the wins, the records and the trophy. Golden State sustained the dream on Monday by defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder,   in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals at Oracle Arena. The Warriors, the defending champions, are bound for the N. B. A. finals, where they will face the Cleveland Cavaliers for the second straight year. Game 1 is here on Thursday. “You appreciate how tough it is to get back here,” said Stephen Curry, who led the Warriors with 36 points. “That’s the one thing I’ve learned. ” Of all the Warriors’ accomplishments, this one may have been the most impressive. They had to win the final three games of the series to outlast the Thunder, whose miscues  —   missed shots, turnovers and wasted chances to advance  —   could haunt the franchise for years to come. Curry shot 13 of 24 from the field and made seven  . Klay Thompson, his companion in the backcourt, added 21 points, including six 3s. The Warriors shot 17 of 37 from the   line. They also set an N. B. A. record for   in a   series with 90, and Curry broke the individual record by sinking 32. (Yes, two more records. Big surprise.) In the series finale, the Warriors trailed by as many as 13 points in the first half before overtaking the Thunder in the third quarter. Golden State conjured its usual brand of basketball sorcery, draining   and flying for   dunks. When the Thunder threatened late in the fourth, whittling the lead to 4 on a short jumper by Kevin Durant, Curry emerged. With the shot clock set to expire, Curry sold Serge Ibaka, his    defender, on a pump fake and drew a foul as he launched a  . Curry made all three free throws. “That kind of hurt us,” Durant said, adding: “But hey, it’s a lot of  . We could have said a lot   throughout the whole playoffs. ” Curry sealed the win with another  . As the final buzzer sounded and confetti fell around him, he cradled the ball with his left arm and pumped his right fist. “I knew we were ready for the moment,” Curry said. “We were a mature basketball team that tried our best not to listen to the noise when, six or seven days ago, we were down,   and everybody thought the wheels were falling off and it was kind of the end of our run. But in that locker room, the talk was positive. It was ‘Let’s figure it out.’ ” Durant scored 27 points on    shooting for the Thunder, and Russell Westbrook collected 19 points, 13 assists and 7 rebounds. Both players supplied huge minutes throughout the series  —   Durant played 46 minutes in Game 7, Westbrook 45  —   and each suffered by the end. Fair or not, the loss also opened the door to a flood of questions about Durant, who is due for free agency at the start of July. Will he stay or will he go? “I mean, we just lost, like, 30 minutes ago, so I haven’t even though about it,” Durant said. “I’m just embracing my teammates and just reflecting on the season. ” The Warriors survived injuries, the antics of Draymond Green and three elimination games against the Thunder, including one in Oklahoma City. On Saturday, the Warriors erased a   deficit to win Game 6, ensuring Monday’s    finale. Kerr made one significant change for Game 7 by starting Andre Iguodala instead of Harrison Barnes. Iguodala, a versatile defender, shed his   attached himself to Durant and wound up playing 43 minutes. “He’s going to need some good treatment tomorrow, for sure,” Curry said. Early on, the Warriors labored with their shooting. After having scored 41 points in Game 6, Thompson missed his first seven   attempts in Game 7. Even after Thompson found his rhythm, hitting three   in a span of less than 2 minutes, the Thunder took a   lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Curry made consecutive    —   the first to tie the game, the second to give the Warriors the lead. Later, after Durant bricked a   attempt, the Warriors raced the other way. Shaun Livingston, the team’s backup point guard, absorbed contact as he soared for a dunk, his   play pushing the lead to 6. The Warriors did not trail again. “It was an emotional play,” Kerr said. “Our bench was into it, and it seemed to pick up our intensity that much more. ” In the finals, the Warriors will reacquaint themselves with the Cavaliers and their old friend LeBron James. Last season, with the Cavaliers hindered by injuries to Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, the Warriors clinched the series in six games. But Love and Irving are healthy, and the Cavaliers have been resting at home since they got past the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference finals last week. It was no easy road to the finals for Warriors, who have been stretching themselves since the start of the season. They won their first 24 games to set an N. B. A. record, but their seasonlong pursuit of the   Chicago Bulls for the best record in N. B. A. history seemed to take an emotional and physical toll. At the start of playoffs, the Warriors flirted with disaster. Curry sprained his right ankle in the first game of their   series with the Houston Rockets, then sprained his right knee three games later. After missing about two weeks, Curry returned to help carry the Warriors past the Portland Trail Blazers in the second round. “I think anytime you go through a long postseason, you grow,” Kerr said. “The experience is incredibly valuable. ” But with their length and shotmaking prowess, the Thunder were a far greater challenge, especially when they dealt the Warriors    blowout losses in Games 3 and 4. The Thunder could sense the delicious possibilities, one win separating them from the finals. The Warriors’ dream season teetered on the edge. On the team plane back to Oakland after Game 4, Green sat with Thompson, Curry and Andrew Bogut at a small table. They discussed their predicament. “We just kept talking about what we needed to do and what we were going to do,” Green recalled. On Monday, the Warriors proved once again that they are more than mere showmen. After a season spent chasing the impossible, they are four wins from making it real.",0
19135,"Review: ‘Nicotine,’ the Stuff of Burning Desire - The New York Times","The best cigarette you will ever smoke, Gregor Hens writes in his new memoir, “Nicotine,” is the relapse cigarette. It tastes better, he adds, “the longer the prior abstinence. ” This is dangerous knowledge. More than a few smokers relapsed after Sept. 11. Others did after the recent presidential election, as if heeding the poet James Dickey’s dictum that “guilt is magical. ” Some of us barely keep the urge at bay. There’s a dark sliver in a former smoker’s mind that   for dire events, so as to justify lighting up again. But it’s not as if we need large cues, Mr. Hens writes, when small ones will do. “Every form of cigarette ad gives me a pang of longing, every   carelessly   cigarette packet at a bus stop, every   cigarette butt, every beautiful woman holding a cigarette between her fingers or just looking like she could be holding one,” he writes. “My reading chair in Columbus gives me a pang, and M. ’s balcony in Berlin, and my old Jeep because I’ve smoked some of the best cigarettes while driving. ” Mr. Hens is a German writer and translator who has lived and taught in the United States. “Nicotine” is the first of his own books to be issued in English. It’s a hybrid volume: part memoir, part philosophical lament. It doesn’t always click. There are passages (“I saw myself as a part of a field of tension”) that, in this translation by Jen Calleja, veer close to psychobabble. But when “Nicotine” stays dry, earthy and combustible, like a Virginia tobacco blend, it has a lot to say and says it well. The author does not resemble your idea of a former serious smoker. There Mr. Hens is,   and dimpled, in his author photo on the back flap. He looks as if he were ready to bag organic carrots during his weekend stint at the food  . Indeed, he writes, he is a serious cyclist, a participant in triathlons and a member of the German Alpine Association. He’s been a health nut all along, at least in between long bouts of smoking. I can’t decide if this is suspicious or insane, like that famous photograph of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson, taking a deep drag on a cigarette in the locker room during halftime of Super Bowl I in 1967. “I’ve smoked well over a hundred thousand cigarettes in my life, and each one of those cigarettes meant something to me,” Mr. Hens writes. He goes on: “I’ve smoked cold cigarette butts, cigars, cigarillos, bidis, kreteks, spliffs and straw. I’ve missed flights because of cigarettes and burnt holes in trousers and car seats. I’ve singed my eyelashes and eyebrows, fallen asleep while smoking and dreamt of cigarettes  —   of relapses and fires and bitter withdrawal. ” He sees this book as a chance finally to put the urge behind him, to comprehend it, seal it and bury it. He writes about his childhood. His father smoked so much that the author thought smoking was the older man’s job. His mother, a stylish woman who drove a   Range Rover, smoked more when she was depressed. There’s a faded romance in the European brand names of the cigarettes he or his family members smoked: Finas Kyriazi Frères Kims Murattis filterless Senior Services Erntes Van Nelle Halfzwares. This book takes us to unusual and evocative locations, too, such as the Frisian island of Borkum. Mr. Hens recounts a drive to the German city of Balderschwang, which sounds like a word an American politician would utter when something livelier than “poppycock” was required. He is especially good on how those who quit become vicarious smokers. “Sometimes I walk around the city and imagine that others are smoking on my behalf,” he writes. “I silently thank the smokers in front of the cafes and office buildings and in smoking areas, imagining that they do it for me, for my inner contentment. I have people smoke for me. ” Like any author worth reading, Mr. Hens is sometimes best when he goes   dispatching obiter dicta. He is brutal about the Midwest. (“The most insignificant city in the United States is Columbus, Ohio. ”) He’s interesting about aphorisms and our need to attach them, usually erroneously, to famous people. He considers how often we utter the phrase “no worries” when, in fact, we are murderously aggrieved. He charts the passing of time by noting how the white tennis balls of his youth have become neon green. This book is not a deep dive into smoking and literature, or into smoking and films. He doesn’t go out of his way to conjure the romance of two lit cigarettes and a corner table. “Nicotine” mostly omits the social pleasures of smoking. Mr. Hens is, with a metaphorical carton of American Spirits under his arm, a smoking section of one. His lapidary prose will sometimes put you in mind of the   Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard’s, though Mr. Knausgaard is generally more penetrating. The small    photographs in “Nicotine” recall the images in some of W. G. Sebald’s books. This edition of “Nicotine” includes an introduction by the English writer Will Self that belongs in the hall of fame of bad introductions. Mr. Self (never has his name seemed so apt) tries to   Mr. Hens by bragging at length about his own peerless nicotine addiction. This introduction is profitably torn out, the way smokers of unfiltered cigarettes tear the filters from Marlboros. This seems like the place to mention that Mr. Hens compares the cottony insides of a cigarette filter, perfectly, to “artichoke hair. ” Someday, surely, smoking will be outlawed. Who will smoke the last unfiltered Camel? Some of us who quit years ago like to imagine that we will start again at the end of our lives. We agree with the English writer Charles Lamb, who hoped that “the last breath I draw in this world will be through a pipe, and exhaled in a pun. ”",0

The increasing symbiosis between the political and the leading mainstream media of the Western world implies that, grosso modo, Russia is blamed for having caused this new situation. While Russia is certainly not innocent and it usually does take two to conflict this blame is rather a sign of diminishing capacity (knowledge) and will (economic and intellectual independence and courage) to ask critical questions that now characterise the corporate media. 
Defence and security political news coverage, journalistic processing, editing and commentaries have sunk to an intellectual level that is considerably lower than during the first Cold War. The entire field is given low priority by editors. Domestic issues, sports, entertainment, lifestyle etc. have made it to the top. 
Out of sync with the globalising world, most media do with 1-2 pages about global affairs out of, say, 40-50 pages and they base this material on the same handful of Western news bureaus. 
The double checking of a variety of sources, versatility and multi-perspective coverage are things of the past and we see more uniformity and more subjectivity in the news media coverage than ever. 
Add to this that both Russia and NATO countries engage in media management, or propaganda (tax payers footing the bills) which squeezes out comprehensive knowledge and unbiased analyses as well as critical angles on one’s own policies and actions. 
Like hot wars, Cold Wars are fought not only on the battle fields but also in the media, about the souls of the citizens. Fearology, therefore, has become a dominant ingredient in this war as well as in the other – equally counterproductive and self-defeating – war, the War On Terror. 
The more people are made to fear, the more they submit to surveillance, authoritarian laws, self-censorship etc and turn away from democratic debate and activism – a trend that will eventually lead to the dissolution of democracy itself. 
In short, these international trends and tension-increasing confrontations boomerang back on our societies in ways that are as frightening as under-stated in the debate. 
To put it crudely: the new Cold War and the War on Terror both have significant, destructive effects on society, diminish its democracy and creativity, narrows the spectrum of opinions and bring us further and further away from the globally desired goals of freedom, democracy and of living in a more peaceful world. 
Security politics has come to mean destruction of the core fibres of what was to be secured. Paradoxically, it promotes the closing of the once open society. 
In addition, that is, to squandering absurd US $ 1700 billion (or about 30 times the entire UN budget) worldwide on one more destructive, failed war after the other. 
These are issues of the greatest importance for humanity’s future, even survival.",0
19137,Putin Casts Doubt on Storage of Doping Suspects’ Urine Samples - The New York Times,"The president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, articulated a possible legal strategy on Wednesday for scores of Russian athletes preparing to defend themselves in sports doping prosecutions: casting doubt on the chain of custody for their urine samples. “When we provided the test samples, there were no complaints,” Mr. Putin said, going on to describe the microscopic scratches on glass sample bottles that investigators said showed that Russia’s Federal Security Service had cracked into them to switch out the athletes’ incriminating urine. “If there was a problem with scratches of whatever kind, this should have been noted in the relevant reports, but there was nothing of this sort. In other words, these samples were stored somewhere, and we cannot be held responsible for the storage conditions,” he said. The scores of glass bottles in question from the 2014 Sochi Olympics  —   bottles thought to be   before last year’s scandal  —   have been stored by the International Olympic Committee in a secure lab in Switzerland for the last three years. All are being   by the committee. Its ultimate disciplinary decisions, unlikely to come before the spring, are expected to be followed by challenges in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That could push deliberation into next year and further confuse the eligibility of Russian Olympians leading to the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Mr. Putin, who has been largely dismissive of the evidence exposing an elaborate Russian doping operation, also expressed respect for the World   Agency, the global antidoping regulator, and the investigations it had commissioned into Russia’s cheating. “We must pay heed to what this independent commission says, despite the shortcomings in its work,” he said, referring to a team led by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren that concluded in December that 1, 000 Russian athletes were involved in a   doping program. “We must pay heed to its work and its results, and to WADA’s demands, because we need to acknowledge that there are established and identified cases of doping here, and this is a totally unacceptable situation,” he said. Mr. Putin’s remarks  —   delivered in Krasnoyarsk, a city in eastern Siberia that is preparing to host the 2019 University Games  —   signaled a shift after months of rejecting the basic conclusions of Mr. McLaren’s inquiry. Regulators have said Russia must accept those conclusions or credibly rebut them to return to good standing in international competition. The Russian doping scandal upended global sports last year, months before the 2016 Olympics, when the nation’s former antidoping lab chief, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, delivered an insider’s account of Russia’s   conspiracy to drug surreptitiously and dominate global standings, most notably at the Sochi Olympics, where it controlled the   lab and had an opportunity to break into the bottles overnight. Since Dr. Rodchenkov spoke out and Mr. McLaren confirmed his story, Mr. Putin and Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s deputy prime minister and former sports minister, have delivered inconsistently conciliatory and defiant responses to the scandal. But with the I. O. C. having begun disciplinary proceedings for doping against 28 Russian Olympians who competed in Sochi, Mr. Putin’s remarks on Wednesday addressed specific facts about the case against his nation’s Olympians. Since leaving Sochi, the doping samples in question have been stored by the I. O. C. in a secure lab in Switzerland. And the University of Lausanne is collaborating with the committee in developing a methodology to scrutinize doping samples, according to Dr. Richard Budgett, the medical and scientific director of the I. O. C. “It has to be recorded extremely carefully. That’s why it’s taking a couple months,” Dr. Budgett said. While Mr. Putin referred to other shortcomings in the array of evidence assembled  —   including what he described as “inaccurate translations or inadequate evidence” presented by Mr. McLaren to international sports officials  —   his overall message on Wednesday was a broad acknowledgment of institutional failures. “Our existing antidoping monitoring system has not worked effectively, and this is our fault, and is something we need to admit and address directly,” Mr. Putin said. In December, top Russian sports officials acknowledged to The New York Times that “an institutional conspiracy” had implicated multiple employees of the government’s sports ministry. They insisted, however  —   as Mr. Putin repeated on Wednesday  —   that the schemes had not been supported by the state, which many officials defined as Mr. Putin and a few of his top associates. Mr. Putin’s remarks came one day after United States lawmakers called a congressional hearing, expressing outrage at Russia’s cheating and what they called global sports officials’ insufficient response to the scandal. “Exactly how far and who was involved  —   we don’t yet know,” Dr. Budgett, who testified at the hearing, said afterward. He acknowledged that Russia’s Federal Security Service had played a part and that Russia’s deputy sports minister had been dismissed for his involvement. “That’s what the commission is doing, getting to the bottom of who was involved within the Russian state and the Russian system. ”",0
19138,Another Trump Surrogate Admits Trump Won’t Build That Effing Wall (VIDEO),"Another Trump Surrogate Admits Trump Won’t Build That Effing Wall (VIDEO) By Darrell Lucus on October 26, 2016 Subscribe Trump foreign policy surrogate and adviser Walid Phares with several Ethiophian-American Trump supporters ( image courtesy Phares’ Facebook) 
Just after the Republican National Convention, I told you that a number of Donald Trump’s top surrogates have known for some time that the Donald’s signature policy proposal–a massive wall along the Mexican border– only exists in Trump’s mind . They have all but admitted what we already know–a 2,000-mile physical wall is simply not feasible. 
Well, we got more confirmation earlier this week from another prominent Trump surrogate. Specifically, his chief foreign policy adviser admitted what we have long suspected–when Trump declares, “I’m building a wall,” he’s just engaging in campaign hype. 
People for the American Way’s Right Wing Watch noticed that on Monday, veteran foreign policy and terrorism expert Walid Phares sat down with France 24’s Surabhi Tandon to discuss Trump’s approach to foreign policy. Phares served as a top foreign policy adviser to the Mitt Romney campaign, and took up the same role with Trump. He is best known as an ardent Islamophobe who had close ties to extremist militia groups during the civil war in his native Lebanon. 
The conversation soon turned to Trump’s wall. Right Wing Watch got a clip. 
Tandon asked Phares how Trump’s planned wall would affect the United States’ relationship with Mexico; Trump has let it be known that one way or another, Mexico will foot the bill for the wall. Phares replied that Trump plans to build the wall along the American side of the border. However, as far as he knows, it won’t be a brick-and-mortar wall. “Now, will we see a physical wall on hundreds and hundreds of miles of border? I don’t know, and I don’t think so.” 
According to Phares, what Trump has in mind is something like what exists in Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in north Africa. He claimed that there was a simple concept in place in those cities for anyone who wanted to cross into Spain via Morocco–“you come, you knock on the door, you have your paper, and you come in.” 
Tandon pounced, reminding Phares that Trump has been clamoring for a physical wall for the entire campaign. But this major Trump surrogate apparently didn’t get the memo. Phares claimed that Trump only talked about building a wall “to raise the attention.” However, since then, Phares has said that Trump has “evolved the concept” of a wall. How so? “Meaning, ‘If nothing is done, I’m going to go back to square one and build a wall. But if I can start talking with the Mexicans, I may not have to do all the wall everywhere because the Mexican government is going to finally send troops to stop these cartels.'” 
But wait a minute. Trump himself has declared the wall will stretch along the entire border. And he even managed to get the wall into the Republican platform. See for yourself , on page 26: “(W)e support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.” 
And yet, a major Trump surrogate–indeed, his top surrogate on foreign policy–has effectively left his candidate on an island. 
Watch the whole thing here ; the exchange about the wall begins at the 6:30 mark. As I write this on Wednesday night, I can find no evidence that either Trump or the RNC has spoken up to correct the record. And I can find no evidence that Phares himself has tried to clarify his remarks. I can only conclude one thing–Trump himself knows he’s not building a wall. About Darrell Lucus

19139,"Earthquake Off Fukushima, Japan, Triggers Tsunami - The New York Times","TOKYO  —   A powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami off the coast of Japan early Tuesday, near where three nuclear reactors melted down at a plant in Fukushima after a quake and tsunami in 2011. Tuesday’s quake quickly brought evacuation warnings along the coast that was ravaged just over five years ago. For about 90 minutes, fears of the 2011 nuclear disaster were raised as a cooling system in one reactor in another nearby plant shut down. It was restored without incident. The public broadcaster NHK exhorted residents of Fukushima Prefecture to leave coastal areas immediately. “Please move as far away from the shoreline as possible,” the announcer said. “Please remember the Great East Japan earthquake. ” A tsunami wave of about 55 inches hit the port of Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture about an hour and a half after the quake hit, and NHK said minor injuries had been reported. The first tsunami waves hit the coast at Onahama in Fukushima Prefecture at about 23 inches. At the Fukushima nuclear plant, the tsunami waves rose to about three feet. No deaths were immediately reported. The Japanese weather service reported a preliminary magnitude of 7. 4 and issued a warning of a tsunami of about 10 feet. (The United States Geological Survey reported a lower magnitude, 6. 9.) The warnings were lifted in the early afternoon, and people were allowed to return to their homes. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, reported that a cooling system in one of the reactors at Fukushima Daini, a nuclear facility not far from the ruined Daiichi plant, had stopped but said there was enough water in the reactor to keep the 2, 544 spent fuel rods cool in the short term. But the utility later said the system had resumed operations after 90 minutes. The Fukushima Daini power station, about seven miles south of Daiichi, has not produced electricity since the 2011 calamity, in which it suffered earthquake damage. Most of Japan’s nuclear power plants have been shut down since soon after the disaster amid public concern about their safety. Fukushima Daini’s reactors are turned off, but the plant still has uranium fuel in a storage pool that must be kept cool by pumping water through the reactors. After the 8.  earthquake and tsunami five years ago, three reactors at the Daiichi plant melted down after tsunami waves breached the power station’s protective sea walls and inundated the facility. The water flooded buildings and destroyed   electricity generators that were supposed to keep critical systems functioning in a blackout. Since the 2011 disaster, Tepco has been cleaning up and has started the decommissioning process. Officials reported that they found no damage or radiation release after initial inspections Tuesday morning. Tepco has struggled with the aftermath of the 2011 disaster. About 7, 000 workers, most of them contractors, are still at the site for the cleanup and decommissioning, which is projected to take as long as 40 years. One of the biggest problems is the huge amount of hazardous waste that has been generated. There are more than 700 tanks, about 1, 000 tons each, that workers have built to store water that has continuously seeped into the melted reactors from the ground since the disaster. After Tuesday’s earthquake, Tepco said it had suspended the transfer of contaminated water to the tanks. In an effort to stem the groundwater flow, Tepco has built an underground wall of frozen dirt 100 feet deep and nearly a mile in length in an effort to halt the flood of groundwater into the damaged reactor buildings. The   ice wall is not yet fully frozen, and groundwater continues to flow into the reactors every day. Tepco appeared to have learned some lessons from the 2011 disaster, when it failed to give timely updates. On Tuesday, Tepco released information about the status of its plants almost immediately. At the peak of the 2011 nuclear disaster, 160, 000 people fled or were evacuated from around the plant. Almost 90, 000 people have not returned. The disaster also fundamentally changed the course of nuclear power in   Japan, which had invested heavily in its   nuclear power stations in its quest to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and energy imports. On Tuesday, the government was taking no chances on warning residents in tsunami zones to evacuate. Sirens rang continuously in the communities near the coast. NHK, the public broadcaster, kept a huge red banner on the top of the screen all morning reading, “Flee immediately!” The 2011 disaster killed almost 16, 000 people as sea waves rose as high as 130 feet at Miyako in Iwate Prefecture. An additional 2, 500 were reported missing and never found.",0

19141,"Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Nominee, Failed to Disclose $100 Million in Assets - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Steven T. Mnuchin,   Donald J. Trump’s pick to be Treasury secretary, failed to disclose nearly $100 million of his assets on Senate Finance Committee disclosure documents and forgot to mention his role as a director of an investment fund located in a tax haven, an omission that Democrats said made him unfit to serve in one of the government’s most important positions. The revelation came hours before Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, began testifying on Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for transparency from nominees. Mr. Mnuchin was ready to outline his vision for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank that ran a “foreclosure machine” during the financial crisis. “The Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the committee. “When I look at Mr. Mnuchin’s background, it’s a stretch to find evidence he’d be that kind of Treasury secretary. ” In a hearing marked by sharp exchanges, Mr. Mnuchin struggled to answer questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, pointedly asked Mr. Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation. He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients, in accordance with the law. “Let me just be clear again: I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I would love to work with the I. R. S. to close these tax issues that make no sense. ” He added: “I would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are simpler and more effective. ” Republicans came to Mr. Mnuchin’s defense, suggesting that none of his omissions were willful, and they gave strong indications that they would vote for him. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Mnuchin’s business record and described him as extremely qualified for the job. “Objectively speaking, I don’t believe anyone can reasonably argue that Mr. Mnuchin is unqualified for the position,” Mr. Hatch said. “If the confirmation process focused mainly on the question of a nominee’s qualifications, there would be little, if any, opposition to Mr. Mnuchin’s nomination. ” But the process was also focused on Mr. Mnuchin’s financial disclosure form, and that prompted intense scrutiny. “In his revised questionnaire, Mr. Mnuchin disclosed several additional financial assets, including $95 million worth of real estate  —   a   in New York City, a residence in Southampton, New York, a residence in Los Angeles, California, and $15 million in real estate holdings in Mexico,” Democratic staff members of the Senate Finance Committee wrote in a memo on Thursday. “Mr. Mnuchin has claimed these omissions were due to a misunderstanding of the questionnaire. ” According to the memo, Mr. Mnuchin also initially failed to disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, along with management posts in seven other investment funds. And he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly $1 million in artwork. Asked about the omissions at the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin described them as a simple mistake made amid a mountain of bureaucracy. “I think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,” Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that he had handed over 5, 000 pages of disclosures. “Let me first say, any oversight, it was unintentional. ” But Democrats pounced and tied Mr. Mnuchin to Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. Pressed as to whether his failure to disclose the information was an ethical lapse, Mr. Mnuchin insisted that he was following the guidance of his lawyers and made an innocent error. “I assure you that these forms were very complicated,” he said, explaining that he had pledged to be forthcoming to “the best of my knowledge. ” Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was unsatisfied with the response and shot back, “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand the words ‘list all positions. ’” To that, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, added: “Never before has the Senate considered such an ethically challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions. Mr. Mnuchin’s failure to disclose his Cayman Islands holdings just reeks of the swamp that the   promised to drain on the campaign trail. ” And American Bridge, the   Democratic super PAC, said Mr. Mnuchin’s holdings were a sign that Mr. Trump’s government would not look out for working class Americans. “By slamming through Mnuchin, Senate Republicans are becoming accessories to Trump’s future corruption, helping him stack his cabinet with shady billionaires who, like Trump, will rig the government to serve their own interests at the expense of the American people,” said Shripal Shah, vice president of American Bridge.",0
