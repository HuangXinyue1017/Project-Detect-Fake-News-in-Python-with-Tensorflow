11422,Ted Cruz: Not One Democrat — Including Hillary and Obama — Voted Against Neil Gorsuch’s Federal Judgeship - Breitbart,"On the first day of confirmation hearings for Federal Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch to be named as a Supreme Court Justice, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) reminded the Democrats, who one after another criticized the nominee, that during his confirmation hearing a decade ago for the federal seat he holds now, not one Democrat  —   including Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama  —   voted against Gorsuch. [“A decade ago, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed by this committee for the Federal Court of Appeals by a voice vote,” Cruz said. “He was likewise confirmed by the entire United States Senate by a voice vote without a single Democrat speaking a word of opposition.  “Not a word of opposition from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,” Cruz said. “Not from Harry Reid, or Ted Kennedy, or John Kerry. ” “Not from Senators Feinstein, Leahey, or Durbin, who still sit on this committee,” Cruz said. “Not even from Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Joe Biden. ” “Not a one of them spoke a word against Judge Gorsuch’s nomination a decade ago,” Cruz said. Cruz said that not only did President Donald Trump play an unprecedented role in the selection of a justice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia by telling the American people of the 21 people  —   including Gorsuch  —   who would be under consideration if he were elected president, but the voters weighed in. Thus, Gorsuch was “no ordinary nominee,” Cruz said. “His nomination carries with it a super legitimacy that is also unprecedented in our nation’s history,” Cruz said. “The American people played a very direct role in helping choose this nominee. ” Cruz also noted that since Democrats voted for Gorsuch’s federal judgeship 10 years ago, his outstanding record since then should make confirming him even easier. Notwithstanding its leftist political leanings, the American Bar Association (ABA) earlier this month gave Gorsuch a “well qualified” rating to serve as a justice on the U. S. Supreme Court. The ABA has three ratings for judicial nominees: not qualified, qualified, and well qualified. The ABA’s standing committee on the federal judiciary was unanimous in granting Gorsuch its highest rating.",0
11423,"Project Veritas 4: Robert Creamer's Illegal $20,000 Foreign Wire Transfer Caught On Tape","  Project Veritas 4: Robert Creamer's Illegal $20,000 Foreign Wire Transfer Caught On Tape Oct 26, 2016 3:10 PM 0 SHARES 
Project Veritas has just released Part IV of it's multi-part series exposing numerous scandals surrounding the DNC and the Clinton campaign, including efforts to incite violence at Trump rallies and, at least what seems to be, illegal coordination between the DNC, Hillary For America and various Super PACs. 
Part IV focuses on a $20,000 foreign donation made by an undercover Project Veritas journalist to Americans United for Change (AUFC). Ironically, shortly after the $20k donation wire was released, the contributor's ""niece"" was offered an internship with Creamer's firm, Democracy Partners. 
In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. 

“First thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I’d like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I’m going to make here is to my money guy and he’s going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,” said the PVA journalist. 

Creamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the “donors” “niece” - another Project Veritas Action journalist - was offered an internship with Creamer. 

In an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor’s money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. During that meeting, Creamer spoke about connections he had with Obama and Clinton. 
AUFC President, Brad Woodhouse, subsequently returned the money, after Project Veritas started to release their undercover videos, citing ""concerns that it might have been an illegal foreign donation."" Oddly, Woodhouse was not terribly concerned about the ""legality"" of the donation when he chose to accept it a month prior. 
In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money. 

While the latest video focuses on the "" $20,000 illegal foreign contribution"" from an undercover Project Veritas journalist , the following comments from Robert Creamer were also rather intriguing in light of recent White House efforts to vehemently deny any connections between he and President Obama. 
""Oh Barack Obama's was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. 

He's a pro. I've known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago . 

I was just at and event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last . He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues. Helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the...the health care bill...trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.""

11425,Christ's burial place exposed for 1st time in centuries,"Christ's burial place exposed for 1st time in centuries Restorers uncover stone slab venerated as resting place of Jesus Published: 11 mins ago 
(National Geographic) For the first time in centuries, scientists have exposed the original surface of what is traditionally considered the tomb of Jesus Christ. Located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least 1555 A.D., and most likely centuries earlier. 
“The marble covering of the tomb has been pulled back, and we were surprised by the amount of fill material beneath it,” said Fredrik Hiebert, archaeologist-in-residence at the National Geographic Society, a partner in the restoration project. “It will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid.”",0

11427,The Oath of Office: 35 Words That Are Harder Than They Look - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump will become president of the United States after he says just 35 words: the oath of office. What is the oath, you may ask?   have taken the oath since the beginning of the republic. George Washington first said it in 1789, and the oath has been the centerpiece of presidential inaugurations ever since, symbolizing the continuity of democratic rule and the peaceful transition of power. The oath of office comes directly from Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. This is the full text, according to the National Museum of American History: The oath is traditionally administered by the chief justice of the United States, but sometimes that can be harder than it looks. In 2009, Justice John G. Roberts Jr. garbled the oath while swearing in Barack Obama. Chief Justice Roberts misspoke  —   he said, “I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully. ” Then, he left out the word “execute” altogether. Mr. Obama, for his part, seemed to realize the chief justice’s mistake. Mr. Obama’s aides said that they believed the oath was valid, even if it had not gone according to plan. But he was sworn in a second time before a small, private audience the next day  —   just to make sure. Before they began, Mr. Obama joked with the chief justice, “We’re going to do it very slowly. ”",0
11428,"On Gulf Coast Flooding, The Times Is Late to the Scene - The New York Times","Updated, 3:41 p. m. The heavy rain started on Friday, and as flooding began in towns across the Gulf Coast, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency. By Saturday the waters were raging: the National Guard was pulling people from their homes, rivers were cresting at historic levels, cars and buses had overturned and the worst was ahead. It was not until Sunday night, at 8:20 p. m. that The New York Times posted a   story on its website, which appeared Monday in print. Readers trying to follow the news might have come across a wire story before Sunday, but The Times had devoted no staff resources before then. Only today has a staff writer reached the flood areas  —   Campbell Robertson, who until now has been covering the floods from dry ground in New Orleans. Many readers have expressed disappointment in the coverage. Here’s Catherine Holmes, of Georgia, who wrote in Sunday afternoon. “Baton Rouge and residents north and east are in the midst of a disaster and I see nothing on The New York Times’s front page. Hundreds of people have been stranded on   since yesterday morning, and just a few hours ago got some water delivered to them,” she wrote. “Disappointing that Trump’s latest gaffe and the Olympics totally dominate your front page this morning, when so many in south Louisiana are suffering. ” There was also this from Laura Esfeller, who grew up in Louisiana: “I am outraged that The New York Times is not covering the devastating flooding in Louisiana! People are stranded, have lost everything and are dying, and the nation’s newspaper of record has done no original reporting on this? Make this a priority!” The Times is not the only news organization being criticized for doing too little too late on the floods. Even so, from my scanning of the media’s reaction, The Times’s performance seems particularly weak. I asked national editor Marc Lacey what explains the limited coverage so far. “I think it’s a big story and I think we were on it,” he said. “It’s clear there’s extensive devastation. ” When I pushed about the slow start, Lacey said, “We definitely could have done more and we’re going to do more. Stay tuned. ” (The Times published two additional   stories Tuesday afternoon.) Lacey said The Times has covered the floods with wire stories and photography, and with two   stories. He said the paper used a stringer in the region to help with the reporting. If there was someone on the ground, it is not very evident to me from the stories that were produced. Most of the quotes from residents, or descriptions of the scene or events, appear to be taken from television or were credited to other news organizations or social media. In other words: aggregation. No doubt this is a busy news period, and the fact that it is August compounds the usual challenges of getting available staff to the site of the news. But a news organization like The Times  —   rich with resources and eager to proclaim its national prominence  —   surely can find a way to cover a storm that has ravaged such a wide stretch of the country’s Gulf Coast. Especially when it has brought devastating floods, once more, to the brave state of Louisiana.",0
11429,Exxon C.E.O. Said to Be Top Contender for Secretary of State Giuliani Is Out - The New York Times,"■ Rudolph W. Giuliani, a fiercely loyal Trump ally, is out of the race for secretary of state. Rex W. Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil, appears to be the leading contender. ■   Donald J. Trump’s transition team is asking a lot of questions at the Energy Department. ■ Mr. Trump will name Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, to direct the National Economic Council. ■ He could also name Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, to be interior secretary. Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, is the leading candidate to be Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, according to a person with direct knowledge of the search process. Mr. Tillerson went to Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday to meet with Mr. Trump, who is said to be close to making a decision. Mr. Tillerson has been strongly recommended by a number of business leaders. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has been described by Mr. Trump’s advisers as still in the running. But Mr. Trump has said conflicting things privately about his views of Mr. Romney, advisers said, and has indicated to several people that he is unlikely to be named.   Trump’s transition team has circulated an unusual   questionnaire that requests the names of all employees and contractors who have attended domestic or international climate change policy conferences, as well as emails associated with the conferences. The questionnaire appears targeted at climate science research and clean energy programs. Energy Department employees, who shared the questionnaire with The New York Times and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, described the questionnaire as unprecedented and worrying. “These questions don’t just indicate an attack on civil servants here in Washington,” said an Energy Department employee. “They amount to a witch hunt in D. O. E. ’s 17 national labs, where scientists have the independence to do their work  —   yet here are questions that are reminiscent of an inquisition rather than actual curiosity about how the labs work. ” The questionnaire asks for lists of employees involved in key climate change programs, including all those who have attended United Nations climate change conferences. It also asks for lists of employees involved in designing a metric known as the Social Cost of Carbon, a figure used by the Obama administration to measure the economic impact of carbon dioxide pollution, and to justify the economic cost of climate regulations. It specifically asks which Energy Department programs are essential to meeting the goals of President Obama’s climate change agenda, which Mr. Trump has vowed to roll back. It includes several questions for the Energy Information Administration, the department’s statistics office, which also measures the nation’s carbon dioxide pollution, asking for justification of its numbers. “In the Annual Energy Outlook 2016, E. I. A. assumed that the Clean Power Plan should be in the reference case despite the fact that the reference case is based on existing laws and regulations,” the questionnaire reads. “Why did the E. I. A. make that assumption, which seems to be atypical of past forecasts?” And it includes several questions focused on the national scientific laboratories, including queries on highest salaries, and outside evaluation of research. Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal allies, is no longer in the running for secretary of state, after removing his name from contention on Nov. 29, according to a statement from the transition. “Rudy Giuliani is an extraordinarily talented and patriotic American,” Mr. Trump said in the statement. “I will always be appreciative of his   dedication to our campaign after I won the primaries and for his extremely wise counsel. He is and continues to be a close personal friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date. ” Mr. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, will remain on the transition team. “This is not about me it is about what is best for the country and the new administration,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Before I joined the campaign I was very involved and fulfilled by my work with my law firm and consulting firm, and I will continue that work with even more enthusiasm. From the vantage point of the private sector, I look forward to helping the   in any way he deems necessary and appropriate. ” The statement came as Mr. Giuliani’s prospects had dimmed for the State Department post, apparently the only one he wanted. He had been offered the job of attorney general and secretary of homeland security, but had no interest, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Some in Mr. Trump’s circle were concerned about the potential for a messy confirmation hearing over Mr. Giuliani’s tangle of foreign business ties and paid speeches. Encouraged by the  ’s possible   on deporting young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, two senators have crafted a bipartisan bill to help protect them. Known as the Bridge Act, the bill, sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, is intended to protect roughly 800, 000 young illegal immigrants from deportation should Mr. Trump make good on his campaign promise to end the protections issued by President Obama through an executive order. The Obama program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, granted deportation protection and work permits for two years to immigrants brought to the country as minors who have passed criminal background checks. The   measure, which also has at least one   from each party, would give current recipients a reprieve even if Mr. Trump undoes the order, and allow new applicants to apply. Mr. Trump, who has included the   Dreamers in his broader deportation plan, appeared to back down in an interview published in Time magazine this week when he said, “We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud. ” Mr. Cohn, president of the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs, is expected to be named director of Mr. Trump’s National Economic Council, joining the Treasury secretary pick Steven Mnuchin as Goldman voices on the economic team. Mr. Trump used Wall Street and “the global elites” as constant foils during the campaign, featuring Goldman’s chief executive and chairman, Lloyd Blankfein, in his dark closing argument. Since his victory, however, Mr. Trump has tapped Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, for Treasury secretary the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to be his commerce secretary Todd Ricketts, heir to the Ameritrade fortune, to be deputy commerce secretary and now Mr. Cohn. The National Economic Council was created by President Bill Clinton  —   another frequent foil of Mr. Trump’s  —   to show that domestic policy would be equal to foreign policy. Like the older National Security Council, the N. E. C. coordinates the policies of the Treasury, labor and commerce departments, as well as other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Council of Economic Advisers. And because Mr. Cohn will sit in the White House complex, he is likely to be extremely influential on Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohn is also a big contributor to federal campaigns on both sides of the aisle, including tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Democratic campaign committees. Adding Mr. Cohn to the economic team was a favorite idea of Mr. Trump’s    Jared Kushner. And he does not break the streak of wealthy Trump teammates. Mr. Cohn’s most recent total compensation package made public at Goldman exceeded $20. 5 million. Goldman Sachs shares, by the way, are up 33 percent since Election Day. Ms. McMorris Rodgers, the   woman in the House Republican leadership, is expected to be announced as Mr. Trump’s secretary of the interior as early as Friday, two people close to the transition efforts said. Ms. McMorris Rodgers comes from Washington, a state with large federal land reserves, and she was also critical of Mr. Trump at various points during the presidential campaign. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to requests for comment. In the last part of his winning run, Mr. Trump’s campaign amassed more money than Hillary Clinton’s, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign took in $70 million from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, compared with $86 million for the Trump campaign, of which $10 million came from the candidate’s own pocket. In terms of spending, Mrs. Clinton relied on the war chest she had built up during the course of the campaign to spend almost $131 million, compared with $94 million by Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton closed the period with under $1 million dollars in the bank, much less than the $7 million remaining for the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump may have tossed in a few million in the final weeks of his campaign, but he also took a few, soliciting donations from supporters, then reimbursing himself for rent and his airplane. From Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, the period covered by a postelection report filed with the F. E. C. the campaign paid nearly $3 million to properties owned by Mr. Trump, including rent to Trump Tower and event fees to other Trump hotels. The largest part went to Tag Air, the company that operates Mr. Trump’s airplane. The new disclosures bring the total amount that Trump companies earned from his campaign to nearly $12 million. The campaign itself was hardly a moneymaker for Mr. Trump himself, though. The  ’s total cash contributions came in at more than $65 million, well short of the $100 million he had originally promised but likely more than his businesses earned off the venture. Linda McMahon, a pro wrestling impresario, put $1 million into Future45, a   “super PAC,” in the final stages of the presidential campaign, taking her total contribution to the organization to $7 million. This week, Ms. McMahon  —   who lost twice in recent years as a Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut  —   was chosen by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who took down Gawker, gave $1 million to Make America Number 1, an   “super PAC” run by the Mercer family, hedge fund billionaires. He has not been named to a position by the transition team, but he has been mentioned as a possibility for the Supreme Court. And: But: But Mr. Trump did tell Time magazine he had done nothing to divide the country. The Trump inaugural committee offered details for the multiday party planned for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, which in a departure from the norm will include a welcome rally. (The   does love his rallies.) The announcement: Not stated: A Million Women March is being organized for the day after with a different message  —   though organizers did not get formal permits for the mall.",0
11430,Salvadoran Officials Overwhelmed by Returning Deported Gang Members,"Officials in El Salvador held emergency meetings after seeing a sharp increase in the number of violent gang members being deported back to the country from the United States under the Trump administration. [Salvadoran authorities have held emergency meetings and proposed new legislation to monitor returning criminals and gang members that are returning to El Salvador after deportation, according to the Washington Post.  The move by Salvadoran officials comes as a direct result of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration and efforts to deport more criminal illegal aliens from the U. S. This year the U. S. has already deported 398 gang members back to El Salvador  —   compared to only 534 for all of 2016. It is due to this rapid increase in deportations that Salvadoran officials like Héctor Antonio Rodríguez, the director of the country’s immigration agency, are worried about the impact the returning gang members will have in the country. “This clearly affects El Salvador. We already have a climate of violence in the country that we are combating,” Rodríguez said. “If gang members return, of course this worries us. ” Many of the returning gang members belong to   a notoriously violent street gang that has plagued communities throughout the U. S. with horrific acts of violence. Although   started out in Salvadoran communities in Los Angeles sometime during the 1980’s, lax immigration policies and weak border security helped the gang explode in size as   originated from illegal immigrants, Breitbart Texas reported. The recent murders of four teens in New York City have put   in the national spotlight with Attorney General Jeff Sessions declaring that U. S. authorities are going after the gang. “The   motto is kill, rape, and control,” Sessions said. “I have a message to the gangs that are targeting our young people: We are targeting you. We are coming after you. ” Speaking at a rally in April, President Trump highlighted the importance of removing illegal alien   gang members from the U. S.: At the heart of my administration’s efforts to restore the rule of law has been a nationwide crackdown on criminal gangs, and that means taking the fight to the sanctuary cities that shield these dangerous criminals from removal. The last very weak administration allowed thousands and thousands of gang members to cross our borders and enter into our communities, where they wreaked havoc on our citizens. The bloodthirsty cartel known as   has infiltrated our schools, threatening innocent children. We have seen the horrible assaults and many killings all along Long Island where I grew up. We are seeing the vicious spread of transnational gangs into all 50 states and the human suffering they bring with them. I have been with the parents. It is devastation. A very respected General recently told me that   are the equivalent in their meanness to Al Qaeda. My administration will not rest until we have dismantled these violent gangs, and we are doing it rapidly, and we are sending them the hell out of our country. On Wednesday, Breitbart Texas reported that Sen. Ron Johnson ( ) Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said recently obtained documents from a whistleblower show that the Obama administration knowingly admitted 16   gang members in 2014.

11431,Poll: Sexism Was NOT A Factor In Hillary's Loss | Daily Wire,"Poll: Sexism Was NOT A Factor In Hillary's Loss By: Aaron Bandler November 11, 2016 
Some leftists still reeling from Hillary Clinton's stunning defeat on Tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president. However, a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in Clinton's loss. 
The poll, conducted by Conquest Communications Group and published on Just Facts , featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism: ""If you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate, who would you vote for?"" 
Here were the results (emphasis added): 
Overall, 69% of voters said “It does not matter,” 15% preferred a female, 12% preferred a male, 3% were unsure, and 1% refused to answer. 
Male voters and Trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say “It does not matter,” at 73% and 72% respectively. The other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error, with rates of: 67% for Clinton voters. 66% for undecided voters. 64% for females. 
Naturally, supporters of Trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president–25 percent to 2 percent, respectively–and Clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president, 27 percent to 5 percent, respectively. 
The survey was conducted from October 11-23, so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election. But it's hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists. 
There is a little bias towards a male president among Trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among Clinton voters, but the results of the survey suggest that overall, the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States. 
Democrats will have to find a different strategy for identity politics since the gender card doesn't work. Speaking of identity politics, it looks like the race card seems to be in trouble as well . Tags ",0
11432,Trump Avoids Answering Whether He Will Lift Sanctions on Russia - The New York Times,"■ President Trump would not say whether he favors lifting sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and meddling in the election, as his British counterpart rejected such a move. ■ Battle lines are forming within the Republican Party ahead of Mr. Trump’s phone call Saturday with Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. ■ The commander in chief said his defense secretary will “override” his views in favor of torture. President Trump said on Friday that it was “very early” to be talking about lifting sanctions on Russia, deflecting a question about whether he would raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on Saturday morning even as his British counterpart flatly rejected such a move. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Theresa May, the British prime minister, Mr. Trump did not say whether he supports keeping sanctions that were put in place following Russia’s military involvement in Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 election. But he said he hoped to have a good relationship with Mr. Putin. “If we could have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I’m all for that,” Mr. Trump said in a brief answer to the question. Ms. May was more direct in her answer to the question about sanctions on Russia. She said the United Kingdom “believes that the sanctions should continue. ” The answers highlight what could be one of the differences between the two leaders, even as both of them insisted Friday that they plan to continue the close working relationship that has long existed between the two nations. President Trump’s phone call scheduled on Saturday with Russia’s president  —   their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office  —   has Republicans on edge. As one of his last acts as president, Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the election to help install Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting the sanctions. What came next was a list of Russian abuses: its invasion of Ukraine, its annexation of Crimea and its support of “the murderous Assad regime as it has waged war on the Syrian people and killed more than 400, 000 civilians. ” Then came this: “And in the most flagrant demonstration of Putin’s disdain and disrespect for our nation, Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and discredit Western values. ” UPDATE: Another Republican senator, Rob Portman of Ohio, joins in: President Trump said Friday that he will let his secretary of defense “override” him by banning torture even though he believes the tactics do work in getting information out of terror suspects. In a remarkable show of deference to his own subordinate, Mr. Trump noted that Jim Mattis, the Pentagon chief, does not believe torture is effective. The president, who serves as the commander in chief and usually makes the final call on military action, said he will let Mr. Mattis decide. “I don’t necessarily agree, but I will tell you that he will override because I’m giving him that power,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. ” Mr. Trump appeared to be struggling about the issue even as he spoke, returning several times to his own belief in torture’s effectiveness even as he stated several times that he would let Mr. Mattis would decide. “But I’m going with our leaders,” he said. “We are going to win, with or without. ” Then he added: “But I do disagree. ” President Trump spoke by phone on Friday with Enrique Peña Nieto, the president of Mexico, White House officials said, less than 24 hours after the Mexican president canceled a White House meeting over anger about Mr. Trump’s intentions to build a border wall. A senior White House official confirmed Friday that the call had taken place and said that an official description of what the two leaders said will be released soon. In the wake of the deepening diplomatic tensions on Thurdsday, aides to Mr. Trump had said they still intended to keep lines of communications between the two governments open. The call suggests that the two leaders may be attempting to reschedule the planned meeting. That could begin to repair the relationship in the short term, though differences will likely remain about construction of the border wall and who will finance it. Then again, Mr. Trump tweeted another salvo on Friday morning. Mr. Mattis on Friday ordered the review of the controversial   fighter jet program, which has been criticized by President Trump for its cost overruns. Mr. Mattis also ordered that plans for a new Air Force One  —   which has also come under fire from Mr. Trump  —  should be reviewed, “with the specific objective of identifying means to substantially reduce the programs costs while delivering needed capabilities. ” The   review, Mr. Mattis said in a memo, will also look at how to reduce costs while still meeting requirements set out for the fighter jet program. During his confirmation hearings earlier this month, Mr. Mattis defended tweets from Mr. Trump criticizing the   program. Mr. Mattis said at the time that Mr. Trump had “in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants more bang for the buck. ” The cost of building the   fighter jet, the   Joint Strike Fighter, has been an issue at the Pentagon for several years. At an estimated $400 billion over 15 years for 2, 443 planes, the fighter jet is the military largest weapons project. Mr. Trump is just not going to give up his claim that 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton, but he’s grasping for evidence. On Friday morning, he looked to VoteStand, which calls itself “America’s first online fraud reporting app” for the smartphone but does not appear to actually exist beyond the Twitter account of its founder, Gregg Phillips. The president seemed to be responding to an interview with Mr. Phillips on CNN Friday morning that was, shall we say, inconclusive. Mr. Phillips at once said 3 million illegal immigrants voted and said he is still working to prove that. “You can reach a conclusion and still verify it,” he maintained. Mr. Phillips began pressing his case that 3 million illegal votes were cast shortly after Election Day in November, but pressed repeatedly, Mr. Phillips has never produced any evidence. As the debunking site Snopes. com wrote: Mr. Phillips has been adamant on Twitter of course. But as PolitiFact wrote, “There is no report. ” And that is not all Mr. Phillips has asserted. He now has an endorsement from the president of the United States. Mr. Trump’s fallacious argument that he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million because of illegal immigrant ballots started as the stuff of wonderment and ridicule. Now that the Trump administration has shifted to an investigation of the voter rolls, things have gotten serious. Democrats appear to be girding for battle, but if, as is likely, Senator Jeff Sessions, a conservative from Alabama, becomes the attorney general, it does not appear to be a fight that the minority can win. The Democrats fear the hunt for illegal voters will become a pretext to tighten voting requirements nationwide and bar many minority voters who tend to side with the Democrats. Even moderate Democrats are alarmed. Word from Politico is that President Trump will not be attending the fancy,   Alfalfa Club dinner Saturday night, a chummy gathering with many of Washington’s politicians, journalists and every president since Ronald Reagan. Lest we get too excited  —   could the White House Correspondents Association dinner be next? Please?  —   we should wait and see. It is true that every president since Mr. Reagan has attended the annual roast and silly cabaret dinner of the Alfalfa Club, a     Washington clique that seems like it was hatched from a bygone era. But not many of those presidents have attended each year. Mr. Trump may yet keep the soiree alive. Mr. Trump traveled to the City of Brotherly Love on Thursday to decry Philadelphia’s rising murder rate  —   “I mean, just terribly increasing. ” But it isn’t. Last year’s 277 homicides was down from 280 in 2015. That is up from 2014, when 248 were murdered, and in 2013, when 246 were killed. But recent years are markedly down from 2007 to 2012 when Philadelphia had more than 300 killings, 391 in 2007 alone. “President Trump’s false statements today were an insult to the men and women of the Philadelphia police force  —   the very same men and women who are working long hours today to ensure his safety,” Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement Thursday. Of course, in the era of alternative facts, Mayor Kenney may be spitting in the wind. The Trump administration’s decision to drop advertisements encouraging people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act was greeted with anger and alarm by supporters of the law  —   and a recognition that Mr. Trump wants the law crippled. “This is sabotage, pure and simple,” fumed Leslie Dach, a senior official in President Barack Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services who now heads a coalition to save the law. “This proves that this administration doesn’t care about people who need health coverage. And it clearly shows that they now own the consequences of their efforts to undermine the health care system. ” The ads were to have run only for a few more days, until the annual open enrollment period ends on Tuesday. In the last few years, large numbers of consumers signed up just before the deadline. But Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress are determined to repeal Mr. Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Since Nov. 1, more than 11. 5 million people have signed up for insurance or had their coverage automatically renewed. And when the enrollment period ends, it’s anyone’s guess who will announce the total number of people who would lose their insurance if the law is repealed. The leading candidate to be the Pentagon’s new spokesman is John Ullyot, a former Marine Corps intelligence officer and veteran of Capitol Hill. Mr. Ullyot served as spokesman and deputy chief of staff for two Republican senators, John W. Warner of Virginia and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and as spokesman for the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2003 to 2007.",0

11435,"Breaking: “Fukushima Cooling System FAILS” After Tsunami, 7.4 Earthquake Hits Japan","Read by 353 people 
One of the worst case scenarios is happening again. 
According to reports, Fukushima is being struck again by a tsunami after a large 7.4 earthquake – just updated from reports of a 7.3 earthquake – struck off the main island directly in front of the Fukushima Prefecture where the beleaguered TEPCO nuclear plant is situated. 
via CNN : A tsunami warning is in effect for Japan’s Fukushima Prefecture after a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Honshu at 5:59 a.m. Tuesday (3:59 p.m. Monday ET), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.A tsunami wave of 1-3 meters (3-10 feet) is possible, according to the agency. 
Numerous aftershocks, somewhere in the range of 5.0 to 5.4 are being widely reported as well. 
According to RT , that tsunami has advanced and has now affected the cooling system at Fukushima. Seriously – this is reportedly happening! Fukushima reactor cooling system stops following quake & tsunami 
The cooling system of the third reactor at the Fukushima nuclear power plant has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake. 
Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) told national broadcaster NHK that the cooling system in the Reactor 3 spent fuel pool stopped working. Japan’s national nuclear agency has confirmed that the temperature rise in the pool is “gradual.” The exact cause of the cooling system stoppage is currently unknown. However, the system might have been “shaken” during the earthquake, according to nuclear agency officials, as reported by NHK. No cooling water leaks or any other “abnormalities” have been reported. According to NHK, cooling equipment for the spent nuclear fuel pool in the reactor No. 3 of Tepco’s Fukushima No. 2 power plant has stopped. 
— The Japan Times (@japantimes) November 21, 2016 
There may still be large waves – potentially as big as 10 feet – that hit the shores of Japan, though the size and extend, and the potential scope of the damage and/or loss of life remains to be seen. 
On March 11, 2011 a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Japan and triggered an enormous and devastating tsunami that crippled the nuclear power plant, and exposed that world’s oceans and biosphere to potential contamination. 
Fukushima is already an open wound but these new events could exacerbate the problems – or magnify them. 
That’s why it is so completely disturbing that the powers that be never properly fixed the problems that were still ongoing after years. The situation at Fukushima Daiichi was never fully contained, and the reactors continued to leak; there is no way to stop the reactions or disable the rods. The authorities simply lied and killed all the press coverage, forcing silence on the issue, except for the online blogosphere, where the issue has lived on as a hotly debated topic that people believe is causing health problems and environmental issues on a widespread basis. RT: Video of blast at Fukushima nuke plant, radiation leak reported 2013:Fukushima Nuclear Disaster Going From Horrible To Horrendous 
But whatever has been swept under the rug is likely to come to the forefront if a new tsunami brings massive destruction to Japan’s mainland again. 
The failure of the cooling systems is – for now – only the first problem to be acknowledged in news reports. The situation is ongoing, and less than 24 hours have passed. 
Considering that the corporate and government authorities in Japan made a concerted effort to silence bad news and pretend the problem away, there is no reason to believe that transparent coverage about what happens after this new earthquake and tsunami will be forthcoming. 
So keep your eyes open, and your screen’s recording what is being reported and what other information comes out. 
RT has continued live coverage of the events in Japan. 
The reality of a potential catastrophe compounding the existing damage at Fukushima, and to everything its waters touch, simply may not be reported. 
The powers that be on the Internet, and in the spheres of politics, are going out of their way to censor the grassroots media that thrives online, and are using 21st Century gestapo tactics to silence what they are labeling “false news.” 
This story may be updated as more information becomes available.

11437,Lena Dunham Apologizes (Makes Excuses) for Her Racism - Breitbart,"Actress and feminist activist Lena Dunham has come under fire recently for her history of racism, for example, a tweet she posted in 2010 referring to African Americans as “rodents. ”[“I’m never mad and I never feel victimized when people point out that they’ve been injured in some way by my behavior. I truly don’t feel like I deserve a certain kind of pass for my feminism or for my politics,” Dunham said during an appearance on comedian Phoebe Robinson’s WNYC podcast, Sooo Many White Guys.  “When you’re living your life in the public eye, you will fuck up and you will fall down, and the only power you have is to apologize and keep moving,” Dunham explained. The    actress attempted to atone, specifically, for projecting sexist thoughts onto New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. when the two briefly shared a table at last year’s Met Ball. “I’m not saying that this is in any way an excuse, [but] I move through the world feeling very awkward. It was at a table of notably beautiful women sitting there. I’m just having the experience of being a   girl around what I consider to be like a hot, desirable athlete. So that was just projecting my own insecurity,” Dunham said about falsely attributing comments to Beckham Jr. rejecting her “marshmallow”  body that he did not make. “I hadn’t understood the way that it fed into a very dark history of, you know, black men being lynched for not responding to white women in the way white women felt they were supposed to be responded to,” Dunham said, maintaining that she was simply ignorant of the implications of her actions. “I understood the minute that that was pointed out to me what the issue was. I was seeing myself as the chubby    I am inside of myself, and not the person who is a cultural figure, who has the power to say something that could be hurtful and destructive. ” Later in the interview, Robinson, a black actress from New York City, grilled Dunham about the lack of   characters in the early seasons of her HBO show Girls —  a raunchy    dramedy about four privileged white girls living in the   Bronx. “There was just a certain amount of ignorance,” Dunham confessed, referencing her privileged white liberal childhood. “I almost wasn’t making a choice because choice implies knowledge. At that point, to be totally frank, I didn’t have enough women of color in my life talking to me about what representation meant to them for me to even understand that my show would be seen and have that kind of power. ” To be sure, Dunham says she has learned from her mistakes and promises never to create another show about “four white girls. ” “We’re not going to make another show that has four white girls on the poster,” she said, “because now, we’ve been very deeply educated about how much representation matters. ” The former Hillary Clinton campaign spokeswoman has been busy since failing to fulfill her promise to move to Canada if Donald Trump won the election. After wishing, last month, that she had an abortion, Dunham gave a “sizable donation to abortion funds” and Planned Parenthood. During the weekend, Dunham got naked, jumped in a tub of water, and took to Twitter to encourage her followers to sign up for Obamacare before the January 31 enrollment deadline: Inspired by @captdope, here’s a commercial for HEALTH INSURANCE. https:  .  —   get what’s yours #pullthisad 🙏 pic. twitter.   —   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) January 28, 2017,  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.",0

11439,Russia: Rebel Attacks Around Aleppo Jeopardize Pause in Airstrikes,"Warns Russia Can't Maintain Pause if Strikes Continue by Jason Ditz, November 01, 2016 Share This 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned today that the moratorium on Russian airstrikes around Aleppo is in jeopardy from the continued rebel attacks against positions around government-held Western Aleppo. 
Peskov insisted Russia wants to enable to exit of civilians from rebel Eastern Aleppo, and to create conditions wherein humanitarian aid can be delivered to the city. Russia has paused its airstrikes for about two weeks now to that end. 
While it seemed early on that Russia could afford to be patient, with Eastern Aleppo surrounded and the Syrian military doing well in clashes with the Nusra Front. Late last week, however, Nusra and their allies launched a major counterattack, which has been raging since. 
The counterattack came from outside the city, trying to end the siege on the east and threatening government-held territories in the west. Russia has so far not gotten involved, and while the Syrian military seems to have staved off any huge defeats, this likely adds to pressure from Russia’s Defense Ministry. 
Though President Putin has so far insisted the pause should continue, the defense ministry has made much of calling for an end to it and resuming airstrikes. It is unusual for them to publicly dissent from official policy, and the pick-up in fighting will only increase those calls. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
11440,Republicans Running for Congress Struggle With an ‘Albatross’ - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Senate Republicans breathed a sigh of relief in late June. Senator Mitch McConnell’s campaign to lure Senator Marco Rubio into running for   in Florida had paid off and Republican control of Congress felt a little more secure. It has been all downhill since. Donald J. Trump’s   plummet in the polls has taken vulnerable Republican Senate candidates along for the ride, throwing the door open to the prospect of a Democratic majority under the leadership of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. On top of that, the Trump campaign brought on Stephen Bannon, the head of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News, which has savaged Republican congressional leaders like Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan as hypocritical quislings. The new campaign team is also promising to let Mr. Trump be Mr. Trump, a prospect that no doubt terrifies many Republican candidates who would prefer not to comment on more incendiary statements from the Republican nominee. His blanket expression of regret Thursday night for earlier comments cheered some in his party, but that moment was quickly overtaken by news of the resignation of Paul Manafort, the embattled Trump campaign chairman. It has all left Republicans tied to the party establishment that Mr. Trump so frequently disparages increasingly glum. “Trump is proving to be an albatross around all of our necks, and it is creating a very challenging environment,” said Rob Jesmer, a Republican strategist and a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. It is a realization of the fear that Republicans have harbored for months  —   that a significant swing in political momentum against Mr. Trump would engulf Senate and House candidates in more competitive states and districts even if they were running solid campaigns. Senate Republicans are currently struggling in at least six states where they are defending seats  —   Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That is two more than Democrats would need to set the Senate agenda if Hillary Clinton were elected president. “I can say without any hesitation that the Democrats will retake the Senate,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the departing Senate minority leader who is not impressed by efforts to retool the Trump campaign. “They’ve been trying to get him to run a real campaign but that’s not who he is. ” Top Republicans admit they face a real challenge. “We are very much on defense this cycle,” Mr. McConnell told me during the Republican National Convention last month. “These are really, really tough competitive races. ” It could get worse. If the Trump campaign continues to falter, the damage could extend to candidates who look like survivors at the moment  —   think Senators Rob Portman in Ohio, Charles E. Grassley in Iowa, John McCain in Arizona and Roy Blunt in Missouri. Even Mr. Rubio, who just a few weeks ago was considered the missing ingredient to holding the Senate majority, is far from safe. And with Mrs. Clinton seemingly competitive in Georgia at the presidential level, Democrats are even eyeing the seat of the Republican senator Johnny Isakson, a race that was on no one’s radar a few months ago. The scope of any Democratic victory is crucial. It is one thing if Democrats are able to muster a    majority or even a    Senate with a Vice President Tim Kaine constantly on hand to break ties after relinquishing his own Senate seat. Every additional Democrat would make it that much easier to move forward with a Clinton administration legislative agenda and make it that much harder for Republicans to reclaim the majority in 2018, when the numbers would be more in their favor. Still, not even the most optimistic Democrats believe they have a chance of reaching 60, the number needed to overcome a filibuster. A similar dynamic is at work in the House. At the moment, chances for Democrats’ winning the 30 seats they would need to take back power are considered slim in the absence of a complete Trump swoon. But both sides expect Democratic gains, and the loss of even half that number of Republicans would greatly complicate the life of Mr. Ryan  —   provided he would even want to remain speaker at that point or that a majority of remaining House Republicans would want him. Mr. Ryan has not directly addressed the addition to the leadership of the Trump campaign of Mr. Bannon, whose website has skewered the speaker. Republicans are hardly surrendering. Many still believe they can hold the Senate and certainly the House. Candidates are frantically raising money, and party strategists are in a rolling series of meetings figuring how best to contend with the intensifying Trump effect. One senator who did not want to be identified conceding any party losses put the   scenario for Republicans at holding on to a    Senate. But even that outcome contemplates Republicans’ winning Mr. Reid’s seat in Nevada, where there is a very close race between a Republican representative, Joe Heck, and former Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat. Democrats have their own concerns. They fear that a decision by the Republican National Committee to abandon Mr. Trump to preserve Republican congressional majorities could rescue some candidates now in danger. They also worry that   conservative groups such as the Koch network could pour in money to keep Republicans in power as a check against a Clinton administration. Plus, Democrats face their own questions about resources. An expanding electoral map presents additional, but less promising, opportunities and Democrats will have to keep spending on their top targets in states such as New Hampshire and Pennsylvania throughout the campaign to keep the heat on the Republican incumbents. Still, as the handicapper Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg  Gonzales Political Report noted, “The upside is certainly on the Democratic side. ” The question at the moment seems to be just how high that upside goes.",0
11441,House Republicans Unveil Bullet Points for Obamacare Repeal - Breitbart,"House Republican leaders previewed parts of an Obamacare repeal bill at a Thursday press conference. [House Speaker Ryan announced:  Here is what is important for us all to understand: Obamacare is not simply stuck in some kind of status quo. It is getting worse by the day, and it will keep getting worse unless we act. We need to rescue people from this collapsing law, and we need to replace it with a true   system. One that gives every American access to quality, affordable coverage. That means more choices and lower costs. It means real protections and peace of mind. And it means returning your care to your control. Patients and doctors should be making the big decisions —  not government bureaucrats. Step by step, this is what our plan to repeal and replace Obamacare will do. We look forward to making progress in the coming weeks and keeping our promise to the American people. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden ( ) joined the speaker in reaffirming their commitment to repealing and replacing Obamacare. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) said, “We’re going to continue to work through this through the district work period next week. And as we come back in the weeks ahead we’re going to be moving forward with legislation. ” Republicans leaders hope to soon provide a credible alternative to Obamacare. House congressional committees including Ways and Means, as well as Energy and Commerce, will start the markup of the bill after the president’s day recess next week. The Republican proposal would include health savings accounts,   pools for sick people, and states receiving greater control over health care. The plan also includes tax credits for individuals to buy health insurance dependent on age and family size rather than Obamacare’s income basis. The Republican plan lowers Medicaid back to each states’ traditional match rate. The proposal says, “This ensures continuity of care and coverage for   adults, but does not reward states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare and allows individuals to cycle off the program into other coverage sources naturally. ” States that did not elect to expand Medicaid would receive additional resources to make states more equal. The plan would limit per capita spending on Medicaid however, states can elect to choose a block grant. The block grant does not include Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid funding and presumes that individuals find coverage outside of the Medicaid program. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told lawmakers that the president backs repeal and replace occurring at the same time, and that “the president is all in on this. ”  ",0

11443,How to Keep the Bloom on That Mother’s Day Rose - The New York Times,"If you’ve received a bouquet from that special someone this Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, or any other special occasion, you may be looking for ways to extend the gesture as long as possible. Just like hangover cures, there are many theories about the best method for keeping flowers fresh. I wanted to find out if one method reigned above all. So I asked some flower experts and tried my own (not very scientific) homegrown experiment. To start, I bought nine stalks of chrysanthemums from a grocery store and put each stalk in a clean glass bottle with about 12 ounces of warm water and the following common treatments: • Water alone • Water and putting flowers in a refrigerator every night • Sprite (¼ cup) and water • Vinegar (1 tbsp.) sugar (1 tbsp.) and water • Vodka (⅛ tsp.) sugar (1 tsp.) and water • Aspirin (1 crushed) and water • Penny, sugar (1 tsp.) and water • Bleach (2 drops) sugar (1 tsp.) and water • Flower food (½ packet) and water There’s some science behind these methods. But a word of caution before you try one: That little packet of flower food that came with the flowers may be your best bet. It likely has the right blend of antibacterial agents, a sugar source for food and an acidifier that will extend the life of your arrangement. “The problem with home remedies is it’s difficult to get the proportions right  —   put in too much bleach, and you might kill your flowers,” said Mary Hockenberry Meyer, a professor of horticulture at the University of Minnesota. But if you didn’t get one of those packets  —   or if you are harvesting flowers straight from the garden  —   here are some things you should know. Let’s rewind first, to the moment you receive a fresh bouquet. Before you even put your flowers in water, there are a couple of things you should do. If you’re using an old vase, wash it thoroughly because “whatever’s left over from your last batch of flowers has a lot of bacteria in it,” said Chris Wien, a professor emeritus of horticulture at Cornell University. Those bacteria block water flow in the flowers’ stems, causing your blooms to wilt sooner. Right away, cut off half an inch to an inch of the stems at a diagonal, using sharp scissors or a knife. Make sure to cut “in a tub or under running water, which prevents air bubbles from getting into the stems and blocking the flow of water,” said Amy Jo Detweiler, an associate professor of horticulture at Oregon State University. Remove any leaves or florets that would sit in the water, because those will cause bacterial buildup. Ideally, you should first put your flowers in water around 110 degrees (and your additives, of choice) and then keep the vase in a cool place for at least a couple of hours. This process, called “hardening” or “conditioning,” helps because warm water molecules move up the stems more quickly, while a cool environment minimizes water loss through the flowers’ petals and leaves. Though you might intuitively want to place flowers by a window, direct sunlight can actually stress cut flowers more than helping them  —   remember, your blossoms are not really photosynthesizing anymore so they don’t need sun to make food. Normal indoor lighting works just fine. Change the water at least once a week, recutting the stems and adding more preservative or food each time. In total, I kept my flowers for 10 days. Every day I randomly shuffled the flowers around, to ensure that positioning wouldn’t explain the outcomes. On Day 5, I fully replaced the water and treatments for each vase. So how did my treatments fare? In theory, soda, vinegar and aspirin should acidify the water so it more closely resembles the sap inside plant cells, helping the flowers take up fluid more easily. Vodka is thought to inhibit the production of ethylene, a gaseous hormone that causes flowers to mature and fruits to ripen. Copper, bleach and vinegar are antibacterial, and refrigerating should slow water loss and the breakdown of tissues. By far, the worst performers were aspirin and vinegar with added sugar. Flowers in the aspirin solution started wilting just four days in, while flowers in vinegar and sugar started wilting on Day 6. The aspirin treatment likely failed because it lacked sugar, and the vinegar treatment may have contained too much acid, said Neil Anderson, a professor of horticulture at the University of Minnesota. “For the water volume you used, you’d maybe want a teaspoon of vinegar at most. ” Though the flowers in the Sprite treatment stayed healthy, the solution had spots of fungus on its surface, which was not surprising because it contained a lot of sugar but no antibacterial ingredients. The flowers in the penny solution also looked good, though the water appeared slightly cloudy, likely because the copper didn’t dissolve enough to provide any antimicrobial effects. “It’s a great psychological remedy, perhaps,” said Dr. Wien. While the bouquets in aspirin and vinegar sagged, all the other flowers appeared robust, even in plain water. That may show the best way to ensure your blooms last longer: Get a resilient flower. Without realizing it, I had chosen one of the hardiest flowers for my experiment. This kind of chrysanthemum will probably live at least two weeks in the vase, and “you will not see a difference in any treatment,” Dr. Meyer predicted when I talked to her on Day 5 of my experiment. Because of genetic differences, certain flowers  —   like chrysanthemums and carnations  —   simply last longer than others, Dr. Anderson said. Though roses are a favorite for Valentine’s Day, they usually don’t last longer than a week, he added, a bit shorter than many other flowers. “Their petals aren’t as tough and waxy, so they lose a lot of water and wilt fast. ” Of course, even if you pull out all the stops, you won’t be able to ward off the inevitable. So, smell your roses while they last.",0
11444,Drug Stocks Drop as Trump Backs Price Bidding,"Drug stocks plummeted as   Donald Trump announced that he wants “new bidding procedures” for Big Pharma that would force drug companies to compete for government contracts. [“They are getting away with murder,” Trump said about drug companies at a press conference Wednesday. “Pharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there is very little bidding on drugs. We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don’t bid properly and we’re going to start bidding and we’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. ”  “The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index fell 2. 6 percent at 11:28 a. m. in New York, and the Standard  Poor’s 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology  Life Sciences Index was down 1. 7 percent,” Bloomberg reports. Trump also noted many drug manufacturers have relocated their legal addresses overseas to save on taxes, a situation he says he plans to address. “We have to get our drug industry coming back,” Trump said. “Our drug industry has been disastrous. They’re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs but they don’t make them here, to a large extent. ” Trump added he has plans for similar actions in other industries.",0
11445,Jeff Sessions Says He Would Be Independent and Stand Up to Trump - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Senator Jeff Sessions,   Donald J. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, pledged on Tuesday to “say no” to Mr. Trump if he tries to go beyond the law, and he spoke out against torture, a ban on Muslim immigration and other ideas that had been floated by Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions, a deeply conservative Republican from Alabama who was an early Trump supporter, appears headed for confirmation after completing more than nine hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Sessions and his allies had girded for a coordinated attack on his civil rights record, but Democrats tempered their criticism and Republicans mounted a   defense, describing him repeatedly as a man of integrity. In his two decades on Capitol Hill, Mr. Sessions has questioned whether the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States, has said courts have interpreted the separation of church and state too broadly and has declared   marriage a threat to American culture. He also voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Much of the hearing focused on Mr. Sessions’s long record as a prosecutor and a senator, but Mr. Trump proved a dominant figure in absentia for much of the debate as Democrats sought to question the   by proxy. They asked whether Mr. Sessions supported Mr. Trump’s most controversial statements and questioned whether he had the independence to rein in the   Mr. Trump if he seeks to exceed his presidential authority. In his cool, Southern drawl, Mr. Sessions vowed repeatedly that he would, saying that an attorney general “cannot be a mere rubber stamp” for the president. “If an attorney general is asked to do something that’s plainly unlawful,” he said, “that person would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy that the attorney general believes would be unlawful or unconstitutional. ” But he indicated that he did not believe he would reach that impasse. If he advises Mr. Trump that a policy is illegal, he said, “I am confident that he would” heed that advice. A Methodist, he also pledged to set aside his personal beliefs and aggressively enforce all federal laws  —   even in areas like abortion, gay rights and hate crimes where he has made his opposition well known. “I don’t think it would be hard for me to be impartial and enforce laws that I didn’t vote for,” he said. “I think I can separate my personal votes of maybe years ago from what my responsibilities is today. ” He was asked, for instance, about a law he opposed in the Senate making attacks based on sexual orientation a hate crime. “The law has been passed, the Congress has spoken, and you can be sure I will enforce it,” Mr. Sessions said. Many of Mr. Sessions’s answers appeared calculated to distance himself from some of Mr. Trump’s most contentious threats and pledges on the campaign trail. He said, for instance, that current law “absolutely” bans waterboarding and the use of other torture techniques against prisoners  —   even though Mr. Trump promised to reinstitute the practice and Mr. Sessions himself supported it for years. Asked about last week’s report by intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the American election, he said that “I have no reason to doubt that and no information that would indicate otherwise”  —   a sharp contrast from Mr. Trump’s weeks of skepticism. Mr. Trump last week called the uproar over Russia’s role a “political witch hunt. ” He said he also opposed creating a registry of American Muslims or banning Muslim immigrants, as Mr. Trump proposed repeatedly during the campaign in response to terrorist attacks. “I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States,” Mr. Sessions said. But he said he supported using “extreme vetting” of immigrants that might take into account religious beliefs  —   an idea Mr. Trump now appears to have endorsed. Mr. Sessions also appeared to play down the prospects that his Justice Department would seek to jail Hillary Clinton over her private email server, another pledge that Mr. Trump made repeatedly during the campaign. Mr. Sessions surprised lawmakers by declaring that he would recuse himself from any decisions on Mrs. Clinton’s emails or the Clinton Foundation because he said that critical statements he made about her during the campaign might pose a conflict. Mr. Sessions had previously supported appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton. The F. B. I. ’s investigation into her private email server is closed, and while a preliminary investigation into the Clinton Foundation is open, senior law enforcement officials say there is little basis for the case to move forward. He deflected questions about Mr. Trump with a calm stoicism, but he grew angry and emotional when Democrats pressed him on a more personal matter: accusations of racial insensitivity toward his employees and others as a federal prosecutor, which doomed his nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986. Protesters in the ornate Senate hearing room, who disrupted the proceedings more than a dozen times during the day, erupted in chants of “Sessions is a racist!” and “No Trump, no K. K. K. no fascist U. S. A. !” Two men dressed as Klansmen in white robes and hoods shouted their mocking support for Mr. Sessions before security officers hustled them out of the room. With his voice rising, Mr. Sessions called accusations that he had made racist remarks in the 1980s “damnably false. ” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican friend who introduced Mr. Sessions for the hearing, came to his defense, pointing to Mr. Sessions’s prosecution of Klan members in an Alabama murder and his appointment of the first   chief counsel to the Judiciary Committee’s Republican staff. “These are not the actions of an individual motivated by racial animus,” she said. Mr. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump’s   presidential bid in early 2016, and they bonded over their shared agreement that immigration had had devastating effects on working people. While Mr. Sessions sought to distance himself on Tuesday from some of Mr. Trump’s controversial stances, he embraced the  ’s focus on toughened immigration laws and a “law and order” agenda  —   priorities he himself has stressed for years. He promised to escalate federal arrests and prosecutions of undocumented immigrants, drug dealers, gun traffickers and violent criminals in response to a rise in crime in some cities, and he declared that “protecting the American people from the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism will continue to be a top priority. ” Critical to that agenda, he said, will be improving federal relations with the police after the intense scrutiny that has followed a string of   police shootings of black men, often unarmed. “Law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors,” Mr. Sessions said. “They believe the political leadership in the country has abandoned them. ” Indeed, Mr. Sessions questioned the Obama administration’s use of civil rights lawsuits and consent decrees to force changes in training and    policies at police departments that have been accused of unconstitutional tactics. Although Mr. Sessions has completed his testimony, the hearings will continue on Wednesday with testimony by advocates on both sides. Witnesses supporting Mr. Sessions will include former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and Larry Thompson, a former deputy attorney general. Testifying against him will be officials from the American Civil Liberties Union and the N. A. A. C. P. as well as Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, a rare case of a senator testifying against a colleague.",0

11447,"Andreea Cristea, Who Fell Into Thames During U.K. Attack, Dies - The New York Times","LONDON  —   A    Romanian architect who plunged into the River Thames when a terrorist plowed  a vehicle into pedestrians in London became the fifth victim to die as a result of the attack last month, the police said on Friday. The story of the Romanian woman, Andreea Cristea, captured the hearts of Londoners  —   and many people around the world  —   after the March 22 attack on Parliament, which also wounded more than 50 people. Her boyfriend, Andrei Burnaz, had been planning to propose to her that day, according to Romanian news reports and officials, and the couple was in London to celebrate his birthday. The police said Ms. Cristea had received medical treatment in London but that life support had been withdrawn on Thursday. It was not clear whether Ms. Cristea was thrown into the Thames after being hit by the vehicle the assailant, Khalid Masood, was driving, or if she leapt into the water to escape. She was rescued from the water by a lifeboat crew before being hospitalized. During the attack, Mr. Masood, a      with a history of violence, rammed a rented Hyundai into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. He then crashed the vehicle into a fence, burst through a gate of the Palace of Westminster and fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer. He was shot and killed by the police. The Islamic State claimed responsibility, although the extent of Mr. Masood’s links to the militant group remains unclear. The police have been investigating whether he acted alone. The four others who died in the attack were Keith Palmer, 48, the unarmed police officer Kurt Cochran, 54, an American tourist who was traveling with his wife to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary Aysha Frade, 43, a teacher who was on her way to pick up her two young daughters and Leslie Rhodes, 75, a retired window cleaner from south London. Mr. Burnaz, who, like Ms. Cristea, is reportedly from the Black Sea port city of Constanta, was also hospitalized after the episode, in his case with a broken foot, but he was discharged. Ms. Cristea’s family and Mr. Burnaz said in a statement that they were convulsed with grief. Ms. Cristea, they said, was “cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way. ” “There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and emptiness that is left in our hearts,” they said, adding that unused money that had been raised to finance her recovery would be donated to charity. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, extended his condolences to the family. “Deeply saddened to hear of the death of Andreea Cristea,” he wrote on Twitter. “Londoners hold her  her loved ones in our thoughts today. ”",0
11448,"Jordan Spieth, His Feet Firmly Grounded, Puts a Sensible Shoe Forward - The New York Times","MALIBU, Calif.  —   The golf shoes on display in a back room at Nobu Malibu, a restaurant overlooking the Pacific Ocean, would have looked at home in the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. They were artwork for the sole, pairs of shoes adorned with leis, plaid, a California grizzly bear and numbers  —   notable scores and finishes that marked steps in the ascent of Jordan Spieth’s career. The Spieth One shoes available soon at an Under Armour retail outlet near you are not at all like the decorative footwear that caught the eye of those at the United States introduction of Spieth’s new spikes. The Spieth One is distinctive in ways that do not catch the eye: the springiness, the snug heel support and the wide placement of the spikes for better stability. Even the stylistic elements  —   vertical and horizontal lines that Spieth requested from the designers  —   emphasize utility. “That’s going to help me when I look down and I’m trying to line up,” Spieth said. “But it also looks cool. It’s a cool way to be subtle because I don’t want a giant J. S. on there. ” Be it his signature shoe or his life, Spieth prefers form over flash. Just as his golfing attire leans toward grays, blues, browns and whites, his public persona leans toward vanilla malted. Except for Spieth’s results, nothing about him screams “Look at me!” That made Nobu, where the beautiful people go to be seen while grazing on yellowtail sashimi, a novel place for Spieth, 23, to promote the shoe last Monday. The day before, Spieth had held his first   lead on the PGA Tour since flubbing the 2016 Masters, and this one he converted into his ninth tour title. His   victory, at the ATT Pebble Beach   was just what the psychologist had ordered for Spieth, who hoped he would not have to return to Augusta National in April weighed down by the baggage of the   lead squandered in last year’s final round. “It was definitely in the back of my head all day,” Spieth said. He added: “You have that voice in your head that says: ‘Who cares what anybody else says or thinks? We just do what we do.’ But, obviously, that round was going to be on my brain because it was the most recent lead that we had. If I didn’t hold this one, what kind of repercussions would that have?” Having exorcised the ghost of leads lost, Spieth could have slept in the next morning, enjoyed a   day, and then luxuriated in the rave reviews of his new shoes that night. Instead, he was out at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. when the sun came up, playing in the Collegiate Showcase with amateur partners who included the heralded Texas senior Gavin Hall. Spieth was accompanied by his coach, Cameron McCormick, who took videos of his swing to review between shots. Spieth, who dropped out of Texas early in his sophomore year to turn pro, said he was striking the ball as well as he did in 2015, when he came close to winning the first three legs of golf’s Grand Slam. He posted 27 consecutive rounds under par in stroke play until his    third round Sunday at the   Genesis Open, where he finished tied for 22nd at six under, 11 strokes off the lead. But you would never know he was striking so well from watching him prepare. In his practice rounds, he bemoaned approach shots that found the green but were more than 10 feet from the pin and lamented drives that were not perfectly struck but nevertheless found the fairway. Last month, Spieth played a   round with another Under Armour athlete, the swimmer Michael Phelps, who said he had been struck by how much Spieth expected of himself. McCormick and Spieth’s caddie, Michael Greller, consider Spieth’s perfectionism a   sword: It motivates him to keep working diligently, but he can be steered off track by the internal torrent of negativity when he falls short. “I’m very reliant on Michael for positive energy, positive voice,” Spieth said of Greller. Then there are the external pressures. A story in a local newspaper two days before the start of the Genesis Open mentioned that Spieth, a   winner in   had “only” two victories last season, as if he had fallen on hard times. If that is struggling, most of Jordan’s contemporaries have never experienced such success: Of the 144 players in the Genesis Open field, 88 had fewer than two career victories on the PGA Tour. “If that’s those individuals’ perception, they’ve got an extremely high perception of what I’m capable of, so I guess, thank you,” Spieth said, adding, “If that’s a low point for a year, then we’re going to surpass Phil Mickelson. ” Mickelson, 46, has 42 PGA Tour victories but is winless since the 2013 British Open. That, combined with Tiger Woods’s being sidelined with a bad back and stuck indefinitely (perhaps enduringly) on 79 tour victories, has tagged Spieth, 23, America’s “it” player in a   game with no discernible safe zone. Before the tournament in Pebble Beach, Spieth tried to accommodate young fans seeking his signature while ignoring the professional autograph hunters, a few of whom became profane when they realized he was not going to engage with them. Spieth later expressed frustration over the adults who obtain his autograph to sell online, saying, “Get a job instead of trying to make money off of the stuff that we have been able to do. ” Appropriately, then, Spieth’s inner circle is a few   short of an entourage. Greller, his caddie, eschewed the chic boutique properties that ring the nearby beaches and spent the first two nights here with his wife at a budget hotel. Spieth’s parents missed his victory in Pebble Beach because they were watching their younger son, Steven, a senior starter on the Brown basketball team, play in home games against Harvard and Dartmouth. Spieth’s girlfriend, Annie Verret, was in Pebble Beach but did not accompany him to Malibu. Spieth has his friends on the tour, like Justin Thomas and Kelly Kraft, the   in Pebble Beach, whom Spieth has included in his favorites on his PGA Tour app, which allows fans to track their favorite players’ statistics and results. One player not on Spieth’s favorite list: himself. That would be too meta, the equivalent of talking about oneself in the third person. “I normally check my app when I’m not playing that week, so there’s no use in having myself on there,” Spieth said. Grinning, he added, “Plus, I kind of know where I am at all times. ” Spieth is also close to his Under Armour family, whose members are always no more than a text away. After his victory in Pebble Beach, Spieth received messages from the Patriots quarterback and Super Bowl most valuable player Tom Brady and the   reigning N. B. A. player of the year, Stephen Curry. Both of those stars have found themselves, intentionally or not, thrust into the political conversation. Brady has been questioned over his friendship with President Trump, and Curry has taken issue with the relationship of Under Armour’s founder, Kevin Plank, with the president. The understated Spieth was apologetically quiet when asked about Plank during a   round on Wednesday. “I have been advised to not say anything politically by my team,” he said. He added, “I’m sorry. ” At the shoe event, Spieth sat in a director’s chair with his back to the sun as it set over the Pacific. It was a scene straight out of Hollywood, complete with a celebrity interviewer. The model and actress Kelly Rohrbach informed those in attendance of her own accomplishments  —   filming a new “Baywatch” movie and swimsuit modeling for Sports Illustrated  —   before turning her attention to Spieth, who corrected her when she described his win at Pebble Beach as his 10th tour victory. At the end of the event, as they were saying their goodbyes, Rohrbach blurted out, “You’re lovely. ” When Spieth was out of earshot, she said: “I was struck by how well spoken he is and how incredibly humble he is. He’s focused, but in the warmest way. There’s a confidence in him that seems to come from work ethic and not bravado. ” During their interview, Spieth told Rohrbach that he felt “so strongly” about his role in the design of the shoes, which was all geared toward performance. It is about science, he added, not style or even sales. “It’s like when I’m playing golf,” Spieth said. “It’s about how am I going to shoot the best score, even if it’s not the prettiest. ”",0
11449,"Generation X More Addicted to Social Media Than Millennials, Report Finds - The New York Times","We all know the stereotype: silly millennials, tethered to their phones, unable to accomplish the simplest tasks without scrolling their Instagram feeds, snapping their friends   tweeting inanely. But a Nielsen report released last week shows that Americans from 18 to 34 are less obsessed with social media than some of their older peers are. Adults 35 to 49 were found to spend an average of 6 hours 58 minutes a week on social media networks, compared with 6 hours 19 minutes for the younger group. More predictably, adults 50 and over spent significantly less time on the networks: an average of 4 hours 9 minutes a week. Sean Casey, the president of Nielsen’s social division, said the finding initially surprised him because “the going thought is that social is vastly owned by the younger generation. ” “It’s kind of synonymous,” said Mr. Casey, who wrote the foreword to the report. “When you think of millennials, you think of social. ” Mr. Casey, 46, said that eventually, the finding started to make more sense to him. “At a time when we wanted to be connected, it came out right when we were at the top of our media consumption,” he said. “It’s become second nature to our generation. ” The finding underscores how ubiquitous the smartphone has become. The report, released on Jan. 17, found that in the United States, 97 percent of people 18 to 34, and 94 percent of people 35 to 49, had access to smartphones.   percent of those 50 and older used smartphones, the report found. The   report was based on data from 9, 000 smartphone users and 1, 300 tablet users across the country from July through September. The data was not  . The report also broke out which social networks were most popular on smartphones, finding that Facebook still dominated on mobile, with about 178. 2 million unique users in September. It was followed by Instagram, with 91. 5 million unique users Twitter, with 82. 2 million unique users and Pinterest, with 69. 6 million users. Snapchat, a favorite of younger users, was sixth on the list, behind the professional networking site LinkedIn. Finally, the report looked at   activity on social media, measuring how many times Facebook and Twitter users employed those sites to post about programs they were watching or to interact with others’ posts. Again, in this category, it was Generation X that could not look away from its devices: On an average day, the report found, 42 percent of those interacting with television on Facebook were from 35 to 49 only 40 percent were millennials.",0
11451,The Circus of Liars - America's Three Rings of Evil Clowns,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:19 UTC © Jen Psaki President Obama holds news conference at the White House. As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country's government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama's presidency we've witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama's mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I'll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack's tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the ""clique"" extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. ""P.J."" Crowley made his ""deal with the devil"" from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared Pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; ""Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?"" Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley's credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He's now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he's been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. ""Fuck the EU"", along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State should she reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the ""WOW"" persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don't take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the clique that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November's presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as ""hash tag diplomacy."" Her ""hot mic"" comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being ""ridiculous"", they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd ""fix"" the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he's what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I'm a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby's contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department's stance on Russia's hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won't End Without Grounding Aircraft - this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington's plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the ""Kirbys"" of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby's ""Russians in body bags"" threat has pushed the Kremlin's panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline ""U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy"", it did not originate with them. Our new ""probably"" dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rothschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation's capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie The Truman Show these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since I or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation , Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message - Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause - perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It's really as simple as all that. Today's Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone's time. Once the ""Man"" has you, he's got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn't got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it's easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary's Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The ""Man"" has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people's fear they'll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell's 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn't that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze, liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts. I don't know how you feel about it, but I feel utterly betrayed.",0

11453,Fact Check: Trump Is Right that Clinton Might Cause WW3,"Artwork by Anthony Freda, AnthonyFreda.com 

Trump claims that Clinton’s policy on Syria would lead to World War 3. 
Let’s fact check … 
The Washington Post points out that a vote for Clinton is a vote for escalating military confrontation in Syria and elsewhere: 
In the rarefied world of the Washington foreign policy establishment, President Obama’s departure from the White House — and the possible return of a more conventional and hawkish Hillary Clinton — is being met with quiet relief. 
The Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy, via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House . 
*** 
The studies, which reflect Clinton’s stated views, break most forcefully with Obama on Syria …. call[ing] for stepped-up military action to deter President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and Russian forces in ­Syria. 
*** 
Most of the studies propose limited American airstrikes with cruise missiles to punish Assad ….

Last year, Obama dismissed calls for a no-fly zone in northwestern Syria — a position advocated by Clinton — as “ half-baked .” 
*** 
Even pinprick cruise-missile strikes designed to hobble the ­Syrian air force or punish Assad would risk a direct confrontation with Russian forces, which are scattered throughout the key ­Syrian military bases that would be targeted. 
“You can’t pretend you can go to war against Assad and not go to war against the Russians,” said a senior administration official who is involved in Middle East policy and was granted anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations. 
The most liberal presidential candidate still running – Green Party candidate Jill Stein – says: ""It should clear to everyone that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war."" — @ajamubaraka Watch live: https://t.co/0B6NJLNY5j 
— Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 13, 2016 Under Hillary Clinton, we could very quickly slide into nuclear war with her declared policy in Syria. I call for a #PeaceOffensive . 
She explains : 
Hillary Clinton wants to start an air war with Russia. Let’s be clear: That’s what a no-fly zone means. It is tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia. 
*** 
Clearly the Democrats are incredibly embarrassed about the nature of these [email] revelations, and they’ve created a smokescreen here to try and distract from that. But that smokescreen is pushing us to the brink of warfare with Russia now, where you have the U.S. head of defense, Ashton Carter, talking about nuclear war. We just did a dry run dropping fake nuclear bombs over Nevada. This is really dangerous stuff; this is not pretend. So we need to take a deep breath here, we need to step back and stop beating the war drums. In this context, Hillary Clinton is talking about starting an air war with Russia. Which could slide—you know, we’re on the verge of nuclear war right now. 
*** 
The most likely nuclear threat right now is with Russia. There’s no doubt about that. When you have Mikhail Gorbachev, who was the prime minister of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, saying that the threat of nuclear war is hotter now than it has ever been in all of history, you’ve got to take that pretty seriously. And when you have Hillary Clinton then beating the war drums against Russia, and essentially saying that if she’s elected that we will declare war on Russia—because that’s what a no-fly zone over Syria amounts to. Shooting down Russian warplanes. 
*** 
Hillary Clinton is a disastrous nuclear threat right now in a context where we’re already off-the-charts in the risk of nuclear war. She has stated in this context that she’s essentially opening up a battlefront with Russia. So to my mind, this emerges as the clearest and most present danger. 
Prominent liberal economist Jeffrey Sachs writes in the Huffington Post, in an essay bannered “ Hillary Is the Candidate of the War Machine “: 
It is often believed that the Republicans are the neocons and the Democrats act as restraints on the warmongering. This is not correct. Both parties are divided between neocon hawks and cautious realists who don’t want the US in unending war. Hillary is a staunch neocon whose record of favoring American war adventures explains much of our current security danger. 
Just as the last Clinton presidency set the stage for financial collapse, it also set the stage for unending war. On October 31, 1998 President Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act that made it official US policy to support “regime change” in Iraq. 
It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime. 
Thus were laid the foundations for the Iraq War in 2003. 
Of course, by 2003, Hillary was a Senator and a staunch supporter of the Iraq War, which has cost the US trillions of dollars, thousands of lives, and done more to create ISIS and Middle East instability than any other single decision of modern foreign policy. In defending her vote, Hillary parroted the phony propaganda of the CIA: 
“In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members… “ 
After the Iraq Liberation Act came the 1999 Kosovo War, in which Bill Clinton called in NATO to bomb Belgrade, in the heart of Europe, and unleashing another decade of unrest in the Balkans. Hillary, traveling in Africa, called Bill: “I urged him to bomb,” she told reporter Lucinda Frank. 
Hillary’s record as Secretary of State is among the most militaristic, and disastrous, of modern US history . Some experience. Hilary was a staunch defender of the military-industrial-intelligence complex at every turn, helping to spread the Iraq mayhem over a swath of violence that now stretches from Mali to Afghanistan. Two disasters loom largest: Libya and Syria. 
Hillary has been much attacked for the deaths of US diplomats in Benghazi, but her tireless promotion of the overthrow Muammar Qaddafi by NATO bombing is the far graver disaster. Hillary strongly promoted NATO-led regime change in Libya, not only in violation of international law but counter to the most basic good judgment. After the NATO bombing, Libya descended into civil war while the paramilitaries and unsecured arms stashes in Libya quickly spread west across the African Sahel and east to Syria. The Libyan disaster has spawned war in Mali, fed weapons to Boko Haram in Nigeria, and fueled ISIS in Syria and Iraq. In the meantime, Hillary found it hilarious to declare of Qaddafi: “We came, we saw, he died.” 
Perhaps the crowning disaster of this long list of disasters has been Hillary’s relentless promotion of CIA-led regime change in Syria. Once again Hillary bought into the CIA propaganda that regime change to remove Bashir al-Assad would be quick, costless, and surely successful. In August 2011, Hillary led the US into disaster with her declaration Assad must “get out of the way,” backed by secret CIA operations. 
Five years later, no place on the planet is more ravaged by unending war, and no place poses a great threat to US security. More than 10 million Syrians are displaced, and the refugees are drowning in the Mediterranean or undermining the political stability of Greece, Turkey, and the European Union. Into the chaos created by the secret CIA-Saudi operations to overthrow Assad, ISIS has filled the vacuum, and has used Syria as the base for worldwide terrorist attacks. 
The list of her incompetence and warmongering goes on. Hillary’s support at every turn for NATO expansion, including even into Ukraine and Georgia against all common sense, was a trip wire that violated the post-Cold War settlement in Europe in 1991 and that led to Russia’s violent counter-reactions in both Georgia and Ukraine. As Senator in 2008, Hilary co-sponsored 2008-SR439 , to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO. As Secretary of State, she then presided over the restart of the Cold War with Russia. 
It is hard to know the roots of this record of disaster. Is it chronically bad judgment? Is it her preternatural faith in the lying machine of the CIA? Is it a repeated attempt to show that as a Democrat she would be more hawkish than the Republicans? Is it to satisfy her hardline campaign financiers? Who knows? Maybe it’s all of the above. But whatever the reasons, hers is a record of disaster. Perhaps more than any other person, Hillary can lay claim to having stoked the violence that stretches from West Africa to Central Asia and that threatens US security . 
Jakob Augstein notes in Der Spiegel: 
Trump would probably be the better choice in the question of war and peace than Clinton. 
Clinton has expressly expressed the wish to establish a flight ban on Syria, or parts of it. *** In truth, it would be an act of war. The risks are unpredictable. Above all, the risk of a military conflict with Russia. 
*** 
The highest soldier of the United States of America, General Joseph Dunford, President of the United States General Staff of the United States Forces, is certain. To control the entire airspace over Syria would mean war with Syria and Russia. Dunford’s predecessor in office estimated a few years ago that an effective flight ban over Syria would involve the use of 70,000 soldiers and a monthly cost of $ 1 billion. 
But the bottom line is Clinton’s proven historical track record … she’s at least partly responsible for war after catastrophic war and coup after disastrous coup in Libya, Syria, Kosovo, Haiti, Honduras and other countries around the world. 
And it’s interesting, indeed, that the Neocons who got us into the Iraq war have endorsed Clinton instead of Trump . 
Trump might speak in a crude, knee-jerk manner … but Clinton is probably more likely to actually get us into war .",0
11454,"Trump Drops Campaign Surprise On Melania During GMA Interview, Her Expression Says It All...","Share on Twitter 
With just 12 days until Election Day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and wife, Melania, sat down to discuss the campaign's “best and worst moments” on “Good Morning America.” 
Journalist George Stephanopoulos began by asking Melania if she's still confident in her husband winning the race to the White House: 
“I see the connection with the American people and my husband, and he created a movement. The crowd and the people that are behind him are unbelievable to see.” 
But when Stephanopoulos questioned whether she'd physically get out there on the campaign trail and stump for Trump, she wasn't as confident: 
“We will see. My priority is my son Barron and I support [my husband] 100% and I’m there for him every time he needs me.” 
Trump was quick to interject, saying Melania would actually give two or three speeches soon, something that seemed to be news to Melania: Image Credit: Screenshot/ ABC News 
Trump explained that her speeches would be “big” and “important”: 
“She’s amazing when she speaks. She is an amazing public speaker. She’s agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it’s going to be big speeches, important speeches.” 
It's understandable if Melania isn't eager to give speeches on the campaign trail, given what happened at the Republican National Convention in July. 
Trump's wife was publicly ripped apart after journalist Jarrett Hill pointed out the similarities between her speech and Michelle Obama's in 2008. 
Though a side-by-side video comparison showed how certain passages were identical, Melania said she wrote the speech herself...with a little help from Hillary Clinton's former speechwriter. 
Despite the controversy, however, many commended her speech as “beautiful” and given “with tremendous poise”— reflecting skills Trump's campaign may benefit from in these next two weeks. ",0

11456,Daesh abducts 1000s near Mosul to use them as human shields: UN,"Iraq Civilians leave their homes as Iraqi troops fight against Daesh militants in the village of Tob Zawa. (Photo by AP) 
Daesh terrorists have abducted tens of thousands of civilians from near Mosul to use them as human shields as government forces inch closer to the city proper in an operation to retake it, the UN says. 
UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the terrorist group also killed at least 232 people on Wednesday, including 190 former Iraqi security forces and 40 civilians, who refused to obey its orders. 
“Many of them who refused to comply were shot on the spot,” Shamdasani said in Geneva, citing reports corroborated by the UN that were “by no means comprehensive but indicative of violations.” 
As the news emerged, Iraq’s Hashd al-Shaabi volunteers said they were set to launch an offensive against Daesh west of Mosul imminently. 
Ahmad al-Assadi, a spokesman for the popular forces, confirmed that the fighters had completed preparations to move in the direction of Tal Afar, a Daesh-held city 63 kilometers west of Mosul. 
He added that the fighters would move to capture Tal Afar from their positions in the Iraqi town of Qayyara, situated some 60 kilometers south of Mosul. 
“A few days or hours separate us from the launch of operations there,” Asadi said. 
Iraqi forces liberated three key areas from Daesh terrorists east of Mosul. Army officials said troops also seized a tank and artillery from the terrorists, and found a two-kilometer-long tunnel full of ammunition. 
The army is edging closer to Mosul by liberating villages around the city. Nearly 80 Daesh-held towns and villages have been retaken by the army since the Iraqi forces began the battle to liberate Mosul last week. Loading ...",0

Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity Executive Director Daniel McAdams stated that Donald Trump’s victory has proven the entire political class in Washington and especially the mainstream media that does their bidding to be completely out of touch with the American people.
The victory of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential elections proves that Washington’s political class and the mainstream US media are completely detached from the actual US electorate, Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity Executive Director Daniel McAdams told Sputnik.
“More than anything else, Donald Trump’s victory has proven the entire political class in Washington and especially the mainstream media that does their bidding to be completely out of touch with the American people,” McAdams said.
According to McAdams, over the course of the election, the mainstream media has proven not to be independent resources seeking out inconvenient truths, but rather “a lapdog to the power elite.”
Earlier in the day, Trump won the US presidential elections despite most of the analysts and opinion polls predicting his defeat to Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton.

(Times of Israel) A rare, ancient papyrus dating to the First Temple Period — 2,700 years ago — has been found to bear the oldest known mention of Jerusalem in Hebrew. 
The fragile text, believed plundered from a cave in the Judean Desert cave, was apparently acquired by the Israel Antiquities Authority during a sting in 2012 when thieves attempted to sell it to a dealer. Radiocarbon dating has determined it is from the 7th century BCE, making it one of just three extant Hebrew papyri from that period, and predating the Dead Sea Scrolls by centuries.

Seven policemen searched Norwegian Nordic Resistance Movement member Ronny Bårdsen’s apartment to find the Norwegian-Russian nationalist Yan Petrovskiy (also knnown as Veliki Slavian; pictured). He will be deported from Norway. The police informed Petrovskiy that he has two days to get a flight ticket and five to leave the country. 
The police wanted to see Petrovskiy’s passport and know if he accepts the decision and leaves Norway voluntarily or if he has to be forced. Petrovskiy answered that according to the advice of his lawyer, Nils Christian Nordhus, he doesn’t keep the passport in his apartment, and he will talk with his lawyer before giving an answer concerning his departure. 
After this Petrovskiy attempted to call his lawyer while the police were waiting, but because his lawyer didn’t pick it up, the police decided to arrest Petrovskiy and search Bårdsen’s apartment. Petrovskiy has lived in the address for some time and has been registered as a Norwegian resident. 
The real reason behind the search was to acquire Petrovskiy’s passport, as without it he cannot be deported. Despite the efforts of the police, the passport was not uncovered. 
The decision about the deportation was made by the Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirektoratet) after the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) sent a letter to the directorate.

""Настоящие патриоты — те люди, которые пытаются все время очень много работать над собой, над своим бизнесом, над своими учреждениями с тем, чтобы соответствовать и даже немного опережать время. Это очень тяжело, это не всегда популярно, это всегда связано с тем, что приходится меняться самому и менять окружающих, влиять на изменение окружающих"", — заявил Герман Греф. 
Прокомментировал его слова председатель правления советов директоров Pravda.Ru Вадим Горшенин: 
- Вот определение того же слова от словаря Ушакова: ""человек, преданный своему народу, любящий свое отечество, готовый на жертвы и совершающий подвиги во имя интересов своей родины"". 
А это по словарю Даля: ""любитель отечества, ревнитель о благе его, отчизнолюб, отечественник или отчизник"". 
Обратили внимание, что из определения Грефа выпало, как абсолютно ненужное, даже упоминание Отечества ? 
На мой взгляд, Греф с этим определением — один из того распространенного типа чиновников в России на высоких постах, которые являются ""гражданами мира"" и смогут нормально себя чувствовать при любом государственном режиме: демократическом, авторитарном, оккупационном — каким угодно. 
Когда-то, если помните, в конце восьмидесятых — начале девяностых прошлого века в стране, с подачи партии старовойтовых, ельциных, бурбулисов ""Демократической России"" резко поменялись все политические определения. И традиционно левых коммунистов, выступающих за равные возможности для всех, общественную собственность и т. д., начали называть ""правыми"", а тех, кто продвигал частную собственность на средства производства, землю, природные ресурс, — ""левыми"". 
В результате ""левые"" совершили переворот с помощью руцких и теперь стесняются так называться. Спросите того же Грефа — левый он или правый политик. Как думаете, что ответит? 
И сейчас есть у меня такое чувство, что ""граждане мира"", они же космополиты, пытаются сделать то же самое, но уже с более глубокими понятиями для каждого человека, любящего свое Отечество (как в России, так и в Америке, Франции, Германии, Сирии и т. д.)… 
Обратите внимание, как сейчас в либеральных изданиях начнут распространять эту откровенную идеологическую чушь от главы Сбербанка, как начнут ее цитировать оппозиционные блогеры. А когда обратите, попробуйте ответить на вопрос: почему ее никогда не повторят, например, Сергей Лавров или Сергей Шойгу. Почему она дико смотрелась бы, припиши ее кто-то Суворову, Кутузову, Екатерине II, Столыпину?

MORE bad news! 
However, bad news for the Clintons means good news for us. 
We all knew that Hillary was a scheming snake of corruption who loves nothing but power and money. However with each new hit that came her way in October, many of us were still shocked over the sheer madness of it all.

Ira Magaziner, the CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, asked former President Bill Clinton to thank Morocco’s King Mohammed VI for “offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia.” 
“CHAI would like to request that President Clinton call Sheik Mohammed to thank him for offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia,” Magaziner gushed in a November 22, 2011 email released by WikiLeaks. 
Clinton frequently has expected free, luxurious private jet travel during his post-presidential life.

[On Feb. 24, the DHS released its notice on FebBizOpps. gov:  The Dept. of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends on issuing a solicitation in electronic format on or about March 6, 2017 for the design and build of several prototype wall structures in the vicinity of the United States border with Mexico. The procurement will be conducted in two phases, the first requiring vendors to submit a concept paper of their prototype( s) by March 10, 2017, which will result in the evaluation and down select of offerors by March 20, 2017. The second phase will require the down select of phase 1 offerors to submit proposals in response to the full RFP by March 24, 2017, which will include price. Multiple awards are contemplated by   for this effort. An option for additional miles may be included in each contract award. President Trump promised to begin building the U. S.  border wall again on Friday during his CPAC speech. “We have to, to turn things around. The era of empty talk is over. It’s over. Now is the time for action,” he said. The administration is moving quickly. Trump transition officials also requested that the Obama’s deputies in the Department of Homeland Security ” assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction,” and look into expanding detention capabilities for illegal aliens and aerial surveillance of the U. S.  border: In response to the transition team request, U. S. Customs and Border Protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the U. S.  border, and about the same distance along the U. S.  border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters  …     One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was Operation Phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1, 200 Army National Guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration  …     Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11. 37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing. The meeting between transition team and DHS officials took place Dec. 5, according to Reuters. Every single illegal alien in the U. S. is subject to deportation, Trump said in a major policy speech given in Phoenix, Arizona, about two months before his election win. There will be “zero tolerance” for illegal immigration under a Trump administration, he said. A study released by the   Center for Immigration Studies found that a border wall stopping as little as nine percent of illegal alien border crossers would easily pay for itself and save taxpayers billions of dollars.  : The Washington Examiner",0

11467,"David Rockefeller, Philanthropist and Head of Chase Manhattan, Dies at 101 - The New York Times","David Rockefeller, the banker and philanthropist with the fabled family name who controlled Chase Manhattan bank for more than a decade and wielded vast influence around the world for even longer as he spread the gospel of American capitalism, died on Monday morning at his home in Pocantico Hills, N. Y. He was 101. His son David Jr. confirmed the death. Chase Manhattan had long been known as the Rockefeller bank, although the family never owned more than 5 percent of its shares. But Mr. Rockefeller was more than a steward. As chairman and chief executive throughout the 1970s, he made it “David’s bank,” as many called it, expanding its operations internationally. His stature was greater than any corporate title might convey, however. His influence was felt in Washington and foreign capitals, in the corridors of New York City government, in art museums, in great universities and in public schools. Mr. Rockefeller could well be the last of a less and less visible family to have cut so imposing a figure on the world stage. As a peripatetic advocate of the economic interests of the United States and of his own bank, he was a force in global financial affairs and in his country’s foreign policy. He was received in foreign capitals with the honors accorded a chief of state. He was the last surviving grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the tycoon who founded the Standard Oil Company in the 19th century and built a fortune that made him America’s first billionaire and his family one of the richest and most powerful in the nation’s history. As an heir to that legacy, David Rockefeller lived all his life in baronial splendor and privilege, whether in Manhattan (when he was a boy, he and his brothers would roller skate along Fifth Avenue trailed by a limousine in case they grew tired) or at his magnificent country estates. Imbued with the understated manners of the East Coast elite, he loomed large in the upper reaches of a New York social world of glittering   galas. His philanthropy was monumental, and so was his art collection, a museumlike repository of some 15, 000 pieces, many of them masterpieces, some lining the walls of his offices 56 floors above the streets at Rockefeller Center, to which he repaired, robust and active, well into his 90s. In silent testimony to his power and reach was his Rolodex, a catalog of some 150, 000 names of people he had met as a  . It required a room of its own beside his office. Spread out below that corporate aerie was a city he loved and influenced mightily. He was instrumental in rallying the private sector to help resolve New York City’s fiscal crisis in the  . As chairman of the Museum of Modern Art for many years  —   his mother had helped found it in 1929  —   he led an effort to encourage corporations to buy and display art in their office buildings and to subsidize local museums. And as chairman of the New York City Partnership, a coalition of business executives, he fostered innovation in public schools and the development of thousands of apartments for   and   families. He was always aware of the mystique surrounding the Rockefeller name. “I have never found it a hindrance,” he once said with typical reserve. “Obviously, there are times when I’m aware that I’m treated differently. There’s no question that having financial resources, which, thanks to my parents, I learned to use with some restraint and discretion, is a big advantage. ” With his powerful name and his zeal for foreign travel  —   he was still going to Europe into his late 90s  —   Mr. Rockefeller was a formidable marketing force. In the 1970s, his meetings with Anwar   of Egypt, Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union and Zhou Enlai of China helped Chase Manhattan become the first American bank with operations in those countries. “Few people in this country have met as many leaders as I have,” he said. Some faulted him for spending so much time abroad. He was accused of neglecting his responsibilities at Chase and failing to promote aggressive, visionary managers. Under his leadership, Chase fell far behind its rival Citibank, then the nation’s largest bank, in assets and earnings. There were years when Chase had the most troubled loan portfolio among major American banks. “In my judgment, he will not go down in history as a great banker,” John J. McCloy, a Rockefeller friend and himself a former Chase chairman, told The Associated Press in 1981. “He will go down as a real personality, as a distinguished and loyal member of the community. ” Mr. Rockefeller’s forays into international politics also drew criticism, notably in 1979, when he and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger persuaded President Jimmy Carter to admit the recently deposed shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment. The shah’s arrival in New York enraged revolutionary followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, provoking them to seize the United States Embassy in Iran and hold American diplomats hostage for more than a year. Mr. Rockefeller was also assailed for befriending autocratic foreign leaders in an effort to establish and expand his bank’s presence in their countries. “He spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did,” the New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002, citing the profitable deals Mr. Rockefeller had cut with “  dictators,” “Soviet party bosses” and “Chinese perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution. ” Still, presidents as ideologically different as Mr. Carter and Richard M. Nixon offered him the post of Treasury secretary. He turned them both down. After the death in 1979 of his older brother Nelson A. Rockefeller, the former vice president and   governor of New York, David Rockefeller stood almost alone as a member of the family with an outsize national profile. Only Jay Rockefeller, a   of John D. Rockefeller, had earned prominence, as a governor and United States senator from West Virginia. No one from the family’s younger generations has attained or perhaps aspired to David Rockefeller’s stature. “No one can step into his shoes,” Warren T. Lindquist, a longtime friend, told The Times in 1995, “not because they aren’t good, smart, talented people, but because it’s just a different world. ” The youngest of six siblings, David Rockefeller was born in Manhattan on June 12, 1915. His father, John D. Rockefeller Jr. the only son of the oil titan, devoted his life to philanthropy. His mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, was the daughter of Nelson Aldrich, a wealthy senator from Rhode Island. Besides Nelson, born in 1908, the other children were Abby, who was born in 1903 and died in 1976 after leading a private life John D. Rockefeller III, who was born in 1906 and immersed himself in philanthropy until his death in an automobile accident in 1978 Laurance, born in 1910, who was an environmentalist and died in 2004 and Winthrop, born in 1912, who was governor of Arkansas and died in 1973. David grew up in a mansion at 10 West 54th Street, the largest private residence in the city at the time. It bustled with valets, parlor maids, nurses and chambermaids. For dinner every night, his father dressed in black tie and his mother in a formal gown. Summers were spent at the   Rockefeller “cottage” in Seal Harbor, Me. and weekends at Kykuit, the family’s country compound north of New York City in Tarrytown, N. Y. The estate was likened to a feudal fief. As Mr. Rockefeller wrote in his autobiography, “Memoirs” (2002) “Eventually the family accumulated about 3, 400 acres that surrounded and included almost all of the little village of Pocantico Hills, where most of the residents worked for the family and lived in houses owned by Grandfather. ” In that bucolic setting, he developed a fascination for insects that would lead to his building one of the largest beetle collections in the world. David was 21 when John D. Rockefeller died. “He told amusing stories and sang little ditties,” Mr. Rockefeller recalled in 2002. “He gave us dimes. ” Mr. Rockefeller’s sense of noblesse oblige was heightened by his early education at the experimental Lincoln School in Manhattan, founded by the American philosopher John Dewey and financed by the Rockefeller Foundation to bring together children from varied social backgrounds. He went on to study at Harvard, receiving his bachelor’s degree in 1936, and then spent a year at the London School of Economics, a hotbed of socialist intellectuals. Mr. Rockefeller was awarded a Ph. D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1940. Moved by the Great Depression at home and abroad, he stated in his doctoral thesis that he was “inclined to agree with the New Deal that deficit financing during depressions, other things being equal, is a help to recovery. ” The notion that a Rockefeller would take such a liberal economic view was major news the family,   Republican, was known for its fierce opposition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal’s author. After receiving his doctorate, Mr. Rockefeller became a secretary to Fiorello H. La Guardia, New York’s pugnacious, liberal Republican mayor. In 1940, he married Margaret McGrath, known as Peggy, whom he had met at a dance seven years earlier, when he was a Harvard freshman and she was a student at the Chapin School in New York. His wife, a dedicated conservationist, died at 80 in 1996. Besides his son David, he is survived by his daughters, Abby Rockefeller, Neva Goodwin, Peggy Dulany and Eileen Growald 10 grandchildren and 10  . Another son, Richard, died in 2014 at 65 when the small plane he was piloting crashed shortly after takeoff from Westchester County Airport. Mr. Rockefeller enlisted in the Army in 1942, attended officer training school and served in North Africa and France during World War II. He was discharged a captain in 1945. He began his banking career in 1946 as an assistant manager with the Chase National Bank, which merged in 1955 with the Bank of Manhattan Company to become Chase Manhattan. Banking in the early postwar era was a gentleman’s profession. Top executives could attend to outside interests, using social contacts to cultivate clients while leaving    management to junior officers. Mr. Rockefeller found plenty of time for such activities. In the late 1940s, he replaced his mother on the Museum of Modern Art’s board and eventually became its chairman. He courted art collectors. In 1968, he put together a syndicate, including his brother Nelson and the CBS chairman, William S. Paley, to buy Gertrude Stein’s collection of modern art. David and Peggy Rockefeller’s own prized paintings  —   by Cézanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso  —   were lent to the museum permanently. Mr. Rockefeller’s rise in banking was swift. By 1961, he was president of Chase Manhattan and its   executive with George Champion, the chairman. Promoting expansion overseas, Mr. Rockefeller clashed with Mr. Champion, who thought that the bank’s domestic business was more important. After Mr. Rockefeller replaced Mr. Champion as chairman and sole chief executive in 1969, he was able to enlarge the bank’s presence on almost every continent. He said his brand of personal diplomacy, meeting with heads of state, was crucial in furthering Chase’s interests. “There were many who claimed these activities were inappropriate and interfered with my bank responsibilities,” Mr. Rockefeller wrote in his autobiography. “I couldn’t disagree more. ” His “  outside activities,” he insisted, “were of considerable benefit to the bank both financially and in terms of its prestige around the world. ” By 1976, Chase Manhattan’s international arm was contributing 80 percent of the bank’s $105 million in operating profit. But instead of vindicating Mr. Rockefeller’s avidity for banking abroad, those figures underlined Chase’s lagging performance at home. From 1974 to 1976, its earnings fell 36 percent while those of its biggest rivals  —   Bank of America, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover and J. P. Morgan  —   rose 12 to 31 percent. The 1974 recession hammered Chase, which had an unusually large portfolio of loans in the depressed real estate industry. It also owned more New   securities than any other bank in the   when the city was edging toward bankruptcy. And among major banks, Chase had the largest portfolio of nonperforming loans. Chase also got caught up in a scandal in 1974. An internal audit discovered that its bond trading account was overvalued by $34 million and that losses had been understated. A resulting $15 million drain in net income tarnished the bank’s image. In 1975, the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency branded Chase a “problem” bank. Even as he struggled to reverse Chase Manhattan’s decline, Mr. Rockefeller found time to address New York City’s financial problems. His involvement in municipal affairs dated to the early 1960s, when, as founder and chairman of the   Manhattan Association, he recommended that a World Trade Center be built. In 1961, largely at his instigation, Chase opened its   headquarters in the Wall Street area, a huge investment that helped revitalize the financial district and encouraged the World Trade Center project to proceed. In the   with New York City facing a default on its debts because of sluggish economic growth and uncontrolled municipal spending, Mr. Rockefeller helped bring together federal, state and city officials with New York business leaders to work out an economic plan that eventually pulled the city out of its crisis. At the same time, he put his bank’s affairs in order. By 1981, he and his protégé Willard C. Butcher had restored Chase Manhattan to full health. He yielded his chairmanship to Mr. Butcher that year. From 1976 to 1980, the bank’s earnings more than doubled, and it outperformed its archrival, Citibank, in returns on assets, a critical indicator of a bank’s profitability. Even after retiring from active management in 1981, Mr. Rockefeller continued to serve Chase as chairman of its international advisory council and to act as the bank’s foreign diplomat. He did not hesitate to criticize United States officials for policies he considered mistaken. He was notably harsh about President Carter. In 1980, he told The Washington Post that Mr. Carter had not done “what most other countries do themselves, and expect us to do  —   namely, to make U. S. national interests our prime international objective. ” But Mr. Rockefeller also played the gadfly to Mr. Carter’s far more conservative successor, President Ronald Reagan. While the Reagan administration was supporting   guerrillas in Africa, Mr. Rockefeller took a   tour of the continent in 1982 and declared that African Marxism was not a threat to the United States or to American business interests. Late in life, Mr. Rockefeller was involved in controversies over Rockefeller Center, the Art Deco office building complex his father built in the 1930s. In 1985, the Rockefeller family mortgaged the property for $1. 3 billion, pocketing an estimated $300 million. In 1989, the family sold 51 percent of the Rockefeller Group, which owned Rockefeller Center and other buildings, to the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan. Mitsubishi later increased its share to 80 percent. The purchase represented the high tide of a buying spree of American properties by Japanese corporations, and it opened the family to criticism that it had surrendered an important national symbol to them. When Japan’s economic bubble burst in the early 1990s and Mitsubishi was forced to declare Rockefeller Center in bankruptcy in 1995, Mr. Rockefeller was criticized again, this time for allowing the site to slip into financial ruin. Before the year ended, Mr. Rockefeller put together a syndicate that bought control of Rockefeller Center. Then, in 2000, it was sold in a $1. 85 billion deal that severed the center’s last ties with the Rockefeller family. As an octogenarian, Mr. Rockefeller, whose fortune was estimated in 2012 at $2. 7 billion, increasingly devoted himself to philanthropy, donating tens of millions of dollars in particular to Harvard, the Museum of Modern Art and the Rockefeller University, which John D. Rockefeller Sr. founded in 1901. Even in his 90s, David Rockefeller continued to work at a pace that would tire a much younger person. He spent more than half the year traveling on behalf of Chase or groups like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. In 2005, when he was interviewed in his offices at Rockefeller Center, he remained physically active, working with a trainer at the center’s sports club. He continued to collect art, including hundreds of paintings as well as furniture and works in colored glass, porcelain and petrified wood. That same year, he pledged a $100 million bequest to the Museum of Modern Art. Such giving became grist for the society pages. One     gala at the museum in 2005 drew 850 people paying as much as $90, 000 for a table. The occasion was Mr. Rockefeller’s 90th birthday, and at the end of the evening, he was presented with a birthday cake modeled after his house in Maine. Then it was off to a week in southern France to continue the celebration with 21 members of his family. With the book “Memoirs” in 2002, he became, at age 87, the first in three generations of Rockefellers to publish an autobiography. Asked why he wrote it, he replied in his characteristic reserved tone, “Well, it just occurred to me that I had led a rather interesting life. ”",0

Montreat College professor William Forstchen says Election 2016 could lead to another bloody civil war. Professor Forstchen specializes in Civil War history. Forstchen gave warning on the October 25th edition of “The Jim Bakker Show” during their weeklong, “Ready Now Expo Oct. 2016.” Forstchen: “I’m a civil war historian.” The U.S. election of 1860 “is the closest I can parallel this to.” “And we all know what the price was. When we went to a civil war, they killed 660,000 young men because we became so divided.” Forstchen urged voters to turn out even if they disliked the candidates, because of other US congress races and the Supreme Court appointment. Forstchen: “I do believe we are at 1860. We are that close to the edge of the debacle.” Baptist pastor Carl Gallups then alluded to false Christian doctrine: “The prophecy clock started ticking” when the modern nation of Israel was established in 1948. In 1860: Four candidates received substantive amounts of votes in the U.S. presidential election. Abraham Lincoln (39.8 percent), Stephen Douglas (29.5 percent), John Breckinridge (18.1 percent) and John Bell (12.6 percent).

Forstchen has co-authored books with Newt Gingrich. 
(WASHINGTON, DC) A professor who specializes in the Civil War appeared on a special edition of “The Jim Bakker Show” last week to warn America that the 2016 presidential election could lead to another secessionist melee. 
“I’m a civil war historian,” the Montreat College professor, William Forstchen , explained by way of introduction. 
The U.S. election of 1860 “is the closest I can parallel this to,” Forstchen said. 
“And we all know what the price was,” the professor then said. “When we went to a civil war, they killed 660,000 young men because we became so divided.” 
Next, Forstchen went on a lengthy diatribe about the U.S. Constitution and the importance of voting. 
He urged “those of you who feel ‘I can’t quite pull the lever for this person or that person'” in the presidential election to vote because U.S. senators and representatives are up for election, and because the Senate must confirm Supreme Court justices. 
Forstchen failed to explain how the results of the 2016 election will hasten — or prevent — a civil war. He also did not specifically mention or endorse any candidates for office. 
Nevertheless, the professor concluded with an adamant exhortation that a civil war is nigh. 
“I do believe we are at 1860,” Forstchen said, looking directly into the camera. “We are that close to the edge of the debacle.” 
From there, another guest, Baptist pastor Carl Gallups, declared that “the prophecy clock started ticking” when the modern nation of Israel was established in 1948. 
Gallups, who introduced Donald Trump at a Donald Trump rally in January 2016, is famous because he has used his radio show to give a platform to people who deny the reality of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, according to the Connecticut Post http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Trump-disavows-Sandy-Hook-truther-who-6880064.php. Gallups has also said he believes neither Marco Rubio nor Ted Cruz are eligible to be president because of the circumstances of their births. 
The segment featuring Forstchen and Gallups was part of The Jim Bakker Show’s weeklong “Ready Now Expo Oct. 2016”— featuring several survival products. 
Four candidates received any substantive amount of votes in the U.S. presidential election in 1860: Abraham Lincoln (39.8 percent), Stephen Douglas (29.5 percent), John Breckinridge (18.1 percent) and John Bell (12.6 percent). 
On December 20, 1860, delegates to a convention in South Carolina unanimously voted to secede from the United States — 44 days after Lincoln, a Republican, was elected. 
Montreat College, Forstchen’s employer, is a small Christian liberal arts college with a main campus located in rural North Carolina. 
Forstchen has written a couple dozen novels and several short stories. His co-author for some of the books is Newt Gingrich.

11470,Hillary Clinton Is Now Radioactive – SoT #122,"Financial Markets Clinton Foundation , Hillary emails , Huma Abedin , Jim Comey , Weiner laptop admin 
Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall (King James Bible). Throughout recorded history, hubris has been the Achilles’ Heel of political despots. Hillary Clinton and her political crime machine has been operating above the law for decades, stretching back at least to when Bill Clinton was Governor of Arkansas. “Hillary Clinton is a toilet scrubber for Goldman Sachs” – John Titus on the Shadow of Truth 
During her 2016 Presidential Campaign, it became routine for her get in front the public and lie with convincing ease. In Greek tragedy, “hubris” was an anti-hero’s excessive pride toward or defiance of the gods, leading to the character’s unforeseen demise. 
When Hillary was deposed by the FBI about the 33,000 emails on her private server that were wiped clean forever using BleachBit, she assumed her tracks were irrevocably covered up. But it wasn’t just 33,000 emails that were incinerated, reams of evidence including laptops, server back-ups and Blackberries either “disappeared” or were wiped clean. 
Out of the blue, as if sent to earth from a Higher Power, the FBI in its child pornography investigation of Anthony Weiner stumbled on to a laptop with 650,000 emails that appeared to have been downloaded from Hillary Clinton’s private server. It is highly probable that among this treasure trough of emails will be copies of the 33,000 emails that Hillary arrogantly assumed were wiped from the Universe. Hubris gets ’em every time. 
But it gets better than that. 650,000 is a decade’s worth of emails. It’s also possible that Weiner’s laptop will finally shed the light of Truth on Benghazi. “Jim Comey did not re-open this investigation of to go over old ground. Worse infractions were discovered.” – John Titus

11471,IMPLOSION: Trump Campaign Insiders Report–‘Think Of The Bunker Before Hitler Killed Himself’,"IMPLOSION: Trump Campaign Insiders Report–‘Think Of The Bunker Before Hitler Killed Himself’ By Andrew Bradford on October 30, 2016 Subscribe 
For months, Donald Trump has assuring his supporters that he is going to win on November 8. This is despite nearly every poll showing him behind by as much as 12 points. And now we have an inside look at the Trump campaign which would seem to indicate that the entire campaign apparatus is on the verge of collapsing on itself. 
New York magazine has just published an article by Gabriel Sherman in which one Trump staffer commented: “Think of the bunker right before Hitler killed himself. Donald’s in denial. They’re all in denial.” 
Overall, the mood of the staff working out of Trump Tower goes from gloom, denial, rage, and glee on Friday when the FBI reported it would review new materials in the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was still Secretary of State. 
While the Trump camp should be able to make hay of the announcement from FBI Director James Comey, one problem remains: The candidate is so undisciplined that any progress made is quickly undone by Trump himself. As a top donor told Sherman : “Trump has the following personality: NIH-NFW, meaning ‘If it’s not invented here, not invented behind these eyes, then it’s no fucking way.'” 
Sherman’s report echoes another article from the New York Times in which an advisor to the GOP nominee commented: “In Trumpworld as Hitler’s Bunker terms (it’s) like when Goebbels thought FDR’s death would save the Nazi regime.” 
And plans for what comes after the election–rumors of a new Trump TV network–also seem unlikely some inside the inner circle reveal. One prominent member of the GOP told Sherman: “It’s too expensive. Trump won’t put his own money in.” 
Disgraced former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes has parted ways with Trump, reportedly because the candidate refused to stay on message and follow direction from campaign staff. Others are also positioning themselves for what happens after the election is over with. One former Mitt Romney staffer says the lifeboats are out early: “It’s a window into a campaign in a downward spiral when the positioning begins, but I’ve never seen it begin this early.” 
So was the entire Trump campaign nothing more than ego fulfillment and an attempt to gain endless media attention for the Donald? With nine days left, that explanation seems to be the most likely reason Trump embarked on this suicide mission in the first place.

11472,‘La La Land’ Wins Seven Golden Globes ‘Moonlight’ Wins Best Drama - The New York Times,"• The record seven awards for the musical “La La Land” included for best picture comedy or musical and wins by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. “Moonlight” won for best picture drama. • Meryl Streep gave an impassioned, politically charged speech after receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award. • Casey Affleck, Viola Davis, Isabelle Huppert and Tracee Ellis Ross also won awards. Here is a list of the winners. • And in TV categories, “The Crown” and “Atlanta” were triumphant. • Wesley Morris, Melena Ryzik and Dave Itzkoff provided   commentary. And The Times was also on the red carpet. The     “La La Land” dominated the 74th Golden Globes on Sunday, receiving a promotional boost in the form of a lavish tribute that kicked off the awards telecast and collecting a record seven prizes, including one for best comedy or musical. No film has won more than four Globes since 1979, when the crime drama “Midnight Express” received six, the previous   number. “I’m in a daze now officially,” said the force behind “La La Land,” Damien Chazelle, 31, as he accepted the directing award. Noting the “La La Land” plot  —     dreamers try to make it in show business  —   Emma Stone said in accepting the award for best actress in a musical or comedy, “I think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world, and that’s what this movie is about. ” “La La Land,” made by Lionsgate, also won Globes for song, score, screenplay and actor. The bliss felt by the “La La Land” cast and crew was likely mirrored by the disappointment of those involved with “Moonlight,” the night’s    film. Despite six nominations, “Moonlight,” about a young black man growing up in Miami, received a lone trophy  —   albeit an important one: best drama. “Please, tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend,” Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight,” said in accepting the award, trying to boost the art film’s box office performance. A year after Hollywood was excoriated for its lack of diversity at the Oscars, inclusion was a major theme on Sunday. “This is for all of the women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy,” said Tracee Ellis Ross, as she accepted the best television actress Globe for her role in the ABC series “ . ” “I want you to know that I see you. We see you. ” Ms. Ross was the first black woman to win in the category since 1983, when Debbie Allen won for “Fame. ” There were several surprises. Isabelle Huppert took best actress in a drama for the French film “Elle,” beating Natalie Portman, who was favored to win for “Jackie. ” (“Elle,” a thriller about a businesswoman who tracks her rapist, also won best foreign film.) The foreign journalists who bestow the Globes are known for spreading their awards far and wide, but several films received nothing, including “Florence Foster Jenkins,” “Lion,” “Hacksaw Ridge” and “Hell or High Water. ” “Manchester by the Sea,” despite five nominations, was honored only in the best actor category for Casey Affleck. HBO, despite 14 nominations, the most of any network, was shut out altogether. The first award of the night, for best supporting actor, dropped jaws: Aaron   won for his performance in Tom Ford’s   “Nocturnal Animals,” beating favorites like Mahershala Ali of “Moonlight. ” “I made it  —   thank you,” Mr.   said, looking a bit startled. To the surprise of almost no one, Viola Davis took the supporting actress prize for playing a 1950s homemaker in “Fences. ” After doling out two kisses, one to her husband and one to Denzel Washington, who directed “Fences” and stars in it, Ms. Davis thanked its producers for taking a risk on the film. “It doesn’t scream moneymaker,” she said. “But it does scream art. It does scream heart. ” Early television awards were widely distributed. The   FX series “Atlanta,” about an aspiring rapper and his manager cousin, was honored as best comedy and Donald Glover won for best comedic actor for his performance in the show. Beating the likes of Rami Malek (“Mr. Robot”) and Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) for best actor in a drama was Billy Bob Thornton, honored for his performance in “Goliath,” a show with little buzz. Best actress in a TV drama went to Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix’s “The Crown,” which won for best dramatic series. As expected, “The People vs. O. J. Simpson: Crime Story” was named best   and Sarah Paulson, repeating her win at the Emmys, collected a trophy for her portrayal of the prosecutor Marcia Clark in that show. A   Ms. Paulson was showered with hugs from   as she returned to her seat. The night got off to a jerky start. After the host, Jimmy Fallon, opened the show with the taped “La La Land”  number, he became befuddled after a teleprompter malfunction. Still, he kept it breezy. “Let’s make tonight a celebration,” Mr. Fallon said in his monologue. Despite promises in preshow interviews to zing Donald J. Trump ahead of his inauguration, Mr. Fallon even kept his political jokes to a minimum. “One of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,” he said, almost in a mumble. For casual movie fans, the annual Oscar race starts with the Globes. (Oscar nomination ballots are due on Friday.) But the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the Globes, has worked in recent years to make its television honors more relevant by leaning toward rookie shows like “The Affair” and “Transparent. ” Hollywood stylists spent most of the week fretting about the weather forecast. For days, it looked like torrential rain would threaten a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a swamp. On Sunday, however, Angelenos awakened to “another day of sun,” to borrow a lyric from “La La Land. ” When Meryl Streep, a   Globes nominee and   winner, accepted her Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she gave an impassioned speech that, while never mentioning Mr. Trump by name, was a clear reaction to the election. “Take your broken heart, make it into art,” she said, quoting Carrie Fisher. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said that he had not watched the Globes or Ms. Streep’s speech, but that he was “not surprised” that she and some other entertainment figures had criticized him during the Hollywood event. “Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep’s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. While winners steered away from directly criticizing Mr. Trump, several used their moment onstage to take clear jabs. The British actor Hugh Laurie, collecting a   actor award for “The Night Manager,” said: “I can say I won this at the   Golden Globes. I mean, it has the words ‘Hollywood,’ “Foreign’ and ‘Press’ in it. ” He added, “I also think to some Republicans, even the word ‘Association’ is sketchy. ” Some Trump supporters, either anticipating the barbs or irritated that many Hollywood stars have been outspoken in their horror at his election, made #BoycottGoldenGlobes trend on Twitter early on Sunday. The Golden Globes are great fun, and so is its red carpet. Among this year’s first arrivals were the Stallone sisters, this year’s Miss Golden Globes, shepherded about by their father Sylvester’s     publicist no buttering up of reporters. A news crew from Canada was promised a question with the sisters but then told “They need to go do Twitter” first. Issa Rae and Donald Glover were among the luminaries who admitted to feeling slightly intimidated to being there. Mr. Glover said he really wanted to meet Ms. Davis, and that he was still shocked at the huge response to “Atlanta,” his FX series. “It was supposed to be a punk show,” he said. “And they screened it at A. F. I. and Scorsese was laughing. ” Ms. Rae, of the HBO show “Insecure,” said she was still adjusting to her growing fame. “I’m an introvert, I barely leave the house,” she said. “To be out here is a blessing but I’m like: ‘Wow, guys. It’s just me. ” Even though Netflix has upended the TV industry, that streaming service had never won in the best drama or comedy category at the Globes (and the Emmys, for that matter). That changed this year with “The Crown,”  which was named best drama. Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, won for best actress in a drama. “The Crown” beat out “Stranger Things,” also from Netflix “Westworld,” the HBO series that practically requires a Ph. D. to understand it NBC’s   “This Is Us” and HBO’s “Game of Thrones. ” Another closely watched television race was for best comedic actress, where Ms. Ross beat out some stiff competition to become the first black woman to win in the category since Debbie Allen in 1983. Also nominated were the   Globe winner Sarah Jessica Parker, for her role as a   suburban mother in HBO’s “Divorce” Ms. Rae, nominated for her   performance in HBO’s “Insecure” Julia   from the network’s “Veep” and last year’s winner, Rachel Bloom (“Crazy  ”). Globe voters have ardently tried to leave behind their reputation for paying more attention to celebrity than honoring the year’s best performances. Once upon a time, Globe attendees also bellied up to the open bar in a boozy spectacle, but nominees  —   heeding the scolding eyes of their publicists  —   have largely started sticking to water. Despite moments of seriousness, however, the Globes lived up its raucous reputation. The “Modern Family” star Sofia Vergara made anus jokes from the stage. NBC censors bleeped expletives from Amy Schumer. Dinner guests in multiple instances chatted right through the speeches. As ever, the ballroom’s smoking patio was chockablock with stars at one moment, Sophie Turner from “Game of Thrones” lit her cigarette off one held by her   Maisie Williams. The young “Stranger Things” cast members ran around taking selfies. As ever, the ceremony’s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. About 18. 5 million people watched last year, down from 19. 3 million in 2015. Televised award shows in general have been suffering from viewer erosion, partly because there is a seemingly endless array of them, but NBC had high hopes for Mr. Fallon. He has a much wider fan base than Mr. Gervais and has been using his “Tonight Show” perch as a promotional platform for the gig.",0
11473,Donald Trump to NATO: ‘Terrorism Must Be Stopped in Its Tracks’ - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump called for the NATO alliance to renew their struggle against radical Islamic terrorism, hosting a moment of silence in remembrance of the victims of the attack in Manchester. [“Terrorism must be stopped in its tracks, or the horror you saw in Manchester and so many other places will continue forever,” he said during his remarks in advance of a NATO summit in Brussels.  Trump called the attacks a reminder of the “barbaric” and “vicious” evil that the world faced. “Innocent little girls and so many others were horribly murdered and badly injured while attending a concert,” he said, describing the victims of the attack. “Beautiful lives with so much great potential, torn from their families forever and ever. ” Trump made his remarks during an unveiling of the Article 5 and the Berlin Wall memorials, recalling the success of the partnership against communism. The monument includes a section of one of the Twin Tower buildings that were destroyed on   which Trump described as “a painful reminder” of the threat the world still faced. The president again described the terrorists as “losers” that should be obliterated from the world. “Wherever they exist in our societies, we must drive them out and never, ever let them back in,” he said.",0
11474,"CNBC Survey: Americans Overwhelmingly Approve of Trump Agenda on Infrastructure, Tax Cuts, Trade","A new survey from CNBC shows that Americans are highly optimistic about the economy and strongly support for President Donald Trump’s economic agenda. [The “CNBC All American Survey” recorded the highest level of economic optimism in its 10 year existence.   percent of the public say the economy is good or excellent, a four point improvement from December. Forty percent expect the economy to improve over the next year, which is close to the record set in 2010 —  when the economy was in truly dire straits.  The survey also shows overwhelmingly strong support for Trump’s plans to improve America’s infrastructure, cut taxes, and renegotiate trade deals.  Nearly 75 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s infrastructure improvement plans, with just around 10 percent disapproving. More than 60 percent of the public endorse plans to cut individual taxes, with just over 20 percent opposing. Renegotiating trade deals is favored by 58 percent of the public, and opposed by just over 25 percent. Reducing taxes also wins the approval of most Americans, but it generates opposition from over a third of the public. Cutting business regulations has an approval rating in the high forties, and a disapproval rating in the  . The results on trade show that while Americans are divided over the benefits of free trade —  34 percent say it helps the U. S. and 31 percent say it hurts —  they aren’t divided on the president’s efforts to strike better trade deals. According to CNBC’s Steve Liesman, even Americans who like free trade say they approve of those efforts.   percent of Republicans say that they want their party to “work to pass Trump’s agenda” rather than “hold the line on conservative positions. ” Democrats divide nearly evenly on whether their party should compromise with the president. The president’s personal popularity is far weaker than his economic agenda. Just 39 percent say they approve of how he is doing his job, compared with 48 percent who disapprove, and 13 percent who said they don’t know or were unsure. One reason for this may be that many of the most public actions taken by the Trump administration have been in areas where public support is weaker. Nearly half of Americans say they disagree with the Trump administration’s attempt to replace Obamacare.  The border wall also divides Americans, with slightly more Americans opposing it than supporting it, according to the CNBC survey. Efforts to rollback some of the Obama administration’s policies on climate change also have more opposition than support. The survey is not perfect. It’s results show that nearly half of Americans oppose Trump’s “Immigration Ban,” when there was no ban on immigration. Instead, the administration tried to put in place a temporary halt on travel from certain countries. Perhaps the actual question asked, which CNBC has not released, was less contentious.",0
11475,"Hundreds of Pounds Lighter, and Now Shedding Another Burden of the Past - The New York Times","Losing 650 pounds is a remarkable achievement, but it does not mean the end of your troubles. It has been more than six years since Paul Mason, who once weighed 980 pounds and could not move from his bed, pulled himself back to life with gastric bypass surgery and his own strength of will. But he still carries his past with him. On Wednesday, Mr. Mason, who is 55 and now lives in rural Athol, Mass. took another important step in a process that has been long and uneven, marked by small triumphs and unexpected setbacks. He had the second of two surgeries to eliminate the excess skin that enveloped his body like a shroud. Fifty pounds of it was removed from his abdomen last year this time, about 10 pounds’ worth was excised from his arms and hip in a multihour operation in Manhattan. It may not sound like much. But imagine how it would feel, for instance, to have a loose sac weighing three pounds attached to the bottom of each of your upper arms. The skin not only swung down in a huge arc but also rubbed against itself, a constant reminder of the person Mr. Mason so wants to put behind him. “I still feel trapped in this excess skin,” Mr. Mason said from his bed on Wednesday morning, as the surgeons marked his body for the operation. “This will be   for me again. ” The surgery was again performed without charge at Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan by a team of seven led by three doctors from three different hospitals. It was painstaking, precise and extraordinarily complex. Cutting off a mass of extra skin, as anyone who has been obese and has lost a great deal of weight knows, is not a matter of simply taking a scalpel, snipping it away and stitching it up. “The three of us spent a long time figuring out how to deal with the reality of his arms  —   the amount of excess skin is far beyond what we can normally handle,” said Dr. Jennifer Capla, who performed the surgery along with two longtime colleagues: Dr. Joseph Michaels, a plastic surgeon in Bethesda, Md. and Dr. J. Peter Rubin, chairman of the plastic surgery department at the University of Pittsburgh. The team had to work out where to make the incisions, far trickier in this case than in most. There was also the question of the dozens of enlarged blood vessels that had to be cut along with the skin. Because Mr. Mason needed anticoagulants to prevent blood clots, the worry was that if the blood vessels were not thoroughly sealed, they could bleed out of control. “In normal life, we either clip or cauterize or tie a vessel,” Dr. Capla said. “In Paul’s case, we have to do all three for each one. ” The British tabloids used to call Mr. Mason the world’s fattest man. Before he had the gastric bypass surgery, in 2010, he had been in bed, in Ipswich, England, off and on for a decade. Abused as a child and deeply depressed, he had whittled his life to its barest essentials, an endless, awful repetition: doze, eat, doze, eat, eat, eat without respite. Food was his sole comfort and his constant torment. When he finally left the house for his initial surgery, the fire department had to knock down a wall and remove him with a forklift. Mr. Mason moved to the United States when Dr. Capla, having read about him in The New York Times, volunteered to take charge of the   surgery no doctor in Britain had been willing to attempt. About the same time, Mr. Mason embarked on a Facebook relationship with a woman named Rebecca Mountain who had read about him and eventually invited him to move in with her in Massachusetts. They were engaged to be married she was by his side during his operation last year. There have since been a number of changes in Mr. Mason’s life, both positive and not, some chronicled on an intermittent TLC series about him. He and Ms. Mountain split up last year under the burden of financial worries and the stresses of living together with so much else going on. Mr. Mason now lives in an apartment in a rooming house. He has had a couple of other brief relationships, but none have worked out. “I don’t have much of a social life,” he said. After the surgery last year, he got his weight down to about 310 pounds, started walking and began working out at a gym. But he’s back around 350 pounds and has had several setbacks. He has arthritis in both knees. He is prone to frequent infections in one leg and requires intermittent hospitalization. Though no longer in a wheelchair, he walks rather painstakingly, with a cane. After the latest surgery, Mr. Mason said, he plans to address his arthritis, start exercising again and eventually buy a car. Money is tight, but he supports himself on a private pension from his earnings as a postal worker years ago, the last steady job he had. While he recovers, he is staying at a Manhattan hotel, his room paid for by an anonymous donor whose mother died of complications from obesity some years ago. The three doctors said that Mr. Mason’s case was the most extreme they had ever worked on. Beyond that, they said, it has resonance at a time when obesity is an epidemic and many obese patients are unaware of the repercussions of extensive weight loss. “They’re left with so many psychological scars,” Dr. Michaels said, in addition to the excess skin and other physical problems left behind. Dr. Capla said she feels protective of Mr. Mason, who can seem so vulnerable, but who has persevered nonetheless. “You have to figure out what you want to live for,” she said. “For someone who’s so emotionally complicated, who could have given up many times  —   he hasn’t. It’s one of the most interesting parts of it, that you have someone who seems to have every reason to throw in the towel, and yet who has fought all the way. ”",0
11476,Trump Becomes Ensnared in Fiery G.O.P. Civil War - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump ignites a lot of fights, but his failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the biggest defeat in his short time in the White House, was the result of something else: a   Republican civil war that humbled a generation of party leaders before he ever came to Washington. A   president who believes that Washington’s usual rules do not apply to him, Mr. Trump now finds himself shackled by them. In stopping the repeal of President Barack Obama’s proudest legacy   —   the Republican Party’s professed priority for the last seven years  —   from even coming to a vote, the rebellious far right wing   Mr. Trump, taking on and defeating the party establishment with which it has long been at war and which he now leads. Like every one else who has tried to rule a fissured and fractious party, Mr. Trump now faces a wrenching choice: retrenchment or realignment. Does he cede power to the   wing of his party? Or does he seek other pathways to successful governing by throwing away the partisan playbook and courting a coalition with the Democrats, whom he has improbably blamed for his party’s shortcomings? “It’s really a problem in our own party, and that’s something he’ll need to deal with moving forward,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, an ally of the   Tuesday Group, which stuck with Mr. Trump in the health care fight and earned the president’s praise in the hours after the bill’s defeat. “I think he did a lot  —   he met with dozens and dozens of members and made a lot of accommodations  —   but in the end, there’s a group of people in this party who just won’t say yes,” Mr. Cole said. “At some point, I think that means looking beyond our conference. The president is a deal maker, and Ronald Reagan cut some of his most important deals with Democrats. ” Mr. Trump is not there yet. Before becoming a presidential candidate, he seemed to have little fixed ideology. But as president, he has operated from the   Republican playbook, embracing many of the positions of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the party establishment. While he is angry and thirsty for revenge, he seems determined to swallow the loss in hopes of marshaling enough Republican support to pass spending bills, an   unformed tax overhaul and a $1 trillion infrastructure package  —   legislation that could attract considerable Democratic support but has the potential to split the party. On Friday evening, a somewhat shellshocked president retreated to the White House residence to grieve and assign blame. In a search for scapegoats, he asked his advisers repeatedly: Whose fault was this? Increasingly, that blame has fallen on Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, who coordinated initial legislative strategy on the health care bill with Mr. Ryan, his close friend and a fellow Wisconsinite, according to three people briefed on the president’s recent discussions. Despite the public displays of unity with the speaker, Mr. Trump and his team now regret outsourcing so much of the early drafting to Mr. Ryan. One aide compared doing that to a developer’s staking everything on obtaining a property without conducting a thorough inspection. And they were stunned by his inability to master the politics of his own conference. Mr. Trump, an   developer with a lifelong indifference toward the mechanics of governance, made a game effort to negotiate with members of the   Freedom Caucus, even if it seemed to some members of that group, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, that he did not have the greatest grasp of health care policy or legislative procedure. He told one adviser late Friday that his loss  —   a legislative debacle foreshadowed by the intraparty fight that led to the 2013 government shutdown  —   was a minor bump in the road and that the White House would recover. In an interview with The New York Times on Friday, Mr. Trump asserted that the administration was “rocking. ” The problem, he suggested, was divisions among Republicans. There are “a lot of players, a lot of players with a very different ” Mr. Trump said. “You have liberals, even within the Republican Party. You have the conservative players. ” But his advisers were more realistic. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, according to people familiar with White House discussions, described the president’s decision to withdraw the health care bill in the face of its   defeat as a   failure that could inflict serious damage on this presidency  —   even if Mr. Bannon believes Congress, not Mr. Trump, deserves much of the blame. Mr. Bannon and the president’s more   legislative affairs director, Marc Short, pushed Mr. Trump hard to insist on a public vote, as a way to identify, shame and pressure “no” voters who were killing their best chance to unravel the health care law. One Republican congressional aide who was involved in the   negotiations said Mr. Bannon and Mr. Short were seeking to compile an enemies list. Mr. Ryan repeatedly counseled the president to avoid seeking vengeance  —   at least until he has passed spending bills and a   increase needed to keep the government running. In the end, the president decided to back down. But Mr. Trump’s advisers worry about the hard reality  —   the developer with the   veneer was steamrollered by factions in the Republican Congress. As the dust settled on the health care debacle, it was clear that Mr. Trump’s lieutenants in the Republican civil war had been divided on how they thought the health care fight should have been handled, which does not augur well for the political battles to come. Mutual disgust with the Freedom Caucus seems to be pulling Mr. Ryan and, despite his misgivings, Mr. Trump, together, at least for now  —   just as it briefly united President Barack Obama and John A. Boehner, Mr. Ryan’s   predecessor, during their doomed effort to reach a “grand bargain” on a tax overhaul in 2011. Until the very end, Mr. Trump’s team was deeply divided over whether he should fully commit to a hard sell on a bill they viewed as fundamentally flawed, with Vice President Mike Pence pointedly advising the president to label the effort “Ryancare,” not “Trumpcare,” according to aides. A Pence spokesman denied that the vice president tried to tie the bill to the speaker. Many on Mr. Trump’s team disengaged from the process even as he dug in. Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, had originally been tasked with playing a large role in shepherding the legislation from the White House side. But Mr. Cohn had grown leery of the bill, and the White House recognized that Mr. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs and a Democrat, was not a good messenger to deal with recalcitrant conservatives. Mr. Trump’s    Jared Kushner, a key adviser, had said for weeks that he thought supporting the bill was a mistake, according to two people who spoke with him. But he was on a family skiing trip in Aspen, Colo. last week, and did not return to Washington until Friday  —   much to the annoyance of Mr. Trump, who thought he should have been in Washington in the whole week, according to two Republicans close to the White House. But Mr. Trump brushed aside those concerns in the last few days and embraced the conventional role as leader of his party. He has one speed when he decides to shift to sales mode, aides said, and he had trouble modulating his tone, issuing   superlatives like “wonderful” to describe an ungainly bill his aides described as anything but. After it was all over, the president dutifully blamed the Democrats, a party out of power and largely leaderless, after turning his back on their offers to negotiate on a bipartisan package that would have addressed shortcomings in the Affordable Care Act while preserving its core protections for poor and   patients. Aides advised him the argument was nonsensical, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction. For Mr. Trump’s Republican opponents, here was revenge served cold. As a candidate in 2016, he initially scoffed at signing a Republican loyalty pledge, at times behaving more like an independent invading the Republican host organism than like a typical presidential candidate. As president, Mr. Trump has left dozens of critical administration jobs unfilled, rejecting stalwart Republican applicants deemed insufficiently loyal to him  —   and now he is decrying the disloyalty of the 20 to 30 conservative members who outmaneuvered and overpowered him on health care. “We all learned a lot  —   we learned a lot about loyalty,” a solemn Mr. Trump told reporters late Friday. The dynamic that led to his defeat is bigger than Mr. Trump, despite his tendency to personalize every win or loss. Republicans who gained power by savaging Washington are in full control and cannot agree on a path forward. “We were a   opposition party,” Mr. Ryan said in assessing the defeat late Friday. “Being against things was easy to do. ” Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, said after the health bill was pulled that he was “getting some déjà vu right now. ” “Do you think Donald J. Trump goes home tonight, shrugs and says, ‘This is what winning looks like’?” Mr. Gingrich added. “No! But this is where the Republican Party is right now, and it’s been this way for years. ” But Mr. Trump put on his best face on Saturday morning. “ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE,” he said on Twitter. “Do not worry!”",0
11477,Justin Trudeau Brings Ivanka Trump to Broadway Show on Welcoming Outsiders - The New York Times,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, whose emphasis on welcoming refugees has been at odds with the harsher stance of the Trump administration, on Wednesday night brought Ivanka Trump to a Broadway show that celebrates generosity toward foreigners in need. The surprise pairing at the new musical “Come From Away” was rich with symbolism, as Mr. Trudeau tries to maintain his country’s close relationship with the United States despite substantial differences in public policy. Ms. Trump, the president’s daughter and a close adviser, sat in Row F between Mr. Trudeau and Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and directly behind a former Canadian prime minister, Jean Chrétien. In brief remarks from the stage before the performance, Mr. Trudeau did not discuss government policy explicitly. Instead he focused on praising the show’s story, about a small town in Newfoundland that fed and housed thousands of air travelers from around the world, diverted when North American airspace was closed during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “The world gets to see what it is to lean on each other and be there for each other through the darkest times,” he said. Mr. Trudeau, who was seeing the musical for the first time, said he also saw it as a demonstration of the importance of close relations between Canada and the United States. “There is no relationship quite like the friendship between Canada and the United States,” he said. “This story, this amazing show, is very much about that, and it’s about friendship as well. ” Mr. Trudeau’s celebration of a show about Canadians opening their borders and homes to foreigners in need comes at a complex moment for his country’s relationship with its southern neighbor. Beyond the Trump administration’s demands for reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement, its ban on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries, blocked on Wednesday by a federal judge, has set off a surge in asylum seekers fleeing from the United States to Canada, where they have largely been welcomed. Mr. Trudeau, who was greeted at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater with a sustained standing ovation, led a delegation of 600 people  —   including more than 125 ambassadors to the United Nations  —   brought to the show on Wednesday by the Canadian consulate general in New York. The audience was filled with exuberant Canadians, some bearing flags or wearing clothing decorated with the maple leaf. “Come From Away” is written by a married Canadian couple, Irene Sankoff and David Hein, and tells a distinctly Canadian story. The show also depicts the shame that Muslim air travelers feel at being singled out for scrutiny cheers the welcome given a gay couple in Newfoundland and features a black passenger worried about being mistaken for a thief and being shot  —   all issues that have deep resonance during the Trump era, with critics of the new administration skeptical of the president’s understanding of those concerns. The show opened on March 12 and received a positive review in The New York Times. The critic Ben Brantley called it a “big bearhug of a musical. ” The show had several   productions, including one in Toronto from November 2016 through January 2017, and is scheduled to open another production in Toronto next February. It is rare, but not unprecedented, for a foreign head of government to attend a Broadway show. Last year, Mr. Trudeau and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel attended “Hamilton. ”",0

11479,Popular ’Polandball’ Meme Page Suspended From Facebook - Breitbart,"“Polandball,” a popular Facebook meme page, has been permanently suspended from the platform, losing over 350, 000 followers in the process. [The page, which focused on “  satire,” was notified by Facebook that they would be permanently deleted on Saturday for unknown reasons.  “Hello, friends. Today Poland has received news that his old page will not be coming back. It was finally permanently deleted by Facebook on 3rd February, 2017, along with over 350, 000 fans, many years of laughs and comics that are now gone forever,” declared Polandball in a statement on their replacement page, which has accumulated over 25, 000 likes. “Something that you should understand is that it was not any particular group of people that got our page deleted, other than Facebook. They were the ones who decided to get rid of our page, and they did this because of the many times we were banned previously. They decided now was the time to end it. ” “We will not be giving up on Polandball and the wonderful community that has been made around it,” they continued. “Thanks to you all very much for being fans, we at Polandball love you. Please continue to support us and our misadventures in geopolitical satire. ” Facebook has repeatedly been criticized for removing comedy pages, some of which have had hundreds of thousands of fans. In December, Breitbart News reported on a Facebook group of nearly a thousand of the social network’s top page owners, most of whom had been affected by Facebook’s suspensions and were attempting to fight back under the #PowerToThePages hashtag. Several other Facebook page resistance groups have also popped up over the past two years. Devin Shire, a Facebook page owner and member of the meme page revolt that took place last year, was sanctioned on the social network after he posted a comedy picture of rapper Drake morphed into a Nintendo 64 controller. “Originally we only had my page Young Thugga La Meme, Everything Is A Social Construct, another page I admin Chair Memes, Digiannantonio Aesthetic, and Kevin 3 I believe, then we went reaching out to everybody we knew who had pages and had them reach out to every other page admin they knew,” said Shire in August on the topic of the revolt. “It was not easy trying to talk some pages into being apart of this because a lot of them feared the backlash they might receive from Facebook for trying to stand up for this issue. ” Like the #PowerToThePages movement, Shire’s revolt included many different affected page owners and garnered support from top content creators, including the   Polandball. In July, a popular Facebook page called “Meninist,” which had nearly 400, 000 likes, was permanently suspended, only to be reinstated after Breitbart Tech called Facebook out on the bizarre move. In the same month, a meme page mocking Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was also removed, with the social network citing a joke image as the reason for deletion. Numerous other examples of Facebook censorship have taken place almost daily, including the suspension of gay conservative Lucian Wintrich after he used the word “fag,” the removal of a men’s rights conference page on the day of the conference, the censorship and restriction of WikiLeaks links, and the deletion of   and even   content. Despite the crackdown on harmless and inoffensive content, Facebook has refused to deal with real infringements upon their policies, such as the cartoon posted by the Black Panther Party of Mississippi’s page in July that portrayed a man in a black robe and mask slitting the throat of a police officer. When contacted for comment, Facebook said that it was investigating the suspension. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

11480,Recipes to Debate - The New York Times,"Good morning. I’ll be spending a lot of today with Kim Severson, our national food correspondent, up from Atlanta to help us welcome guests to our Food for Tomorrow conference, which starts tomorrow in Pocantico Hills, N. Y. at the Stone Barns Center for Food  Agriculture. It would be great if we were cooking, but we’ll be in a car, talk, talk, talking, and when we need gas, we’ll stop, and Kim will scout for pork rinds, because you never know: There may be a better kind than Golden Flake. I hope you’ll be cooking. (Not in the mood? Head on over to Facebook and watch our cool little video about making a ricotta tart. See if you don’t want to make that baby tonight or later this week.) If I were cooking, I’d be pleased this evening to serve Pierre Franey’s great old recipe for chicken breasts with lemon alongside some plain rice and a platter of green beans with shallots. It makes for a relatively fast meal, and it should leave you time to clean up ahead of the first   debate of this election season. (Alternatively, you can roast up some loaded nachos and eat them while watching, drinking beer and taking a shot of whiskey every time Mrs. Clinton says “breaking down barriers” and each time Mr. Trump mentions “the wall. ”) I’d be making plans for the rest of the week, too. I’m excited to try my hand at David Tanis’s recipe for lamb steaks with Lebanese spices. I’d like to serve Florence Fabricant’s recipe for broccoli rabe made  . I want to make Nigella Lawson’s recipe for salmon in a ginger and lemongrass broth. It’s getting to the time of year when I want to eat David’s recipe for pork chops with apples and cider. And who doesn’t want, as fall begins to cool off our evenings a little, to settle into a dinner of Jamie Oliver’s recipe for eggplant Parmesan? The Food for Tomorrow conference runs through Wednesday, so perhaps I’ll get to one of those toward the end of the week.

11481,Amazon Now Worth Twice As Much As Walmart - Breitbart,"Amazon stock has skyrocketed this week as shares rose above $900 for the first time on Tuesday CNN Money reports. [Amazon stock is riding high with shares gaining 7 percent this week alone and 20 percent overall this year. This values Amazon at around $430 billion, twice the market value of one of its major rivals Walmart which is worth around $220 billion. Currently, the only companies worth more than Amazon are Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Amazon is now worth more than both Facebook and the Warren   Berkshire Hathaway,  This surge in Amazon’s stock price comes after the announcement last week that the company would be buying the Middle Eastern   site Souq. com. Amazon reportedly purchased the company which had been previously valued at around $1 billion for the price of $650 million. Amazon’s stock is now trading at 125 times the companies estimated earnings this year and 75 times the companies projected profits for next year. Despite the high price of the stock, financial data and software company FactSet still considers the stock a good buy. Two dozen analysts have estimated the stock price target to rise above the current price with seven analysts putting it above $1, 000. Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets raised his price estimation on Monday to $1, 200 while Shyam Patil of Susquehanna Financial Group raised his price target to $1250. These estimations are approximately 40 percent higher than the current market price, if these predictions are proven true, then Amazon could soon hold a market value of nearly $600 billion. Considering the company’s rapid expansion into technology with their Amazon Alexa home device and it’s Sponsored Products business, Amazon could soon also be dominating the tech and world in the near future.

11482,Trump Says Health Law Replacement May Not Be Ready Until Next Year - The New York Times,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   President Trump said in an interview that aired on Sunday that a replacement health care law was not likely to be ready until either the end of this year or in 2018, a major shift from promises by both him and Republican leaders to repeal and replace the law as soon as possible. “Maybe it’ll take till sometime into next year, but we’re certainly going to be in the process,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with Bill O’Reilly of Fox News, after Mr. O’Reilly asked the president whether Americans could “expect a new health care plan rolled out by the Trump administration this year. ” “It statutorily takes awhile to get,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to be putting it in fairly soon, I think that, yes, I would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments but we should have something within the year and the following year. ” Mr. Trump acknowledged that replacing former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act is complicated, though he reiterated his confidence that his administration could devise a plan that would work better than the law  —   despite having provided few details of how such a plan would work. “You have to remember Obamacare doesn’t work, so we are putting in a wonderful plan,” Mr. Trump said. Speaker Paul D. Ryan has vowed to move legislation for a replacement for the Affordable Care Act by the end of March. But some Republicans are worried about a political backlash if they repeal the law without an adequate replacement  —   potentially throwing millions of people off their insurance  —   and have urged a more methodical approach. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, recently proposed repairing parts of the health care law ahead of scrapping the whole package. Mr. Trump said last month that he wanted to present a replacement soon after the Senate confirmed his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Price’s confirmation this week. “We’re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,” Mr. Trump said in January. Last month, the president signed an executive order to begin unwinding the Affordable Care Act. It gave the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to ease what it called “unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens” from the existing law.",0
11483,The World Is Actually Becoming A More Peaceful Place,"The World Is Actually Becoming A More Peaceful Place Nov 17, 2016 0 0 Is it too good to be true? Is the world actually becoming more peaceful? With the advancement in technology and the rise of alternative media continuing to spread, we are now witness to many things we previously were not. With that, some might reject the statement that the world is becoming a more peaceful place, however, it is simply that we are now catching on camera and video some acts of violence that then spread on social and alternative media. We see that it is not that the world is becoming more hostile and violent, it is just that we are now catching these things on camera more than ever. As Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker says , “The news is a systematically misleading way of viewing the world.” In fact, there is statistical and real-world evidence to support the statement that the world is becoming a more peaceful place. As we can see in the image below, the amount of deaths around the world due to war has trended downward for quite some time, outside of the small uptick in the past couple years. Data comes the Peace Research Institute of Oslo. In his 2011 book, “ The Better Angels of Our Nature ,” Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker states that the decline of violence is, “the most significant and least appreciated development in the history of our species.” He also stated that between 1945 and 1990 there were 30 wars that killed over 100,000 people each, which included wars in Tibet, Uganda, Greece, China, Mozambique, Algeria and Guatemala. Pinker adds , “With the exception of last year’s small wars in Ukraine, the zone of war has contracted to a crescent from Central Africa through the Middle East into South Asia.” The Harvard psychologist also said that in his book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, he has proven statistically that other forms of violence has also declined, including murder, capital punishment, torture and domestic violence. In regards to violent war, it is happening in fewer places than what we might believe due to the media’s influence. Recent Examples of Peace In somewhat recent years, wars in Iran, Peru, Chad, Angola, Sri Lanka and Lebanon have ended, which is another positive and continuing trend. While it is on shaky grounds, there also still exists a ceasefire in Ukraine. Additionally, the Afghanistan government in late September signed a peace deal with Hezb-i-Islami, which is the first peace deal signed by the Afghanistan government since war with the Taliban broke out in 2001. In October, thousands of Palestinian and Israeli women marched together for two weeks on a peace march which they called March of Hope. The march ended in front of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Jerusalem, which was done in attempt to get peaceful dialogue started again between Israel and Palestine. Just a few weeks ago a United Nations resolution was passed in which 123 nations voted for (38 against) a ban on destructive nuclear weapons, which will be discussed starting in March of 2017. As Kate Hudson, the chairwomen for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said, “It’s very encouraging to see so many countries say loud and clear it’s time for the world to move on from nuclear weapons.” Also, less than one week ago, the Colombian government and the FARC Rebels signed a revised peace treaty, which is ending a war that has been occurring there for over the past 50 years. What We Can Do As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr once said, “Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war.” Synchronized meditations is an easy way to effectively organize. One way to “effectively organize” is to participate in synchronized meditations, which is meditating with other people at the same time. Before this is dismissed as fantasy and wishful thinking, it must be remembered that group intention and synchronized meditation has been studied over 600 times, in 33 countries and by over 250 independent research institutions. The result of synchronized meditations has been labeled the “ Maharishi Effect .” It’s most notable study was when 7,000 individuals meditated over a period of three weeks each morning and evening, which lowered global terrorism by 72%. While it might sound unbelievable to some, in the fields of social science, social psychology and quantum physics, it is a very serious and respected topic. While there are numerous things we can do to cultivate more peace in our lives and the world around us, such as using non-violent communication, smiling more often, gardening, connecting with ourselves in a deeper way, or being more grateful, synchronized meditations are an extremely beautiful and powerful way for people to organize and create ripples of peace in the fabric of our world.

11488,"Colombia Peace Deal Is Defeated, Leaving a Nation in Shock - The New York Times","BOGOTÁ, Colombia  —   A Colombian peace deal that the president and the country’s largest rebel group had signed just days before was defeated in a referendum on Sunday, leaving the fate of a   war suddenly uncertain. A narrow margin divided the    vote, with 50. 2 percent of Colombians rejecting the peace deal and 49. 8 percent voting in favor, the government said. The result was a deep embarrassment for President Juan Manuel Santos. Just last week, Mr. Santos had joined arms with leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, who apologized on national television during a signing ceremony. The surprise surge by the “no” vote  —   nearly all major polls had indicated resounding approval  —   left the country in a dazed uncertainty not seen since Britain voted in June to leave the European Union. And it left the future of rebels who had planned to rejoin Colombia as civilians  —   indeed, the future of the war itself, which both sides had declared over  —   unknown. Both sides vowed they would not go back to fighting. Mr. Santos, who appeared humbled by the vote on television on Sunday, said the   that his government had signed with the FARC would remain in effect. He added that he would soon “convene all political groups,” especially those against the deal, “to open spaces for dialogue and determine how we will go ahead. ” Rodrigo Londoño, the FARC leader, who was preparing to return to Colombia after four years of negotiations in Havana, said he, too, was not interested in more war. “The FARC reiterates its disposition to use only words as a weapon to build toward the future,” he said in a statement. “With today’s result, we know that our challenge as a political party is even greater and requires more effort to build a stable and lasting peace. ” The question voters were asked was simple: “Do you support the final agreement to end the conflict and construct a stable and enduring peace?” But it was one that had divided this country for generations, as successive governments fought what seemed to be a war without an end and the Marxist FARC rebels dug into the forest for a hopeless insurgency. To many Colombians who had endured years of kidnappings and killings by the rebels, the agreement was too lenient. It would have allowed most    fighters to start lives as normal citizens, and rebel leaders to receive reduced sentences for war crimes. “There’s no justice in this accord,” said Roosevelt Pulgarin, 32, a music teacher who cast his ballot against the agreement on a rainy day at an elementary school in Bogotá, the capital. “If ‘no’ wins, we won’t have peace, but at least we won’t give the country away to the guerrillas. We need better negotiations. ” María Fernanda González, 39, an administrator at a telecommunications company who voted against the deal, said she simply did not trust the FARC. “Why didn’t they turn in their arms and tell the world what happened to the people they kidnapped, as a gesture during the talks?” she asked. Her household seemed to reflect the deep divides in Colombia, with her husband, Carlos Gallon, 42, an engineer, voting for the deal. Mr. Gallon said the country had no choice but to stop fighting. But still, he admitted, “I understand why she is voting no. ” The referendum result overturned a timetable intended to end the FARC insurgency within months. The rebels had agreed to immediately abandon their battle camps for 28 “concentration zones” throughout the country, where over the next six months they would hand over their weapons to United Nations teams. Under the agreement,    fighters were expected to be granted amnesty. Those suspected of being involved in war crimes would be judged in special tribunals with reduced sentences, many of which were expected to involve years of community service work, like removing land mines once planted by the FARC. On Sunday, the government said it had sent negotiators to Havana to begin discussing the next steps with the rebels. After the president’s statement that he was reaching out to opposition leaders in the Colombian Congress like former President Álvaro Uribe, experts predicted a potentially tortured process in which Mr. Uribe and others would seek harsher punishments for FARC members, especially those who had participated in the drug trade. “Everyone has said, including those who sided ‘no,’ that they could renegotiate the deal, but obviously that would have political challenges,” said César Rodríguez, the director of the Center for Law, Justice and Society, a nongovernmental organization in Colombia focusing on legal issues. “It was a small majority, but a valid majority, and that has consequences. ” On Sunday night, politicians who had strongly opposed the deal were already signaling that it was time to negotiate more stringent terms with the rebels. “We want to redo the process,” said Francisco Santos, a vice president under Mr. Uribe, who was against the deal but supports an eventual peace with the FARC. “In democracy, sometimes you win, but sometimes you lose. ” The war left brutal scars in Colombia. About 220, 000 people were killed in the fighting, and six million were displaced. An untold number of women were raped by fighters, and children were given Kalashnikov rifles and forced into battle. Unable to put down the insurgency, the government turned in the countryside to paramilitary groups run by men who became regional warlords. The state seemed swept aside in the fighting. In the end, the war lasted so long that it might have been difficult for many Colombians to forgive the FARC. “The adults that were born before the war now number very few,” said Juan Gabriel Vásquez, a novelist who voted for the deal. “As a society, we are a massive case of   stress, because we have grown up in the midst of fear, of anxiety, of the noise of war. ” Many people lost because of the outcome. Among them was President Santos, who had staked his legacy on the peace deal and had been rumored as a possible contender for the Nobel Peace Prize. FARC members, who had been on the run in the jungle for decades, saw their hopes of rejoining Colombia as political leaders, including 10 seats in Congress, suddenly dashed for the time being. Perhaps the biggest winner on Sunday was Mr. Uribe, the former president, and the Colombian far right, which had vowed to defeat the deal at the ballot box. Mr. Uribe had argued that the agreement was too lenient on the rebels, who he said should be prosecuted as murderers and drug traffickers. “Peace is exciting, the Havana agreement disappointing,” Mr. Uribe wrote on Twitter on Sunday after casting his “no” vote. In the end, a small majority of Colombians agreed with him.",0
11489,Dr. Mercola: The Dangers of LED Lights,"Leave a reply 
Alexandra Bruce – Dr. Joseph Mercola interviews Dr. Alexander Wunsch about the hidden dangers of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. 
Our eyes were designed to receive the light frequency of the Sun. Rays strike the optic nerve, which signals the pituitary gland, triggering the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate our bodily functions. 
The mitochondria of each cell in the human body produce almost one’s entire bodyweight in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per day (!) and the human body can only live for 15 seconds without it, as compared to 4-10 minutes without air, 3-4 days without water. Another shocking thing we learn is that we only receive 1/3rd of what is converted into ATP from the food we eat. The overwhelming percentage of our ATP production comes from the light we receive through our eyes and skin. 
With many of us staring at screen devices or spending most of our time indoors with energy-saving LED lighting, few of us are aware of the adverse effects that LEDs have on retinal health, hormonal health and mental health, because these do not emit the correct frequency of light, in order for us to produce ATP.

11490,AFL-CIO Praises President Trump’s Move to Withdraw from TPP,"  president Richard Trumka praised GOP President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership once and for all on Monday with an executive order officially killing the Pacific Rim trade deal. [Trumka also praised the decision by President Trump to reopen negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal from the 1990s, a deal that saw millions of U. S. jobs leave the country for Mexico and Canada —  and the labor union leader praised President Trump’s harsh words for Big Pharma, the pharmaceutical industry, when Trump said of that industry that “they’re politically protected, but not anymore” in an interview with the Washington Post.  Trumka said in his Monday statement: Last year, a powerful coalition of labor, environmental, consumer, public health and allied groups came together to stop the TPP. Today’s announcement that the US is withdrawing from TPP and seeking a reopening of NAFTA is an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people. While these are necessary actions, they aren’t enough. They are just the first in a series of necessary policy changes required to build a fair and just global economy. We will continue our relentless campaign to create new trade and economic rules that end special privileges for foreign investors and Big Pharma, protect our planet’s precious natural resources and ensure fair pay, safe conditions and a voice in the workplace for all workers. ” While labor unions’ politically motivated leaders by and large supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016’s presidential election, it is no surprise that President Trump won over many of the workers throughout the union structure. Trump’s populist appeal to American workers in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio was critical to his landslide electoral college victory, when he stunned the   political, financial, and cultural elites in places like New York City, Washington, D. C. and Los Angeles with a 306 electoral vote landslide win over Clinton on Nov. 8. The media and political class have struggled to understand the matter since, with many still refusing to make course corrections after their failures. Trump has met with labor leaders and industry leaders, bringing them together on key issues like trade and fighting corruption —  building an entirely new political coalition while the Democratic Party debates about how far to the extreme left to veer with a race for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship coming down to two extreme progressives, Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, both of whom oppose good trade deals and immigration controls that Trump and his new coalition support.",0

11492,Trump’s Improvised Path to a Month of Executive Action - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump plans to take executive action on a nearly daily basis for a month to unravel his predecessor’s legacy and begin enacting his own agenda, his aides say, part of an extended exercise of presidential power to quickly make good on his campaign promises. But in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise, he has made few, if any, firm decisions about which orders he wants to make, or in which order. That is a striking break from past presidents, who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas. It was plain that Mr. Trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office, as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on Friday. “It’s going to be a   decision,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that afternoon. Then, around 7 p. m. reporters were suddenly summoned to the Oval Office. After sprinting from the briefing room, they watched Mr. Trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the Affordable Care Act. “There are a number that are being looked at, but it’s just a question of which ones he feels like doing, and when,” Mr. Spicer had said of executive orders earlier on Friday. In recent days, he had said that Mr. Trump’s top aides were still deciding on the “sequencing” of the unilateral actions. Still, there is little doubt about the policy areas in Mr. Trump’s sights: international trade deals, illegal immigration, the fight against the Islamic State, climate change and Washington lobbying. In his first   in office, Mr. Trump focused on health care, ordering the machinery of government to look for every opportunity to pull back on President Barack Obama’s signature achievement by waiving fees or granting exemptions to states, businesses, individuals and insurance companies. He also moved quickly to freeze the Obama administration’s unfinished regulations, a routine step for an incoming president of the opposite party. During the campaign, Mr. Trump railed against Mr. Obama’s use of executive authority to sidestep an uncooperative Congress on issues like immigration and health care. After his victory, Mr. Trump vowed to use those same powers to quickly reverse the country’s ideological course. Aides said they hoped to group Mr. Trump’s executive actions thematically for maximum impact. They gave few other details, though some advisers suggested that executive actions on illegal immigration could be among the first issued after the inaugural weekend. Advocates for undocumented workers are anxiously waiting to see what Mr. Trump will do. If he moves aggressively, he could immediately overturn Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA  —   the program Mr. Obama created to protect young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children, giving them legal status and access to work permits. Ending that program would put as many as 800, 000 of them at risk of being removed from their families and sent to the countries they had left as children. The White House could instead unwind the program slowly, giving the young people, often called Dreamers, more time before their immigration protections and work permits expire. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on Friday that in a brief conversation with the new president, Mr. Trump had given him assurances about the program. The president, Mr. Durbin said, told him that “we don’t want to hurt those kids we’re going to do something. ” “Thank goodness he said that,” the senator added. The president could also order federal agents to conduct workplace raids to crack down on immigration violations. He could take action against   sanctuary cities, those that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. Or he could issue an order reinstating a program known as Secure Communities, in which the local authorities cooperated with federal agencies to detect and deport illegal immigrants. And he could order work to begin, at least symbolically, on a wall at the southern border. Financing construction of the entire wall would require congressional action, however. But on the border wall and other promises, Mr. Trump now faces the challenge of translating slogans into action. He has already missed the deadline for a vow he made in August to start deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records on his first day in office. “We will begin moving them out, Day 1,” he said during a rally in Phoenix. “My first hour in office, those people are gone. ” Mr. Trump’s approach to using his newly minted executive power mirrors his often chaotic transition to the White House. The    nature of the new president’s first 24 hours reflected his management style, both in his business empire and in the campaign, which went through four   as aides fell into and out of favor. His travel schedule was rarely planned out more than a few days in advance, and Mr. Trump did not hesitate to tear it apart when he wanted to. Decisions would be telegraphed by top advisers, only to be pulled back within hours, or never formally announced. The lack of planning stands in stark contrast to the approaches of past presidents, who have sought to demonstrate the change in direction they hope to lead and maximize the effectiveness of their unilateral actions. Ronald Reagan retreated to the President’s Room just off the Senate floor only moments after being sworn in and signed an order freezing federal hiring, echoing the declaration in his inaugural address that “government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem. ” Mr. Obama also decided well in advance which executive actions he wanted to take in his first days, after a team of lawyers led by Gregory B. Craig, his first White House counsel, spent much of his transition planning what he could do without Congress to illustrate a stark break with George W. Bush’s presidency. On his second full day in office, Mr. Obama ordered the closing of the Guantánamo Bay prison  —   a directive still unfulfilled  —   and banned torture by mandating that terrorism interrogations be guided by the Army Field Manual. Mr. Obama’s embrace of executive orders  —   early in the administration and later, when a   Congress blocked his legislative agenda  —   may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump to take quick action. Since many of Mr. Obama’s achievements were put in place with executive action, Mr. Trump can reverse them, at least over time, the same way.",0
11493,Comment on US will cure cancer ‘once and for all’ - Obama by whatifs,"US President Barack Obama has said that the United States should be the country to win a new global health race and find a cure for cancer “once and for all.” 
“Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer,” Obama said during his final State of the Union address on Tuesday, referencing Joe Biden’s remarks last year when he announced not to run for president. 
“Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they’ve had in over a decade,” he added. 
“Tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all,” Obama stated. 
Biden launched a high-profile push last year to find a cure for cancer, which kills millions of people around the world every year, after his oldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer in May. 
In October, Biden announced that he would not enter the US presidential race, saying after the death of his son he lacks the emotional energy required to put up a good fight against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. 
Biden’s wife, Jill, said she was disappointed her husband decided not to seek the Democratic nomination. “I believed he would’ve been the best president,” she said. 
In his comments on Tuesday night, Biden said his priority will be increasing public and private funds to fight cancer. 
“The federal government will do everything it possibly can — through funding, targeted incentives, and increased private-sector coordination — to support research and enable progress,” Biden wrote in a blog post. 
Biden compared the commitment to fighting cancer to President John F. Kennedy’s dedication to send American scientists to the moon more than five decades ago: “This is our moonshot.”",0

11496,UK training Saudi pilots amid reports of war crimes in Yemen,"Email Britain has been providing military training to the Saudi Arabian Air Force, while the country is carrying out atrocities in neighboring Yemen, a report says. The UK's Liberal Democrats revealed that the British government is providing the training in both Saudi Arabia and Britain itself, The Independent revealed on Saturday. The party’s Foreign Affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, obtained a parliamentary letter from UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, in which he acknowledged that the British government provides the training to Saudi pilots bombing civilians in Yemen. Brake denounced the move as “shameful,” calling on the Ministry of Defense to end the training immediately. “The Government must end its complicity in this murderous campaign,” he said. ""It is shameful that the UK government is not only arming Saudi pilots, it is training them as well.” Saudi Arabia has launched a war in Yemen on March 26, 2015, in a bid to undermine the HouthiAnsarullah movement and restore power to Saudi-backed former president AbdRabbuh Mansur Hadi. Since the beginning of the aggression, almost 10,000 people, including over 2,000 children, have been killed. The Liberal Democrats also wanted to know what the instructions and advice had been given by the British government on authorizing military operations and the “targeting of aerial operations” over the last year. ""The indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, in clear breach of international humanitarian law, is now well documented,” Blake added. In response, Fallon claimed the government helps the Saudi Air Force in order to “improve their targeting processes and to support International Humanitarian Law (IHL) compliance.” Fallon said the UK had delivered two training sessions in Saudi Arabia on the process for investigating alleged International Humanitarian Law violations, under a joint incident team it supported. He, however, said that the government “has not provided any specific operational advice to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for operations in Yemen and has not provided training on political authorization of military operations.” The Liberal Democrat party also insisted that the latest revelation requires an urgent action by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Jonson, who personally signs off any arms sales to countries such as Saudi Arabia. London, which has been one of the biggest suppliers of weapons to Riyadh for 40 years, has come under fire for its continued sales of weapons to the kingdom during its war on Yemen. Charity group Oxfam accused the British government of being in a state of “denial and disarray” over its arms supplies to Riyadh. Earlier this year, Amnesty International found a banned British-made cluster bomb used by the Saudis in Yemen. The un-detonated bomb which was found in a remote village in northern Yemen was BL-755 cluster bombs.",0
11497,3 More Emotions Men Should Master,"  3 More Emotions Men Should Master 3 More Emotions Men Should Master 
André is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 3, 2016 Mind 
Passions and emotions are an almost bottomless pit. Start digging there and you will find new ones, or new relations between this and that tidbit of emotional content. So-called Enlightenment philosophers who tried to theorize the passions—something that had been done at greater length, actually, by Thomas Aquinas—could never agree on how many there were or even how much they exactly mattered in the course of life. 
Whether or not you have been reading my last two pieces on the topic, remember this is about mastering passions in the most general sense. This is not only about emotional restraint or seduction. Our own emotional states are the first in line, but mastering the passions is also about spotting what other people are feeling, how they can be led to a specific course of action, and what tends to make them tick. Mastering the passions is far from evident, it rather takes times and experience: the concepts and directions I am providing here aim at giving some conscious clarity about things that are by nature a bit muddy. 
Artists, though they often suffer from mental problems, are skilled at painting a particular vision in vivid colours, allowing their public to share a specific point of view and emotional state. This is something the elite know very well. Critics trashed Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged because they could see themselves painted there as passive-aggressive cultural parasites. Rand’s novel was more cogent, and attracted more heat, than her barely original “philosophical” pieces today sold at the cheapest price on the second-hand book market. 
More recently, the movie The Fall (2004) got backlashed by some of the mainstream media on the grounds that it depicted Hitler as “too human.” While seeing actor Bruno Ganz pondering, eating, talking to his closest company or getting angry, the viewer could perhaps feel a bit of empathy to him. Which is, of course, unacceptable to a Left that clings to the idea of a crazy, careless, “inhuman” dictator to be forever cast as an embodiment of evil. Hollywood directors do not like witnessing others competing with their own emotional mastery. 
We need artists, as well as qualified cultural critics, to take some distance from the mainstream propaganda disguised as entertainment and expand an alternative culture and artworks. Emotions explored in the present series can be used just that way. 1. Gratitude 
Gratitude denotes a trained and refined disposition. Being graceful means “recognizing that the good in our life can come from something that is outside us and outside our control” (Neel Burton, Heaven and Hell , chap.8, p.61). It focuses on positive things we already have and that cannot be ascribed to our sole merit or efforts. 
The traditional world, whatever the particular cultural or religious form it was embodied into, always emphasized the necessity of being grateful. You owed your existence to God, to your family and your community. None of these goods were actually deserved, which meant you had to be grateful for them and repay them by being a dutiful member of the community as well as a dutiful father for your own children. A lot of prayers and ancient rites imply a thanksgiving for what one already has. 
Moving later in time, it is striking to see that modern progressivism breeds the exact opposite mindset. The ideology of rights make many goods granted, not a “thank you for” but an “I have a right to.” Neophilia (the relentless pursuit of novelty) always casts a bad shadow on what has been around for some time, as if what was coming later was always better. 
Advertisement, gossip culture, economic growth pressure, quest for victimhood lead to envy and always being more or less frustrated with what one already has, regardless of what it is. By leading us to always want more, progressivism makes us oblivious to what we already have or how it does not stem from pure individual merit—and, when it flatters the ego, it makes us complacent and far from cultivating the art of being thankful. 
Turning our backs from the modern, ungraceful mindset is easier said than done. To start with: loud-mouthed girls should be remembered they owe their nice, luxurious workplaces to the men who built them, LGBTBBQ should thank their heterosexual parents and ancestors for their very lives, anti-white black activists should remember they would not even exist had their ancestors not benefited from their white colonizers healthcare technology. Feel free to expand the list. Ultimately, I think, every person who is modern or westernized enough can be outed as ungraceful for something. 2. Trust 
A famous study showed that multiculturalism was closely correlated with defiance and a lack of trust in each other. Provided that we enlarge a bit our definition of multiculturalism, this absolutely makes sense. Some ethnic groups are especially prone to violence, and some “minority” groups are rewarded for freely accusing the silent majority, but the hegemony of political correctness made it a taboo. Communities have been fragmented by individualism, i.e. each person looking to take as much as she can, and by an “antiracist” white guilt that soon became an intra-white generalized suspicion of “racism.” People do not identify anymore with the larger society and often cannot even identify with a smaller community—which makes everyone else a potential enemy. 
Yet, without trust, life becomes unbearable. If you can’t go to the streets without the possibility of getting mugged by, say, BLM activists , or go to a family meal without the prospect of a lukewarm struggle with aging leftist parents, or have a relationship with a girl without the possibility of her making a false rape accusation , there aren’t a lot of things you can do on the long run. Without trust in other people, you have to trust the complex of big corporations, NGO, and State institutions we call the system—and be dependent from it for things as basic as food and shelter. 
Only trust in each other can make life sustainable and long-term projects workable. To re-create trust, we have to make people accountable and bound to precise rules, reward good behaviours while punishing bad ones. Actions must bear consequences. But before neomasculinity gets into power, men should strive to establish a reputation through reliability, persistence, and a strong mindset. I could wager you have been more trusting of your Facebook friends last years than of the mainstream media , the former conveying more trustworthy information than the latter. 3. Desire 
Modern capitalism and progressivism always ran on desire. Want cheaper prices? More goods? Better goods? More TV channels to watch? More monies? More ego and thinking you are the hot shit? Well, just buy in X or do some work for Y, and here it is… um, nah, you just have to do some more, and some more, and some more. In the end, you forgot why exactly you are doing what you’re doing, or why you started to watch TV. But it all started with you led to perform something, no matter how surreptitiously framed as spontaneous or normal it was. 
The system plays on desires in three ways. It sets things to be desired, things to be feared or never desired at all, and things to be consummated without end. Things to be desired include everything the advertisement wants you to desire, like a revolving credit, a new sofa, an SUV or whatever, as well as the next step of “ progress ” as it has been elaborated on the top of the pyramid. 
Things to be feared are where the system wants you to be resigned and fatalistic: did you ever feel sad to see all these girls losing themselves into a sea of fat, bitching, and SJW-propaganda spouting? Too bad, that’s globalization, resistance is futile, move on! At last, things to be consummated are mainly produced to keep you busy and programmed though you are not really practising anything beyond staring at a screen. 
Lately, an important shift has been happening between the first and third ways to play on desires. Decades before, the average consumer had to desire owning more junk or being part of the “progress”: the system needed him to work and monitor his peers. Today, the junk is already everywhere, PC culture is already hegemonic, and the average American worker is no longer needed. Active desire is not needed anymore. 
Thus, the system has shifted into making the average Joe more passive. Instead of actually desiring more, the consumer should be content with surrogates of everything—pseudo-group identity with team sports, pseudo-sports with football and basket on TV, pseudo-sex with porn, pseudo-life with video games, pseudo-family life with animals, pseudo-expertise when the average libtard obnoxiously parrots the media on everything. This is Brzezinski’s tittytainment in a nutshell. 
Even if you don’t give up on having a real life instead of a surrogate, the system will still want you to desire things only for yourself, thus retreating into individualism, instead of trying to actually weight on the world. Either you surrender to “the progress” or you try to ignore it before it comes for you. As if nothing could change. 
Don’t let the elite frame the world according to its own interests. Desire self-realization and weighting on the course of the world. Of course, our female counterparts should desire being loving, caretaking, and definitely on our side. To conclude this series 
Once again, it is hard to sketch in a few words what could be done with passions or emotions. What I have mostly dwelled into is how those already in power manipulate them and what we could do as to take them back. If you find the topic worthy of interest, you can expand it in two directions: first, documenting yourself on a particular passion or emotion, and second, using some by stirring it with a certain aim in mind. 
In the former case, I would recommend Neel Burton’s Heaven and Hell (quoted several times in the course of this series) as a point of departure. In the latter, being creative or simply assertive is up to you. Whether this looks more like efforts or self-persuasion or artistry does not matter much. 
Here, as well as in seduction, a tight framing is key. Whatever the topic, no vocabulary and no picture are really neutral, which is a problem as our perception and thinking orientation are often conditioned by these. The mastery of emotions is reinforced—and reinforces—the mastery of representations. If this sounds far-fetched, let me provide some examples of use, examples you are absolutely free to expand as it suits you. 
In the comments space, several guys here have been giving a very negative portrayal of the nice guy: he would be a fake, a “sneaky bastard,” a “jerk.” So guys who want to get laid or have their own interests, just as everyone else, are jerks? This looks like internalized feminist thinking. In my opinion, nice guys should elicit empathy, which goes through a positive portrayal emphasizing their willingness to respect the girl or how they were likely raised by an unmanly culture. 
A recent ROK piece about mainstream media has shown how these are making a conscious effort to hide and de-legimitate white victimhood: they paint vividly any crime where the victim is non-white and the perpetrator is, but mention no detail or do not mention at all any crime perpetrated by non-white(s) on white(s). 
The same pattern appears in the movie Elysium (2013), when the (of course) white villain mentions children she wants to protect from a mass of brown invaders, yet these children are never shown and consequently stir no empathy from the average watcher, whereas the brown-skinned are vividly depicted as humane and not responsible for their own poverty. 
Analyzing these phenomena is fine, but ultimately insufficient. Creative people on our side have to provide an alternative that includes mastered emotions. Picking up girls is part of, and gives some experience in, this wider game.",0
11498,Donald Trump Adjusts His Complaints About Debate Microphone - The New York Times,"During a    event in New Hampshire on Thursday night, Donald J. Trump made a passing remark about the first presidential debate last week and about the audio equipment that he has blamed for his    performance. “It wasn’t that the mike didn’t work,” Mr. Trump said, during comments about the difficulties he had faced during the debate. The problem, he said, was that the people operating the soundboard had been “oscillating” as he spoke, changing the levels of his voice. In any other election, this would have been an anodyne comment. But it came after Mr. Trump had spent days insisting he had had a “bum mike” and theorizing that there may have been foul play. Mr. Trump’s new comments may be obscured somewhat by the arrival of Hurricane Matthew. But, ahead of the crucial second debate with Hillary Clinton on Sunday, they represented an adjustment by Mr. Trump of what had been a rallying cry portraying him as a potential victim of sabotage. In an email Thursday evening, a Trump spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, pointed to a brief statement by the Commission on Presidential Debates last week saying that an audio issue had affected how Mr. Trump was heard in the hall. “We’d like to reiterate, as the commission stated independently, that Mr. Trump experienced audio issues the night of the debate,” Ms. Hicks said. “Regardless of the exact technical cause or effect, it was unfortunate. ” The event on Thursday was intended to help Mr. Trump find a comfort zone before the Sunday debate, which shares the    format. But it was moderated by a friendly conservative radio host, questions were screened in advance, and Mr. Trump spoke for only about 30 minutes. Mr. Trump, who faced some criticism for seeming ill prepared for the first debate, will spend time today and over the weekend preparing for the second. But the hurricane  —   potentially the worst to hit the United States in many years  —   threatens to drown out attention on the race, perhaps even on debate day.",0
11499,"Dave Chappelle on Trump, Cosby and His Netflix Deal - The New York Times","Whether lambasting racial inequity with his trademark eccentricity, or putting on a Jheri curl wig for a   parody of Rick James, Dave Chappelle has long been considered one of the most exciting   in comedy. But he hasn’t issued a special or album since his infamous decision to walk away from the critically acclaimed “Chappelle’s Show” on Comedy Central  —   and a $50 million contract  —   in 2005. [ Read a review of the Netflix specials ] He   in the spotlight in 2013, rekindling his love of   in what one critic called “magnetically compelling” sets in a variety of spaces: comedy clubs, festivals and 10   shows at Radio City Music Hall.   the medium that first made Mr. Chappelle famous, was again his life’s work. On Tuesday he releases two new specials on Netflix, “Deep in the Heart of Texas” and “The Age of Spin,” culled from a 2015 performance in Austin and a 2016 show in Los Angeles. In an interview that touched on the death of Prince and his conflicted feelings about Bill Cosby, Mr. Chappelle spoke by phone on Thursday about his contract with Netflix, his “Saturday Night Live” appearance and how the election of President Trump affects comedy. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You caught flack for walking away from a lucrative TV deal more than a decade ago. Now Netflix is reportedly paying you $60 million to air these two prerecorded   performances and create a   third one. It wasn’t like I made a deal and had to go out and do a lot. [Laughs] I just had to deliver the shows. And you’ll be releasing another   special for Netflix this year as part of the   deal.  Yeah. I’m working on that now. Not a bad deal. Do you have other unreleased shows still in the vault? I have hundreds of hours of   audio recording of shows I did after I quit my television show. And then I [taped] three specials  —   one in Chicago, one in Austin, and one in L. A. Oh, and I also recorded the Radio City shows. These specials showcase a comedian who is reinvigorated by   comedy. I could quit my show, and that’s one kind of difficulty. But quitting doing   would be another. I’m sure everybody gets to a point where they run out of [stuff] to say, and they’ve got to take a knee and recharge and be introspective and live their life. But it’s hard to not ever come back to. Guys might walk away from it and close the door, but they don’t lock it behind. Eddie Murphy always entertains the possibility of doing it again. Even though he doesn’t do it, I’m sure he thinks about it all the time. It’s just one of those things where you’ll do it for 10 years, and then you’ll think about it for the next 30.  Many of your contemporaries are still performing. It kind of reminds me of the ’90s: Chris [Rock] is back out there, I see Jerry [Seinfeld] around, I hear Jon Stewart is around again. All these people who are great comics that stopped doing  . It’s fun to see everybody back. It’s a good time for comedy in that respect. But the whole Trump thing makes it harder for comedians. How so?  He’s so skewed, it’s hard to find an angle that sounds fresh. If you talk about him, it’s almost like you’re part of the chorus and not a soloist. How do you view the dynamic between comedy and bringing truth to power? I think it’s interesting that people perceive us as having a sanctuary. Because I don’t. In fact, I think we’re almost disproportionately taken to task over what we say. “Chappelle’s Show” brought you a level of ubiquity few comedians ever achieve. A lot of times when you’re a famous dude, you don’t really feel like a person is actually looking at you. They’re looking at the phenomenon that you’ve become. Every once in a while, a person will engage with you, and you’ll be like, O. K. this person actually sees me. But I didn’t want the headache or the scrutiny. It was too much for me at that point. I felt like after I quit my show, the crowds could actually see me. The audience recalibrated with me. They listened to me again. And it was great. I started playing clubs again just because I enjoyed it. It was reaffirming a love for [ ]. It was important for me to do that. I needed that. I loved it. In the last few years, I’ve found an altitude I’m comfortable with. You famously parodied Prince on your TV show. How did you react when you learned of his passing?  It’s a hard thing to talk about. I looked up to him like everybody did. I didn’t know him that well, but the times that we hung out were fun and very memorable and often funny. He was very generous with his advice, and he was very generous with his access. He let me see some of his process. He fostered a community among artists. He used to have these parties where we would go over to his house, and there would be all these musicians that I admired, and they’d just do these jam sessions in the basement. Everybody at the party was playing something. I think when he died there was the icon dying, but then there was this pillar in the community of people dying. Take me through hosting “Saturday Night Live” last November in the immediate wake of the election. At a certain point [on election night] we were all in the writers’ room, and as the night went on, and Trump was picking up these Electoral [College] votes, everyone stopped writing. And then everyone was just staring at the TV. I saw people tear up sketches they were writing. They’d assumed Hillary was going to win. Now there was essentially no show on Saturday. It was like the wind got knocked out of the writers’ room. I was really worried. And yet you delivered a humorous, poignant monologue reflecting your equal parts hope and fear for the future. The best advice I got was from Louis C. K. I went to a comedy club Friday night [before the show] and saw him. And Louis told me: “[Forget] the rest of the show. The monologue is all that matters. ” I was stressed out all that day. But right before I went onstage, this calm just washed over me. Everything just felt right. As someone who idolized Bill Cosby as a child, it’s surprising you dedicate so much time in both specials to the rape allegations against him. The Bill Cosby thing was tough for me. I’m not saying that to detract from his alleged victims at all. But he was a hero of mine. Is there a mourning process involved? So many bad things happened to our heroes: Muhammad Ali had Parkinson’s Richard Pryor had M. S. Prince died too young. And Bill just looked like one of the guys who was going to get to the finish line and just die of old age. And this happened. Jesus Christ. It’s awful. How do you respond when critics put you in the same conversation as comedy greats like George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock? I appreciate it, but it’s not a useful thing. I don’t know what to do with that but just be humbled by it. You never feel like you’re better than your heroes. What does life look like moving forward?  I need time to think. I need to have experiences. I have to live in order to get onstage. When I’m sitting there staring into space, that’s the heavy lifting. I’m like everybody: Sometimes I’m wildly optimistic sometimes I feel doom and gloom. We all just keep moving.",0
11500,Bernie Sanders to Cut Hundreds of Staff Members and Focus on California - The New York Times,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.  —   Battered by four defeats in Tuesday night’s primaries, Bernie Sanders is planning to lay off hundreds of campaign staffers across the country and focus much of his remaining effort on winning the June 7 California primary. The Vermont senator revealed the changes a day after Hillary Clinton’s victories widened her delegate lead and left her all but certain to win  the Democratic presidential nomination. Despite the changes, Mr. Sanders said he would remain in the race through the party’s summer convention and stressed that he hoped to bring staff members back on board if his political fortunes improved. But political experts say the layoffs signal Mr. Sanders is beginning to accept that he will not be the Democratic nominee and is now focused on pulling the party toward a more progressive agenda. “We want to win as many delegates as we can, so we do not need workers now in states around the country,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “We don’t need people right now in Connecticut. That election is over. We don’t need them in Maryland. So what we are going to do is allocate our resources to the 14 contests that remain, and that means that we are going to be cutting back on staff. ” When asked how many people would be let go, Mr. Sanders did not give an exact number but did say, “It will be hundreds of staff members. ” “We have had a very large staff, which was designed to deal with 50 states in this country 40 of the states are now behind us,” he said “So we have had a great staff, great people. ” The development came a day after Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders’s senior campaign strategist, said in an interview that the senator would reassess his candidacy, looking into issues of staffing and messaging. The remarks set off something of a backlash within the Sanders campaign, as officials disputed Mr. Devine’s comments, saying that no such reassessment would take place. Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager told NBC News that there would be “no big pow wow. ” When asked about Mr. Devine’s remarks, the senator’s wife, Jane Sanders, pushed back in a MSNBC interview. “No, no. We assess on an everyday basis,” Ms. Sanders said. “Even if he had a string of wins, like eight in a row or he’s won states by landslide victories, nobody in the media and certainly not The New York Times has ever said he has a chance to win. ” Stu Loeser, who owns a media strategy firm and was a longtime spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said he had seen this sort of back and forth in campaigns involving Mr. Devine before. During Vice President Al Gore’s presidential campaign, Mr. Devine had a reputation as a strategist who would be upfront with the candidate. “Every elected official needs two kinds of loyalists close to them. One kind are the people who are with them no matter what, agree with them no matter what, and help them execute their vision,” Mr. Loeser said. “And the other is an adviser who is able to stand up and tell the candidate what he or she needs to hear regardless of whether the candidate wants to hear it. Tad Devine had that role with Gore in 2000. ” Mr. Sanders has started to talk more openly about the possibility of not winning the Democratic contest. During a rally in Indiana he talked not just of his path to victory but discussed what he might do if he lost. He stressed he was in the race to “win and become the Democratic nominee. ” But he also said if he did not succeed he would try to get as many delegates as possible and “put together the strongest progressive agenda any political party has ever seen. ” Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in a statement that the campaign would keep on staff more than 300 workers focused on the remaining contests. Mr. Loeser said Mr. Sanders’s comments showed that he was beginning to pivot his message, perhaps because people within the Sanders campaign are realizing that the senator would not be able to beat Mrs. Clinton. “By the math, it’s been impossible for Senator Sanders to catch up for quite some time,” Mr. Loeser said. “Now it looks like he’s finally looked down, realized there is no ground underneath him, and is starting his descent. ”",0

11502,Video by Wife of Keith Scott Shows Her Pleas to Police - The New York Times,"CHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   A cellphone video made by the wife of Keith Lamont Scott as he was fatally shot by the police here shows the moments before and after the episode, including the wife’s pleas to her husband to get out of his truck, and her pleas to the officers not to shoot him. But the video, which was given to The New York Times on Friday by lawyers for the family, does not include a view of the shooting itself. Nor does it answer the crucial question of whether Mr. Scott had a gun, as the police have maintained. This question and others surrounding the case have transformed Charlotte into the latest crisis in the divisive debate over police treatment of minorities. In the last several nights here, hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets demanding justice. Many have done so peacefully. Others have vandalized property and clashed with the police. One of the lawyers, Justin Bamberg, who is representing the family along with Eduardo Curry, said in an interview on Friday that the video did not prove whether the shooting was justified. Rather, he said, it offered “another vantage point” of the episode. He said he hoped the Police Department would release its own videos of the shooting, as protesters have demanded since Mr. Scott was killed on Tuesday. The video provided a vivid glimpse of the drama that played out as Mr. Scott’s wife of 20 years, Rakeyia, first pleaded for a safe outcome to her husband’s encounter with the police, and then was heard reacting in uncomprehending horror as he was shot to death. Mr. Scott, a father of seven, had parked his white Ford Explorer in a visitor’s space at the apartment complex where he lived, about a   south of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He often waited there, on a   stretch of Lexington Circle, for one of his children to return home from school. Officers of the   Police Department arrived in unmarked vehicles shortly before 4 p. m. to serve a warrant on another person. Ms. Scott left their apartment to bring Mr. Scott a cellphone charger, the lawyers said, when she saw the officers around him and began recording the scene on her phone. The Police Department has said that officers saw Mr. Scott, who was black, standing beside his S. U. V. holding a handgun, then saw him get into the vehicle. The video, which lasts 2 minutes 12 seconds, begins with shaking images of grass and the voice, apparently that of an officer, shouting, “Hands up!” Immediately, Ms. Scott said, “Don’t shoot him,” and began walking closer to the officers and Mr. Scott’s vehicle. “Don’t shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don’t shoot him. ” An officer can then be heard yelling: “Gun. Gun. Drop the gun. ” A police S. U. V. with lights flashing arrived, partly obscuring Ms. Scott’s view, and a uniformed officer got out. From that point, there are five officers, most of whom appeared to be wearing body armor over plain clothes, around Mr. Scott. “Don’t shoot him, don’t shoot him,” Ms. Scott pleaded, her voice becoming louder and more anxious. “He didn’t do anything. ” Officers continued to yell “drop the gun” or some variation of it  —   at least 12 times in 38 seconds. “He doesn’t have a gun,” Ms. Scott said. “He has a T. B. I. ”  —   an abbreviation for a traumatic brain injury the lawyers said Mr. Scott sustained in a motorcycle accident in November. “He’s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine. ” “Drop the gun,” an officer screamed again as Ms. Scott tried to explain her husband’s condition. The officer then said he needed to get a baton. “Keith don’t let them break the windows. Come on out the car,” Ms. Scott said, as the video showed an officer approaching Mr. Scott’s vehicle. “Drop the gun,” an officer shouted again. Ms. Scott yelled several times for her husband to “get out the car,” but on the video, he cannot be seen through the window of the S. U. V. “Keith, don’t do it,” Ms. Scott shouted, as the video showed her backing away and panning to the ground. Mr. Bamberg said that Ms. Scott was trying, in those statements, to “get him to stand still” after he got out of the car. It was only in the final moments before the shots  —   less than two seconds on the video  —   that the camera panned back and Mr. Scott could be seen, still unhurt. He was standing between the vehicles and officers, wearing bright aqua pants, a dark   and a white ball cap, his head turning from side to side. Neither of his hands  —   and what, if anything, he was holding  —   could be seen clearly. Friends and neighbors have raised the possibility that he was holding a book. The police claimed that he was holding a gun, and that a gun was recovered from the scene. But the police chief, Kerr Putney, has acknowledged that in police videos of the shootings, he could not see Mr. Scott’s hands. “The video does not give me absolute, definitive visual evidence that would confirm that a person is pointing a gun,” he said on Thursday. Fifty seconds into Ms. Scott’s video, four shots rang out. The Police Department has identified the officer who fired as Brentley Vinson, 26, who is black, and has been with the force since 2014. Ms. Scott seemed to flinch at the first gunshot, and the picture immediately left her husband. “Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him?” Ms. Scott shouted, her voice becoming louder each second. “Did you shoot him? He better not be [expletive] dead. ” She moved closer, and the video showed Mr. Scott lying face down on the pavement, his white sneakers pointed to the camera, with officers standing and kneeling around him. “I’m not going to come near you. I’m going to record, though,” Ms. Scott said. “I’m not coming near you. I’m going to record, though. He better be alive. ” Mr. Bamberg said of the video: “Right now, we don’t have enough facts to say whether this shooting was justified or unjustified. That’s what we’re trying to find out. ” The lawyers also brought attention to an object that they said could be seen on the ground near Mr. Scott after he was shot. They said the object seemed to appear in the video after the camera panned away briefly, in a place where no object was previously visible. The video had been widely viewed both online and on television by Friday afternoon. City and police officials did not respond to Ms. Scott’s video. But in a statement on Friday, Jennifer Roberts, the mayor of Charlotte, pressed the state’s Bureau of Investigation to speed up its efforts to release the police recordings. “I urge it to use every resource at its disposal to get this done, and release the information to the public as quickly as possible,” she said. Chief Putney arranged for Mr. Scott’s family members and their lawyers to privately view two police videos on Thursday. Beforehand, they had been uncertain whether the videos should be released to the public, Mr. Bamberg said, but after seeing them, they called for release of the recordings. While the family members differed with the police on some major points about the videos, they seemed to be in agreement with the police chief on one aspect. “It is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands,” they said in a statement. Mr. Bamberg and Mr. Curry also described the two police videos  —   one from a dashboard camera and the other from a body camera  —   that the police allowed the lawyers and family members to view. The   video, Mr. Bamberg said, provided few significant details of the shooting. But he said the dashboard video showed two officers taking up positions behind a pickup truck and yelling commands at Mr. Scott, who was inside his vehicle. The dashboard video, the lawyers said, appeared to show that the front window on the driver’s side was rolled up. The video, Mr. Bamberg said, then showed Mr. Scott stepping out of the vehicle, his hands down, with his right hand empty and “some type of object” in his left hand. “It’s impossible to make out what it is,” the lawyer said, noting that Mr. Scott was  . “He doesn’t make any dramatic movements,” Mr. Bamberg said. He also said Mr. Scott seemed “confused. ” In the video, Mr. Scott took a couple of steps forward “in a nonaggressive manner,” the lawyer said, and then a step back. Then shots were fired. According to court records, Mr. Scott, who was born in South Carolina, was charged in that state with a number of offenses including check fraud, aggravated assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Later, he moved to Texas, where he shot and wounded a man in San Antonio in 2002. He was convicted and sentenced, in 2005, to seven years in prison, and was released in 2011. His lawyer in the Texas shooting case, Gloria Yates Early, said Mr. Scott had claimed his family was being “stalked. ” “Allegedly, people were following them around with weapons, pointing them at their bodies,” Ms. Early said. “He carried a gun around and he admitted to shooting a guy. He alleged   of himself and his family. ” When asked on Friday if Ms. Scott knew whether her husband owned a gun at the time he was shot by the police, Mr. Curry replied, “Not that she knew of. ”",0
11503,BREAKING: Trump Just Set Washington ON FIRE With New Ruling that Has Lobbyists Terrified!! * LIBERTY WRITERS NEWS,"0 http://ydouthink.com/deforestation 
Donald Trump has finally done it! Less than a week after his presidential nomination, Trump has kept his word on “Draining the Swamp” in Washington DC with a new ruling that has lobbyists p*ssing all over themselves!! 
In a historic move never before seen by a US President, Trump declared that ALL officials working with his campaign, on his transition team, and in his cabinet will be BANNED from working as DC lobbyists for 5 years to prevent them from abusing their connections for self-gain! Image From Gawker 
Not only that, but ANYONE who wants to work for Trump is now required to immediately end ALL of their current connections to lobbying groups or be FIRED instantly. 
But the Donald was not done yet. To put icing on the cake, he has also moved to officially have the term lobbyist apply to ALL DC insiders working as “consultants” or “advisors” when in reality, “we all know they are lobbyists.” Video by CNN – Trump Drain the Swamp!! 
Of course, you know all the long-time Senators and lobbying groups are already freaking out. Mitch McConnel refused to acknowledge the ban when pressured by reporters while the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics tried to intimidate Trump by saying “This will have a chilling effect on his hiring, no doubt.” 
Uh, yeah. Now Donald Trump will have to hire people NOT trying to line their pockets with hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars. Sounds like a real loss to me…NOT!! 
If you are proud of President Trump for standing up against the DC lobbyists and career politicians, let him know by sharing this out to every person you know!! ",0
11504,"On a ‘Day Without Immigrants,’ Workers Show Their Presence by Staying Home - The New York Times","It first spread on social media, rippling through immigrant communities like the opposite of fear and rumor: a call to boycott. In the New York region and around the country, many cooks, carpenters, plumbers and grocery store owners decided to answer it and not work on Thursday as part of a national “day without immigrants” in protest of the Trump administration’s policies toward them. The protest called for immigrants, whether naturalized citizens or undocumented, to stay home from work or school, close their businesses and abstain from shopping. People planned for it in restaurant staff meetings, on construction sites and on commuter buses, but the movement spread mostly on Facebook and via WhatsApp, the messaging service. No national group organized the action. “It’s like the Arab Spring,” said Manuel Castro, the executive director of NICE, short for New Immigrant Community Empowerment, which works primarily with Hispanic immigrant day laborers in Jackson Heights, Queens. “Our members were coming to us, asking what the plan was. Frankly, it kind of came out of nowhere. ” But what began as a   movement quickly reached the highest levels of federal government. In Washington, the Pentagon warned its employees that a number of its food concessions, including Sbarro’s, Starbucks and Taco Bell, were closed because immigrant employees had stayed home and that they could expect longer lines at restaurants that were open. Restaurants, from San Francisco to Phoenix to Washington, D. C. were some of the most visible spots affected, with   chefs closing some of their eateries for the day in support. Rick Bayless, the Chicago chef and owner of the Frontera Grill, closed several of his restaurants and said he would give a portion of the revenue from the ones that remained open to an immigrant and refugee rights group. “What really makes our country great is the diversity we experience here,” Mr. Bayless said in an interview. “I can’t say enough about the lack of respect and the   and   that I’m sensing around us these days. ” Some people felt that the support of immigrants who are undocumented was wrongheaded. “Of course, nobody wants to do without immigrants  —   they are what made America,” Sarah Crysl Akhtar, 67, a writer in Lebanon, N. H. said in a telephone interview. “But there is a difference between legal immigrants and illegal aliens. ” The latter, she said, “bring down the quality of life for everyone. ” Some schools and   centers across the country experienced a drop in attendance. At KIPP Austin Comunidad, a   charter school in Austin, Tex. one teacher posted on Twitter that only seven of her 26 students came to school on Thursday. “Some of our school buses were coming to school with two and four children on them,” said Sarah Gonzales, a   bilingual teacher at the school. “Nothing like this has ever happened before. ” By the end of the day, the KIPP Austin Public Schools network executive director, Steven Epstein, said only 60 percent of students attended its 10 schools with 5, 000 students. Usually the attendance rate is 98 percent or above. At Siler City Elementary School in rural North Carolina, where 65 percent of the school population is Hispanic, 263 of the 662 students were absent on Thursday. Just 18 were absent on Wednesday, said John McCann, a spokesman for the county school district. Still, cities did not grind to a halt, and for most people, the action registered as an inconvenience  —   a longer wait for lunch, a favorite restaurant closed, a bus driver who wasn’t there. In the Hasidic neighborhood of Borough Park, Brooklyn, some customers noticed the absence of the usual Latino immigrant employees at their local stores. “I thought, ‘Oy, my coffee will not be as good as any day,’ but I felt, ‘Good for them, they are standing up for their rights,” said Rabbi Joel Labin, 34, a writer and activist who shopped at Center Fresh market. “We grew up with these stories. I hear from my grandparents the issue of immigration from Europe. I feel like it’s kind of my story, too. ” Mexican workers participated in large numbers in New York. In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, most bakeries and taquerias were closed, and a public library was crowded with parents and children they kept home from school. But the action was not limited to Hispanic immigrants: On several blocks in Midwood, Brooklyn, virtually all stores were shuttered on Thursday as part of a protest planned by Pakistani shop owners. There, an auto repair shop on Coney Island Avenue posted a handmade sign on its   metal shutter: “We Are Immigrants. ” The driver of a discount shuttle bus outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Sam Ahmad, originally from Egypt, said on Wednesday night that he was not going to work on Thursday and many members of his mosque in New Jersey would not, either. Asked why, Mr. Ahmad, 57, said, “Because that crazy guy,” he said, referring to President Trump. “Because I’m Muslim and I got a lot of family here. They can get separated, and it’s not right. Our children are born here and grow up here. ” In downtown Newark, a   gathering outside the stately Essex County Hall of Records started with only a couple dozen protesters and turned into a spirited event when students from nearby Science Park High School charged in with signs, banners and chants. “We are loud, we are clear, immigrants are welcome here,” they said, drawing honks from cheering passing motorists. Gina Alvarado, one of the students, said the plan to ditch school for the rally had spread spontaneously Thursday morning via social media, texts and   . In Manhattan, the flower district, mostly concentrated on West 28th Street, was as quiet as the wholesale jewelry and garment district around it. At one point, two construction workers from a nearby site took a coffee and cigarette break. “Half the job didn’t come in,” said Joe Burns, 32. “About 10 people, Spanish guys,” he added. “We’ve got to labor for ourselves today. ” It did seem that in New York, at least, pockets of the nonunion construction industry were shut down. A    carpenter from Cuenca, Ecuador, who gave only his first name, Santiago, said in Spanish that at his construction site in Astoria, Queens, a supervisor asked on Wednesday whether workers were coming the next day. They were not, the workers told him. About 500 people from several companies were employed at the site, Santiago said, including carpenters, electricians and plumbers. The Davis Museum at Wellesley College took an innovative approach to the protest. It removed or cloaked 120 works of art that had either been created by an immigrant or donated by an immigrant  —   about 20 percent of the museum’s display. With entire galleries shrouded in black felt and placards replacing paintings, the director of the museum, Lisa Fischman said, “I’ve been calling it an intervention, because it takes what we have and reframes it. ” The protest seemed to get less traction in downtown Boston, with a few restaurants and stores closing. Still, a number of places posted supportive messages on social media, such as one from Eataly Boston, the Italian marketplace, which showed a picture of pasta, olive oil, wine, coffee beans and other goods with the headline: “We were all imported. ”",0
11505,Cause of Severe Injury at Pipeline Protest Becomes New Point of Dispute - The New York Times,"Sophia Wilansky, 21, who grew up in the Bronx, rested in a Minneapolis hospital bed, her father by her side, recovering from surgery to try to save her left hand and arm after an explosion at a pipeline protest in North Dakota this week. “From an inch below the elbow, to an inch above her wrist, the muscle is blown off,” her father, Wayne Wilansky, said from the hospital, Hennepin County Medical Center. “The radius bone, a significant amount of it, is blown away. The arteries inside her arm are blown away. The median nerve is mostly blown away. ” As many as 20 operations lie ahead, Mr. Wilansky said, and it was unclear whether she would keep the arm. Her injury is the most serious to have been reported during months of increasingly acrimonious conflict over the   Dakota Access Pipeline, which Native American tribes, led by the Standing Rock Sioux, fear would pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds. The project was delayed in September when the Obama administration temporarily blocked it from crossing under the Missouri River. And this month, President Obama called on both sides to show restraint and revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternative route for the project. But Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press last week that it would not consider a different route. On Wednesday, Gov. Jack Dalrymple, Senator John Hoeven and Representative Kevin Cramer, all North Dakota Republicans, urged Mr. Obama to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to allow construction to resume. All the while, the protests have gone on, and the polarization between the police and protesters extended to their sharply differing explanations of how Ms. Wilansky was injured early Monday. Law enforcement accounts suggest that fellow protesters caused the explosion the demonstrators insist the police are to blame. The clash that led to Ms. Wilansky’s injury began Sunday night when protesters with homemade wood and plastic shields tried to dismantle obstacles, including burned vehicles and concrete barriers, and push past a   bridge to the pipeline construction site. They were turned back by officers using water hoses several protesters were treated for hypothermia. Mr. Wilansky, who spoke by telephone and checked details with his daughter as he did, said the explosion had taken place around 4 a. m. Monday, when most of the protesters were gathered around a bonfire near the foot of the bridge. His daughter and a handful of others were farther up on the bridge, he said, “playing around,” using pieces of plastic and wood as sleds to skid across icy sections of the highway, when an officer began firing foam or plastic bullets at her and another person. “She was backing away as they were shooting her,” Mr. Wilansky said, adding that someone from the police lines then threw a device, which he called a grenade, that hit her in the forearm and exploded. Lt. Tom Iverson of the North Dakota Highway Patrol offered a different version of the episode, which he said was being investigated by the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Around the time of the explosion, Lieutenant Iverson said, officers fired sponge and beanbag rounds at three people who had shielded themselves behind a length of plywood near a burned vehicle on the bridge. The three were thought to be acting suspiciously and refused orders to emerge, he said. Officers saw someone roll metal cylinders to the protesters by the burned vehicle, Lieutenant Iverson said, and then heard an explosion. Afterward, he said, several protesters ran up, pulled a woman from under the vehicle and ran off. Three propane canisters were recovered from the vicinity of the explosion early Tuesday, he said. Lieutenant Iverson said that officers did not use concussion or flash grenades at any time. Instead, officers used tear gas, pepper spray canisters and what are known as stinger balls, round grenadelike objects that spread tiny rubber pellets to try to disperse protesters, he said. Mr. Wilansky said that doctors in Minnesota had removed fragments from his daughter’s arm that he hoped could be used to find out what caused the injury and to hold someone responsible. Ms. Wilansky headed to North Dakota around the beginning of November, bringing a subzero sleeping bag and planning to stay through the winter with the protesters, who call themselves “water protectors. ” Friends said they were not surprised that Ms. Wilansky would gravitate to the North Dakota protest. She had also protested the construction by Spectra Energy of a natural gas pipeline in New York. In June, she locked herself to an excavator at a natural gas pipeline dig in Vermont. About three weeks later, she was arrested in Massachusetts after lying down in a trench dug for the West Roxbury Lateral pipeline. “Every time I talked with her she was doing something new, going to a rally,” said Rebecca Berlin, 23, from Yorktown Heights, N. Y. “She was really plugged in, really passionate. ”",0
11506,Women Employees Line Up To Kiss Chinese Boss,"  Edmondo Burr in Weird // 0 Comments A male Chinese boss has come under fire for ordering his female workers to perform a daily kissing ritual. 
The female workers of a Beijing company are forced to line up every morning and give their boss a kiss. 
The creepy Chinese boss forces his female employees to kiss him every morning, claiming that it fosters good relationships among colleagues. 
Daily Trends reports: 
Women working at a company that sells home brewery machinery, in Tongzhou District, Beijing, are required to line up between 9:00 and 9:30 each morning to kiss their boss. And we’re not talking about a little, innocent smooch on the cheek, although that would be pretty weird as well, but a kiss on the lips. China Press reports that while the women were initially reluctant to accept the bizarre daily ritual, they eventually gave in to the boss’ demands in order to keep their jobs. Only two of the company’s female workers refused to kiss their boss on the mouth and chose to resign instead. According to Chinese media reports, over half the unnamed company’s staff members are women. 
Facing increasing pressure from both the media and the general public, the boss explained that he picked up the idea for the daily morning kiss while visiting a company in the United States, and claimed that the disgusting daily ceremony helps “foster good relationships among colleagues”, allowing him and his female staff to get along “like fish and water”. Not only that, but he says that some of his women worker genuinely miss him when he is away, and send him messages on WeChat. 
Needless to say that the boss’ explanation didn’t really satisfy the millions of social media users outraged by the viral video of him kissing his female staff. 
“How can these female workers accept this? Do their boyfriends or husbands know?” one person commented on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “I want to ask these female workers: Do you have no money? Would you starve if you changed jobs?” another added. 
And while all of them condemned the man for his sleazy rule, some said that the women carried some of the blame as well, just for putting up with the situation. “The boss is a perv, but the workers are foolish,” someone wrote.",0
11507,‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’ Sets Olivier Awards Record - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   The   “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” shattered records at the Olivier Awards for London theater here on Sunday night, picking up nine prizes, including best new play, and honors for the actors playing Harry, Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy’s son, Scorpius. The previous   were “Matilda the Musical” and “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the ” both hits in London before opening on Broadway. Those shows each won seven Oliviers, which are Britain’s equivalent of the Tony Awards. Jamie Parker took best actor for his portrayal of Harry, while Noma Dumezweni won supporting actress honors as Hermione and Anthony Boyle supporting actor honors as Scorpius. “Harry Potter” also won for best director (the Tony winner John Tiffany) and for its lighting, sound, costumes and set design. The production had tied the record for the most nominations for any show in Oliviers history, with 11. Other winners on Sunday included “Groundhog Day,” which won best new musical and best actor, for Andy Karl “Jesus Christ Superstar,” which won for best musical revival and “Yerma,” which picked up the prize for best play revival and best actress, for Billie Piper’s performance. “Harry Potter,” a   play that audiences can watch over two days or in a single, marathon day, takes place about two decades after Harry’s years at Hogwarts, as a   Harry ships off his son Albus for his first year at the wizarding academy. J. K. Rowling wrote the story for the play with its playwright, Jack Thorne, and Mr. Tiffany. In going    the show missed only in the categories of theater choreographer, which Matthew Bourne won for his stage adaptation of “The Red Shoes,” and outstanding achievement in music, which it lost to the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical “School of Rock. ” In his acceptance speech, Mr. Bourne apologized to “Harry Potter” fans, apparently referring to the fact that he had broken the show’s winning streak. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is running in London and is expected to open at the Lyric Theater on Broadway in the spring of 2018. No casting has been announced. “Groundhog Day” is in preview performances on Broadway.",0
11508,Why Polls Fail,"November 13, 2016 Why Polls Fail 
Today I discussed the U.S. election with a friend who studied and practices statistics. I asked about the failure of the polls in this years presidential election. Her explanation: The polls are looking at future events but are biased by the past. The various companies and institutions adjust the polls they do by looking at their past prognoses and the real results of the past event. They then develop correcting factors, measured from the past, and apply it to new polls. If that correcting factor is wrong, possibly because of structural changes in the electorate, then the new polls will be corrected with a wrong factor and thus miss the real results. 
Polls predicting the last presidential election were probably off by 3 or 5 points towards the Republican side. The pollsters then corrected the new polls for the Clinton-Trump race in favor of the Democratic side by giving that side an additional 3-5 points. They thereby corrected the new polls by the bias that was poll inherent during the last race. 
But structural changes, which we seem to have had during this election, messed up the result. Many people who usually vote for the Democratic ticket did not vote for Clinton. The ""not Clinton"" progressives, the ""bernie bros"" and ""deplorables"" who voted Obama in the last election stayed home, voted for a third party candidate or even for Trump. The pollsters did not anticipate such a deep change. Thus their correction factor was wrong. Thus the Clinton side turned out to be favored in polls but not in the relevant votes. 
Real polling, which requires in depth-in person interviews with the participants, does not really happen anymore. It is simply to expensive. Polling today is largely done by telephone with participants selected by some database algorithm. It is skewed by many factors which require many corrections. All these corrections have some biases that do miss structural changes in the underlying population. 
The Clinton camp, the media and the pollsters missed what we had anticipated as ""not Clinton"". A basic setting in a part of the ""left"" electorate that remember who she is and what she has done and would under no circumstances vote for her. Clinton herself pushed the ""bernie bros"" and ""deplorables"" into that camp. This was a structural change that was solely based in the personality of the candidate. 
If Sanders would have been the candidate the now wrong poll correction factor in favor of Democrats would likely have been a correct one. The deep antipathy against Hillary Clinton in a decisive part of the electorate was a factor that the pseudo-science of cheap telephone polls could not catch. More expensive in depth interviews of the base population used by a pollster would probably have caught this factor and adjusted appropriately. 
There were some twenty to thirty different entities doing polls during this election cycle. Five to ten polling entities, with better budgets and preparations, would probably have led to better prognoses. Some media companies could probably join their poll budgets, split over multiple companies today, to have a common one with a better analysis of its base population.One that would have anticipated ""not Hillary"". 
Unless that happens all polls will have to be read with a lot of doubt. What past bias is captured in these predictions of the future? What are their structural assumptions and are these still correct? What structural change might have happened? 
Even then polls and their interpretation will always only capture a part of the story. Often a sound grasp of human and cultural behavior will allow for better prediction as all polls. As my friend the statistician say: ""The best prognostic instrument I have even today is my gut.""   13, 2016 at 03:17 PM | Permalink",0
11509,Meet CoverGirl’s New Cover Boy - The New York Times,"Beauty contracts have long been a brass ring for celebrities: acknowledgment of their rising profiles that also provides additional income and the chance to tap wider audiences. So what does it mean that CoverGirl’s latest face (joining the ranks of Zendaya, Katy Perry, Pink and more) is   …     a boy? And a noncelebrity boy at that? He is James Charles, 17, a high school senior from Bethlehem, N. Y. who lives with his parents and a younger brother and does makeup for friends in his spare time (at no charge). In the past year or so, Mr. Charles has amassed nearly 650, 000 followers on his Instagram account and more than 90, 000 subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he posts tutorials for creating fake freckles or layering chunky glitter around the eyes. He gained attention last month when he posted to social media about retaking his senior photos because he didn’t like how the highlighter on his cheekbones looked in the originals. For the second set, Mr. Charles brought his own ring light. His post spread on Twitter, garnering a comment and repost from the singer Zendaya, who wrote, “You win. ” The selection of Mr. James by CoverGirl comes amid a broader questioning of traditional gender boundaries in fashion and beauty, and the growth of a crop of   beauty junkies who have built followings through social media. On the more traditional celebrity end, there’s Jaden Smith and his unceasing effort to make skirts mainstream for men: The musician and actor, son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, appeared in Louis Vuitton’s women’s wear campaign last January, donned a shift dress for prom and is generally a fan of “super drapey things,” he told GQ. There’s also the rapper Young Thug, who made waves in August when he released the cover art for his album “No, My Name Is Jeffery,” featuring him in a tiered froufrou dress that recalled both Japanese kimonos and the antebellum South. Before then, he’d worn dresses for a Calvin Klein campaign (“There’s no such thing as gender,” he said in the ad) and for Dazed magazine. Within fashion, designers such as Alessandro Michele of Gucci, J W Anderson, Demna Gvasalia of Balenciaga, and Shayne Oliver of Hood by Air have all become known for testing notions about gender dressing. And in beauty, a group of young men have made their way into the industry through a   entrepreneurial effort entrenched in YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. With devoted followings, they have carved out a space to experiment and expand the notion of being male. From these intersecting forces comes Mr. Charles. Despite his newfound fame, he is spending a lot of his time figuring out where to apply for college. Still, he did find a few minutes to discuss his new role, online bullying and why what he does is different from drag. This interview has been edited and condensed. What was it like when you found out about your new gig?  I screamed and started to cry. It’s all been so ridiculous and crazy and fast. I’ve barely gotten any sleep, but I’m  . K. with it. What was it like to work with Katy Perry? It was the coolest surprise ever. She was so kind. We were posing for pictures together, and we were hugging each other, and she said: “I can feel you shaking. I’m just as nervous as you are. ” To hear that someone at her level was just as nervous for a shoot as me calmed my nerves and put me in a place of “Oh, I can actually do this. ” What can you bring to CoverGirl as a boy?  I love to do glam. But I also love a lot of creative,     stuff. The fact that I am the first boy is so cool. It shows that this industry is actually becoming genderless, and we’re really making the push toward equal opportunities for everybody, regardless of race, sexuality, gender. I think it’s a huge steppingstone for such a big and iconic company. Hopefully other people will see this, and when they think, “Oh, this random    kid just started doing makeup recently and is now the face of CoverGirl,” I hope that inspires them to really be themselves and feel comfortable and wear makeup and express themselves in a manner they haven’t been comfortable doing before. Do you think a lot of boys want to try makeup?  Absolutely. Oh, my gosh. I see new guys on my Instagram feed every single day rocking amazing makeup looks and crazy     stuff. It’s a growing industry, and the population of boys in the industry is growing as well. As more and more guys come to light, the way the internet is, there will be people who don’t agree. Those negative comments probably make people not want to do it, because lots of people take that stuff very seriously, which is totally understandable. Online bullying has been a huge problem forever. Men in makeup is becoming more widely accepted. But it’s going to take so much more   to have it be a common thing. How do you deal with negative online comments? My followers are some of the most loyal people out there. They know everything about me and my life. They know all my drama with guys that I have crushes on, all that stupid stuff that doesn’t really matter. But all that stuff allows me to build a close relationship with them. So even though I get hate comments every once in a while, it doesn’t affect me, because I have so many more people who are supporting me and loving me for who I am. If somebody doesn’t like me behind the keyboard, oh, well. Everybody has the right to their own opinion. I’ll just continue to do me. Have you ever responded to people who are critical? Not really. It’s kind of a waste of my time. I have to focus on me and on school and my friends and family. In the past, the only ones I have replied to are the ones that questioned my character. I don’t care if someone makes fun of me, but if someone calls me a mean person or something, I reply. If you don’t like me in makeup, that’s O. K. But I would like people to like me as a person. What do you think of where we are as a country on gay rights and gender identity? The place we’re in is phenomenal compared to where we were a few years ago. We’ve made so many amazing progressions with gay rights, gender inclusivity and  . But I think we still have so, so much longer to go. A lot of people still don’t support or understand it. Gay marriage laws were passed recently. Now with people on social media and boys in makeup, we’re becoming more accepting in general. We have a lot longer to go. All of our biggest issues have taken a long time. What compelled you to try makeup? Before I did makeup, I did hair. For one of my best friends, I did her hair for a military ball at a local school, and she was an hour late for her makeup appointment at a local counter, and she asked me to do her makeup. I’d been watching makeup tutorials for years and years, but I’d never actually done it. And I was, like: “Girl, I will do your makeup. But if you look awful, I’m not taking credit for it. ” She was, like, “O. K. we’ll do it because I have no other option. ” And she ended up looking absolutely stunning. I wanted to continue. I bought a starter set online. I did my friends’ makeup for fun, not charging them anything. Then I started charging $5 or $10. And then I’d take that money to buy new brushes or new equipment. After about three months, I made my Instagram page. And here we are, one year later. Were you experimenting on yourself before creating your Instagram? I mostly did my friends’ makeup. I did drag makeup on myself twice, just to see what it was, because I’ve always been a fan of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and drag in general. It looked absolutely horrible. I have the pictures in a locked folder on my phone. They will never, ever be released anywhere. Speaking of drag, how is what you do different? They are really similar in expressing yourself and releasing your creative juices. But boys in makeup are boys in makeup. When you’re a drag performer, you’re a boy in makeup performing as a female. Drag is performance artistry. What look are you dying to try?  I have a bunch of really cool Halloween tutorials planned. I have a huge list. I need to make sure they’re totally appropriate and everybody can enjoy them. Halloween is always a touchy subject. But other than that, I don’t really plan my looks ahead of time. I’ll do my base makeup, and then I’ll just start throwing some colors on there and ask, “What can I create now?” What’s your best makeup tip? Highlighting is a huge trend right now. If you really want your highlights to pop  —   which is obviously what the goal is, duh  —   when you’re applying your highlighter, spritz your brush with water before you dip it into your highlighter. It will be   and magnetic. You will be blinding people left and right.",0
11511,Limbaugh on Trump’s Shots at Freedom Caucus: These Guys Are Not the Enemy - Dems Are the Enemy - Breitbart,"Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh reacted to President Donald Trump’s tweets aimed at the House Freedom Caucus, which is considered by many to be what kept the American Health Care Act, House GOP leadership’s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, from passing the House.  If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts  reform.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017,  Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador? #RepealANDReplace #Obamacare,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017,  Limbaugh mentioned a Politico story describing the House Freedom Caucus leadership as “ringleaders” before saying there was a better way to handle the House Freedom Caucus than calling them out on Twitter. “Now, to this health care business. As I mentioned earlier today, the president has doubled down on the Freedom Caucus, the 30 or so members of the conservative members of the House of Representatives, The Politico and such others in their headline are referring to the three Freedom Caucus leaders as the ringleaders, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Raul Labrador. The ringleaders? What do you associate ringleaders with? Ringleaders  —   crime, gangs,” he said. “Exactly right. Bank robbers. The ringleaders of the group were hiding in the getaway car parked one block down the street. ” “So now these guys are being characterized as ringleaders of some gang, some    gang in the House, and Trump has doubled down on it,” Limbaugh continued. “Look, folks, calling them out like this, I know it’s Trump’s technique I know it’s Trump’s method. But there’s a better way of doing this. These guys are not the enemy. The Democrats are the enemy. The Freedom Caucus has actually made a pretty big move here. ” Limbaugh went on to cite a Washington Examiner editorial calling the Freedom Caucus’ conditions reasonable and urging the White House, House Speaker Paul Ryan and congressional GOP centrists to accept those conditions. “That’s the problem with the first effort: It didn’t kill the law,” Limbaugh said. “It sustained much of it and then put in the hands of the secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, the responsibility of removing a bunch of things from it. And the Freedom Caucus said, ‘We’re not really getting rid of it, if we’re just letting the secretary remove it and nothing else happens, then the next time the Democrats win they can put those things back in. We need to take them out by statute. ’” “But it’s clear that the objective here was to get a win,” he added. “The objective was to really knock it out of the park in the first two months, fulfill a campaign promise, say that Obamacare had been repealed and the replace effort was underway, first phase of three. But the ringleaders of the Conservative Caucus were suspicious that this was not gonna end Obamacare, and they had campaigned promising to do so. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
11512,Hillary Turns Her Back on Standing Rock Sioux: ‘Path Forward Must Serve Broadest Public Interest’,"Home / Be The Change / Hillary Turns Her Back on Standing Rock Sioux: ‘Path Forward Must Serve Broadest Public Interest’ Hillary Turns Her Back on Standing Rock Sioux: ‘Path Forward Must Serve Broadest Public Interest’ Jay Syrmopoulos October 29, 2016 Leave a comment 
Brooklyn, NY – With tensions escalating rapidly after the militarized police action at the Standing Rock Sioux “Treaty Camp,” which included the use of armored police tanks, attack dogs, batons, rubber bullets, high-velocity bean bags, tear gas and LRAD sound weapons, and that saw the arrest of over 100 water protectors, the Clinton campaign, after months of silence, could no longer sit quietly on the sidelines and released a statement about the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) one day after the violent assault. 
The statement from the Clinton campaign director of coalitions press, Xochitl Hinojosa, who oversees Hispanic, black, and women’s media for the Clinton campaign, reads in full: 
We received a letter today from representatives of the tribes protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. From the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects. Now, all of the parties involved—including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes—need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens, it’s important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators’ rights to protest peacefully, and workers’ rights to do their jobs safely. 
On the same day the militarized action in North Dakota took place, Native youth from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes — tired of the damning silence from Hillary Clinton — demonstrated outside of Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. 
A number of brave Lakota youth and their Lenape relatives erected a teepee and prayed in the lobby of Clinton’s Brooklyn office as a militarized police force evicted water protectors from their traditional Treaty Lands in North Dakota. They were there to deliver a letter to Clinton about the pipeline. 
A 14 –year-old girl from Standing Rock attempted to deliver a letter to Hillary Clinton’s Brooklyn campaign HQ to ask her to take a stand on the Dakota Access Pipeline. The youth stood at the front desk in tears asking for someone to please come down to accept the letter. The guards completely ignored the young girl, and the Clinton campaign refused to show enough respect to send a campaign staffer to cordially accept the letter. 
Just after this dozens of police arrived and ordered us to disperse or we would be arrested. 
“ What a crock,” said Ruth Hopkins, a Dakota-Lakota Sioux writer for Indian Country Today Media Network. 
“Hillary Clinton managed to make a statement about the Dakota Pipeline that literally says nothing. Literally,” 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben tweeted in response to the Clinton campaign statement. 
“Kind of a BS statement by the Clinton camp on #NoDAPL, frankly,” wrote MSNBC host Joy Reid. “The outrage taking place out there cries out for outrage.” 
Or as Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting journalist Adam Johnson put it, this “is the most Clinton thing of all times.” 
This curiously appears to be another case of Clinton having a “public and private position,” as revealed in her leaked speeches to Wall St. banks, the primary drivers behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The fact is that Clinton has completely turned her back on the Standing Rock Sioux. Her statement was essentially a non-statement, which speaks volumes as to who she is truly beholden too… and it isn’t the American public. The words “find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest” can be directly translated into “this pipeline is good for Merica, and we don’t care about Native issues… but we’ll pretend we do until I’m elected.” 
Please share this story if you believe Clinton’s statement is a blatant disrespect to all Native peoples! Share",0
11513,"Twinkle, Twinkle Little [Insert Name Here] - The New York Times","Which branch of science has the worst trouble with names? You might think it’s physics, which has bestowed   names like quarks, neutrinos, selectrons and bosons on the most elemental constituents of nature. But in astronomy the confusion can be, well, cosmic. Where would we be without the North Star, also known as Polaris, Alpha Ursae Minoris, HD 8890 and a host of other names, including (in Inuit) Niiqirtsuituq? The stars are our oldest promise of order in the universe and the most profound symbols of our possible destiny. But only a relative handful of the billions of twinkling lights in the sky have names, misspelled and mistranslated as they have been handed down through the ages in a variety of cultures, recognizable to the average adult who probably lives in a city and can’t see many of the stars anyway. Still more stars have designations using Greek letters to rank them by brightness within their constellations, but constellations have arbitrary and shifting boundaries, and are   anyway. All stars do have numbers. In fact, many have more than one number, corresponding to their listings in the voluminous catalogs that have been compiled over the century by astronomers. The PPMXL catalog, combining data from the United States Naval Observatory and the University of Massachusetts, lists the positions and motions of some 900 million stars. This makes for awkward moments when modern astrophysics vaults one of these previously anonymous stars into the limelight, because it is exploding weirdly or turns out to harbor possibly habitable planets. Such dramatic destinations as HR 8799  HD 85512 and Gliese 581 don’t exactly trip off the tongue. Now, however, the International Astronomical Union, an organization of stargazers, is coming to the rescue. In November, it published what it calls “the first set” of approved names for 227 stars. The I. A. U. has traditionally concerned itself with policing the names of asteroids, craters and comets, and famously demoting Pluto from   status 10 years ago. It is also worth reminding readers here that the I. A. U. ’s hegemony is absolute and cosmic no amount of money donated to a registry or anywhere else will get your name officially on a star. Never mind the engraved certificate that comes along with it. The problem of star names came up in 2015 when the astronomical union ran a contest to name some of the new planets that were being discovered in droves around other stars by NASA’s Kepler spacecraft and   astronomers. The game included names for the stars around which those new worlds were orbiting. It turned out that some already had names, albeit not ones that were well known, even to the professionals: Edasich, for example, an orange star in Draco, the Dragon, whose name derives from an Arabic term for “male hyena. ” Or Ain, Arabic for “eye,” an orange giant star in Taurus, the bull. Should they overwrite these names by popular vote or give them new life? The committee opted for tradition. The result was the formation of a new I. A. U. committee, the Working Group on Star Names. Eric Mamajek of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the chairman of the group, said its main priorities so far have been collecting star names from the scientific literature and astronomical cultures around the world. The new list is the first fruit of their efforts. How far it goes will depend on how interested the international community is in having a mechanism for naming interesting objects, Dr. Mamajek said, noting that planetary astronomers have had committees for naming craters, asteroids and such for decades “with only minor hiccups. ” “The alternative is chaos,” he added. The first list contains the most   stars, and their inclusion will prevent the names from being used for something else, like an asteroid or an exoplanet, Dr. Mamajek said. Their names go back as far as the Arab astronomer Abd     in the 10th century, but the words have been Latinized and misspelled over the years. Dr. Mamajek said he had found 30 versions of the star Fomalhaut in astronomical literature. Sirius, the brightest star of all to the eye, just now making its presence known in the winter sky, also goes by the names of the Dog Star, Aschere, Canicula, Al Shira, Sothis, Alhabor, Mrgavyadha, Lubdhaka and Tenrōsei, as well as Alpha Canis Majoris, after its constellation, Canis Major, the big dog. Not all the names on the new list are so familiar. I never knew there was a star named Musica. Or Mimosa, the second brightest star in the Southern Cross, or Crux. Just saying the name made me want to drink one, settle into a hammock and gaze up at the constellation. I would love to find out someday that somebody or something lives there, calling those blissful sounding rays home.",0
11514,Voting Machine SHOCKER: Video Proof Election Is RIGGED!,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News , US // 1 Comment 
The Clinton campaign have found a way to rig voting machines in order to commit election fraud, and America is completely clueless. 
Dominion Voting Systems, the biggest voting machine owner in the United States, has been Exposed donating to the Clinton Foundation, and has close ties to George Soros. 
In 2010 Dominion Voting Machines bought out the right to own the machines in 600 jurisdictions across 22 different states, according to Wikipedia. 
The same company, Dominion Voting, has also been exposed donating enough money to the Clinton Foundation to make it to their online donor list. 
Is it any wonder voters have already started reporting that some machines are flipping their votes? 
How blatant is that! Just take a look at the Clinton Foundation’s website itself. 
Wow. That is just such a strange coincidence, don’t you think? Right around the same time Hillary Clinton was deciding to retire as Secretary of State and focus on her campaign, this company bought out half the voting machines in the country. 
And if that is not bad enough, one of the top owners of Dominion Voting is none other than the king of corruption himself, George Soros. 
But it gets even worse. 
Dominion Voting Systems and The Clinton Foundation did a 2.25 million dollar charity initiative in developing nations together called the DELIAN Project. 
According to the project’s own website : 
“ In 2014, Dominion Voting committed to providing emerging and post-conflict democracies with access to voting technology through its philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, as many emerging democracies suffer from post-electoral violence due to the delay in the publishing of election results. Over the next three years, Dominion Voting will support election technology pilots with donated Automated Voting Machines (AVM), providing an improved electoral process, and therefore safer elections.” 
This presents a very troubling conflict of interest. Most Americans would certainly agree that voting machines should have zero connection to presidential candidates and their foundations. 
As we previously reported , the Democratic primaries were essentially rigged. So why wouldn’t the general U.S. election potentially be manipulated in favor of the elite’s preferred candidate? 
If you think this is as important of information as I do, then share this out immediately. Time is of the essence.",0

11517,10 Key Moments From Thursday’s Trump Nominee Hearings - The New York Times,"On the third day of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, there was one emerging theme: Many of the nominees of   Donald J. Trump have disagreements with him on policy. There were serious questions, efforts at diversion with humor, and   statements by senators. Overall, though, none of the nominees made any major mistakes, and one of them, James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, was approved as Mr. Trump’s choice for defense secretary by the Senate Armed Services Committee, 24 to 3. Fun fact: He doesn’t care for the nickname “Mad Dog. ” ■ Mr. Mattis diverged sharply from his prospective boss on Russia, calling Moscow one of the top threats to the   world order. “I’m all for engagement,” Mr. Mattis said, “but we also have to recognize reality in terms of what Russia is up to. ” ■ Mr. Mattis also put daylight between himself and Mr. Trump on NATO and indicated strong support for the alliance’s principle of collective defense. “My view is that nations with allies thrive, and nations without allies don’t,” Mr. Mattis said. ■ Mr. Mattis said he supported the Iran nuclear agreement, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized. ■ And finally, he said that he had no intention of revisiting the Obama administration’s decisions on social issues at the Defense Department, like the opening of combat roles to women. ■ Representative Mike Pompeo, the Kansas Republican who is Mr. Trump’s nominee for director of the C. I. A. said the agency would pursue information about efforts by Russia to interfere with the American election, including any possible links to the Trump campaign. “I promise I will pursue the facts wherever they take us,” he said. ■ In a reversal, Mr. Pompeo said emphatically that he would not endorse torture, including coercive methods like waterboarding. Mr. Pompeo had previously said he did not believe waterboarding was torture, and that it was legal. ■ Mr. Pompeo signaled that he agreed with the assessment of United States intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to promote Mr. Trump’s candidacy and to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, describing the report that was delivered last week to Mr. Trump and President Obama as “sound. ” ■ Ben Carson’s confirmation hearing for secretary of housing and urban development was not attended by Mr. Trump. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, directed biting comments at the  . Ms. Warren, while accusing Mr. Trump of hiding his assets, repeatedly asked Mr. Carson if he would commit to keeping taxpayers’ dollars away from Trump businesses. ■ Mr. Carson successfully parried questions about whether someone who had gained acclaim as neurosurgeon was qualified to oversee the vast federal housing agency. Though he has no background in housing, he avoided any major stumbles. ■ Democrats seemed to take it a bit easy on Mr. Carson, with some talking about his young granddaughter attending and others questioning him without being too adversarial.",0
11518,Democrats Stuffing Absentee Ballots With Campaign Literature – For Democrats,"Pinterest 
Democrats have been caught stuffing absentee ballots with campaign material, in what must be a direct violation of federal law. 
It happened in Fairfax County, Virginia. When Jena Jones opened up her absentee ballot, she got more than she expected. Stuffed into the envelope was the actual ballot and several pieces of leftist campaign propaganda, WND reports : 
Jones, will be out of town on Election Day and requested an absentee ballot from the Virginia Department of Elections. She was surprised to what else came with her ballot. 
“I found a letter from the governor of Virginia asking me to please vote Democrat and ‘help keep Virginia blue’ this year. Then I got a letter from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what I should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot,” Jena explained to WND and Radio America. 
The step-by-step letter that Jones is described is called a “sample ballot” and it is handed out by campaign workers outside polling places (at a legal distance), telling people how to vote for one particular party or candidate. 
There was no material promoting any of the GOP candidates on the ballot or any information on the numerous proposals or propositions. Jones said she is not a registered Democrat and did not request the ballot from the party. 
Although Jones is not a political junkie of any sort, the inclusion of fliers from Democrats but nothing from Republicans struck her as odd. 
“I was a little confused as to why we didn’t get anything Republican at all, and I wasn’t sure why that was included in my ballot at all,” she said. 
On the back of the letter from McAuliffe were lengthy, glowing biographies of Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine and her local congressman, Rep. Gerry Connolly. 
Her husband, David, was serving as a witness to Jena’s vote. He was even more frustrated by all the pro-Democrat literature while no GOP materials were included. 
“I also was a little befuddled because I figured that this would be a time that you wouldn’t want to encourage voters to go one way or the other,” David Jones said. “It’s just like when you walk into the precinct or the polls, they can’t be within a certain amount of feet from the voting booths, and I figure they shouldn’t be able to put a piece of paper in the envelope with your ballot.” 
David was also surprised by the letter from the Governor (Democrat Terry McAuliffe) urging the to “keep Virginia blue” this year. 
“If it was just a letter saying, ‘Hey we appreciate you voting. Every vote counts,’ that would make sense and I would totally back that. But when there’s a specific flier that says, ‘Hillary Clinton for President’ and ‘Tim Kaine for Vice President,’ laying out their platform, to me it was just biased. It was one side.”

In the   to last year’s presidential election, Nance described Donald Trump as the “ISIS candidate,” and following his victory, predicted that Donald Trump’s security and military advisors would lead to “the end of U. S.  East relations as it exists today. ” He also questioned whether Trump’s victory meant America was “teetering on the edge of fascism. ” Despite being a   expert, Nance also has a history of denying terrorist acts’ connection to Islamism, describing the terrorist responsible for the bulldozing of civilians with a truck in Nice as “mentally unstable,” Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen as suffering from a “physchosexual problem,” and the San Bernadino mass shootings as “a hybrid act of   violence. ” Nance’s comments also come at a time of a rising Islamist terror threat in Turkey, as the country’s President Recep Erdoğan turns the country into a religious state.

11521,‘I’ve Got Thick Skin’: We Talk to the Pro-Trump Mayor Who Was Running From Us - The New York Times," After spending Friday searching for him, we met with Mayor Roger Claar of Bolingbrook, Ill. at City Hall. He had been a bit difficult for us to locate since a   he helped organize for Donald J. Trump became an issue in the village’s mayoral race. BOLINGBROOK, Ill.  —  It was supposed to be an easy glide to yet another term for the longtime mayor of this suburb of Chicago. But then Mayor Claar helped throw the   and things got complicated. Jackie Traynere, 54, a labor organizer, is mounting an ambitious challenge against him. Here’s the story of one village election on Tuesday that has become as much about Mr. Trump as the candidates on the ballot. • Ms. Traynere was so mad about the   event last fall that she decided to run against Mr. Claar. The Democratic apparatus in Illinois  —   senators, members of Congress, you name it  —   is lining up behind her. • Mayor Claar hadn’t answered our interview requests, so we had been hoping to catch up with him Friday. • Finally, we talked with him at City Hall  —   he does not regret the   though he has been disappointed by the reaction. Here’s how the search unfolded. A little about Bolingbrook, 30 miles southwest of Chicago: About 74, 000 people live here and it’s fairly diverse. The mayor’s race is officially nonpartisan, and usually only several thousand people show up to vote. But with a challenger to Mr. Claar and all the attention on the race, this year could be different. The “Rog Mahal”  —   also known as the Bolingbrook Golf Club  —   was the scene of the   for Mr. Trump. It was built by the city for $36 million in 2002, according to The Chicago Tribune, and many people in Bolingbrook see it as a sign of lavish excess. Mayor Claar’s election HQ is along a stretch of strip shopping centers, tucked between an optometrist’s office and a cellphone store. Campaign signs are plastered on the glass doors, and little wooden Uncle Sams decorate the entry. Three workers are milling around. One of them: the mayor’s wife. Ms. Claar was polite but said she had nothing to add about how the campaign was going or why Mayor Claar might not want to meet. Onward. Around here, Mayor Claar has plenty of fans. Everyone seems to know him. He’s been around through this village’s expansion. Subdivisions have replaced cornfields. The population has almost doubled since 1990, and Mayor Claar has been there through it all. At Sophia’s House of Pancakes, Ms. Traynere is meeting with supporters over club sandwiches and bowls of soup. She seems energetic and talks fast, but she also says she’s starting to come down with a cold as her campaign reaches the homestretch. Her complaints about her competitor, the mayor? She says the village’s debt is too high. She says he runs the whole village  —   top to bottom  —   and that he can be a “bully. ” But most of all, she says the Trump event turned her stomach. “Trump’s own words,” she says are what threw some residents here for a loop. Bolingbrook is 20 percent black, 25 percent Hispanic and 11 percent Asian  —   a big change, she says, from when she was growing up here. “The way he talks about minorities,” she says, “that’s not what we experience in our community. That just doesn’t jibe with our town. ” She goes on: “When people realize that that was the mayor who brought him here, that definitely turned their head to think, ‘hmm, maybe I ought to look at a few other things. ’” But why is such an array of prominent Democrats lining up behind her for a little municipal race? Critics say it seems a bit much. Her supporters don’t seem the least bit troubled by all the backing, though. They’re thinking more about the mayor and the  . Off to City Hall  —   we need to find Mayor Claar. After a wait in the lobby of Bolingbrook’s municipal building, Mr. Claar suddenly appears in the doorway. Mayor Claar has gotten word of our search for him, and is actually clutching a printout of the story we have been writing today. For the record, he acknowledges that he has gotten our earlier phone messages and email requests for interviews, but says that he simply had not wished to talk to us. That said, he shows us to a conference room and patiently takes more than half an hour of questions. The mayor says that the   he helped throw for Mr. Trump is the essential reason that he finds himself with such a   race. He doesn’t regret the  . Not at all, he says. But he adds: “I’m disappointed that some people will take that one thing over 31 years and that’s it. ”",0
11522,"Shots reportedly fired, 141 arrested at Dakota Access Pipeline protests","Seattle Times 
Here’s what’s happening : Seattle Times environment reporter Lynda Mapes and Times photographer Alan Berner are on the ground through the end of the week to report on protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline near Bismarck, N.D. Hundreds of protesters have joined the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in their effort to block construction of the pipeline they say threatens water supplies and sacred sites. On Thursday, protesters clashed with police officers who began to push them from land owned by the pipeline developers. More than hundred people were arrested, authorities said. One woman allegedly fired shots at officers while being placed under arrest, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. Read our primer on what’s going on with the oil pipeline. And here’s what we’re reading about the project and the region’s history. Here’s what happened on Wednesday . 
Update, 10:25 p.m. 
More than 12 hours after protesters started clashing with authorities Thursday, the disturbance is still going. No serious injuries have been reported. 
Numerous law-enforcement agencies are involved. In addition to the Morton County Sheriff’s Department, other North Dakota city and county agencies have responded, as well as the highway patrol. Also, officers from Wisconsin, South Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota, Nebraska and Indiana are in the area. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs is here to assist tribal nations. 
The Associated Press captured this video footage of authorities making arrests earlier in the day. 
— The Associated Press and Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 10:05 p.m. 
The Morton County Sheriff’s Department now say 141 people have been arrested. 
The total number of arrests has grown throughout the day, since authorities began pushing protesters from private land owned by the pipeline developers. 
The department said protesters set fires to numerous vehicles, three pieces of Dakota Access Pipeline equipment and a bridge. The extent of total damage was unknown. Protesters also reportedly threw rocks, bottles, logs and homemade firebombs at officers. They also locked themselves to items. 
Some people were arrested on suspicion of reckless endangerment, the department said. Others were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to endanger by fire or explosion, engaging in a riot and maintaining a public nuisance, according to the department.

Update, 8:20 p.m. 
Authorities’ operation earlier Thursday to move protesters off private land, which the pipeline developer owns, included agencies from six states, as well as from the local area. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 6:50 p.m. 
Authorities say 117 people have been arrested as of 6:15 p.m. PST. 
Donnell Hushka, a spokeswoman for the Morton County Sheriff’s Department, said Morton County will use other jails to house people. 
Those who were arrested on suspicion of misdemeanors can bond out, she said, but those facing felonies will be held for initial court appearances. 
Earlier, protesters started two fires on a bridge and threw Molotov cocktails at authorities, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. 
— The Associated Press and Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 6:15 p.m. 
Near the clashing scene between protesters and authorities — which resulted in more than a dozen arrests Thursday and one woman allegedly firing shots at officers — residents nearby are giving their take on the demonstration. 
Ken Wressler, 66, a retired steelworker, says he was glad to move back into the house in which he was born here after working in the steel mill in nearby Mandan for more than 30 years. 
Earlier Thursday, standing on his porch to have his morning coffee, he said he doesn’t much see the sense of blocking the $3.8 billion oil pipeline under construction through four states by Energy Transfer Partners of Dallas, Texas. It cuts a swath of freshly-turned ground just a mile from his house. 
The construction is protected by razor wire on a highway overpass, a reminder of the protests that have drawn international attention, about a half hour from Wressler’s house near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. 
“They ain’t bothered us here in St. Anthony,” Wressler said. “But I’m afraid something is going to happen for the worst. If they are not going to move and they are going to get moved,” he said of protesters now encamped in the path of construction. He said the sheriff “should have taken a stronger stance from the beginning, but who knows?” 
North Dakota needs the pipeline, he said. As a former steel worker, he knows the value of the oil industry. 
“During the first boom, in 1989, we made tanks and more oil tanks and more tanks.” Today? “What good is oil to North Dakota if we can’t send it somewhere? What do we want to get it from the Arabs? We see how many problems that gave us.” 
It’s been a good life, Wressler said, in this faded town, that used to have two schools, a lumber yard, grocery store and a post office. The bigger town of Mandan, up the road, sucked off the jobs and population. But he values the roots he feels deep in this ground. His father used to work in the shed next to his Wressler’s house, as a blacksmith, fixing farmers’ tools. “He pounded and fixed everything, until they moved to throwaway scythes, throwaway everything.” 
Wressler’s red plaid flannel shirt with white plastic pearl snaps was all he needed to be comfortable on this fall morning. “Everybody wanted an early winter. The pipeline people wanted it, so the Indians would leave, the Indians wanted it so they couldn’t put in the pipeline. Instead, we’ve got this.” 
He shook his visitors’ hands goodbye with a meaty hand. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 5:20 p.m. 
A woman allegedly fired three shots at law enforcement officers during their operation to force protesters off private land, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. 
Cecily Fong, a spokeswoman for the department, said the woman was being placed under arrest when she pulled out a .38-caliber pistol and fired, narrowly missing a sheriff’s deputy. Officers did not return fire, Fong said. 
It wasn’t immediately clear exactly when the incident happened. 
Authorities took the woman in to custody. 
Popping noises that some in the crowd thought was gunfire can be heard in this Facebook Live video produced by Atsa E’sha Hoferer during the protests. It’s unclear whether this video captures the shooting incident reported by police. Popping noises that some in the crowd thought was gunfire can be heard in this Facebook Live video produced by Atsa E’sha Hoferer during the Dakota Access pipeline protest. 
Update, 5 p.m. 
A spokesman for protesters said they will continue efforts to block the project, despite being forced from a camp Thursday afternoon. 
Cody Hall says protesters likely will set up a new camp to the east, on federally-owned land that’s also in the path of construction. 
The main camp of the protesters is on land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. That agency has taken no steps to evict protesters from that camp, citing free speech reasons. 
Thursday’s eviction by authorities targeted protesters on private land owned by the pipeline developer. About 200 law enforcement officers launched the operation midday Thursday. On Wednesday, the demonstrators refused to leave voluntarily from the camp. 
Hall believes it won’t be as easy to move the protesters off a new camp, if it’s on federal land. 
— The Associated Press 
Update, 4:25 p.m. 
Authorities say they have ousted the protesters from a camp they had set up on land owned by the pipeline developer. 
Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier says authorities will maintain a presence in the area to keep protesters off private land and prevent them from blocking a nearby highway. 
Late in the afternoon, Kirchmeier said the camp was secure, though officers were still dealing with some protesters in the surrounding area. 
North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple said the effort was “well-handled from start to finish” and resulted in no serious injuries. He said the protesters were given “more than ample time” to move on their own, and that those who didn’t leave voluntarily needed to be dealt with “as we have.”

Update, 4:05 p.m. 
Medics say they have treated a tribal member who was hit by an ATV, as well as tribal members who were hit by pepper spray. 
Also, medics said they have helped a tribal member who was hurt by a falling horse. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 3:50 p.m. 
An estimated 250 demonstrators are still at the north camp and about 80 more, with a dozen horses, are at county road 134. 
On that road, protesters have set an area on fire near a bridge, according to the Morton County Sheriff’s Office. They also have burned tires on Highway 1806, the office said. 
In a prepared statement, Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said, “Law enforcement has been very methodical in moving ahead slowly so as not to escalate the situation.” 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 3:22 p.m. 
Sixteen protesters have been arrested, according to the Morton County Sheriff’s Department. No further details on the arrests were immediately available. 
Law enforcement officials are using pepper spray, bean-bag shot guns, concussion grenades and mace to move the demonstrators out of a camp that sits on private land. They have also deployed Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD), which make piercing noises. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline purchased the private land to complete its nearly 1200 mile-long pipeline. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 2:59 p.m. 
Protesters have set tractors on fire. 
Ambulances from the Standing Rock tribe are standing by to help protesters hurt in the clashes with law enforcement. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 2:45 p.m. (Pacific Time): 
A herd of buffalo was seen surging over the prairie, bringing cheers from the demonstrators. They flowed over the ground like fast moving water, finally disappearing over the distant hills. 
Meanwhile, a man named Tubs, of northern Ohio, said he was maced four times and struck with a club. He headed to the medical tent. 
Police on all-terrain vehicles are chasing demonstrators on horseback, kicking up a cloud of dust. A helicopter also pursued. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 2:32 p.m.: 
Alfred Kills His Horse, 27, of the Lakota Nation, said he was standing on the front lines and was shot by a bean bag from a shotgun. 
“The water is everything to us. I don’t understand why this chaos is coming to us. We all drink water,” he said. “I don’t want the violence. I don’t want to get shot. We don’t know any other way. We have been fighting the U.S. government for hundreds of years.” 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 2:09 p.m.: 
Protesters on horseback are galloping toward the front-line of the demonstration, wearing gas masks. 
“They started advancing on our lines,” said Dana Yellow Fat, Standing Rock Sioux tribal councilman. “They opened up a big gash on a man.” 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 1:58 p.m.: 
Police are advancing with armored-personnel vehicle and ATVs. Campers are surrounded and outnumbered. Seven empty buses are en route while police move in. 
Some protesters have locked themselves onto a pickup truck. 
“You will be pepper sprayed if you do not get off of the pickup,” an officer said through a megaphone. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 1:42 p.m.: 
Police continue to work to clear the protesters’ camp on land owned by the Dakota Access Pipeline developer. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 1:23 p.m.: 
Darryl Lies, from Douglas, North Dakota, said he came to the standoff “because of the violation of private property rights. And the use of one right to trample another is an abuse of our God-given and our country-given rights.” 
Lies is president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. “They are using the First Amendment right to trample private property rights,” he said. 
Lies said the protests have harmed the relationship between farmers and ranchers and the tribe. 
“We just want this to go away,” he said. 
Trent Loos, 50, of Loup City, Nebraska, said the protesters crossed the line when they went onto private property. 
“The sheriff has executed his rights as he should. He has not caved to federal pressure,” he said. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 12:46 p.m.: 
Police continue to push demonstrators south down the highway toward the protesters’ main camp about a half mile away. The front-line camp is owned by pipeline developers. Opponents began moving the camp there in the path of construction last weekend. 
The first arrest on Thursday was made there as police encircle the camp, moving closer and closer, foot by foot. 
“We need as much people as possible. They started spraying (pepper spray). They are pushing tents down,” said Devin Blackcloud, a Standing Rock tribal member. “No one is budging. There are 150, 200 people willing to be arrested.” 
Some campers are running. Police pursued. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 12:30 p.m.: 
Police are moving protesters south on Highway 1806. Over the megaphone, police are saying: “Please move to the south. I am going to sound the alert tone. You guys are too close to the vehicles. Please move. … We do not want to arrest anyone. We are moving forward a few feet.” 
A line of demonstrators has formed, facing the oncoming riot gear-clad officers and their armored-personnel carrier. Police are also fanned out in the surrounding fields and many more are standing by a short distance away up the hill. 
— Lynda Mapes, Seattle Times environment reporter 
Update, 11:57 a.m.: 
Back at the main camp, south of the confrontation with police, the mood is hushed, subdued. Black smoke is still rising from the highway barricade that was set on fire. The camp dogs have begun howling. 
Times photographer Alan Berner cut his head on barbed wire during the flurry of activity earlier. Medics assisted, and his wound was cleaned. He declined stitches or staples and is headed back to the front line of demonstrations near the property owned by the pipeline developers.

Update, 10:22 a.m.: 
The Morton County Sheriff’s Office has warned protesters at their new camp erected on property owned by the pipeline developers to leave — or be arrested. No one is leaving. Demonstrators are rushing to the front line of the protest. A helicopter is circling overhead. 
A police officer shouted over a megaphone, over and over, that protesters should take their personal belongings and leave: “Walk to the main camp; 0pen the road block. We will not hurt you. You need to come out with your hands raised. Come onto the road. Do not go into the field. Do not approach us with horses. Do not approach us with vehicles.” 
Protesters are locking arms, praying and drumming and burning sage, waiting to be arrested. 
“Disperse now or you will be arrested under North Dakota laws,” police ordered, as protesters sing.

Update, 9:46 a.m.: 
The Dakota Access Pipeline slicing through four states of the U. S. also creates small-town divisions, where some business owners near the protest camp have plenty to say on the subject. They declined to give their names publicly, though, for fear of sending away customers. 
In the tiny town of Solen, which is on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and about a half hour’s drive from the protest camps, some business owners are walking a difficult line. 
For instance, a non-Indian garage owner is married to a Sioux woman who sides with the opponents — while he finds the whole controversy a nuisance. 
“I think most of the people around here, Native and non-Native, would like to see it end. It’s a big inconvenience. All the traffic, the cops. I am for the pipeline. North Dakota is an oil-producing state,” he said. “And it’s the safest way to transport it.” 
At home, the dividing line is clear. “She is convinced the pipeline is going to break and people are going to die,” he said of his wife. “She’s got her view, and I’ve got mine.” 
Up the dirt road, off the main highway, is the Last Chance Saloon, decorated with branding irons, large, longhorn cattle horns and solid advice on a bumper sticker stuck on the wall: “When in doubt, let your horse do the talking.” 
The barkeeper, age 89, was similarly opinionated with the couple — yet circumspect. 
“I wish it would end; I’m sick of it,” she said, pouring fresh coffee for visitors into Styrofoam cups. “And they keep coming, more and more.” 
A lifelong resident of this farming hamlet, she comes in to clean the bar every day for her son and mind the counter during the slow hours. 
“What else am I going to do, sit and look out the window? I like to stay busy.” 
As for the coffee, it was hot, fresh and free. She wouldn’t take payment, no. Not from out-of-town visitors. 
“Don’t make me argue,” she said.

For the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, the battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline recalls a bitter history the tribe does not want repeated.

Once roaming the Great Plains, living in teepees and hunting buffalo, the Sioux leaders such as Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Crazy Horse are household names. Their bloodiest battles are too: Wounded Knee. Custer’s Last Stand. 
The history of the Sioux people and the United States is one of broken promises and seizing land for white settlement, gold mining and development. Those lands were reserved for the Indians’ sole use, in peace treaties that were supposed to be the highest law of the land.

11523,Man Defeats Mystery Digestive Illness By Eating Just This One Type of Food,"Waking Times 
Derek Nance is a Kentucky man who has chosen to eat only raw meat in his effort to get rid of a mystery illness. He found himself with little appetite for regular food and vomiting after he ate, which resulted in significant weight loss. After eliminating food after food after food, he discovered that a carnivorous version of the Paleo diet cured his digestive problems and left him feeling pretty fantastic. 
Some of you may find these images disgusting, but for Nance, this is what meal time look like. 
Nance doesn’t just grab a steak every time he’s hungry. A lot of thought and planning goes into his diet. He mostly eats grass-fed lamb, which he buys locally and slaughters himself. He avoids animals that are pumped full of hormones , such as pig. The animals he chooses are free-range and raised on several varieties of grass, which impacts the taste and quality of the meat. 
When Nance slaughters an animal, it seems that no part goes unused. In addition to the meat, the organs give him Vitamin C. He eats lots of animal fat and also uses it to brush his teeth. Brains are considered a delicacy, followed by a nice glass of blood to wash it all down. 
Probiotic -rich rotten meat is also on Nance’s menu. In an interview with Vice.com , Nance explains why he eats rotten meat: 
“Half of the problem with my digestion was actually just lack of enzymes. My body just doesn’t produce enough enzymes to digest starchy foods. So the probiotic bacteria in rotten meat actually help me to digest the food.” The Fight Against the Modern Diet 
Some may think it very unusual and actually unhealthy for a man to live only on raw meat. Yet, we cannot deny that our contemporary way of eating has resulted in an increase in modern diseases such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. 
Humans in general suffer from more chronic illnesses than ever before. Is an all-meat diet, or even a Paleo diet , the solution? Many health professionals and nutritionists would strongly disagree, but they will agree that our food choices play a major role in how healthy a person is. Diets, such as the Paleo diet with mostly meats and seasonal vegetables, fruit, nuts and roots, cut out processed foods that are often full of sodium, preservatives, and genetically-modified ingredients. 
“The nutritional qualities of modern processed foods and foods introduced during the Neolithic period are discordant with our ancient and conservative genome. This genetic discordance ultimately manifests itself as various chronic illnesses, which have been dubbed ‘diseases of civilization.’ ~ Dr. Loren Cordain, author of The Paleo Diet 
Derek Nance is an example of what can happen when a person is willing to make the effort to address illness by changing up the diet. For Nance who’s been following his unusual diet for over seven years, after the first few weeks of raw meat, “I felt absolutely great, and I never went back.” 
“Listen to your body. Do what feels right for yourself. Be your own guinea pig. As soon as something doesn’t feel right or doesn’t make sense to you, maybe you can tweak it a little bit.” ~ Pete Evans, TV personality, award-winning chef and author of Healthy Every Day and The Complete Gut Health Cookbook Read more articles by Anna Hunt .

11524,"Obama Joins Hillary Clinton on Stump, Saying She ‘Has Been Tested’ - The New York Times","CHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   As Hillary Clinton braced for political fallout from her use of a private email server, President Obama delivered a stemwinder on her behalf on Tuesday, praising her “steady judgment” as his secretary of state and criticizing Donald J. Trump for his own lack of transparency. Sleeves rolled up and declaring himself “fired up” on her behalf, Mr. Obama heaped admiration on Mrs. Clinton and assailed Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, saying American voters face a critical choice between “some imaginary past, or whether we are going to reach for the future. ” “I can tell you this, Hillary Clinton has been tested,” Mr. Obama said as he interrupted repeatedly by the cheering crowd. “There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office,” the president boomed. But the jubilant rally  —   Mr. Obama’s first campaign appearance with Mrs. Clinton  —   unfolded at an awkward moment, just hours after the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, accused Mrs. Clinton of being “extremely careless” in her email use as he announced the end of an investigation that has engulfed her candidacy and put the Obama administration on the defensive. The dueling political events on Tuesday were as discordant as they were separate: The president and his   secretary of state sidestepped the email issue at their rally, where Mr. Obama clasped hands with his onetime rival and predicted victory in the fall, making no mention of Mr. Comey’s dramatic announcement in Washington faulting Mrs. Clinton even as he recommended against criminal charges. Without mentioning the email controversy, Mr. Obama pointed to the political attacks that have chipped away at Mrs. Clinton’s trust among voters. “Can I be blunt?” he said. “Hillary’s got her share of critics. ” But, he added, “That’s what happens when you dedicate yourself to public service over a lifetime. ” Mr. Obama delicately touched on Mrs. Clinton’s perceived weaknesses as a candidate even as he marveled at her tenacity in the nominating fight they waged against each other eight years ago. In an election year in which outsider candidates have railed against the establishment, Mr. Obama portrayed Mrs. Clinton’s   experience as a plus. “Sometimes we take somebody who has been in the trenches and fought the good fight and been so steady for granted,” he said, recognizing that voters’ yearning for the next new thing had helped his own 2008 campaign. “We don’t do that, by the way, for airline pilots. ” At a time when her State Department tenure is being picked apart by political critics, he defended her turn as the nation’s top diplomat, noting how her popularity faded only once she returned to the political spotlight. “It’s funny how the filter changes a little bit,” he said. “The filter is a powerful thing. ” Mrs. Clinton, perched on a stool behind the president, grinned and gently nodded. The   rally in North Carolina was rescheduled after a previous campaign event in Wisconsin was hastily canceled after the Orlando shootings. But in some ways, the moment had been years in the making. Eight years ago, after a brutal primary fight, Mrs. Clinton appeared arm in arm with Mr. Obama for the first time in Unity, N. H. where she declared, “Unity is not only a beautiful place, it’s a wonderful feeling, isn’t it?” Mr. Obama referred to that event at Tuesday’s rally in North Carolina, a rally that served as a kind of bookend to two remarkable careers that at times seemed destined to clash. “We went to Unity, N. H. just in case people missed the point,” Mr. Obama said. “I saw the grace and the energy with which she threw herself into my campaign. ” Mrs. Clinton spoke before the president, an unusual departure from how she appears at events with   surrogates, and at times it felt like she was campaigning not for herself, but for Mr. Obama’s legacy, praising his “heart, depth and humility. ” She repeatedly referred to their former rivalry, even praising Mr. Obama’s political deftness at defeating her. “He knows a thing or two about winning elections, take it from me,” she said. The F. B. I. ’s decision not to recommend criminal charges came days after an unplanned, brief meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch at an airport in Phoenix. To avoid any appearance of political interference, Ms. Lynch said Friday that she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the F. B. I. director on whether to bring charges against Mrs. Clinton. On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton and her lawyers met with officials from the F. B. I. and the Justice Department to answer nearly four hours of questioning related to her email server. Aides to both Democrats said Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton did not discuss the F. B. I. investigation on the flight to Charlotte. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, added that Mr. Obama looked at photos of Mrs. Clinton’s grandchildren aboard Air Force One. Serving as Mr. Obama’s secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton engendered good will with the White House, and the experience of accepting Mr. Obama’s offer to run the State Department became one of the most popular stories she relayed on the campaign trail, particularly when wooing black voters. Mrs. Clinton also fired away at Mr. Trump, saying that Mr. Obama was “someone who has never forgotten where he came from  —   and Donald, if you’re out there tweeting, it’s Hawaii,” a reference to Mr. Trump’s calls in 2011 for the president to produce his birth certificate. For several attendees, many of whom waited for hours in sweltering conditions to get into the rally, the chief draw was the chance to glimpse Mr. Obama as he sets off on something of a farewell tour. The crowd was heavily   flashing clothing and trinkets dedicated to the sitting president. Vendors sold tote bags and   emblazoned with images of Mr. Obama’s teenage daughters, and   promising to continue Mr. Obama’s historic 2008 victory by electing the first female president. “It was on my bucket list,” Ivy Dunn, 69, said of seeing him. Asked if she thought Mrs. Clinton could be as effective in office, Ms. Dunn paused. “I’m not going to say yes,” she said, “but she’ll be good. ” Mrs. Clinton will need to nurture Mr. Obama and his supporters, particularly after she strayed to the left of his policies during her nominating fight on issues like the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Keystone XL Pipeline. A majority  —   51 percent  —   of Americans approve of the president, according to a recent Gallup poll. As Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton touched down at the Charlotte airport, and strode off Air Force One together in a sign of solidarity, a reporter asked John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman and a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Obama, whether the F. B. I. announcement overshadowed the rally. He replied with a single word: “Hardly. ”",0

You can’t just convert overnight to a religion. ” That month, Lohan told the New York Post that she was racially profiled for the first time in her life at London’s Heathrow Airport, where she was traveling while wearing an Islamic headscarf. The actress said she wears the headscarf out of “respect” for certain countries to which she travels. In recent months, Lohan has been busy with her advocacy work on behalf of Syrian refugees. The actress met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inside the country’s presidential palace in January, and has previously visited with refugees in hospitals and homes in Istanbul. The “burkini”  swimsuit has previously been at the center of some controversy last year, authorities in the French town of Nice banned the garment, reportedly claiming it posed a risk to public order. A court in Nice later overturned the ban.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
11526,Inside the Invisible Government       :," Inside the Invisible Government
By John Pilger
 The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions.
In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade  behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo! Bernays influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War.
The secret, he said, was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it.
He described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible government.
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged.
Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties.
In the second city  in another country nearby  almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by us  by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city  which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city.
Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad.
What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today.
Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powells fabrications. The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?
He replied that if journalists had done their job, there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq.
It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question  Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps.
When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoi Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria  and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollandes bombast about France being at war and showing no mercy. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak.
When the truth is replaced by silence, said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, the silence is a lie.
The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country.
The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an agreement that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked.
From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics  the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.
The Wests medieval client, Saudi Arabia  to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars worth of arms  is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs  our bombs  that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news.
Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education  Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia  and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT.
And they love war.
While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie.
In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call regime change in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafis influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, We came, we saw, he died!
The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong. Intervention  what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction.
According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 strike sorties against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, most [of them] under the age of ten. As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS.
Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato.
 This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washingtons military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up withduring the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil.
The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine  except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count.
Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government.
There is almost the joie desprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
 To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to Americas design for the 21 st century.
This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China.
To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, its over. That was not news.
Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world  unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China.
Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to totally obliterate Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria  a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime a distinction for which the competition is fierce.
Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders.
Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way  in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clintons victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays torches of freedom.
George Bushs press spokesman once called the media complicit enablers.
Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history.
In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.

11528,Nigerian Archbishop Calls on Govt to Protect Christians from ‘Wanton Destruction’ from Muslims,"The President of the Nigerian Catholic bishops’ conference has appealed to the government to be “more proactive” in defending Christians from the atrocities being wrought by the Muslim population in   Nigeria. [During December, more than 800 people —  mostly Christians —  died in   violence in the south of Kaduna state, which forms part of Nigeria’s   middle belt, where the chiefly Muslim north of the country meets the mainly Christian south.  According to Vatican Radio, the Muslim Fulani Cattle herdsmen in the area have recently committed “atrocities” resulting in the deaths of “thousands of Christians and the destruction of property worth millions of Naira. ” The Nigerian government claims that the death toll is actually lower than the one given by the Catholic church. In a statement, Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama, President of the Bishops’ Conference, said the bishops were “particularly saddened by the constant and wanton destruction of lives and properties,” noting that   violence had spread around the country and “no one knows which community will be the next victim. ” The crisis and violence in Southern Kaduna has destabilized the region and “brought untold hardship and tensions” on the local Christian population, Kaigama said. Muslim Fulani herdsmen have perpetrated much of the violence against the predominantly Christian local farmers, and some Christians have reportedly also carried out retaliatory killings as well. Government officials have tried to downplay the religious dimension to the conflict, suggesting instead that it is largely about “ethnic” rather than religious tensions. “We live in a country that is     and complex in nature,” Kaigama said. “That is why we must constantly appeal to the sensibilities of our political leaders not to be seen to promote the interest of any particular group but to be neutral and seek the common things that will promote unity, fairness and equity in the country. ” Another local bishop, Joseph Bagobiri of Kafanchan, blamed the government for the systematic elimination of Christians in Southern Kaduna, noting that it will be difficult for Christianity to survive in northern Nigeria. “The crisis here has persisted because of the way and manner the federal and state governments, as well as the security agents are handling it,” Bagobiri said. “The root cause of this crisis is the institutionalisation of what could be regarded as structural injustice. ” In my view, he said, this is “a deliberate policy of injustice designed to shut our people out from the scheme of things and deny us our rights. ” “We as a Church must evolve new ways on how we can face violence without losing faith,” Bagobiri said. “It is our prayer that God will give us his strength and the needed direction on how to make Christianity survive despite the constant attacks and persecutions we received. ” He added that people have turned to prayer in the absence of government help. “It is only God that can save us from our present situation,” the bishop said. “Our hope in Him is never in vain since he knows our problem and He will deliver us one day just as he delivered the people of Israel from the hands of the Egyptians,” he said.

11529,Say What?! FBI Never Destroyed Laptops of Clinton Aides – AGENTS REFUSED TO DO IT,"0 comments 
This is just too rich! The FBI agreed to destroy the laptops that Clinton and her aides turned over during the EmailGate investigation… and then agents REFUSED to do it. Now, the laptops have been subpoenaed and the FBI is just waiting for Congress to ask for them. Oh goody! All that evidence is about to come back into play along with Weiner’s laptop that has over 10,000 emails of Huma’s dealings with Hillary Clinton. Good times. Stick a fork in them… I’d say they may just be about done. 
Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova is the one that broke this explosive revelation. Hillary Clinton must be having multiple panic attacks right about now. I guess we are going to see just how well her health holds up over her corruption being exposed. I understand that she looks dead tired over all this. I’ll bet. Her lies are finally beginning to catch up with her. They should have long ago. 
From The Daily Caller: 
Agents within the Federal Bureau of Investigation never destroyed laptops given to them by aides of Hillary Clinton as previously reported , a Washington D.C. lawyer with a source close to the Clinton investigation says. 
Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova said on The David Webb Show on SiriusXM Friday night that despite the FBI agreeing to destroy the laptops of Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and ex-campaign staffer Heather Samuelson as part of immunity deals made during the initial investigation of Clinton’s email server, agents involved in the case refused to destroy the laptops. 
“According to the agreement reached with the attorneys who handed over their laptops, the laptops were to be destroyed per the agreement after the testimony was given –the interviews were given – – by the attorneys. The bureau and the department agreed to that,” DiGenova said. “However the laptops contrary to published reports were not destroyed and the reason is the agents who are tasked with destroying them refused to do so. And by the way the laptops are at the FBI for inspection by Congress or federal courts.” 
DiGenova said the laptops have already been subpoenaed and the FBI is waiting for Congress to ask for them. 
I’m sure Donald Trump is all smiles over these developments. In the end, Hillary Clinton was her own worst enemy and Donald Trump’s biggest supporter in this election. 
“When I found out last Sunday that those laptops — by the way from somebody who is involved in the investigation by the FBI– had not been destroyed contrary to published reports, I could not believe that the Republicans had not gotten their hands on them even yet,” DiGenova said. Neither can I… come on GOP… you’ve just been handed the keys to the kingdom here. Time to go in for the kill. Don’t blow it this time. Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton

11531,10 Things I Learned From Being My Own General Contractor,"One of the foundations of living a good life in today’s times is having a good place to call home. Whether you want a solid, comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies, recover from the day’s tribulations, and just to be, or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits, or both; a good home is essential to the modern man.
I purchased a home and I decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations. My home was an as-originally-furnished home of the 1970s, and I brought its multi-color painted, green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed, hardwood-floored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style. A general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site, source the labor, follow the schedule, get the materials, and execute the vision of the plan. Here are ten things I learned as my own general contractor.
1. There are good contractors, and there are bad contractors 
You will run into both good and bad contractors out there. A good contractor does good work, at good value, follows the schedule, and is honest and doesn’t lie to you. A bad contractor will do any or all of the above. I fired a contractor who had good value, but did poor work, could not follow the schedule, and lied to me. I paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work, hit the schedule on time, and was a perfectionist. Give a bad contractor a second chance, mainly to see how he corrects it; and, if he fails to shape up, cut him loose.
A good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork, but no more. Some firms I turned down did things by hand and had no contractor’s license, and that is too little, whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanic’s lien on your home if you do not pay is too much.
A lot has to do with the presentation of the representative. Tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands, but a man that does not have a good handshake, good eye contact, and is evasive on important details is shady.
2. Good contractors cost more, and they are busy The best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule, and I mean they are booked often a month or so in advance. The guy I fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night, which, while it SEEMS like he’s busy, he’s actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs.
A good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them, and he will, when awarded the job, put you in his schedule at an agreed-upon time. My best contractor was so busy that I had to do other things first before I could get his firm to bid my work, and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy; they turned down my work until later.
3. You need to establish a reputation 
General contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they sub-contract to, and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation.
A busy contractor will work with a GC who will give them work in the future over one who will not. I was an unknown, so the busy guys during the busy season (fall and pre-holidays) would pass on me and work with ones they knew.
However, word got around to the others that I gave jobs of good scope, and paid on time. I hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs, and, once they found out who I used as my electrician (it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to), they called and the electricians vouched that I was picky as all hell, but paid on time, and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house. At that point, I was in.
4. Good contractors know other good contractors 
Reputation works the other way too. A good roofer who I only turned down because he was too busy and wouldn’t meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above. Although you should ALWAYS get multiple competing quotes (bid to three, two will generally respond, and pick the better one), the deciding factor was that his brother, the roofer, ran a good shop, and it stood to reason he would, too.
My plumbers knew my AC guys and my chimney guy. My flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys. Everyone works with and around everyone else, and I saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that, on any future projects, I know who to call for what, and, even if I don’t know, I know who to ask for recommendations.
5. It will take more money than you think it will 
Home renovation is expensive, and it’s mainly for the nasty reason that, once you commit to action, you can get hit with extra costs. You can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what, but you will find that the home will need things you didn’t think about, or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted, or materials will simply cost more.
Part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now, and what to spend money on later. Right now, I live in the place (finally), but I still have construction paper down on my floors as I have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas. My bathrooms have plumbing in, but no mirrors, cabinets, towel racks, or toilet paper holders. Entire rooms are without furniture. All of these can, and should, be taken care of later, but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier.
6. It will take more time than you think it will You may not need something this complicated, but a Gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others.
Contractors have their own schedules, and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit, you have to juggle quotes, they have to then write you in, then they do the work, then there’s follow-ups and punch-lists, and then, finally, that job is done and you pay them.
You can’t do some other jobs before you finish the first one. This is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters. My floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors, but they did not when they were laying sub-floor, and I was able to have plumbers in that day as well. Contrariwise, I could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done.
7. Some of your ideas are wrong, some are right I had my own thoughts about what to do with the place. Sometimes I was wrong; it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood (even though it was the same color) and I listened to my contractor and used new. Sometimes I was right, my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the counter-tops’ colors, and the ratio of white I wanted was correct, but I was persuaded to add more by my contractor.
Know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent, but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how, instead of the what. I have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures; they did what I wanted, but did it in a better way than I would have suggested, and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process.
8. There will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
The one thing a professional general contractor does that you, as a private operator, will not is do all the basic stuff themselves. A GC will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans, but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself. My electricians did install and hang them for me anyway.
This was for two reasons, and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job. The first is to provide all the materials yourself, which also allows you to pick out what you want. I had a pile of fixtures, fans, and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where, and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done.
The second reason is to provide a good scope of work. Will a plumber come install a single faucet? Maybe. Will he come install five and a garbage disposal? Certainly, that’s a good day’s work, so, if you have little jobs, have a LOT of little jobs, and you’ll get more interest.
9. There are things with which you will not be satisfied; good enough is good enough 
This house is old, but renovated. Some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval; I cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is 40 years old and it had popcorn texture on it. Some things I did not address; I have new baseboard and new window trim, but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time.
Some things were done, but were not perfect. The drywall where my kitchen cabinets’ bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where, even after two reworks, still has a hairline paint crack. Some of the window film has pull away lines, and there’s a couple things trapped under the film in places. One of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue. You cannot have perfection, but you can go for reasonable excellence.
10. Code enforcement sucks The Man sucks. Someone called Code Enforcement on me, and I had to go get a permit of a cost of X% of the renovation’s cost, mainly so they can jack my taxes up.
I got the permit, and I expect my taxes to go up. The inspector was a real schmuck, as most appointed officials are, but the joke’s on him, as I only got the permit on what I had left to do and I omitted some things that would still happen, but weren’t too noticeable.
With code enforcement and county ordinances, the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken, instead of flouting the law. I went and got the permit when I was busted for it, but they only know a third of the story. Had I gotten a permit earlier, perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all. Another tactic, which I will do on a future project I have planned, is to get the permit months ahead of time, then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices.
Conclusion If you have the time, the patience, and the skill to know exactly what you want, who to get for it, and how to juggle a massive schedule, running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational. If you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything, then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead.

11532,Obama's Victory Lap?,"  
In between nearly daily campaign stops shilling for Hillary, President Barack Obama has been promoting his record as Head of State. To Obama’s credit, he talks nice and appears to be both thoughtful and rational, qualities that were not always evident in his predecessor in office. But the hype about what was achieved in his eight years appears to be more than a bit overblown, particularly if one considers the flagship domestic project, Obamacare. It is a program in which the government forces individuals to buy a product that has been crafted together by private, for profit companies. If the people do not buy, they will be penalized by the government. The companies in turn have learned that it is tough to make money insuring people who are actually sick so they are leaving the program while those individuals who have to buy their own coverage without government subsidies are discovering that the significant annual price increases mean that they cannot afford insurance at all. Donald Trump is right that the program is in crisis, is “over,” and should be repealed. 
Against that, what has Obama accomplished domestically? I will not consider the constant pandering on gender and race because that is, after all, what Democrats do. But if one considers immigration a part of domestic policy, he is responsible for refusing to enforce immigration law, letting Haitians stay illegally in the U.S. as compensation for a hurricane that occurred in 2010, while also failing to deport whole categories of Hispanics who are in the country without visas or residency permits. Domestic would also include the continuation of several types of surveillance of citizens by the NSA and FBI, the hounding and prosecution of whistleblowers, and the increased reliance on the State Secrets privilege to derail the use of the judicial system to pushback against government overreach. And in a just concluded parole hearing involving a Guantanamo detainee who had been repeatedly tortured, the Obama Administration has now determined that some individuals can be held in prison forever without ever being charged with a crime or convicted. 
But it is in the foreign and national security policy areas that Obama has been most visibly active as he has a relatively free hand based on what he considers to be his own “unitary executive” authority. In his famous Cairo speech delivered to the Muslim world in 2009 he promised change but basically did not deliver, though there have actually been several successes in foreign policy that date to the past year. He should get full credit for confronting the Israel Lobby and Congress (essentially the same thing) to obtain a nuclear program agreement with Iran. Likewise, he went against the Cuban Lobby and GOP in Congress (also essentially the same thing) to ease relations with Havana. He still might do the right thing by the Palestinians and allow the U.S. to recognize their statehood at the United Nations later this month or even support the French plan for a multinational conference to create a Palestinian state but I wouldn’t want to bet on it, particularly as the incoming Administration headed by Hillary Clinton will be firmly in the Israeli pocket and Obama would presumably defer to her before doing anything dramatic. 
And Obama should also get credit for some things that he didn’t do. He did not exacerbate tensions with Russia by arming Ukraine with game changing offensive weapons in spite of intense pressure from Congress and the media and he did not get involved in a new land war involving tens of thousands of American soldiers in Asia even though some of his advisers were urging him to do so in Syria. But by the same measure starting yet another war by proxy, in Libya, was a complete failure, though it did not involve American boots on the ground. It was a war that might in part be attributed to the aggressive advocacy of Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time. 
And while it should also be recalled to Obama’s credit that he made no effort to maintain a troop presence in Iraq, he was unable to extricate U.S. forces from America’s longest war in Afghanistan, which continues and is likely to be on the presidential agenda for the next decade or even longer. Nor could he dissuade the Saudis from initiating their brutal and senseless war on Yemen, which has had devastating consequences with more to come for the entire region. And President Obama has also failed to closed Guantanamo prison in spite of promises made eight years ago to do so. 
President Obama has also changed the actual mechanics of America’s intervention in the world, using drones and aerial bombardment instead of soldiers on the ground to enforce Washington’s diktat. A Pentagon press release in September boasted how over Labor Day weekend U.S. warplanes attacked targets in six countries. The United States was not at war with any of them. And then there is Anwar al-Awlaki and his son, American citizens who were executed in Yemen by drone without any legal process, by executive order, after they were placed on a “kill list” compiled by the White House. 
But Obama’s poorest grades relate to his handling of Russia, Syria and Israel, all three of which might plausibly be seen as linked issues as Secretary Clinton once commented that Syria’s government would have to be brought down to benefit Israel while Russia is Syria’s most important ally. The problem with Syria is the policy itself. The only serious direct threat emanating from the country is ISIS, which has the capability to send suicide bombers and other dedicated terrorists to strike targets in the United States and Europe. To be sure, Washington is operating against ISIS, providing intelligence, equipment and training to its proxies and the “moderate” rebels that it supports in the country, but the effort is a mish mash, involving as it does feckless allies and clashing loyalties. The Pentagon and CIA have meanwhile been training batches of dubious recruits, some of whom turn their weapons over to the crazies at first opportunity. The Defense Department deflected completely accurate charges that it was supporting terrorists by changing the names of the groups involved. Amid the chaos, President Obama has even conceded that there are no moderate rebels. 
Defeating ISIS would be relatively simple if everyone were on the same page, but the White House persists in seeing the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad as the top priority, as if creating a power vacuum in Damascus would be a solution to what ISIS has been doing. And pressuring al-Assad also creates and feeds the ongoing problems with Russia. As the beltway groupthink goes, Syria minus al-Assad and Vladimir Putin would magically become a place where all the moderate, nation-building and democratically inclined forces would be able to come together and form a new government that would immeasurably benefit the Syrian people. 
That formulation is, of course, complete nonsense and it is Moscow that has a clear understanding of what is at stake, not Washington. The reality is that creating a power vacuum is precisely what provides the opportunity for militant groups to settle in and expand their authority. It is how al-Qaeda and ISIS both came into prominence. It happens because, as in Iraq and Libya, the Washington interventionists have no idea what might succeed as a post-civil war political system in Syria. Nor do they have any real plan for achieving a functioning polity. 
U.S. administrations have already tried decapitation of existing leadership in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya with catastrophic results but one of the delights of the American political system is that all the key policy players change every four to eight years meaning that lessons learned are lost and have to be discovered a second time around, repeating as necessary. That regime change would work any better in Syria defies belief but it is nevertheless what Washington chooses to believe and by seeing al-Assad as an enemy it is hampering the effort against ISIS’s most effective asset: the Syrian Army backed up by Russian air support. 
And then there is Israel. Israel is, according to many Congressmen and the media, America’s best friend and greatest ally. It is a judgment that also defies belief as Tel Aviv and more particularly its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been persistently pursuing policies that are nominally opposed by the United States government, most particularly the expansion of its settlements. It has also interfered in U.S. internal politics during elections and did not hesitate to exploit political divisions in Congress when Netanyahu was invited by GOP leaders to speak to a joint session to provide his perception of President Obama’s “misguided” negotiations with Iran. Israel is no friend of the United States even if it does receive an annual handout currently running at in excess of $3 billion and unlimited political cover in international bodies. Obama reportedly hates Netanyahu but did not have the courage to do anything about him. 
So the Obama record is a mixed bag, but mostly a disappointment. His presidency will be somewhat untouchable by those who do retrospectives, as least for a while, protected by Obama’s status as America’s first black president. It would have been nice to see real health care reform, a backing off from police state norms in the war on terror, and less lethal engagement in other people’s quarrels overseas, but I suppose Obama would argue that GOP obstruction and the Establishment consensus caused him to support policies and engage in compromises that he really wanted to avoid. There may be some truth to that but ultimately Obama comes across as yet another morally deficient head of state who presumably saw the folly in the status quo but ultimately decided that loyalty to his party and dedication to its continuation in power was more important than doing what was right. Ultimately, the acquisition of money and power are everything in our system of government and the brief trajectory of Barack Hussein Obama is no exception to that rule.",0
11533,New Poll: Americans Feel Less Safe After 15 Years Of War,"Written by Daniel McAdams   We were told that we had to attack Iraq because the Saddam Hussein government made us less safe.

11535,"Emails Warrant No New Action Against Hillary Clinton, F.B.I. Director Says - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, told Congress on Sunday that he had seen no evidence in a recently discovered trove of emails to change his conclusion that Hillary Clinton should face no charges over her handling of classified information. Mr. Comey’s announcement, just two days before the election, was an effort to clear the cloud of suspicion he had publicly placed over her presidential campaign late last month when he alerted Congress that the F. B. I. would examine the emails. “Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,” Mr. Comey wrote in a letter to the leaders of several congressional committees. He said agents had reviewed all communications to and from Mrs. Clinton in the new trove from when she was secretary of state. The letter was a dramatic final twist in a tumultuous nine days for both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Comey, who drew widespread criticism for announcing that the F. B. I. had discovered new emails that might be relevant to its investigation of Mrs. Clinton, which ended in July with no charges. That criticism of Mr. Comey from both parties is likely to persist after the election. While the new letter was clear as it related to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Comey’s message was otherwise vague. He did not say that agents had completed their review of the emails, or that they were abandoning the matter in regard to her aides. But federal law enforcement officials said that they considered the review of emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s server complete, and that Mr. Comey’s letter was intended to convey that. One senior law enforcement official said that as recently as Friday, it was not clear whether the review would be completed by Election Day. But after days of working in shifts around the clock, teams of counterintelligence agents and technology specialists at the bureau’s headquarters in Washington finished their examination of the thousands of emails. Officials had decided to make their decision public as soon as they had reached it, to avoid any suggestion that they were suppressing information. According to the law enforcement official, many of the emails were personal messages or duplicates of ones that the bureau had previously examined during the original inquiry. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said in a post on Twitter that the campaign had always believed she would be cleared of any wrongdoing. “We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited,” Mr. Fallon said. “Now Director Comey has confirmed it. ” Kellyanne Conway, Donald J. Trump’s campaign manager, lamented the fact that Mr. Comey had again inserted himself into the election, but she predicted that his conclusion would have no effect on the outcome. “The investigation has been mishandled from the beginning,” Ms. Conway said on MSNBC, arguing that Mrs. Clinton had wasted taxpayer money and federal resources because of her email practices. “She was reckless, she was careless, she was selfish. ” The new review began after agents discovered a cache of emails in early October in an unrelated investigation into the disgraced former congressman Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of one of Mrs. Clinton’s closest aides. When searching Mr. Weiner’s laptop for evidence of whether he had exchanged illicit messages with a teenage girl, they discovered emails belonging to the aide, Huma Abedin. That announcement renewed talk of an investigation that had shadowed Mrs. Clinton for much of the Democratic primary campaign. She and her aides had been under investigation for improperly storing classified information on Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. The discovery of new emails raised the prospect that the laptop might have new information that would renew the F. B. I. inquiry. Federal law enforcement officials had said for the past week that only something astounding would change their conclusion that nobody should be charged. But the mere potential for legal trouble was enough to make Republicans gleeful, and Mr. Trump highlighted the F. B. I. ’s actions in campaign ads. At the end of a rocky week for Mrs. Clinton that included wild, false speculation about looming indictments and shocking discoveries in the emails, Mr. Comey’s letter swept away her largest and most immediate problem. Republicans immediately accused Mr. Comey of making his announcement prematurely. “Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he can’t possibly know,” Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, wrote on Twitter. Mr. Comey’s move is also sure to prompt questions from Democrats. Most important among them: Why did Mr. Comey raise the specter of wrongdoing before agents had even read the emails, especially since it took only days to determine that they were not significant? Just hours before Mr. Comey sent the letter to Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats said hearings should be held to examine how Mr. Comey had handled the matter. After the letter’s release, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the Justice Department “needs to take a look at its procedures to prevent similar actions that could influence future elections. ” “There’s no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency’s inquiry,” she added. The F. B. I. director’s vague, brief announcement on Oct. 28 left Mrs. Clinton with few details to rebut and little time to do it. Many current and former F. B. I. agents and Justice Department officials said Mr. Comey had needlessly plunged the F. B. I. into the politics of a presidential election, with no clear way out. A long list of former Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. chided Mr. Comey. Despite the fact that the bureau did not find anything that changed its original conclusion about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Comey has insisted that he had no choice but to inform Congress about the new emails because the investigation had been completed and he had pledged transparency, according to senior F. B. I. officials. Because of Mr. Comey’s Oct. 28 letter, Attorney General Loretta Lynch made completing a review of the emails a top priority. Late last month, Mr. Comey ordered agents to work around the clock to sift through the messages. That process, senior F. B. I. officials said, was painstaking, because each message that had been sent to Mrs. Clinton had to be reviewed to determine whether it had sensitive national security materials. In Mr. Comey’s short letter to Congress on Sunday, he said he was “very grateful to the professionals at the F. B. I. for doing an extraordinary amount of   work in a short period of time. ”",0
11536,Will James Comey Change the Outcome of the Election?,"Will James Comey Change the Outcome of the Election? Is this the game-changing October surprise that many hope for -- and others dread? November 2, 2016 
Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
FBI Director James Comey’s reopening of the investigation into Clinton’s emails has roiled once more the presidential election. Donald Trump has called the decision “courageous” and “bigger than Watergate.” Clinton, the DOJ, Democrat Senators, and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champion’s defection, calling the announcement “appalling,” “absurd,” “strange,” “deeply troubling,” an “attack,” and “unprecedented.” The bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to Trump’s side and put him in the White House. 
There’s no doubt that Comey’s announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying. Not because it is “unprecedented” as the Democrats keep squealing. They had no such qualms when the weekend before the 1992 election, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh indicted a poll-surging George H.W. Bush for his alleged involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. No, the mystery is Comey’s motives. Is Comey like Conrad’s Lord Jim, now sacrificing his FBI career––sure to be over if the notoriously vengeful Clinton is elected–– to atone for having besmirched his office, reputation, and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist self-interest? Or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled FBI investigators? To quote one of our candidates, “At this point, what difference does it make?” 
The real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters. Right now we don’t know if the content of the 650,000 emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Clinton vizier Huma Abedin, will reveal something damning like, say, classified materials. But we already know that Clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server, which didn’t bother Comey back in July. So what could be in these new emails that rises above Comey’s sophistic “extreme carelessness,” and reaches the statute’s “gross negligence”? Or has Comey found new evidence of Hillary’s “intent,” his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law? There had to be something that made Comey subject himself to the scorched-earth wrath of the Democrats. 
Whatever is found on the Abedin laptop, one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters. They have shrugged off so many scandals, lies, and failures that should have sunk a candidacy, that it’s hard to calculate what level of incompetence, unpleasantness, dishonesty, sleaze, and crime is disqualifying anymore. Here are the greatest hits from Hillary’s catalogue: Whitewater Missing billing records from her tenure at the Rose Law Firm Renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to donors Travelgate Illegal possession of FBI files Conducting illegal secret meetings of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform Cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail Hounding the victims of her husband’s sexual assaults and philandering Stealing $200,000 worth of china, furniture, and artwork from the White House Claiming she landed under “sniper fire” in Bosnia Claiming she and Bill left the White House “dead broke” Shaking down Wall Street while assuring the Orcs of capitalism that she’s got their back Charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides Calling 30,000 missing emails “personal” communications Lying about the Benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead Americans’ families Supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure Internet video when she knew the same night that they weren’t Perjuring herself before Congress and the FBI about the emails and her private server The disastrous overthrow of Ghaddafi in Libya The disastrous “reset” with Russia The disastrous nuclear deal with Iran The disastrous withdrawal from Iraq The corrupt Clinton Foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary, the pay-to-play State Department Using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planet’s most brutally misogynistic regimes Serially flip-flopping on issues like same-sex marriage, the Trans Pacific Trade deal, and the Keystone pipeline Promising to “raise taxes on the middle class” and “put coal miners out of work” Her campaign staff’s dirty tricks against Trump and his supporters Her campaign staff’s incestuous relationship with the media Her staff’s illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation Her strong support of gruesome late-term abortions And, last but not least, the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health 
Back in the day, just a few of these gaffes, deceptions, and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for Congress, let alone the White House. 
And Mr. Trump’s offenses? He’s talks exactly as you’d expect a New York real estate developer, casino owner, reality television star, and beauty pageant mogul to talk He’s condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what Bill Clinton and every White-House-visiting rapper, movie star, or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity: “When you’re a star they let you do it,” as Trump bragged of his crude sexual advances He’s ignorant of policy He doesn’t understand the economics of global trade He doesn’t know what the “nuclear triad” is He’s addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives He wants to build a wall with Mexico He takes legal advantage of tax law He’s not “suitable” for office He does not have the right “temperament” He’s used bankruptcy as a business tool He’s accused of groping over a dozen women, including a polymorphously perverse porn star He’s mean and insulting He has orange hair 
In short, Trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices. Just ask Hillary’s various Secret Service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be. 
The voters will decide for themselves which candidate’s catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous. But whatever happens, it’s clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates. 
This transformation happened decades before Trump and Hillary came along. After Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the White House, his approval ratings were 73%. He left the White House with a 66% rating, higher than any president since Harry Truman, including Ronald Reagan. Think about it: the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the Soviet Union into its own dustbin of history. 
That was the inflection point for our political culture. No wonder that Barack Obama’s lack of any real-world experience or achievement, left-wing views, self-confessed drug use, friends like the anti-American racist Jeremiah Wright and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers, and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to 45 million voters. So why now are we shocked, shocked that off-brand candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying for the presidency? Decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue, wisdom, and decorum have already long gone. 
So absent a smoking howitzer in the next WikiLeaks dump, Comey’s restart of the investigation, which in any case will take months to complete, will probably not be the game-changing October surprise many hope for and others dread, especially given a corrupt media’s studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate. Then again, the rapid erosion of Hillary’s support is drawing analogies to Reagan’s late surge against Carter. 
Either way, on November 8, most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions, and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like “cares for people like me.” Or they might just finally realize that Hillary’s accumulated offenses are intolerable. But what that standard of selection will deliver is anybody’s guess.",0
11537,Republican Health Proposal Would Undermine Coverage for Pre-existing Conditions - The New York Times,"A new effort to pass the Republican health care bill has been propelled by an amendment that would allow states to waive certain insurance regulations in Obamacare. We examined the probable effects when the idea surfaced in April. Now that those ideas have become part of the legislative package, we’ve updated our analysis. Throughout the debate to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trump and Republican congressional leaders have insisted they would retain a crucial, popular part of the health law: the promise that people can buy insurance even if they’ve had illnesses in the past. Their efforts foundered in March, when a House health bill had to be pulled from the floor after it failed to attract enough support. But now, the bill appears back from the dead, because of a compromise meant to attract votes from the conservative Freedom Caucus. The proposed changes would effectively cast aside the Affordable Care Act’s protection of people with   conditions. The terms of the new amendment, go something like this: States would have the option to jettison two major parts of the Affordable Care Act’s insurance regulations. They could decide to opt out of provisions that require insurers to cover a standard, minimum package of benefits, known as the essential health benefits. And they could decide to do away with a rule that requires insurance companies to charge the same price to everyone who is the same age, a provision called community rating. In exchange, states would be required to set up special arrangements for   patients. The ability to opt out of the benefit requirements could substantially reduce the value of insurance on the market. A patient with cancer might, for example, still be allowed to buy a plan, but it wouldn’t do her much good if that plan  was not required to cover chemotherapy drugs. The second   would make the insurance options for those with   conditions even more meaningless. Technically, the deal would still prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with a history of illness. But without community rating, health plans would be free to charge those patients as much as they wanted. If both of the Obamacare provisions went away, the hypothetical cancer patient might be able to buy only a plan, without chemotherapy coverage, that costs many times more than a similar plan costs a healthy customer. Only cancer patients with extraordinary financial resources and little interest in the fine print would be likely to sign up. Under the amendment, customers would be subject to community rating only if they’d had a lapse in coverage of more than 63 days, but, in practice, the change would be likely to result in nearly everyone paying a price based on their health status, as Matt Fiedler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Obama administration official, has written. There is a reason that many conservatives want to do away with these provisions. Because they help people with substantial health care needs buy relatively affordable coverage, they drive up the price of insurance for people who are healthy. An insurance market that did not include cancer care  —   or even any cancer patients  —   would be one where premiums for the remaining customers were much lower. The result might be a market that is much more affordable for people with a clean bill of health. But it would become largely inaccessible to anyone who really needs help paying for medical care. We do not have to speculate to know what the world looks like without essential health benefits and community rating. It was how most state insurance markets worked before Obamacare. Back in 2009, most sick people who did not get insurance through work or a government program were excluded from coverage if they had a history of health problems like allergies or arthritis. Plans that did not cover pregnancy care or drug addiction treatment were widespread. (The data about individual market insurance premiums is a little spotty, but it appears that they were substantially lower in most states.) One idea Republicans have about how to care for the sick was also in effect  . Many states had “  pools,” where people shut out of the traditional insurance markets could buy special plans with the help of state subsidies. The Freedom Caucus proposal is likely to include some money that states could use to set up such pools. “The fundamental idea is that marginally sick people would pay with risk associated with their coverage,” Mr. Meadows said when the idea was first discussed. “Those that have, you know, premiums that would be driven up because of catastrophic illness or   illnesses, we’ve been dealing with that for a long time with   pools. ” But insurance in the old   pools tended to be expensive, and often came with long waiting periods or benefit limitations, even for the very sick. The main difference between the policy environment in 2009 and today is that the federal government would now be offering tax credits to help healthy people buy what would probably be relatively skimpy plans. That would mean that more   Americans would probably have health coverage than before the Affordable Care Act, since the combination of policies would tend to make insurance much more affordable for people who are young and healthy. What states would choose to do with this set of options is hard to predict. Before Obamacare, few states required community rating of health plans. And few states required insurers to cover all of the benefits deemed essential under Obamacare, though most did require a few types of treatments to be covered. State governments would face a difficult choice: either take away the requirements, and leave sick patients without insurance options, or keep them and see people unable to afford coverage under the new subsidy system. Under Obamacare, states can already waive many of the law’s insurance rules if they can show that an alternative program would cover as many people with comprehensive coverage at a lower cost to the government. But that standard is difficult to meet. Mr. Meadows has suggested that the waivers under discussion should be “very easily granted” to states. The language of the amendment requires little proof of effects from the states, and indicates that all applications would be considered presumptively approved after 60 days. The politics of health care in the United States have shifted since the Affordable Care Act was passed seven years ago. In recent months, the law has grown more popular, and the   conditions policy is among its   protections. That could create political pressure for states to keep the insurance rules, even if they are not required by law. But it is likely that at least some states might decide to eliminate them if they are made optional. Shifting norms about health insurance regulation may also affect the idea’s reception in Congress. The version of the health bill currently under discussion would retain the   conditions policy. But that would be true in only the most literal sense. The mix of policies could allow insurance companies to charge sick people prices that few of them could pay. And it could allow them to exclude benefits that many healthy people need when they get sick. The result could be a world where people with   conditions would struggle to buy comprehensive health insurance  —   just like before Obamacare.",0
11538,Ryan Lochte and Three Teammates Robbed at Gunpoint - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Ryan Lochte, an Olympic gold medalist in swimming, and three of his United States teammates were held up at gunpoint here early Sunday, according to the United States Olympic Committee, heightening anxiety over violent crime in the host city of the Summer Games. The American swimmers and United States Olympic officials provided few details about what happened, and the state police said they were trying Sunday night to learn more about the episode. Crime was already a top concern before the Rio Games began, as Brazil’s economic crisis deepened, pushing up unemployment and poverty rates. The Rio de Janeiro state government deployed a huge security force, and the streets surrounding the Olympic Park and the athletes’ village sometimes look like a military compound. Nonetheless, crimes have occurred more frequently than at other recent Olympics. On the night of the opening ceremony, the chief of security was mugged at knifepoint. Two coaches for Australia’s rowing team were attacked and robbed in the Ipanema neighborhood, while some Olympians were robbed of belongings in the athletes’ village during a fire drill. Bullets have landed in the equestrian venue, and a bus carrying members of the news media was attacked, its windows shattered. On Sunday, Rio Olympics officials were confronted with the most   crime yet. Besides Lochte, the other swimmers robbed, according to a statement from the committee, were Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen. “Their taxi was stopped by individuals posing as armed police officers who demanded the athletes’ money and other personal belongings,” a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee said. “All four athletes are safe and cooperating with authorities. ” The American swimmers robbed on Sunday had left a party at Club France, a French hospitality house established during the Rio Games in the upscale Lagoa neighborhood, the spokesman said. Hugo Sppezapria, a spokesman for Club France, confirmed that the swimmers had spent several hours at a party there, which began at 11:30 p. m. Saturday and lasted until 5 a. m. The party featured electronic house music, he said, and the group had attended to celebrate another swimmer’s birthday. He said the Americans had left around 3 a. m. Sppezapria distanced the party from the episode, saying that a police car had been stationed outside Club France all night. “It sounds like a rough situation,” he said. “But it didn’t happen here. ” The civil police in the state of Rio said they were investigating. One of the swimmers had spoken with the police, they said, and given a report of the episode. That swimmer, who was not named by the civil police, said he and his teammates were in a taxi when they were stopped and held up. He told the police he did not know precisely where the robbery took place. The civil police said the other swimmers would be asked to provide separate accounts. The police were also trying to track down the taxi driver. Bentz, one of the swimmers who was robbed, declined to comment when reached by The New York Times on Sunday. Lochte initially denied reports of the robbery through Olympic officials. He later told NBC News that one of the men had put a cocked gun to his head. “I think they’re all shaken up,” Ileana Lochte, the swimmer’s mother, told USA Today. “They just took their wallets, and basically that was it. ” Bentz and Conger participated in the heats of the   freestyle relay, but not the final. Feigen did the same in the   relay. Lochte won a gold medal in the   freestyle relay and finished fifth in the   individual medley, his only individual event. The swimming competition at the Rio Games had concluded Saturday night. At a news conference on Sunday, another American swimmer, Ryan Murphy, mentioned the security briefings the team had received before the Games. “I think we all trust our security guys, and they’ve done a great job,” he said. A spokesman for U. S. A. Swimming declined at the news conference to specify what instructions those briefings had provided but noted that they had included tips on transportation in Rio. Conflicting accounts of the taxi episode had swirled on Sunday morning, after a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee said that reports of the robbery were “absolutely not true,” citing information that had been provided by the United States committee. After Ileana Lochte’s statements that her son had indeed been robbed, the spokesman for the International Olympic Committee said he had simply passed along information from the American Olympic officials. Ryan Lochte did not respond Sunday to a request for comment. However, in a post on Instagram, he said, “While it is true that my teammates and I were the victims of a robbery early Sunday morning, what is most important is that we are safe and unharmed. ” David Marsh, Ryan Lochte’s coach, referred inquiries to U. S. A. Swimming, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Brazil’s minister of sport, Leonardo Picciani, seemed to suggest to reporters on Sunday that the swimmers bore some responsibility for venturing out beyond the heavily fortified Olympics zone. “Security in the Games has been absolutely efficient,” Picciani was quoted as saying by the newspaper Estadão. “The delegations have not had problems. Those who have bought tickets have not had problems. “Certainly no athletes have had problems in their places of accommodation, their training facilities and the athletes’ village. ”",0

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/soros-paid-al-gore-millions-to-push.html Liberal billionaire George Soros gave former Vice President Al Gore’s environmental group millions of dollars over three years to create a “political space for aggressive U.S. action” on global warming, according to leaked documents. A document published by DC Leaks shows Soros, a Hungarian-born liberal financier, wanted his nonprofit Open Society Institute (OSI) to do more to support global warming policies in the U.S. That included budgeting $10 million in annual support to Gore’s climate group over three years.“U.S. Programs Global Warming Grants U.S. Programs became engaged on the global warming issue about four years ago, at George Soros’s suggestion,” reads a leaked OSI memo.“There has been a budget of $11 million for global warming grants in the U.S. Programs budget for the last several years,” the memo reads. “This budget item captures George Soros’s commitment of $10 million per year for three years to Al Gore’s Alliance for Climate Protection, which conducts public education on the climate issue in pursuit of creating political space for aggressive U.S. action in line with what scientists say is necessary to put our nation on a path to reducing its outsize carbon dioxide emissions.”It’s unclear what year the memo was sent, but the Gore co-founded Alliance for Climate Protection (ACP) was established in 2006 and lasted until it became The Climate Reality Project in July 2011. In 2008, the Alliance launched a $300 million campaign to encourage “Americans to push for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,” The Washington Post reported . Global Warming is NOT caused by humans: 10 Prominent Scientists Refuting 'Manmade Global Warming' with Solid Research ACP got $10 million from the Open Society Institute (OSI) in 2008, according to the nonprofit’s tax filings. OSI handed over another $5 million to ACP in 2009, according to tax filings. The investigative reporting group ProPublica keeps a database that has OSI tax returns from 2000 to 2013. TheDCNF could not find other years where OSI gave money to ACP.OSI is primarily a grant-making nonprofit that hands out millions of dollars every year to mostly left-wing causes. Now called the Open Society Foundations, Soros’s nonprofit has handed out more than $13 billion over the last three decades.OSI didn’t only plan to fund Gore’s climate group to promote global warming policies in the U.S., OSI also planned on giving millions of dollars to spur the “youth climate movement.” Greenpeace Founder: Humans Not to Blame for Global Warming “This budget item also allows for the renewal of U.S. Programs’ long-standing support of the Energy Action Coalition, which is the lead organizer of the youth climate movement in the U.S., the memo reads.“We are also including a placeholder for an additional $2 million, pending discussion about and development of OSI’s global warming agenda,” the memo reads. “There is a memo from Nancy Youman in the strategic plans binder that recommends pathways forward for OSI on the climate issue – in the U.S., as well as in other parts of the Open Society Network.” By Michael Bastasch  ",0
11540,Trump Unveils Ethics Policy to Avoid Conflicts of Interest,"  Donald J. Trump and his transition team unveiled an extensive plan to avoid conflicts of interest between his private business empire and his public office at a press conference at Trump Town in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. [The plan was presented by Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney at the Morgan, Lewis and Bockius firm. The goal of the plan, she said, was to ensure that Americans could “rest assured that all of [Trump’s] efforts are directed to pursuing the people’s business and not his own. ” She said that Trump’s business empire was “not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became Vice President  —   but at that time, no one was so concerned. ”  While Trump would not divest himself entirely of his assets  —   a process, Dillon argued, that would itself involve conflicts of interest because of the people buying his assets or lending the money for their purchase  —   he had directed the attorneys at the firm to create a structure that would “completely isolate him from the management of the company. ” She pointed out that Trump’s plan was voluntary, since laws governing conflicts of interest did not apply to the president or vice president, but he wanted to avoid even an appearance of impropriety. The plan involves several major elements, the first of which is   Trump’s decision to place all of his business assets, liquid and illiquid, in a trust by the time he is sworn in Jan. 20, and to hand control of the family business to his sons, Eric and Donald, Jr. along with Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg. Trump himself would resign from all his posts in the family business, and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, would also resign from, and have “no further involvement with,” the Trump Organization, due to her husband, Jared Kushner, taking an advisory role in the White House. Furthermore, the management of the new family business entity, Dillon explained, would appoint an Ethics Advisor, whose written approval would be required for any dealing “that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns. ” The Trump Organization had also created the position of “Chief Compliance Counsel” to oversee conformity with ethics rules. Dillon also revealed that Trump had ordered that all of his pending business deals terminated, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. She added: “No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process. ” Trump would not have any role in such deals, but would only learn about them through the media like everyone else, in order to avoid the appearance of any conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization would only report profits and losses to Trump, not particular business details. She also argued that creating a blind trust would have been ineffective, since Trump knows what his “iconic assets” are, and that turning the Trump Organization into a   company would have been too lengthy and cumbersome to work. In answer to critics who argued that foreign payments to Trump’s businesses  —   such as hotel bills paid by overseas guests  —   violated the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, Dillon pointed out that the courts had never interpreted that clause to apply to fair market value exchanged for goods or services. Nevertheless, she said, Trump had arranged that any profits from foreign customers of the Trump hotel chain would be donated to the U. S. Treasury to prevent appearances of foreign influence. Critics might observe that all of the arrangements above are voluntary  —   that is, the chain of accountability is entirely within the Trump Organization. However, Dillon would likely argue Trump’s commitments exceed what is required under the law. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

11541,Executive Order: Trump Has No Choice but to Go to Supreme Court,"President Donald Trump responded swiftly to Thursday’s ruling by the Ninth Circuit upholding a temporary restraining order against his executive order restricting travel from   countries: “SEE YOU IN COURT. ”[Experts, like Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, suggest Trump should rescind the first order and issue a new one. If the original order were indeed a matter of pressing national security  —   which the Ninth Circuit doubted  —   that would reinforce the point.  According to that logic, there might only be two reasons for Trump to persist in appealing the Ninth Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court. One is that the Ninth Circuit ruling is so bad  —   it makes no reference to the underlying statute, and would give even a   hijacker the right to sue to come to the U. S.  —   that it deserves to be publicly rejected. However, it is not going to be persuasive to other courts, and would likely be overturned or limited to the facts of this particular case, eventually. The other reason for Trump to go to the Supreme Court is that he has said publicly said he would do so. He would lose some credibility, and perhaps suffer some embarrassment, were he to withdraw. Yet ego alone should not trump national security. But the reality is that Trump actually has no choice: he has to go to the Supreme Court, because the left would likely sue to stop any executive order he issued on the subject. Given the left’s determination to oppose anything and everything he does  —   even blocking new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from visiting a school on Friday  —   it is a safe bet that they would simply sue in a Ninth Circuit court again, and Trump would likely be forced to appeal to the Supreme Court in any case. So even if there is an extremely urgent national security threat, Trump might have to wait months, even to improve on the first order. And so it is ugly to say, but is likely true, that the courts may have increased the threat of terror to our country. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

11542,Re: The Drought That Was Prophesied To Hit The Southern United States Is Now Here,"The Drought That Was Prophesied To Hit The Southern United States Is Now Here   15th, 2016 
A record-setting drought has gripped the southern United States, but most people have no idea that this drought is the fulfillment of a prophecy that was given four years ago. Back in 2008, John Paul Jackson released a DVD entitled “ The Perfect Storm ” in which he detailed many of the prophetic events that God showed him would soon come to America. In 2012, he released a video update to “The Perfect Storm” that you can view on YouTube right here . In that update, he shared a list of future headlines that God had revealed to him over the years. Some of these headlines have already happened since that time, and now we are watching another be fulfilled right in front of our eyes. 
Specifically, I am referring to this headline: “Record High Temps Accompany Record Drought Swept South” . 
In an article entitled “ July’s Extreme Heat Breaks Records Across South “, weather.com detailed many of the high temperature records that have been broken in the South in recent months, but in this article I am going to focus on the crippling drought that is plaguing the region. 
In addition to the headline above, John Paul Jackson was shown several other headlines regarding drought and famine coming to America… 
“Drought Continues to Cause Prayer to Rise” 
“Demand for Classic Seeds Skyrockets” 
“Food Prices Lead Nation’s Escalating Inflation Woes” 
“Sysco and Kraft Consider Guards on Delivery Trucks as Food Nears 40% of the Family Budget” 
And of course John Paul Jackson is not the only one that has been shown that these things are coming to this nation. 
The following is a very small portion of what Terry Bennett was shown in April 2011 … 
I was also warned, by the appearing of the black horse and its rider, about famine. The angel said, “There will be a famine of food in your nation!” Not only this, but also the prices of food, particularly grains, will dramatically rise. We will see not only shortages and high prices, but I was shown significant starvation occurring during this time. Death followed this black horse! 
Dr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories of Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and she was also shown that famine is going to hit America … 
“I’m instructing my children to begin to fill up their storehouses before the famine strikes just as I instructed Joseph while he was in Egypt.” 
With those prophecies in mind, it is extremely alarming to see what is happening all across the southern portion of the United States right now. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor , most of the southern half of the country is experiencing some level of drought at this moment… 
The drought in California has been raging for quite some time, but what has surprised the experts is how dry it has been in the Southeast lately. The following is from an EcoWatch article entitled “ Record-Breaking Drought and Wildfires Plague Southeast “… 
The atmospheric spigots have been turned off across most of the U.S. over the last several weeks. According to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report from Nov. 10, more than 27 percent of the contiguous U.S. has been enveloped by at least moderate drought (categories D1 through D4). This is the largest percentage value in more than a year, since late October 2015 . 
The upward trend of the last month is worrisome given the outlook for the coming winter: Drier-than-average conditions are projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration across the southern half of the contiguous U.S., a frequent outcome during La Niña winters. 
To say that the drought in the Southeast is severe would be a tremendous understatement. At this point, some cities in the Southeast haven’t seen any measurable rain in about 50 days … 
No measurable rain (at least .01 inches) has been tallied at Birmingham’s Shuttlesworth International Airport since Sept. 18, approaching a two-month-long dry streak, topping their previous longest dry streak on record – 52 straight days – from fall 1924. 
Nine minutes of sprinkles Nov. 4 and another bout of sprinkles on Oct. 16 has been the entirety of Birmingham’s rainfall so far this fall. 
Anniston, Alabama, and Rome, Georgia, have dry streaks now approaching 50 days. 
And unfortunately, it appears that there is not going to be any substantial rain for the region any time soon … 
There are no signs of any significant rainfall through the end of the month across the Southeast, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity said. 
The region needs days and weeks of a steady, soaking rain to completely eliminate the drought. 
“Things will only get worse before they get better,” Margusity explained. 
Whenever conditions are this dry, it is inevitable that there will be wildfires. 
Right now more than 100 major wildfires are raging across the Southeast, and some of the worst are in the mountains of North Carolina. 
As you read this article, more than 1,000 firefighters are battling dozens of large wildfires in the North Carolina mountains. Governor Pat McCrory is referring to these fires as “ California wildfires in North Carolina “, and he is not exaggerating one bit. 
If what we are witnessing is truly the beginning of the fulfillment of what God showed John Paul Jackson, Terry Bennett and Patricia Green, then we should expect drought conditions to continue to intensify in the months ahead. 
And as you can see above, they are saying that things will eventually get so bad that famine will strike America. 
Most of us couldn’t imagine something like that ever happening in this nation. But these are men and women of God with very long track records. As I noted above, Dr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories by Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and John Paul Jackson has a track record of correctly fulfilled prophecies that is exceedingly long. 
As I end this article, I also want to remind everyone of what God showed Heidi Baker regarding the future of America not too long ago … 
I saw bread lines, soup kitchens, and I saw people wearing beautiful clothing. Their clothing was not worn out. Now in my nation when people are hungry you can tell. I mean they are in shredded rags. They don’t have shoes or they have flip flops. Most of them [have] no shoes. They are hungry and they know they are hungry. They come for food, not because they are beggars, but because they are hungry. 
These days a lot of Americans have become complacent and are feeling pretty good about things. 
But the events that are warned about in this article are coming, and I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can.",0
11543,Did You Know Beer Is Healthier Than Milk?,"posted by Eddie “Beer adds longevity and strengthens bones, whereas milk causes obesity, diabetes, and cancer.” – PETA Yes! You read it right. And this is not a hoax. People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has approved in Madison, America’s Dairy Land that Beer is indeed healthier than milk. PETA is leaving no stone unturned in its campaign to promote ‘Beer over Milk.’ It’s noteworthy that, PETA is targeting youth and teenagers to become part of this campaign. It might be aiming at to save the animals, but the facts which PETA has shared about beer over milk are quite interesting. You might be thinking how come beer becomes healthier? Well, that’s one great story, my friend, and with the proofs which cannot be challenged. Last time when ‘beer’ took over food was in the 1930’s. The Great Depression got 100,000 people unemployed only in New York City, and the only thing which forced people to come out on the streets for something was the ‘paid jobs.’ And jobs were rare, and morale was low. In this time of struggle, the one thing which drove the masses to the streets of NY City was Beer . The reason behind the march was the government’s move to impose a tax on beer. At that time around early 1932, showman Jimmy Walker led the beer for taxation March, which became famous as “We Want Beer.” Since then, many researchers are working to make beer a household drink… And it seems like they’ve succeeded in making it one of the most commonly served drinks around the world. Today, if you’ll go to any bar and ask for a beer, you’d never have to hear a ‘No’ in the answer. Many ‘ Branded Beers ‘ are serving the purpose. Alcohol in moderation is good for your health. There’s nothing wrong with the consumption of alcohol if done in moderation. But there’s no sense in having dairy products that can harm your health. Moreover, it’s the animals who suffer most. Watch the one-minute video that we’ve for you in the climax of this story. Here’s how beer can help you. Consumption of dairy products is a matter of serious health issues like diabetes, obesity, excess-mucus, heart disease, etc. On the other hand, beer is known for saving bones from brittle, and according to Harvard Medical School, more than 100 prospective studies show that moderate consumption of alcohol can not only lower the risk of heart attack, but it can also prevent you from gallstones and Type 2 diabetes. Thanks to PETA for highlighting the research. It’s official: Beer is better than milk. A lot of social organizations and activists have accused PETA of promoting beer over milk and also for encouraging the younger generation to opt for it. In reply, PETA answered: we also recommend juices, soy, and mineral water, then why to create hype over beer? PETA organization added on their website: “Had we used soda instead of beer, there would have been no media interest in the campaign, of course. PETA urges everyone, beer-drinkers included, to drink responsibly. Where milk is concerned, there’s no such thing!” So, when’s your plan to go on a date with Beer? Drink beer, but drink responsibly.” Let me tell you one thing clearly; there’s nothing bad about beer if you know when to stop. Alcohol consumption is considered a bad habit and has been banned it in certain states as people consume it in excess which eventually leads to broken marital relationships, and domestic altercation. Beer is accepted worldwide, and the matter of concern is: how responsibly we consume it. So, let’s conclude it here and when you go out next time with your friends, drink beer sha. Source:",0

Obi-Wan Kenobi has reported a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. 
The wise old man felt the disturbance whilst chatting to his young apprentice and felt a sudden need for a sit down, muttering ‘something terrible has happened’. 
Jedi Master Kenobi, who fought with Bail Organa in the Clone Wars, is currently uncertain of the cause of the disturbance but suggests some sort of planet-busting doomsday event may have occurred. 
“I’m hoping it’s just a giant space-laser obliterating an entire civilisation; that’s probably the least-worst possible cause,” he confirmed. 
“Failing that, it’s likely something dark side-y. Some kinda of colossal use of the mind trick, maybe?

11545,"Joe McKnight, Former Jets Player, Killed in Possible Road Rage Episode - The New York Times","Joe McKnight, who played three seasons for the Jets and was a standout at the University of Southern California, was fatally shot in Louisiana on Thursday in a possible episode of road rage, the authorities said. McKnight, 28, was shot “multiple times,” Col. John N. Fortunato, a spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, said in an interview. The shooting occurred around 2:45 p. m. at Behrman Highway and Holmes Boulevard in Terrytown, La. about five miles southeast of New Orleans, the office said in a statement. McKnight was pronounced dead at the scene. A suspect, Ronald Gasser, 54, was taken into custody at the scene and was being questioned by detectives, the sheriff’s office said. The events leading up to the shooting were not immediately clear but the office said it may be related to “a possible road rage incident. ” The Jets, for whom McKnight played from 2010 to 2012, wrote on Twitter: “Rest in peace, Joe McKnight. Our thoughts and condolences are with his loved ones. ” Others also reacted on Twitter: McKnight arrived at Southern California as one of the more promising recruits in the nation, eliciting comparisons to the former Trojans star Reggie Bush, but his production never matched the hype. The Jets, seduced by his speed and versatility, traded up to select him in the fourth round of the 2010 draft. McKnight had trouble cracking the Jets’ running back rotation but revealed value as a returner, running back kickoffs for touchdowns in 2011 and 2012, his final full season with the team. He spent three seasons with the team, starting once in 39 games and gaining 505 yards rushing and 177 receiving. In 2011, his 31. 6 yards per kickoff return led the N. F. L. and his   touchdown in Baltimore remains the longest play in team history. The end of his tenure with the Jets was defined by turbulence: a failed conditioning test, an arrest on traffic warrants and a concussion. The team released him among their final cuts in August 2013, and McKnight played only two more games in the N. F. L. both with Kansas City in 2014. McKnight continued his career in the Canadian Football League, where he started in February and played with the Edmonton Eskimos and, most recently, the Saskatchewan Roughriders.",0
11546,Study: Moral Outrage ’Alleviates Guilt’ over People’s Own Moral Failings - Breitbart,"A recent psychological study concluded that moral outrage is sometimes a symptom of personal guilt rather than genuine empathy for the situation of others. [The study, which was conducted by Bowdoin psychology Professor Zachary Rothschild and University of Southern Mississippi psychology Professor Lucas A. Keefer, concludes that the research on guilt suggests that moral outrage over   issues is sometimes  .  According to the study: Feelings of guilt are a direct threat to one’s sense that they are a moral person and, accordingly, research on guilt ﬁnds that this emotion elicits strategies aimed at alleviating guilt that do not always involve undoing one’s actions. Furthermore, research shows that individuals respond to reminders of their group’s moral culpability with feelings of outrage at    . These findings suggest that feelings of moral outrage, long thought to be grounded solely in concerns with maintaining justice, may sometimes reflect efforts to maintain a moral identity. Rothschild and Keefer conducted an experiment in which they assessed the relationship of various emotions. The first portion of their research concluded that the level of a subject’s personal guilt uniquely predicted that individual’s level of moral outrage in response to a controversial stimulus. “Study 1 showed that personal guilt uniquely predicted moral outrage at corporate   and support for retributive punishment,” the research concludes. Based on their findings, the study’s authors argue that “outrage driven by moral identity concerns serves to compensate for the threat of personal or collective immorality. ” According to the research’s abstract, one of the several studies conducted by Rothschild and Keefer concluded that outrage is often driven by a desire to affirm a certain moral identity in an unrelated societal context: “Study 5 showed that   outrage was attenuated by an affirmation of moral identity in an unrelated context. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

11547,Aussie Muslims Demand ’Safe Spaces’ so Followers Can Vent Extremist Views,"An Australian Islamic group wants   “safe spaces” provided for young Muslims to discuss “inflammatory” issues away from broader public scrutiny. [In a submission to an Australian parliamentary inquiry into freedom of religion, the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) said such   forums enabled opinions to be “respectfully and intelligently debated and challenged” while also helping to combat alleged “mental health” problems in the young Muslim community in the State of Victoria.  The ICV claimed “Muslim Victorians experience religious intolerance in the form of Islamophobia, racial abuse and breaches of our universal human rights. ” The alleged inability of Muslim adherents to safely practice their religion without feeling subject to surveillance is a “human rights issue,” according to the ICV. The call comes just days after    Somali refugee Yacub Khayre took a hostage, killed a man, and wounded three police officers in Melbourne. The terrorist explicitly dedicated the attack to the Islamic State and   while Islamic State swiftly claimed him as a “soldier” of the caliphate. ICV spokesman Adel Salman said they did not consider the “safe space” proposal controversial, because it is a practice he claimed  —   without providing evidence  —   is already used with young people in other countries. “This is about good practice because the youth require an avenue to express their views in a safe environment  …     where they feel their views are valued, where they can be respectfully challenged and counter views presented,” Mr. Salman said. He said such spaces would be “conducted with experts who are familiar with the methodology, and understand the way the conversation can be guided”. Victoria State Premier Daniel  Andrews ruled out any possibility of funding such an initiative. “I am very troubled by the suggestion that we might have a space where people could be radical as part of a   programme. That makes no sense to me whatsoever”.  ",0
11548,Movie Theaters Hosting Screenings of ’1984’ to Protest Trump,"Dozens of cinemas across the United States are planning to screen the film adaption of George Orwell’s 1984 in protest of reports that President Donald Trump is allegedly considering cuts to arts funding. [The film, starring the late John Hurt, will be screened on April 4, the date in the book in which Smith begins his rebellion against Big Brother, the   eye of the fascist regime.  The 1949 novel follows the struggles of Winston Smith, a man living in a totalitarian police state, and has become culturally iconic as a symbol of fascist regimes. Leading independent cinemas including the Alamo Drafthouse, IFC Center, and Film Society of Lincoln Center have all signed up to host screenings, according to the Independent. Although the theater protests form part of a wider opposition to Donald Trump’s agenda, the group behind the effort says its goal is to push back against the Trump administration’s reported plans to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. “The endeavor encourages theaters to take a stand for our most basic values: freedom of speech, respect for our fellow human beings, and the simple truth that there are no such things as ‘alternative facts’. By doing what they do best  —   showing a movie  —   the goal is that cinemas can initiate a   community conversation at a time when the existence of facts and basic human rights are under attack,” reads a statement from the project’s website. “Through nationwide participation and strength in numbers, these screenings are intended to galvanize people at the crossroads of cinema and community, and bring us together to foster communication and resistance against current efforts to undermine the most basic tenets of our society,” it continues. Since Trump’s inauguration, Amazon revealed that sales of the book 1984 have risen significantly.   You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
11549,New York City Ballet Savors the City of Light - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   On Saturday, the New York City Ballet will wrap up a     season at Théâtre du Châtelet here, the company’s longest international tour to one city since 1976. City Ballet was presented by Les Etés de la Danse, an annual summer festival that brings dance companies  —   often American ones  —   to the French capital. “I spent a lot of time here with Balanchine, listening to him talk about his experiences in Paris,” said Peter Martins, the company’s ballet master in chief, referring to George Balanchine, the   of City Ballet, whose groundbreaking choreography forms the backbone of the company’s repertory. “Balanchine didn’t get good reviews here they liked Jerry Robbins, and Balanchine knew that,” Mr. Martins added. “So our first week was all Balanchine because I wanted to say, this choreographer is not only arguably the greatest choreographer in history, but our choreographer. ” The logistics are impressive: 150 people came from New York, including 94 dancers an additional 60 board members and patrons came for the opening and a gala dinner. Four sea freight containers were sent, containing costumes, scenery, props, lighting booms, physical therapy equipment, orchestra music and stage management supplies. (These include floor tape, tissues, ammonia, mops, Sharpies, bandages and Altoids.) Houses have been full, critics have been fulsome, and audiences rapturously appreciative. Meanwhile, the dancers have been enjoying Parisian life, sightseeing on their days off, hanging out in cafes and occasionally proposing marriage. Here are some snapshots of City Ballet in Paris, and edited excerpts from conversations with the dancers. Justin Peck, a soloist with City Ballet as well as its resident choreographer, came to Paris a month earlier than his colleagues to work with the Paris Opera Ballet. His “Entre Chien et Loup” for Paris Opera has been running at the same time as the City Ballet season. “It’s my first experience working in Europe, and it has been so nice to be living here and not feel so much like a tourist,” Mr. Peck said over a coffee on Monday. “I stayed in the Marais, which was great because I could walk to work every day. Sometimes I did class with the Paris Opera Ballet, other times I’d warm up by myself and listen to my music to get into the right head space. “Basically in any off time, I’ve tried to eat my way through Paris. I’d go with [the choreographer] Bill Forsythe, who was also working at the Opera, to this great French place near the Palais Garnier, and I have a favorite   new wave place. ” He added: “The Picasso and Rodin museums are my favorites, but it’s crazy, because I’ve been here for so long, and I keep thinking I’m going to get to things. Now it’s the last week, and there is so much I still haven’t done. ” Dancing at Châtelet was a homecoming for Robert Fairchild, a City Ballet principal who starred in Christopher Wheeldon’s production of “An American in Paris,” which appeared at the Châtelet in 2014 before opening on Broadway in April 2015. “The first day, after class, we ran over to the stage, and I got the chills seeing that house again,” said Mr. Fairchild, who left the show in March. “But I’ve tried not to compare the experiences. One was making a Broadway show here we were in the theater all day long, and you only went out to get a sandwich. This time has been more about living here and doing things in Paris. It’s nice to be here with Tiler [Peck, Mr. Fairchild’s wife, also a City Ballet principal]. We also went back to a lovely restaurant at the top of the Musée du Quai Branly, because after I proposed we had gone there for dinner, but we were so tired that we were falling asleep at the table. It was good to go back there and be awake this time!” “I feel almost Parisian by now!” Ms Hyltin said after company class on Monday. “I’m on the Metro, I know where I’m going, I’m practically a local. I go for lunch every day to one place, because I love their  . This one is so big that I keep a third of it to eat just before the show. ” Ms. Hyltin said that the rehearsal schedule was as intensive as it is in New York, partly because the company is preparing for its annual summer season in Saratoga Springs, immediately after the Paris tour. She has performed almost every night, but has made the most of company days off. “I’ve been up the Eiffel Tower to the Musée d’Orsay the Rodin museum a great architectural museum, Cité de l’Architecture et du Patrimoine and to   twice,” she said, adding that she loved the Rodin especially, “looking at the musculature and elegance of those sculptures. It really hit me how rich the culture is here everywhere you look there is history. ” Mr. Martins doesn’t teach company class every day, but when he does, there is always a   turnout of dancers, and on Tuesday morning, almost 90 bodies were crammed into the studio space at Théâtre de la Ville, where the dancers do their daily class and rehearse. (It’s across the plaza from Châtelet.) Mr. Martins gives   instructions, indicating steps by motioning silently with his hands the dancers seem to pick it up by osmosis or telepathy. Unusual rhythmic accents and quick differences in dynamics (from fast to slow, sharp to soft) give some clues about why the City Ballet style is so specific to this company. The dancers worked with concentration, finishing with a partnering sequence. “I notice how hard you work,” Mr. Martins told a corps de ballet dancer after the class. “I always notice. ” Silas Farley, a corps de ballet dancer, proposed to Cassia Wilson, a dancer with Ballet Austin, on Sunday. (She accepted.) On Monday, Mr. Farley recounted the story. “Cassia’s favorite movie is ‘Funny Face,’ and her sister suggested that I propose at the Château de la Reine Blanche, which is in it. I didn’t tell her where we were going, and we took the train out there. It was picture perfect, sunny, blue sky, blue lake, swans. We had lunch there, and at one point I told our waiter, I’m going to propose, please take my phone and video it. Then I got down on one knee in front of the chateau and asked Cassia to marry me. The waiter got it perfectly he turned out to be a wedding photographer in his spare time!” Indiana Woodward, a corps dancer, is half French and came to Paris to stay with her father during every school break while growing up. She said she had always dreamed of performing with City Ballet for her French family. “My face hurt from smiling after the first show I danced here,” she said. “And I’m staying at home, in my room!” Ms. Woodward said she had taken her City Ballet friends to all her top Paris spots  —   the Jardin du Luxembourg, a small park at the top of Montmartre, the banks of Seine  —   and handed out “a giant list of vintage shops. ” Paris, she added, feels more relaxed than New York. “People sit around having a coffee. You take that for granted when you are here. ” Craig Hall, a soloist, is retiring this season and performing some of his last shows in Paris, although he will remain with the company as a ballet master. “It’s a really great way to end off,” he said, as he, Lauren Lovette and Brittany Pollack set off for the Île   in search of the famed Berthillon ice cream. Ms. Lovette, a principal, said that she had visited the Normandy war memorial on an off day, and had been very moved at the sight of thousands of graves. “It’s part of our history too,” she added. She had a more upbeat excursion to the Champagne region to visit Ruinart, which supplies the bubbly stuff to City Ballet. “They gave us an amazing vintage Champagne to try, then more over lunch,” she said. “Probably not so wise of us, but we figured, we’re in France!”",0
11550,Nigerian Girl Abducted by Boko Haram From Chibok Is Found - The New York Times,"LAGOS, Nigeria  —   One of the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram more than two years ago during a mass abduction at a school in Nigeria has been found, community leaders in the area said on Wednesday. The girl, Amina Ali, was wandering in the forest when members of a vigilante group lying in wait to ambush a Boko Haram camp came across her, said Aboku Gaji, a local vigilante commander. The kidnapping of nearly 300 girls during exam time at their boarding school in the Nigerian town of Chibok shocked the world and helped galvanize pressure on the government to fight Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group that has terrorized parts of northern Nigeria for years. Some girls managed to escape shortly after the fighters stormed their school and hauled their classmates away. But Ms. Ali is the first girl to be found since the early days of the episode. More than 200 girls who were taken from the school on April 14, 2014, are still missing. The mass abduction was one of the most notorious acts by a group that has rampaged through the north of Nigeria, burning entire villages and carrying out rapes, beheadings, lootings and other acts of violence. The inability to find and rescue the girls has been a political embarrassment for President Muhammadu Buhari and for the Nigerian military, which has made recent gains in fighting Boko Haram and releasing entire towns from its control. Mr. Buhari planned to meet with Ms. Ali in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, on Thursday. A military spokesman on Wednesday said that one of the Chibok girls was among a group of people rescued by troops, claiming credit for the recovery. According to the vigilante commander, Ms. Ali was with a baby and a man described as her husband. The commander said that the husband had been captured by militants as well, and that the two married while being held by Boko Haram. The couple apparently escaped the militants’ camp. But in a news release late Wednesday, the military said the man was in fact a suspected Boko Haram terrorist who claimed to be the girl’s husband. The release described Ms. Ali as a nursing mother with a    baby, a girl named Safiya. Members of the vigilante group took Ms. Ali to Chibok, where her mother saw her and confirmed her identity, Mr. Aboku said. Other members of the community of Chibok also confirmed that Ms. Ali had been found. She told her family that the other girls from Chibok were still in the forest but that six of them had died. Ms. Ali was in the custody of the Nigerian military in the town of Damboa, according to Mr. Aboku. Hassan Usman, a Chibok resident whose niece is among the abducted schoolgirls, said he had seen the rescued girl arrive in Chibok in a car driven by local vigilante members from the neighboring town of Mbalala, where her family lives. The vigilantes took Ms. Ali to the marketplace in the town’s center, the same place a suicide bombing took place earlier this year. “She was so happy to see her people,” Mr. Usman said. “People were so happy, so happy that, yes, there is hope these girls are alive. And once the government puts more effort, we will see some of them. ” Some local residents who saw her started crying. Holding her baby, Ms. Ali talked with residents for about a   telling them she had been held in a village in the Sambisa Forest along with about 60 other female captives. Some of them were her classmates from Chibok others were from other communities. American officials have said that clusters of the schoolgirls have been located at times using a combination of local intelligence gathering, intercepted communications and drone footage. But rescue operations have not been carried out, the officials said, because of fears that any ensuing battle with Boko Haram fighters would put the captives at risk, or incite retaliation against hostages still being held in other areas. Mr. Usman said the rescued girl had described how Boko Haram tried to shield the hostages from aerial surveillance. “Anytime they sighted a fighter jet or any helicopter or military aircraft, they hide them under the ground so that it will prevent the military from seeing,” she told villagers, Mr. Usman said. Ms. Ali was able to escape because the military began bombing the forest and the militants scattered, leaving her unguarded. Nigeria’s military this month launched a push into Sambisa called “Operation Sambisa Crackdown. ” Ms. Ali was in the custody of the Nigerian military and being taken to Maiduguri for questioning, according to the military.",0
11551,"Larry Colburn, Who Helped Stop My Lai Massacre, Dies at 67 - The New York Times","Larry Colburn, who became an    American hero when he intervened with two comrades to halt the massacre of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by United States soldiers in 1968, elevating an innocuous hamlet named My Lai into a watchword for the horrors of war, died on Tuesday at his home in Canton, Ga. He was 67. The cause was liver cancer, his wife, Lisa, said. Mr. Colburn was the last surviving member of a   helicopter crew that was assigned to hover over My Lai on Saturday morning, March 16, 1968, to identify enemy positions by drawing Vietcong fire. Instead, the men encountered an eerie quiet and a macabre landscape of dead, wounded and weaponless women and children as a platoon of American soldiers, ostensibly hunting elusive Vietcong guerrillas, marauded among defenseless noncombatants. The crew dropped smoke flares to mark the wounded, “thinking the men on the ground would come assist them,” Mr. Colburn told Vietnam Magazine in 2011. “When we would come back to those we marked,” he said, “we’d find they were now dead. ” Audaciously and on his own initiative, the pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr. swooped down and landed the copter. “Mr. Thompson was just beside himself,” Mr. Colburn recalled in an interview in 2010 for the PBS program “The American Experience. ” “He got on the radio and just said, ‘This isn’t right, these are civilians, there’s people killing civilians down here.’ And that’s when he decided to intervene. He said, ‘We’ve got to do something about this, are you with me?’ And we said, ‘Yes.’ ” Mr. Thompson confronted the officer in command of the rampaging platoon, Lt. William L. Calley, but was rebuffed. He then positioned the helicopter between the troops and the surviving villagers and faced off against another lieutenant. Mr. Thompson ordered Mr. Colburn to fire his   machine gun at any soldiers who tried to inflict further harm. “Y’all cover me!” Mr. Thompson was quoted as saying. “If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them. Promise me!” “You got it boss,” Mr. Colburn replied. “Consider it done. ” Mr. Thompson, Mr. Colburn and Glenn Andreotta, the copter’s crew chief, found about 10 villagers cowering in a makeshift bomb shelter and coaxed them out, then had them flown to safety by two Huey gunships. They found an    boy clinging to his mother’s corpse in an irrigation ditch and plucked him by the back of his shirt and delivered him to a nun in a nearby hospital. Crucially, they reported what they had witnessed to headquarters, which ordered a  . By then, as many as 500 villagers had been killed. Would Mr. Colburn have fired at his fellow Americans? “How could I ever be prepared for something like that?” he replied years later. “Would I have? I guess that’s the $64, 000 question, isn’t it?” Seymour M. Hersh, the independent journalist who later uncovered the My Lai massacre, said of Mr. Colburn in a phone interview on Friday that “for a door gunner in Vietnam to point his machine gun at an American officer” under those circumstances “was in the greatest tradition of American integrity. ” Lawrence Manley Colburn was born on July 6, 1949, in Coulee Dam, Wash. His father, Harry, a World War II veteran, was a civil engineer who had helped build the Grand Coulee Dam. His mother, the former Catherine Manley, was a homemaker. His father died when Larry was 15. An altar boy, he attended Roman Catholic elementary and junior high schools and a public high school, where, after an altercation with an assistant principal, he was suspended for two weeks. Rather than return to school, he joined the Army. Because he was 17, he needed his mother’s permission. He earned his high school equivalency diploma in the Army before being shipped to Vietnam in December 1967. The full extent of the gang rapes, massacre and mutilations by Charlie Company in My Lai and another hamlet, on the South Central Coast, was not exposed until two months after Mr. Colburn was discharged. A Pulitzer   report by Mr. Hersh for The Dispatch News Service in November 1969 provoked international outrage and eventually resulted in charges against more than a dozen officers. Only one, however, was convicted: Lieutenant Calley, for the murder of 22 civilians. He was sentenced to life imprisonment but ended up serving only three and a half years under house arrest at Fort Benning, Ga. Mr. Colburn entered Green River College in Auburn, Wash. on the G. I. Bill but struggled academically and financially and quit before graduating to become a commercial fisherman in Alaska. He later moved to Oregon, where he met Lisa Cale, a student at Eastern Oregon State College. They married in 1985 and moved to Atlanta, where he sold orthopedic rehabilitation equipment. She survives him, along with their son, Connor, and his sisters, Sheila Beal, Mary Jones and Colleen Capestany. My Lai became a paradigm for unbridled brutality and an object lesson in battlefield ethics, but the crewmen whose audacious intervention prevented even more bloodshed were largely forgotten. Their heroism was acknowledged with Bronze Stars, which they considered inappropriate recognition: The Bronze Star is awarded for bravery under enemy assault, they reasoned, and they had demonstrated courage in the face of friendly fire. After the investigations and trial, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Colburn received something else, too: hate mail. “One of the most infuriating things is being called a   as if we went and ratted someone out,” Mr. Colburn told Vietnam Magazine. “That is completely false there was no   going on. We were right in their face at My Lai. We were ready to confront those people then and there. And we did, the best we could. ” In the late 1980s, after seeing Mr. Thompson interviewed on a television documentary, David Egan, a professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, began a crusade to recognize, belatedly, the crew’s actions. Trent Angers, the author of “The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story” (1999) told The Associated Press that Mr. Colburn had “stood up, shoulder to shoulder with Hugh and Glenn, to oppose and stand down against those who were committing crimes against humanity. ” “Without his assistance,” he added, “Hugh might not have done what he did. ” In 1998, 30 years after the massacre, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Colburn were awarded the Soldier’s Medal, which is granted for lifesaving bravery not involving direct contact with an enemy. “It is my solemn wish that we all never forget the tragedy and brutality of war,” Mr. Colburn said at the ceremony, held at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. “I would like to quote Gen. Douglas MacArthur: ‘The soldier, be he friend or foe, is charged with the protection of the weak and the unarmed.’ ” Mr. Thompson and Mr. Colburn walked the short distance to the memorial, where they made a rubbing of the inscribed name of Mr. Andreotta, who was killed in Vietnam three weeks after the massacre. He was awarded the Soldier’s Medal posthumously. The two men returned to My Lai that year, meeting some of the villagers they had rescued and dedicating an elementary school. On the flight home, Mr. Colburn recalled, he turned to Mr. Thompson and said, “It was so good to see all those little kids smiling again, not having to worry about being blown up, not having to be looking over their shoulders all the time, just being able to be kids. ” Mr. Thompson died of cancer in 2006 at 62. Two years later, on the 40th anniversary of the massacre, Mr. Colburn returned to Vietnam and was reunited with Do Ba, who as a boy had been rescued by Mr. Colburn from an irrigation ditch.",0

11553,Both Trump And Clinton Went To Jeffrey Epstein’s Sex Slave Island.,"One Twitter user once asked me, “Is it too much to hope that *one* of our parties would pick someone with no links to a pedophile sex-slave island?” 
Apparently, it is too much to ask for. 
Both presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton have ties to convicted pedophile and Democratic donor, billionaire Jeffery Epstein and “Sex Slave Island.” 
Note: President Bill Clinton is not merely the husband of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, either. Bill is currently campaigning for his wife, plus Hillary recently unveiled that Bill with be in charge of “ revitalizing the economy ” if she were to take office. 
It has been uncovered that Clinton, known for his trouble-making libido, has even stronger ties to Epstein than previously reported. As noted by The Free Beacon , “Clinton was aboard the infamous Lolita Express owned by a billionaire pedophile at least 26 times,” not the initially reported 11 times. 
Fox News reports : 
Clinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls…Official flight logs filed with the Federal Aviation Administration show Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 U.S. Secret Service agents. However, on a five-leg Asia trip between May 22 and May 25, 2002, not a single Secret Service agent is listed. 
The Republican presumptive nominee apparently got in on the action, too. Trump’s ties to Epstein — a man Trump once called a “terrific guy” — and Sex Slave Island have been chronicled by The Daily Wire here . 
Per The Political Insider, Trump is accused of threatening and raping a 13-year-old girl on the private island . Epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct. The lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the Trump camp, alleging that the filing is a “hoax” and that there is “no evidence” that the plaintiff in question “actually exists.” 
Sex Slave Island, sometimes referred to as “Orgy Island,” (both lovely names), is one deranged place, allegedly rife with solicited sex, often from minors “ groomed ” by Epstein. 
“Terrific guy” Epstein, of course, was convicted for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008; the billionaire served 13 months in prison.

11555,Top Aide to Hillary Clinton Urges the FBI to Disclose what it Knows about Trump's Russia Ties,"23 Shares
4 18 0 1
A top aide to Hillary Clinton urged the FBI on Tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between Donald Trump and Russia, accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into Clinton's email practices while staying quiet about the Republican presidential candidate.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that Trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with Russian people or businesses, but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation, according to sources familiar with the matter. The agency has not publicly discussed the probe.
A week before Election Day, the Clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by FBI Director James Comey on Friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.
Clinton has voiced confidence the FBI will not find anything problematic.
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook questioned why the FBI director had not released any information about the agency's Russia inquiries.

Not Much and Here's Why Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted ""If you're in the business of releasing information about investigations on presidential candidates, release everything you have on Donald Trump. Release the information on his connections to the Russians,"" Mook said on CNN.
The FBI inquiry reviewed allegations that Trump or his associates might have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or engaged in contacts or commerce with people in Russia who are subject to U.S. or international financial sanctions.
The U.S. government has blamed Russia for cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations. Democrats criticize Trump for taking what they say is a pro-Russia foreign policy stance.
Russia's possible role in the campaign again came into focus when online magazine Slate said a group of computer scientists had been alarmed by records showing thousands of apparent connection attempts between an email server operated on behalf of the Trump Organization and computers inside a Russian company, Alfa Bank in Moscow.
Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the server, which had been used to send out hotel marketing material, had been dormant for years.
Prominent U.S. cyber security company FireEye said it had been hired by Alfa Bank to investigate the records and had been granted access to the bank’s systems in Moscow to look for evidence of any relationship with Trump’s company or any signs of hacking or infection. FireEye said so far it had found no emails being sent back and forth or any other link.",0
11556,Suburban Women Find Little to Like in Donald Trump’s Debate Performance - The New York Times,"WEST CHESTER, Pa.  —   Donald J. Trump badly needed to make an impression on women like Nancy Groux in Monday’s presidential debate. She is an undecided Republican who hungers for change in Washington and thinks business experience would be an asset in the Oval Office. In the light of Tuesday morning, it was clear that he had made an impression  —   but not a good one. Waiting here for a dress shop to open, Ms. Groux, 60, said that she thought that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had been “presidential” in the debate, but that Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, had come across like a “bull in a china closet. ” “I truly want to like him,” she said. “I keep looking for something in him. But I can’t have my children grow up and look at him as someone to respect. ” The first of three scheduled presidential debates was the talk of suburban West Chester on Tuesday, and there was much to chew over between bites of pastry and sips of coffee on Church Street: Mr. Trump’s demeanor as he loudly talked over Mrs. Clinton and hectored her with interruptions her smirks and grim stares as she looked at Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton’s intense denunciation of Mr. Trump over his denigration of women, after he questioned her “stamina” in the debate’s final moments. Ms. Groux, who works at a flower shop in West Chester, faulted Mr. Trump for refusing to release his taxes, and for what she called a shallowness on policy that suggested an unwillingness to consult experts. “He doesn’t listen,” Ms. Groux said. “I’m afraid he would just make his own decisions and not listen to anyone else’s  —   and I don’t think that’s a way to have a country. ” This year, as in past elections, the key to carrying Pennsylvania is expected to be winning the trove of educated voters, especially women, in the counties surrounding Philadelphia. Here in Chester County, Mitt Romney defeated President Obama in 2012 by less than one percentage point Mr. Obama won nearby Bucks County by a margin nearly as close. In several dozen interviews on Tuesday, undecided women here consistently said that Mr. Trump had failed to win them over, and that in several cases he had repelled them. “The faces he made  —   he rolled his eyes!” said Janet Melton, who bought a cake and doughnuts at Yori’s Bakery, where a blackboard on the sidewalk advertised “Pumpkin Everything. ” “He doesn’t come across as being very professional to me. ” Ms. Melton, a registered Republican who manages a team of software engineers, said that if the election were today, Mrs. Clinton  —   whom she, too, called “so much more presidential”  —   would get her vote. That alone was a milestone, she added: “I come from a long line of Republican family members who will turn over in their graves. ” Mr. Trump, who was rising in national polls before the debate, has also narrowed the gap in important battleground states. A   poll released Monday showed him running about even with Mrs. Clinton among likely voters in Pennsylvania, a state Democrats regard as a blue wall barricading Mr. Trump’s path to the White House. But even among Republican and independent women who do not support Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump’s debate performance  —   frequent interjections of “Wrong” and a thin command of policy details  —   failed to allay doubts. “I’d rather have almost anybody in there except Hillary,” said Debbie Windle, a    office administrator from Glenmoore. “I didn’t like her last night. I thought she was smug. She thought she was better and was putting him down. “But I look at Donald Trump, and I think, oh, my God, he’s rough,” she added. “He could cause us a lot of damage. ” Ms. Windle said she was considering not voting. And Diana Martens, 51, of Jeffersonville, a Republican who works at a pharmaceutical company, said she might write in a candidate. “Hillary, I’m not a big fan of hers,” she said. But she said many of Mr. Trump’s answers lacked details or substance. “I don’t think he has the experience,” she said. “His behavior is unpresidential, unkind,  . ” Not everyone thought Mr. Trump appeared unprepared for the White House. Barb Haag of West Chester, a retired teacher of the emotionally disturbed, said Mr. Trump’s interruptions did not bother her. “Kids interrupt you all the time if they have a point to make,” she said. “His manner of speaking was thorough, to the point I liked the way he sounded,” said Ms. Haag, 69, who said she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Trump. But others who sounded somewhat sympathetic toward Mr. Trump expressed disappointment at the debate’s outcome. One woman in her 50s, who said she was a registered independent but refused to give her name, took out her phone to display a text message she had sent her husband, she said, at the moment Mr. Trump had lost her: when he dodged responsibility for stoking the   birther movement that questioned whether Mr. Obama was  . “I had hoped he’d be smarter and better prepared,” the text message read. “It’s not like he didn’t know that birther thing would come up. He thought he could wing this. ” Democrats here expressed great relief, saying they had taken note of Mr. Trump’s rise in the polls and worried that he might unleash one of his trademark   slashing attacks. “I was nervous before the debate because I thought it could have gone much worse,” said Sarah Kelley, a graduate student at Villanova University, in Radnor Township. “I’m feeling kind of proud of Hillary. Every time she gave a smile, kind of a big one, made me feel confident. ” But Mr. Trump’s confirmed supporters found reason to cheer, too. “I’m going to go with Donald because he didn’t lose much ground,” said Brian Lance, 30, an accountant, who watched the debate in a sports bar in Rosemont. “I thought Hillary was a little crass. ” Midway through the debate, Betsy Gehlot, a Republican watching in the same bar, Gullifty’s, complained that Mr. Trump kept talking over Mrs. Clinton. “He’s doing all the talking,” said Ms. Gehlot, who works in a boys’ private school. “He’s kind of bullying her, I think. ” The next morning, Bob and Mary Ann Jann were still digesting the debate over breakfast at  ’s Diner in Yardley, Pa. Mr. Jann, a psychologist, said he thought Mrs. Clinton had won “hands down. ” He pointed to “Donald’s dark view of America, and the fact that he couldn’t control his mouth and couldn’t follow the rules of the debate. ” What stuck with Ms. Jann  —   and not out of admiration, either  —   was the way Mr. Trump had answered Mrs. Clinton’s attacks about his having failed to pay vendors to his businesses. “His way of succeeding in business did not seem to have helped out the people who worked for him,” she said. But nothing in the debate seemed to dismay Republican women more than when Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of disrespecting women. Kim Gray, a Trump supporter, said she had cringed when Mrs. Clinton accused him of calling a former Miss Universe “Miss Piggy” because she gained weight and “Miss Housekeeping” because she was Latina. “That is embarrassing,” Ms. Gray, an office manager, said as she parked outside the West Chester post office. “I have a daughter. I have a son who’d never speak like that. ” Ms. Gray said she still planned to vote for Mr. Trump, however, because of his business success and his support for law enforcement. “He had a horrible night,” she acknowledged, dropping her voice and nearly blushing on Mr. Trump’s behalf.",0

11558,Russia Signs Deal for Syria Bases Turkey Appears to Accept Assad - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Russia signed a   agreement on Friday to greatly enlarge its military presence in Syria, more than doubling the space for warships in Russia’s only Mediterranean port and securing rights to an air base that may already be adding a second runway. The agreement covers the port in Tartus and an air base near Latakia, which have been pivotal in Russian assistance to President Bashar   of Syria in fighting an array of insurgents. It ensures Russia’s ability to deploy forces in Syria for the next   and perhaps beyond. News of the agreement came as Mr. Assad received what appeared to be another positive development: A Turkish official suggested publicly for the first time that Turkey would accept a peace deal in Syria’s    war that would allow Mr. Assad to stay in power. The remarks by the official, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, indicated that Turkey  —   Syria’s northern neighbor and one of Mr. Assad’s most implacable foes  —   had softened its position in the interest of finding a solution. While Turkey’s government later said that Mr. Simsek’s remarks had been misconstrued, it was clear that he had said a settlement without Mr. Assad would be “not, you know, realistic. ” Both developments came as Russia, Turkey and Iran prepared to convene Syrian peace talks in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Monday. For the first time, it looked likely that the main Syrian opposition, along with many other factions, would sit down with Mr. Assad’s government for peace talks. The last effort at such negotiations was held by the United Nations in Geneva in February, and it collapsed in days. The new Russian military agreement with Syria provides for an expansion of Russia’s Tartus naval base on the Syrian coast under a   lease that could automatically renew for a further 25 years, according to Tass, the Russian news agency. Tass said the expansion would provide simultaneous berthing for up to 11 warships, including   vessels, more than doubling its present known capacity there. Tass reported that the agreement also provided for a similar   commitment for the Russians to use the Khmeimim Air Base in the Latakia area, which the Russians built in 2015 as they mobilized to help Mr. Assad’s forces. There were news reports that the Russians were building a second runway at the air base. The military agreement came despite Russia’s announcement this month that it was drawing down its  forces in Syria after successes by the Assad government against Syrian rebels, which were achieved with much help from the Russians. The rebels were ousted from their strongholds in Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city, late last year, partly because of Russian air support. The   agreement came as momentum grew among dissidents to join the peace talks in Astana, although it was a foregone conclusion that any deal from those negotiations would be rejected by jihadists. At least 14 rebel factions are participating. At the Turkish government’s insistence, however, Kurdish groups fighting the Islamic State in the east of the country and backed by the United States were not invited. Turkey’s government has accused those Kurdish groups of affiliations with militant Kurdish separatists in Turkey. Mr. Simsek’s remarks were made at a World Economic Forum session titled “Syria and Iraq: Ending the Conflict. ” He suggested that Turkey would accept continued rule by Mr. Assad. “As far as our position on Assad is concerned,” Mr. Simsek said, “we think that the suffering of the Syrian people and the tragedies, clearly the blame is squarely on Assad. ” “But we have to be pragmatic, realistic,” he said. “The facts on the ground have changed dramatically, and so Turkey can no longer insist on, you know, a settlement without Assad, and it’s not, you know, realistic. We just have to work with what we have. ” Hours later, Mr. Simsek’s office in Ankara issued a statement saying news accounts had distorted Mr. Simsek’s remarks and “tried to create the perception that our deputy P. M. said, ‘Turkey cannot insist anymore on an agreement without Assad. ’” But a review of the videotape of the session left no doubt that that was what he had said. The Astana talks are the outcome of a     throughout Syria that began at the end of December. It has been widely observed except in areas where extreme jihadist factions prevail  —   but with many accusations of breaches elsewhere as well. “The priority for us is to put an end to human tragedy, human suffering in Syria and Iraq,” Mr. Simsek said in Davos. “The process is to make sure we translate the current lull into a more lasting   and then talk about more mundane stuff of settling the conflict. ” Russia is the lead host of the talks in the Kazakh capital, with support from Turkey and Iran. Over the last week, Turkey and Russia have also invited the United States and the United Nations to attend the Astana negotiations.",0
11559,"Obama, Keen to Push Israeli-Palestinian Peace, Will Meet With Netanyahu - The New York Times","President Obama arrived in New York City on Sunday evening for three days that will mix   politics with a farewell to the world stage at the United Nations. But the visit comes against a suddenly tense backdrop, after a powerful explosion rocked a Manhattan street and a man claiming fealty to the Islamic State stabbed several people in a Minnesota shopping mall. The president’s diplomatic schedule also got more complicated. The White House announced Sunday that he would hold meetings at the United Nations with leaders from Israel and China. Both will be closely watched for signs of friction in relationships that have been marked by tension during Mr. Obama’s tenure. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to confer with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at a time when he is weighing whether to propose his own framework for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians over Mr. Netanyahu’s objections. The two leaders have clashed repeatedly over the Iran nuclear agreement and Mr. Obama’s pursuit of Middle East peace. The meeting could be their last    encounter before Mr. Obama’s term ends in January. Last week, the United States and Israel sealed a $38 billion,   American security aid package to Israel, the largest ever granted to an ally. Officials in both countries have characterized the deal as proof that the   relationship is enduring, whatever the strains between the two men. On Monday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to have a brief session with China’s premier, Li Keqiang, a week after North Korea tested another nuclear device. The president is expected to press Mr. Li to use China’s influence to discipline the North, something the Chinese have resisted for fear of destabilizing an impoverished neighbor. Mr. Obama returned recently from a trip to Hangzhou, China, which was marred by a messy arrival at the airport that led to shouting matches between American and Chinese officials. Administration officials played down the significance of the episode, saying Mr. Obama’s talks with President Xi Jinping were not affected. This will be Mr. Obama’s last appearance at the United Nations, and his aides said he would use it to recall his diplomatic achievements and argue that his multilateral approach is a model for dealing with future crises. But the   bombing in New York and the stabbings in Minnesota, which the F. B. I. is treating as a “potential act of terrorism,” guarantee that security will be at the forefront. So will presidential politics. Mr. Obama arrived in New York a day earlier than usual so he could attend a   in Manhattan for his preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama’s motorcade crossed Manhattan on 23rd Street, the site of Saturday’s explosion, though several blocks to the east, before arriving at Gramercy Park. Mr. Obama spoke to 65 people at the apartment of the restaurateur Danny Meyer. The guests paid $25, 000 each to attend, while the chairmen raised or contributed $250, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint organization of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee that raises money for Democrats up and down the ballot. Mr. Obama said that despite the gulf in qualifications between Mrs. Clinton and the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, the election was likely to be close because of what he called the “structural” polarization of American society. And he spoke more starkly than he had before about the role gender is playing in the race. “There’s a reason why we haven’t had a woman president,” Mr. Obama said. “We as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women. And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly. ” Mrs. Clinton has her own schedule of meetings at the United Nations, including with the presidents of Egypt and Ukraine and the prime minister of Japan. It was not clear whether she planned to meet with Mr. Netanyahu, a leader with whom she had her own clashes while secretary of state. On Sunday, Mr. Obama made clear that now that he had demonstrated a commitment to Israel’s security, he planned to press Mr. Netanyahu to move toward reconciliation with the Palestinians. “The meeting also will be an opportunity to discuss the need for genuine advancement of a   solution to the   conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. Left unclear was whether Mr. Obama would go beyond simply urging Mr. Netanyahu. The president is considering whether to publicly lay out his own parameters for a settlement of the   conflict, a prospect Mr. Netanyahu has strongly opposed. The president’s speech to the General Assembly would be a logical place for such a move, though his advisers say he might wait until after the November election to avoid its becoming part of campaign politics. If he proceeds, he could give a speech outlining his ideas or even encapsulate them in a resolution before the United Nations Security Council. Aides to Mr. Obama say he has played his cards very close to his chest, not discussing his plans outside a tiny circle.",0
11560,Surgeons Admit That Mammography is Outdated and Harmful to Women,". Surgeons Admit That Mammography is Outdated and Harmful to Women Every year, millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms, a breast cancer... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/surgeons-admit-that-mammography-is.html Every year, millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms, a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a woman's breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors. But surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice , which studies show isn't even an effective screening tool, and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive it. The public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early, but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure, found that mammography is neither effective nor safe. After looking at data on more than 600,000 women between the ages of 39 and 74 who underwent the procedure on a routine basis, researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed. Many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy , resulting in their rapid demise.As published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good, because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer. Thus, the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments, and not at the forefront of women's medicine. ""If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily,"" the authors concluded. Read: Largest & Longest Study on Mammograms Again Finds No Benefit Group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good One year after this review was published, a second one published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) came to a similar conclusion. A team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist, a clinical epidemiologist, a pharmacologist, an oncologic surgeon, a nurse scientist, a lawyer and a health economist, decided that the medical industry's claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunk. They found that for every 1,000 women screened in the U.S. over a 10-year annual screening period beginning at age 50, one breast cancer death would be prevented, while a shocking 490 to 670 women would have a false positive, while 70 to 100 would undergo an unnecessary biopsy. Between three and 14 of these women, the study found, would also be over-diagnosed for a non-malignant form of cancer that never even would have become ""clinically apparent."" This study out of Switzerland corroborates another out of Canada – the 2014 Canadian National Breast Screening Study – which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination. In other words, the procedure is completely unnecessary, and in many cases exceptionally harmful. NCI Shocking Admission: Tens of Millions of 'Cancer Cases' Aren't Cancer at All And on and on the list goes, with data out of Norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isn't all that it's cracked up to be. U.S. data spanning the course of nearly 40 years shows that more women are over — or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully early-diagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization. This represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesn't work. ""I believe that if you did have a tumor, the last thing you would want to do is crush that tumor between two plates, because that would spread it,"" says general practitioner Dr. Sarah Mybill, as quoted in the documentary film The Promise.

11561,U.S. Register of Copyrights at the Library of Congress Resigns Suddenly,"On Monday, Oct. 24, 2016, the United States (U.S.) Register of Copyrights at the Library of Congress, Maria Pallante, resigned suddenly. Pallante’s letter of resignation, leaked to “The Hollywood Reporter,” came after the newly appointed Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, announced that Pallante had been moved to another position, senior advisor for digital strategy. At this same time, Hayden confirmed that Karyn Temple Claggett will act as Register of Copyrights. The Register of Copyright has not been dismissed in 119 years.
Pallante, the former U.S. Register of Copyrights at the Library of Congress, claims that she resigned suddenly because she was locked out of her computer on Monday after being demoted. The Register provides expert advice to Congress on matters concerning intellectual property. In the past, Pallante has been critical of some of the big Silicon Valley companies, such as Google, who have pushed for more lenient laws related to copyrights to music and video. This connection between Hayden’s past as an advocate for antitrust laws and the demotion of Pallante leads some to question the value of intellectual property in Washington.
There are two recommendations Pallante has made to Congress that may have set her in direct opposition to Google. The first of these came in January 2016, when Pallante warned Congress that a new method of licensing music called “100 percent licensing” would be devastating for songwriters who wish to retain control over their product. The licensing scheme was proposed by Renata Hesse, a former Google antitrust attorney who has become Acting Attorney General for antitrust cases at the Department of Justice. Essentially, the rule would allow anyone with partial ownership of a song, whether it is 2 percent or 99 percent, to sell the rights to that song to a user, such as Pandora. The U.S. Copyright Office heeded Pallante’s warning and stood against the implementation of the rule.
A second piece of advice Pallente offered, that could have frustrated Google, relates to the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) desire to update CableCARD. CableCARD is a Personal Computer (PC) card device that allows consumers to watch shows digitally on their PCs, with a newer system. The industry offered an app-based solution but apparently FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler opposed this plan in favor of a plan proposed by an organization called Public Knowledge who is reportedly funded by Google. The problem, as Pallante explains, was this:
Rather than being passive conduits. . . it seems that a broad array of the third-party devices and services would be enabled by the Proposed Rule and would essentially be given access to a valuable bundle of copyright works, and could repackage and retransmit those works for profit.
When an U.S. Register of Copyrights at the Library of Congress suddenly resigns after being locked out of her computer, questions will be asked. Librarian of Congress Hayden was only appointed to her position in mid-September by President Obama and she is wasting no time in making changes. The exact reason for moving Pallante to a new position has not been disclosed. Hayden did say on Monday in her announcement that Karyn, the new Register, “is a skilled intellectual property lawyer and manager, and I am confident she will provide excellent leadership for the Copyright Office in the interim.”

11562,Will Trump Swallow the G.O.P. Whole? - The New York Times,"Every week or so during the spring, I met with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the party headquarters on Capitol Hill. We fell into a familiar routine. I would enter his office, usually chaperoned by Sean Spicer, the R. N. C. ’s chief strategist and head of communications. Priebus has a healthy appreciation for gallows humor, which is not a bad thing for an R. N. C. chairman these days. “I haven’t started pouring Baileys in my cereal yet,” he says often enough that it has become a signature line. I would regularly break the ice with something sarcastic, like asking Priebus how his party’s Hispanic outreach program was going on the morning after the committee’s head of Hispanic outreach resigned rather than work another day for Donald Trump’s election. “The scent of party unity is in the air,” I said in May when Paul Ryan reported that he was “not there yet” on supporting Trump. “No, that’s incense,” Priebus said, pointing out that he had been burning some behind his desk. As suits a man occupying what might be the toughest political job in America, Priebus does his best to stay availed of serene distractions. He plays jazz piano at home late at night and gazes into the   saltwater fish tank that he keeps next to his desk. “You see that big eel?” Priebus asked one day, pointing out a black slithery creature on the bottom, before noting others. “That’s a yellow tang, hippo tang, a spotted puffer. There’s an anemone. An urchin. An orange clown fish. ” He took a hunk of shrimp from a refrigerator and dangled it with a set of tongs into the water. A race to the bottom ensued as bits fell away and the fish vied for pieces of flesh. It was difficult to look away from the feeding frenzy. The big orange clown fish flailed at front and center. I asked Priebus if it reminded him of anyone. “That’s not funny,” he said with something between a slight grunt and chuckle. No matter how much Trump has roiled the Republican water, it remained Priebus’s job to carry it. The presumed Republican nominee appears on many days to be at open war with the party that is about to nominate him. The entire campaign, meanwhile, has been a proxy battle for the proverbial “soul of the party” that has been escalating between the G. O. P. ’s populist grass roots (captured by Trump) and “party leaders” (embodied by Priebus, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell). Is the G. O. P. now the “party of Trump”? Priebus bristles when people ask him this  —   or taunt him. I asked Priebus some variation on this question during each of my visits. “Donald Trump is Donald Trump,” Priebus says. “And the party is the party. ” “Priebus” is a German name, pronounced like the Toyota Prius with a “b” stuck in the middle. Reince (short for Reinhold, rhymes with “pints”) is 44 but has an  ’s vibe. He is often underslept, has the beginnings of jowls and tiny goose pimples clustered under his eyes like those on the belly of a toad. He speaks in the slow and slightly   manner of an adolescent whose parents are always hassling him about the nightmare house guest. The Trump issue, in other words. It’s never far from anything, and really, these days, what else is there? Plenty, Priebus kept trying to convince me. The Republican Party had its own distinct identity and principles and points of pride. It controls both chambers of Congress and holds more federal and statewide seats than at any time since 1900, he said. What keeps eluding Republicans is the White House. They have lost the popular vote in five of the last six national elections. “Cultural elections,” Priebus calls them  —   “the big ones. ” A chief reason for this is that many voters dismiss Republicans as being culturally and demographically stuck in 1900. It was Priebus who commissioned and endorsed the findings of the G. O. P. “autopsy” after Mitt Romney’s defeat in 2012. Formally christened as the “Growth and Opportunity Project,” the report warned that the G. O. P. was “increasingly marginalizing itself” to a point where it would be “increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future. ” That is, the report concluded, unless the party expanded its aging white base to include more immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, precisely the groups the next likely   has so splendidly repelled. Priebus refers to himself as a “party guy. ” He spent much of his youth in Kenosha, Wis. organizing pizza parties for Republican volunteers, putting up yard signs and listening to Newt Gingrich speeches on cassettes in his car  —     things. His first date with his future wife included a trip to a Republican Lincoln Day dinner, an evening sexed up by the presence of two Republican congressmen: James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Henry Hyde of Illinois. Being a “party guy” can come off sounding a little   nerdy, like being a   guy. But Priebus speaks of this identity with sincere pride, and his allegiance is clear: to “the party,” not any one nominee. Still, our meetings sometimes took on the feel of therapy sessions, with Priebus playing the role of the betrayed spouse trying to convince me that his tormentor really could change. Trump would soon be “pivoting” into a more “presidential” mode, Priebus kept promising. But after a while it became clear that Trump’s outrages would continue unabated. Within the space of a few weeks, he suggested that Bill Clinton had committed rape and (along with Hillary) might have killed his former aide Vince Foster and that Ted Cruz’s father might have associated with Lee Harvey Oswald and that Mitt Romney walked like a penguin and. . .. Priebus pretty much stopped bothering with “presidential. ” On this particular day, cable news was    with stories: the surfacing of an audio tape of someone sounding a lot like Trump claiming to be a Trump “spokesman” the discovery of a Facebook post from Trump’s longtime butler calling for President Obama to be killed and news that the Trump campaign had selected a white nationalist leader to be a California delegate (the delegate wound up resigning). Priebus eventually pivoted to Trump’s supposed “authenticity. ” Yes, “authenticity” was a better word, more latitude. He settled on the idea that Trump was a “unique” candidate who had created a new standard for what a politician could say and get away with. “He’s carved out this idea that he’s this earthquake in a box,” Priebus says. Priebus was saying in effect that it would be possible to build a wall around Donald Trump and not have the G. O. P. pay for it. Trump did not define its values in the long term, even if he might temporarily defile them. “We’re the party of the ‘open door,’’u2009” Priebus told me, as he often does. Not big, beautiful walls. For a while this spring, it seemed possible to contain the earthquake. Trump showed flickering signs of “maturing” as a candidate, and Republicans seemed willing to “support the nominee,” if not endorse him. The “normalization” of Donald Trump became a media watchword, the idea that his daily affronts could be integrated into the routine paces of a quadrennial exercise. Formerly hostile primary opponents like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all at various points said they would support Trump or were at least no longer (in Rubio’s case) deriding him as a “fraud,” “con man” and “lunatic” or (in Graham’s) a “  xenophobic, religious bigot” or (in Jindal’s) a “madman who must be stopped” or (in Perry’s) a “barking carnival act. ” I imagined Trump laughing at how easy it was to get Republicans to submit to him after he had savaged so many of them during the primaries. Actually there was no need to imagine because Trump was doing exactly that. “I’ve never seen people able to pivot like politicians,” he said at a rally in California in late May while boasting of his support from Perry. In an interview, I asked Trump if it was harder to flip politicians or the real estate people he has dealt with over the years. His smirk was audible over the phone. “Well, I’m not referring to any politicians in particular, but I’ve said many times that businesspeople are much tougher,” Trump said. “Politicians tend to be much more deceptive and deceiving and more willing to break a deal. But they are not as tough. ” Priebus, meanwhile, kept working the phones, trying to coax   Republicans back to the party line and persuade  —   beg  —   Trump to lay off the elected Republicans he kept dumping on. “I have encouraged him to constantly offer grace to people that he doesn’t think are deserving of grace,” Priebus said. Trump, in turn, calls Priebus “Mr. Switzerland” and speaks well of him. “Reince is a peacemaker, a very good person for getting people together,” he said. Trump was calling me from his limo after a rally in Anaheim, Calif. He was in the midst of an intrapartisan grudge tour of the American West, during which he disparaged, among other Republicans, Jeb Bush, the South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, and the New Mexico governor, Susana Martinez, who is one of the   Hispanic elected officials in the G. O. P. He also reiterated that Romney was a “loser” and a “choker” and for good measure boasted that “I have a store that’s worth more money than he is. ” Priebus’s mother is Greek, which he says trains him for dealing with whatever the Greek word for mishegas is. “Ever see ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding’?” he asked. “That’s my family, that’s my life. The arguing starts at 7:30 in the morning, everyone’s in each other’s business. It was good family chaos. ” I asked if what the G. O. P. was going through now was “good family chaos. ” “It depends how it turns out,” he said. At this point in the    calendar four and eight years ago, Romney and John McCain had built massive campaign operations and   networks that were orders of magnitude larger than Trump’s. They had accumulated armies of elected officials promoting them and were diligently making peace with vanquished opponents and paying courtesy calls to party dignitaries and congressional leaders in the name of “unity. ” The period between the end of the primaries and the start of the conventions is typically one of consolidation,   harvesting and turning full attention to the   opponent  —   all of which Trump has succeeded in achieving the   opposite of. Trump would of course be the first to point out that both McCain and Romney lost and that he has been doubted at every step of his campaign. But the degree to which he seems unconcerned with his pariah status among name Republicans remains a key feature of his pursuit. To a comical extent, top Republicans willed themselves invisible when I reached out to them for this article, fearing, not incorrectly, that the conversation would turn to Trump. This included some of the most typically quotable Republicans, including former Trump challengers like Graham (“He’s sorta had his fill talking about Trump,” a spokesman emailed) Perry (“Thanks for thinking of him”) and Ted Cruz (“Not great timing on our end”) the previous nominee Mitt Romney (“You are kind to think of me,” he wrote) Trump stalwarts like Chris Christie (“We are going to take a pass this time”)   Republican governors like Charlie Baker of Massachusetts (“The governor won’t be available”) and senators like Mike Lee, of Utah (“Senator Lee would love to talk to you about the state of the G. O. P. and conservatism in general. We are free anytime after Nov 8. ”). I tried Rubio, who has undergone more public agony than perhaps anyone about Trump. Rubio looks nauseated whenever someone asks him about the man he called “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency” but who later said he would be “honored” to speak for at the Republican convention before clarifying that if he did speak, he would only “speak about things I believe in, not somebody else’s platform. ” Rubio also holds the astonishing position of saying he’ll vote for someone he has previously declared unfit to hold the American nuclear codes. You envision him under a mushroom cloud, assuring his kids that it could be even worse  —   at least he didn’t vote for Clinton. There’s a palpable weariness among Republicans, and it’s still only June. Every day, it’s something else. “What it does is suck all the oxygen out of the chamber,” Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, told me. “I’m trying to do my job as a senator, which does not end because we have a contentious and bizarre presidential candidate. ” Trump, after accumulating enough delegates to win the nomination with almost no visible operation or recognizable strategy, has only nominally scaled his campaign beyond where it was a few months ago. There is barely any   or field apparatus to speak of, and Trump has outsourced a great deal of the   of an enormous   campaign to the overtasked R. N. C. Priebus has won praise for revamping the   data and field infrastructure that he inherited from his embattled predecessor, Michael Steele, in 2011. But no national committee in recent memory has been called upon to pick up as much operational slack in a general election. I asked Priebus if he was frustrated that so much has been thrown into the R. N. C. ’s lap. “It’s more frustrating for us when a campaign comes in and layers over our field staff,” is how he spun it. In addition to celebrating the presidential nominee, national conventions are a showcase for party eminences, rising stars and elected officials. Not so here. The last nominee, Romney, and two living former presidents, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, have said they are not supporting Trump or will not campaign for him. McCain has said he would be skipping the convention and is pursuing his senate   in Arizona with characteristically gritted teeth: the familiar “it pains me to do this” routine. Three of the top five   in the primaries  —   Cruz, Jeb Bush and the Ohio governor John Kasich  —   have either made no commitment to support Trump or, in Bush’s case, said definitively he would not support him. A fourth, Rubio, in addition to his prolonged and winding agony over Trump, has said he does “not want to be considered” as Trump’s running mate. This is a popular distancing trick doubling as a nifty   among reluctant Trump endorsers. “To the members of the press who are asking, while I am flattered to be mentioned,” Nikki Haley said, “my plate is full, and I am not interested in serving as vice president. ” (For the record, Trump finds these expressions annoying. “They were never asked,” Trump told me. “I don’t like it when they do that, because it’s very dishonest. If they’ve taken themselves out, it means they’re not being asked. ”) There is a distinct sense among leading Republicans that if you take proper precautions  —      —   it’s possible to avoid contagion. Ryan agreed to be interviewed for a Father’s Day feature in People Magazine but only on the condition that no Trump questions be asked. Trump seems to fundamentally welcome the party’s revulsion. As Ryan wavered over supporting him, Trump was privately saying that Ryan’s rejection might actually help him, that he was just the kind of political lifer whom Trump positioned his campaign against. His   director (and a former caddie) Dan Scavino Jr. actually went public with this, tweeting out a link to a column in Breitbart headlined, “Paul Ryan Is the Reason the G. O. P. Is Losing America. ” While Ryan is trying to refashion and sell the G. O. P. as a party of innovation and heart, Trump is a creature of mouth and gut and other   drivers. They can try to operate in parallel G. O. P. universes, but the two styles are often in obvious conflict. On the sunny morning of June 7 in Washington, Ryan and a group of seven House colleagues visited the mostly black neighborhood Anacostia to highlight a central idea of Ryan’s agenda. After a meeting at a residential   center, the representatives took turns giving testimonials on why Republican policies  —   lower taxes, entitlement reform, less regulation  —   would better address the intractable problems of urban poverty. This was Ryan at his most earnest and  . His concern for the urban poor derives heavily from his intellectual mentor, Jack Kemp, the former Republican congressman, housing secretary and patron saint of     conservatism. Poverty is the first item of Ryan’s   policy plan. He spoke at a lectern, surrounded by community leaders, and then invited questions from the press. Did Ryan have any regrets about endorsing Trump? “I told you,” Ryan said, smiling, turning to one of his hosts. The first six or so questions were about Trump. He was then in the midst of a furor over his repeated claims that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the   jurist presiding in a civil case against Trump University, could not rule fairly because he was “Mexican. ” Ryan was blunt on the Curiel matter. “Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” he said. That was the headline. Ryan expressed great frustration that such comments by Trump “undercut these things,” meaning this   event. When we spoke, Ryan was most eager to discuss Priebus, his old friend and fellow Wisconsinite. Along with the   governor, Scott Walker, the trio form a formidable G. O. P. axis of cheese heads. I asked Ryan how he, as the   elected Republican, would distinguish his mission as a party leader from Priebus’s. “I see my role as helping to define the standard, which are the issues,” Ryan told me. Priebus’s role is building the party’s apparatus to be ready for the  . “Reince is basically being the adult in calming the situation,” he added. “He is protecting that   process. Reince is protecting that from being disfigured or hijacked. ” Ryan views himself as a guardian of conservative “ideas. ” “Ideas” is one of those fetish words, popular among ambitious young pols (conservative   are constantly dropping Kemp’s name). As the speaker of the Florida House, Rubio published a book in 2006 of “100 innovative ideas” and spoke about his love of ideas during his presidential campaign, before he started making   jokes about Trump. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor who was then considered one of the   innovators of the party, warned after Romney’s defeat in 2012 that the G. O. P. must stop being “the stupid party” and urged fellow Republicans to talk “like adults” and swear off “offensive and bizarre” rhetoric. He then embarked on a presidential campaign in which his most memorable “idea” was suggesting that Trump “looks like he’s got a squirrel sitting on his head. ” (Jindal dropped out in November Trump barely bothered to insult him.) Jindal’s “stupid party” remark reflected a concern among idea conservatives that was marinating well before Trump came along: that the Republican Party has taken on an increasingly   bent. There has been a strong populist allergy to elitism within the G. O. P. coalition for a long time. But Sarah Palin’s emergence as the   nominee in 2008 and subsequent tenure as a party celebrity was a benchmark. Lesser imitators like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain took turns as Republican   in 2012. Trump made his name as a national political figure in 2011 and 2012 with his flamboyant campaign to prove that Obama was not born in the United States, an   notion that was especially offensive to  . Four years later, the leader of what many Republicans had hoped was a nativist fringe movement is the party’s presumed nominee. Ryan believed that he and fellow   in Congress could preserve the party’s substantive core. This would be the laboratory from which he could remake the party’s conservative identity while attracting new Republicans, including young and minority voters. “I have to protect conservatism from being disfigured,” Ryan told me. His focus, he said, is on “ideas, temperament and the future of conservatism. ” Ryan has little confidence that Trump cares at all about his ideas, possessed that temperament or had thought at all about the future of conservatism. Trump almost never talks about “ideas,” unless you count blustery promises to “build a wall and make Mexico pay for it,” end lousy trade deals and “win” again. When, after considerable public hesitation, Ryan finally did say he would “vote for” Trump, he wrote a column in a newspaper in Janesville, Wis. reiterating his view that “politics can be a battle of ideas, not insults” and that “if we’re going to unite, it has to be over ideas. ” He said he had become convinced that Trump “would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws. ” What Trump had going for him more than anything, in Ryan’s eyes, was his willingness to outsource the conservative “idea” architecture of his administration to Ryan and   Republicans in the same way that he’s farming out much of his   campaign to the R. N. C. Even so, there’s no avoiding that Trump has over the last year been the ubiquitous voice of the G. O. P. to most voters, many of them new ones. He can cut a problematic image, to say the least. (In a June 15 Bloomberg poll, just 32 percent of Americans view the Republican Party favorably, the lowest figure since the survey’s 2009 inception.) Priebus and Ryan were relatively powerless during the primaries as Trump undertook his systematic disfiguring of the R. N. C. ’s plans for a more inclusive party. Last summer, during the relatively innocent months of Trump’s campaign, Priebus called and urged him to tone down his remarks (about “Mexican rapists,” for example). Trump scoffed at the idea that such a puny figure, a party guy, would ever try such a thing. “We’re not dealing with a   Army general,” Trump said. Priebus paid a debasing house call to Trump Tower last fall to accompany Trump as he signed a loyalty pledge to the eventual nominee. He listened this spring to Trump predict “riots” in Cleveland and complain about the “rigged” system that might deny him his rightful nomination. (“Give us all a break,” Priebus tweeted at one point.) He has endured an outpouring from a gallery of   who are urging the R. N. C. to take extraordinary measures and disavow its extraordinary nominee. “If Priebus ends up blessing the Trump nomination,” wrote the Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, the head White House speechwriter for George W. Bush, “it would turn the sins of Trump into the sins of the G. O. P. And Priebus would go down as the head of the party who squandered the legacy of Lincoln, the legacy of Reagan, in a squalid and hopeless political effort. ” Priebus is not a man for extraordinary measures. He is an organization man in a time of disruption, runaway   and selfie campaigns. Party guys go along. It’s not always a fair fight. Political parties have seen better days in America. They are like many big and traditional institutions that way: the government, the church, among others. Signing on with the Donkeys and Elephants would seem a tired construct in a disintermediated culture of free agents and personal brand customization. Identities have replaced affiliations. In the course of reporting this article, I asked many Republicans of varied perspective why a young person today should consider joining a major political party. The question elicited sighs and head shakes, as if I were asking them why a millennial would join a Kiwanis Club, except that Kiwanis Clubs aren’t actively being resisted the way the Democratic and Republican parties are. Based on data from a 2014 Pew survey, 39 percent of the electorate identify as independents, compared with 32 percent as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans (that’s the highest proportion of independents in nearly eight decades of surveys despite the fact that the country remains heavily partisan). It’s certainly worth pointing out that people have been predicting the death of the   system in America for years and also the demise of individual parties at various low points. The G. O. P. was supposedly terminal after Barry Goldwater’s landslide defeat of 1964, as were the Democrats following the rout of George McGovern in 1972 each party came back to win the White House four years later. Priebus, not surprisingly, is a defender of the party status quo. “The reality is, there’s two doors that people can walk through in this country,” he told me. “It’s not Italy. We don’t have 12 different parties where everyone can fit into their exact box. ” Still, the culture and speed of technological change has fueled an accelerated shift in how voters engage with and perceive political institutions and politicians. When I asked Trump the “why join a party?” question, he said, “I think the whole system is changing. ” His toggling between parties over the years has been well documented. Likewise, his embrace of atypical Republican positions during the primaries  —   his support for some aspects of Planned Parenthood  —   did nothing to thwart his nomination. It would indicate that voters might not be as wedded to the assumed conservative orthodoxies as G. O. P. leaders might think. “You have people who are socially conservative and fiscally nonconservative and vice versa,” Trump told me. “You have so many different permutations now. ” Trump’s embrace of this à la carte approach comports to a sensibility of voters’ choosing between models of disruption rather than a singular ideology. In a sense, disruption in and of itself has become an ideology. Whoever swings the biggest wrecking ball wins. “Washington is so broken and needs to be disrupted, and a lot of what could happen in this disruption would be good,” said Ben Sasse, a freshman Republican senator from Nebraska. “Unfortunately, it has to be someone who takes seriously the stewarding of a whole nation. And who cares about facts. And who is trustworthy. ” Sasse was pointedly not talking about Trump. He has said that he could not support him as his party nominee. He would not be voting for Clinton either. “There are Dumpster fires in my town more popular than these two ‘leaders,’’u2009” he wrote in a Facebook post in which he predicted the imminent breakup of both parties. He was harsher on Trump. Everywhere he goes in Nebraska, Sasse told me, people ask him for advice. “People say: ‘I’m distraught. I’m opposed to everything Hillary Clinton stands for, and yet I think I have to vote for her. How do you make sense of this? What should I do? ’’u2009” he said. “These are young evangelical women, teary sometimes. They say, ‘I can never tell my kids I voted for that man. ’’u2009” Sasse, who is 44, became an instant luminary of the   Never Trump movement after he unloaded on Trump. He is mostly avoiding interviews, though in a classic bit of politician   took this as an opportunity to share with me that “I’ve turned down something like 45 Sunday shows in a row. ” I asked Sasse if America’s fascination with celebrity might help explain the rise of Trump. No, he said. “There is such crisis of shared vision for what America means right now,” Sasse, a   former college president and business consultant, said. “People desperately seek shallower pop culture as a form of escape rather than finding actual meaning. ” For politics to be satisfying, it requires deeper ideals. And to partake of it as just another celebrity snack food leads a citizen to feel, after a while, “like you’ve eaten a   of cotton candy. ” In a tweet from early May, Sasse tried to nudge the former senator Tom Coburn into making a   bid. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and   physician, left the Senate in 2015 after spending his career  —   six years in the House, 10 in the Senate  —   as one of Washington’s proudest conservative mavericks and procedural troublemakers. Sasse told me that Coburn is one of his political idols. He also mentioned Paul Ryan. “If Tom Coburn and Paul Ryan have a baby,” Sasse said, “I’m their hideous offspring. ” All things being equal, Coburn would welcome having a superdisrupter in Washington. He has never been a party guy. “I don’t think it really matters, the parties,” Coburn, now retired and living in Tulsa, said. But Trump has been “repulsive to me,” he said, adding that Trump’s ability to win a party nomination “kind of fits with the modern social decline of America. ” I asked Coburn what Trump’s nomination signaled about the state of G. O. P. He was characteristically glib, apocalyptic and idealistic. “Either Trump is going to totally destroy the Republican Party,” Coburn said. “Or in the aftermath of him possibly losing an election, we’re going to rebuild it stronger than ever. ” The    option is predicated on Trump’s losing. Several Republicans I spoke to seemed to hope for this, if not explicitly. It is politically fraught, obviously, to say they will not support their party’s presidential nominee. But based on my discussions, I’m willing to bet a good portion of the elected Republicans who claim minimal allegiance to “the nominee” will wind up voting for Clinton in the privacy of their voting booths while rooting for Trump’s complete humiliation. “We’re just going to have to swallow it,” said Mark Salter, the longtime chief of staff and confidant of John McCain. “He’s just unfit for the office,” referring to Trump. As for Clinton, he said, “I mean, the worst thing you can say about her is, she’s kind of a hack. ” Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist and veteran of the Reagan and George H. W. Bush White Houses, calls himself a “not yet Republican,” meaning he is “not yet” ready to support Trump and has in fact moved in the opposite direction since Trump clinched the nomination last month. Rogers, a longtime business partner of the former Mississippi governor and R. N. C. chairman Haley Barbour, acknowledged that the Republicans tend to exaggerate Clinton’s flaws as a trade prerogative. “The Clintons have never been the demons ideologically that we’ve made them out to be,” Rogers told me. “From a character standpoint, they’re pretty bad, but Hillary isn’t the frightening offensive character that Trump is. ” If   Republicans rebelled against the “establishment” in the primaries, Trump has provided the establishment with mounting ammunition to fight back in the 11th hour. The first half of June has been a running train wreck for Trump, beginning with his crusade against Judge Curiel. Trump has been provoking increasing alarm among Republicans at the moment he should be proving himself nominally “presidential. ” The Republican senator Mark Kirk of Illinois announced that he could no longer support Trump in the aftermath of Curiel (“I think he’s too bigoted and racist for the Land of Lincoln”) Lindsey Graham did the same and urged other Republicans backing Trump to rescind their endorsements. Top Republicans voiced widespread opposition   to Trump’s reiterated calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump in turn called party leaders “weak” and pounded them for not falling in line behind him. “Just please be quiet, don’t talk,” he railed at them at a June 15 rally in Atlanta. “We have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me do it by myself,” Trump said. “I’ll do very well. ” He would be banking on the   system being sufficiently hobbled that allegiance to him would prevail over partisan loyalty. Republicans wouldn’t hold it against Trump that he’s anathema to their establishment while Democrats would feel no loyalty to their traditional home team, let alone to Hillary Clinton. Trump appeared at this moment prepared to begin an independent   campaign under the nominal banner of the Republican Party, while using their abundant resources. This looked more like a jail break than a pivot. The second week of June was shaping up as another one of those “Baileys in my cereal” stretches for Reince Priebus. We were two days past the mass shooting in Orlando, a horrific event that moved Trump to tweet immediate thanks to all those who sent him “congrats” for predicting it. He also called on Obama to resign and later seemed to suggest that the president might have even been complicit in the tragedy. This invited swift repudiations from Republicans and Democrats, including a furious Obama, whose presidential stature seems to grow the longer Trump dominates news cycles. Obama’s net   rating has risen nearly 20 points since Trump became the G. O. P.   and the party’s inescapable face last summer. Priebus spent the weekend in Utah at an annual “ideas” gathering that Mitt Romney hosts for Republican luminaries, donors and business leaders. In a normal year, this would serve as a Republican unity confab before the convention: party bonding in the mountains. But this year’s edition was more of a rock slide. It convened a huddle of the Never Trumps, disaffected    and increasingly skittish party notables like Ryan and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. Romney set the tone for the weekend when he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN that Trump in the White House could “change the character of the generations of Americans that are following” and might result in “  racism,” “  misogyny” and “  bigotry. ” In a    session with Ryan, the   chief executive Meg Whitman, who was the G. O. P. nominee for governor of California in 2010, questioned how Ryan could endorse such an appalling figure. She placed Trump in the company of Hitler and Mussolini. Romney appeared to tear up at one point, according to an account in Politico. “Seeing this just breaks your heart,” he said. Priebus played the good party soldier. “Respect Mitt and differences but couldn’t disagree more,” he tweeted at Romney after his remarks. “Let’s stop this and unify. ” Priebus told Trump opponents at the retreat that Trump would win “with or without their help. ” He conveyed the exasperation of a substitute teacher being pelted with flying erasers. In almost every visit, Priebus and I had engaged in some variation on the same discussion. I kept asking him: “Whose party is this anyway? Who gets to define the G. O. P. ?” “It’s the party’s party,” he always answered. “The party defines the party. ” Convention delegates write the platform that lays out the party’s tenets. Trump can’t really change those: It’s a common refrain these days among   Republicans. “Trump is not going to change the institution,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told Politico last month, referring to the G. O. P. “He’s not going to change the basic philosophy of the party. ” Priebus and others might try to shape Trump’s behavior. They talk every day, Priebus and Trump. And tens of millions of people are having their impressions formed, shaped or solidified about today’s Republican Party by watching Donald Trump. They will vote for or against him in droves, not based on anything they read in the platform, whose readership probably amounts to less than 1 percent of Trump’s Twitter following. As I waited for Priebus in the lobby of the R. N. C. I noticed a tweet from an Associated Press reporter saying that Lamar Alexander, a Republican senator, had just suggested Trump might not be the surefire nominee after all. “We do not have a nominee until after the convention,” Alexander said. “That’s what you say,” Alexander added in response to a reminder that Trump was in fact the “presumptive nominee. ” It would seem ridiculously late in the process to be haggling over modifiers, at least it would be in a mythical normal year. When I walked into Priebus’s office, he sat on his couch and soldiered forth like a good party guy. If Ryan and McConnell tried to remain boxed off from the earthquake, Priebus occupied another shelter, constructed of   armor, alternate reality and denial. “I’m feeling good about things,” Priebus told me. His voice was flat and deliberate,   mode. It was hard to resist a few pokes at the organization man. How’s that Trump pivot working out? “I think it’s a work in progress,” Priebus said. He was trying to be upbeat. “I have Hillary Clinton on the other side,” he said, clinging to her as a lifeline. He was hoarse. I noticed him fiddling with a drink coaster. The coaster bore a cartoon rendition, sure enough, of Donald Trump: the only physical likeness I noticed anywhere in the building. Priebus had swiped a couple of these coasters from the bar at the   Hotel and found them amusing. He set them on a side table in his office, next to the fish tank. He predicted that Clinton’s campaign would be a “race to the bottom. ” Well, yes. There’s nothing like claims of moral high ground on a campaign. But I couldn’t help reminding Priebus that Trump recently accused President Bill Clinton of rape, Obama of treason, Hillary Clinton of murdering Vince Foster, Cruz’s dad of associating with assassins, Romney of not being a “real” Mormon and the rest of the litany. Where did the bottom even begin, and where could it possibly end? Priebus said that the rape and Vince Foster things were “sort of just warning shots to the Hillary campaign. ” He also claimed that Trump and Clinton were running “tied in the polls,” though this was being contradicted as we spoke. Clinton led Trump by 12 points in a new Bloomberg survey, with 55 percent of respondents saying they would never vote for the Republican and in an ABC   Post poll, seven in 10 Americans viewed Trump unfavorably, up 10 points in just the last month. A few days earlier, the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said that Republicans’ accepting Trump as the nominee was “like ignoring Stage IV cancer. ” There was a new wave of “Dump Trump” stories in the media, mostly featuring the same band of   Never Trumpers who seem to spend vast amounts of time on Twitter. I asked Priebus about any convention situation that could deny Trump the nomination. He did not reject the possibility, but it’s remote. It would require an alternative candidate (none currently) an organizing effort and a confluence of highly unlikely rule changes, delegate votes and procedural   whose likelihood Priebus compared to drawing an inside straight three times in a row. “I think people are living in Fantasy Land,” he said, not saying whether he shared in the fantasy. Priebus was heading out to catch a flight to Greensboro, N. C. for a   event with Trump that night. He was playing a role, the party guy, the proprietor of the china shop in the time of the bull. There was something oddly comforting to me about this presence, as thankless and unenviable as the life of Priebus might seem these days. What could be better for a lifer apparatchik? Priebus made a perfect   foil to a new politics of blazing chaos. “It could be a great moment or a bad moment,” Priebus told me. “But it’s going to be a moment. ” I thanked Priebus for his time. He was still fumbling with the cartoon Donald Trump coasters. “Your party’s made this story fun for me,” I told him. “Have I made it fun?” he asked, almost plaintively. “Or have I made it less fun?”",0

11565,"Gohmert: Obama DOJ, Not the Russians, Tried to Influence Presidential Election - Breitbart","In an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “America’s News HQ” on Sunday, Rep. Louis Gohmert ( ) said that if anyone interfered with the 2016 presidential election, it wasn’t the Russians but the Department of Justice.  He specifically named former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former FBI Director James Comey. Gohmert referred to Comey’s testimony last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee where he said Lynch had told him to refer to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information as a “matter,” rather than an “investigation,” even though Clinton was under investigation. Comey said that led him to publicly announce the end of the Clinton investigation in July 2016. “At best, it was an attempt to manipulate the election, not by the Russians in this case, but by the Department of Justice  —   the Attorney General herself  —   because that came from Comey,”  Gohmert said. “[Comey] totally ruined his own credibility  —   or what was left of it,” Gohmert said. “He did vast damage and raised big red flags and questions over Loretta Lynch’s job as head of the Justice Department. “[Lynch] was using her official position to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton and that didn’t seem to bother him enough to do a memo,” Gohmert said. Gohmert said this should be the subject of a congressional investigation. “We need to round up all those people [Comey] talked to  —   because we have a conspiracy remaining afoot in the Department of Justice that is going to be out to destroy this president and they’ve got to be fired if not worse. ” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter @PennyStarrDC",0
11566,"Tim Tebow, Wearing No. 15, Participates in First Mets Workout - The New York Times","PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.  —   A helicopter circled overhead. Below, about 400 fans and more than 70 members of the news media gathered at the Mets’   training complex. They were all there  —   on the ground, in the air  —   to watch Tim Tebow play catch. The most famous minor league baseball player since, perhaps, Michael Jordan arrived at the Mets’ minor league facility Monday for his first workout in a Florida instructional league camp. Fans cheered and chanted his name, dozens of photographers took thousands of pictures, and national sports network correspondents issued live reports as if this were a postseason game in October. None of this was particularly surprising. Still, it was different. Normally, the first day of an instructional league camp in September is watched by parents of one or two players and is accompanied by a completely different sound. “Crickets,” said Paul Taglieri, the executive director of the Mets’ minor league facilities and the person who has overseen the instructional league here for almost two decades. But like so much else in Tebow’s life as an athlete and ongoing celebrity, Monday became a spectacle, one that also included   humility from Tebow and some earnest hard work. “I felt like such a kid,” Tebow said afterward, beaming, as he spoke with reporters. “Totally felt like a kid. ” A former   professional football player who has not played organized baseball since he was a junior in high school, Tebow, who turned 29 in August, took the field with 57 other aspiring players in the Mets organization who are much younger. Tebow played catch, took batting practice, participated in baserunning and fielding drills and later spoke extensively about following what he termed his lifelong passion to play baseball. “It was definitely a dream of mine as a kid, ever since I was young,” he said, “and to be honest with you, I thought that I was probably going to play baseball for the majority of my life. ” At this point in his life, Tebow is famous, to some extent, for being famous. However, Florida is also the state where he won the Heisman Trophy and led the University of Florida to two national football championships. Which makes him even more famous here than elsewhere. On Monday, the fans in the back fields of the complex cheered when he performed the simplest running drills, and they chanted, “   ” when he walked past them. With every step he took, more than a dozen television cameras were pointed in his direction. Not even Mike Piazza, at the height of his fame with the Mets, drew this kind of attention. “I am humbled by the fans and the support from the fans, because it gives you a platform,” Tebow said after his work was over for the day. “It gives you an opportunity to walk into a hospital and make a kid smile. ” When Tebow arrived at the complex Monday, he found a Mets jersey hanging in his locker bearing the same No. 15 that he wore on the football field  —   at Florida and with the Denver Broncos and the Jets in the N. F. L. In an age of   it was not surprising, either, that Tebow’s Mets shirt was a hot seller on the Mets’ online store even before he finished his workout. Minor league players do not usually have their jerseys on the market, but Tebow’s representatives, Major League Baseball’s licensing arm and the Majestic company, which manufactures the shirts, worked out a special agreement, according to Ed Price, a spokesman for Tebow’s agent, Brodie Van Wagenen. “I think it’s cool,” Tebow said, almost sheepishly. Tebow said that he was humbled by all the attention he was getting for trying to switch sports and denied that his attempt to play baseball was a publicity stunt. His goal, he said, is to make it to the major leagues. He has work to do. He has some natural power at the plate, but he has yet to face live pitching in a game above the high school level. Defensively, he looks at times like a quarterback trying to play the outfield. Then again, sometimes he used to look like a baseball player trying to play football. At one point on Monday, while still warming up with another player at a distance of about 15 yards, he threw the ball clear over that player’s head  —   and a     fence. During batting practice, Tebow hit several balls off the fence in center field, but also hit some harmless grounders to second base and a few   into the netting of the cage. It was too small a sample size for it to mean anything, but Tebow is battling the skepticism of many baseball people, who doubt he will make it to the top level of the minor leagues, let alone the majors. “I’m not doing it for them,” Tebow said. “I’m doing it to pursue what’s in my heart. ” In the N. F. L. Tebow’s last stop as a quarterback was with the New England Patriots, who invited him to their training camp in 2013 but cut him. That ended his football career, other than as a college analyst for the SEC Network, a commitment he intends to continue this fall. On Monday, he was asked if he would consider a return to football if a team like the Patriots  —   whose temporary starting quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, was injured on Sunday  —   reached out to him. “No, sir,” he replied politely. “I am part of the Mets’ family. ”",0
11567,"A Better (Smelly) Mosquito Trap, but With Caveats - The New York Times","A new type of mosquito trap running on solar electricity and using human odor as bait has cut mosquito populations by 70 percent in a test on a   island in Kenya, according to a new study. The study, published in The Lancet last week, also found 30 percent fewer malaria victims in houses that had traps than in those that did not. The total number of malaria cases was so small during the   testing period, however, that the researchers did not conclude that the traps were only 30 percent effective. Although the traps appeared quite effective at lowering mosquito populations, they had some significant drawbacks. Because they need power from rooftop solar panels, they are relatively expensive. Still, the panels appealed to residents who could also use them to power a light bulb or charge a cellphone. Also, the traps  —   which resemble lampshades and hang just outside the house  —   lured in Anopheles funestus mosquitoes, which are the most important malaria vector on Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, where the test was conducted. But they did not attract Anopheles gambiae or Anopheles arabiensis, which are much more important malaria vectors in most of Africa, where more than 400, 000 children die of the disease each year. Also, the traps needed regular rebaiting with a blend of five chemical constituents of human odor along with a chemical that mimicked the carbon dioxide plume created by human breath. Mosquito traps releasing carbon dioxide are available in the United States, but they can cost hundreds of dollars can sometimes require propane tanks, electricity or dry ice and may not be effective. The test was led by scientists from Wageningen University in the Netherlands, along with Kenyan and Swiss scientists. An editorial accompanying the study praised the traps as a “groundbreaking lead technology,” that nonetheless has “obvious shortcomings. ” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently tested simple bucket traps that caught   females by using only water and hay as bait and sticky paper to kill. The traps lowered mosquito populations by 80 percent in the four Puerto Rican towns where they were tested, and they appeared to cut chikungunya transmission by almost half. But the millions that would have been needed to fight the Zika epidemic there were not ready in time.",0
11568,"Ann Coulter: A Health Care Plan so Simple, Even a Republican Can Understand! - Breitbart","It’s always impossible to repeal laws that require Ann to pay for greedy people, because the greedy run out on the streets wailing that the Republicans are murdering them.  Obamacare is uniquely awful because the free stuff isn’t paid for through income taxes: It’s paid for through MY health insurance premiums. This is unfortunate because I wanted to buy health insurance. Perhaps you’re not aware  —   SINCE YOU EXEMPTED YOURSELVES FROM OBAMACARE, CONGRESS  —   but buying or selling health insurance is illegal in America. Right now, there’s no free market because insurance is insanely regulated not only by Obamacare, but also by the most corrupt organizations in America: state insurance commissions. (I’m talking to you, New York!) Federal and state laws make it illegal to sell health insurance that doesn’t cover a laughable array of supposedly vital services based on bureaucrats’ medical opinions of which providers have the best lobbyists. As a result, it’s illegal to sell health insurance that covers any of the medical problems I’d like to insure against. Why can’t the GOP keep Obamacare for the greedy  —   but make it legal for Ann to buy health insurance? This is how it works today: ME: I’m perfectly healthy, but I’d like to buy health insurance for heart disease, broken bones, cancer, and everything else that a normal person would ever need, but no more. INSURANCE COMPANY: That will be $700 a month, the deductible is $35, 000, no decent hospital will take it, and you have to pay for doctor’s visits yourself. But your plan covers shrinks, infertility treatments, sex change operations, autism spectrum disorder treatment, drug rehab and 67 other things you will never need. INSURANCE COMPANY UNDER ANN’S PLAN: That will be $50 a month, the deductible is $1, 000, you can see any doctor you’d like, and you have full coverage for any important medical problems you could conceivably have in a million years. Mine is a   plan (and you don’t have to do the second step, so it’s really a   plan). STEP 1: Congress doesn’t repeal Obamacare! Instead, Congress passes a law, pursuant to its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce, that says: “In America, it shall be legal to sell health insurance on the free market. This law supersedes all other laws, taxes, mandates, coverage requirements, regulations or prohibitions, state or federal. ” The end. Love, Ann. There will be no whining single mothers storming Congress with their   placards. People who want to stay on Obamacare can. No one is taking away anything. They can still have health insurance with free pony rides. It just won’t be paid for with Ann’s premiums anymore, because Ann will now be allowed to buy health insurance on the free market. Americans will be free to choose among a variety of health insurance plans offered by willing sellers, competing with one another to provide the best plans at the lowest price. A nationwide market in health insurance will drive down costs and improve access  —   just like everything else we buy here in America! Within a year, most Americans will be buying health insurance on the free market (and half of the rest will be illegal aliens). We’ll have TV ads with cute little geckos hawking amazing plans and young couples bragging about their broad coverage and great prices from this or that insurance company. The Obamacare plans will still have the “essential benefits” (free pony rides) that are so important to NPR’s Mara Liasson, but the free market plans will have whatever plans consumers agree to buy and insurance companies agree to sell  —   again, just like every other product we buy here in America. Some free market plans will offer all the “essential benefits” mandated by Obamacare, but the difference will be: Instead of forcing me to pay a premium that covers Mara Liasson’s special needs, she’ll have to pay for that coverage herself. I won’t be compelled to buy health insurance that covers everyone else’s gambling addiction, drug rehab, pregnancies, marital counseling, social workers, contact lenses and rotten kids  —   simply to have insurance for what doctors call “serious medical problems. ” Then, we’ll see how many people really need free health care. Until the welfare program is decoupled from the insurance market, nothing will work. Otherwise, it’s like forcing grocery stores to pay for everyone to have a house. A carton of milk would suddenly cost $10, 000. That’s what Obamacare did to health insurance. Paul Ryan’s solution was to cut taxes on businesses  —   and make the milk watery. But he still wouldn’t allow milk to be sold on the free market. Democrats will be in the position of blocking American companies from selling a product that people want to buy. How will they explain that to voters? Perhaps Democrats will come out and admit that they need to fund health insurance for the poor by forcing   Americans to pay for it through their insurance premiums  —   because otherwise, they’d have to raise taxes, and they want to keep their Wall Street buddies’ income taxes low. Good luck with that! STEP 2: Next year, Congress formulates a better way of delivering health care to the welfare cases, which will be much easier since there will be a LOT fewer of them. No actual   business is going to survive by taking the welfare cases  —   the ones that will cover illegal aliens and Mara Liasson’s talk therapy  —   so the greedy will get government plans. But by then, only a minority of Americans will be on the “free” plans. (Incidentally, this will be a huge    —   if anyone cares about the federal budget.) Eighty percent of Americans will already have good health plans sold to them by insurance companies competing for their business. With cheap plans available, a lot of the greedy will go ahead and buy a free market plan. Who wants to stand in line at the DMV to see a doctor when your neighbors have great health care plans for $50 a month? We will have separated the truly unfortunate from the loudmouthed bullies who simply enjoy forcing other people to pay for their shrinks and aromatherapy. And if the Democrats vote against a sane method of delivering health care to the welfare cases, who cares? We have lots of wasteful government programs  —   take it out of Lockheed Martin’s contract. But at least the government won’t be depriving the rest of us of a crucial product just because we are middle class and the Democrats hate us. There’s your health care bill, GOP!

11569,Bernie Sanders: The Democratic primary gave me ‘leverage I intend to use’ to pressure Hillary Clinton,"Print 
Sen. Bernie Sanders laid out the ways he would leverage his popularity that emerged from the Democratic primary to continue to push Hillary Clinton to the left if she wins the presidency next month. 
In an interview published Monday with The Washington Post, Sanders argued that the Democratic Party is “more progressive” than its presidential nominee. 
He emphasized that he saw it as his role to “demand that the Democratic Party implement” the party platform his allies helped shape, and would be “vigorously in opposition” if Clinton attempted to abandon the platform’s progressive elements. 
“The leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people,” Sanders said. He then referenced the number of states he won during the primary, 22. 
“That gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use,” he added. 
The Vermont senator also emphasized that he would not be cowed by the knowledge that his proposals would not be well received by a likely Republican-controlled House of Representatives.",0
11570,Iowa Cop Killer Was Mad At Police For Not Arresting Black Teens Who Sat During Anthem,"Comments 
Special to Occupy Democrats by Carlos Miller of PINAC News. 
It was only last month that Scott Michael Greene accused a group of black teenagers of being “cop haters” because they did not stand for the National Anthem during a high school football game. This morning, he shot and killed two cops in cold blood as they sat in their patrol cars. Greene, 46, was arrested a few hours later after an intense manhunt. 
Below is a video he posted on YouTube, along with a screenshot of his comment referring to the black teens as cop haters for not standing during the national anthem at high school game, which caused him to throw a fit of rage leading to him eventually being kicked out of the stadium. 
He was angry at police after they had kicked him out of the football game for waving a Confederate flag in front of a group of black students in Urbandale on October 14, 2016. Two days later, he posted the infamous video to YouTube from the encounter titled, “Police Abuse, Civil Rights Violation at Urbandale High School 10/14/16.” 
Of course, neither Trump nor his campaign have said anything about the killings except a tweet offering the old tired “thoughts and prayers.” 
In the video, he tries to explain to the cops kicking him out that he was doing nothing more than expressing his First Amendment rights to wave the Confederate flag. He also said he was assaulted and had his flag stolen from him. However, police said he was causing a disturbance and that he would be arrested for trespassing on school property if he did not leave. They also returned his flag to him. 
While they agreed he had a Constitutional right to wave the flag, they informed him that on school grounds, he was subject to school policies that did not allow the waving of the Confederate flag. Less than a week ago, he stated in the comments section of his video that he was “offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem” and referred to them as being “cop haters.” Now, he is a suspected cop killer. Greene has a long history of arrests, including one incident where he threatened to kill a black man after calling him a racial slur. He also went though mental evaluation and was placed on medication. 
According to the Des Moines Register: 
He was charged with a simple misdemeanor count of interference with official acts on April 10, 2014, when he resisted an attempt by officers to pat him down for weapons at an Urbandale residence on Colby Parkway, according to a criminal complaint. The officers wanted to search Greene after noticing that he had a pouch on his belt that resembled a holster. 
Greene was “noncompliant, hostile, combative and made furtive movements toward his pockets” before the arrest, Officer Chris Greenfield wrote in the complaint. Greene pleaded guilty to the charge about two weeks later. 
The complaint does not indicate why officers initially came into contact with Greene. But two days later he reportedly threatened to kill a man in the parking lot of the same apartment complex and he was charged with first-degree harassment, according to another complaint. 
In that incident, Greene was accused of approaching a man in the parking lot and shined a flashlight in his eyes. Greene, who lived in the apartments, called the man the N-word and told the man “I will kill you, (expletive) kill you,” according to the complaint. Greene pleaded guilty to a lesser harassment charge on June 30, 2014, and was sentenced to one year of probation. 
In a discharge report filed in June 2015 a probation officer wrote that Greene had received a mental health evaluation and “reports to have complied with the medication recommendations.”

11572,"First Seen 30 Years Ago, a Supernova Refuses to Be Ignored - The New York Times","On the morning of Feb. 23, 1987, a couple of dozen subatomic particles known as neutrinos zinged through specially instrumented underground sensors in Japan, Ohio and Russia. The particles had squirted from the core of a collapsing star 163, 000 light years away in a small galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud. They were the heralds of doom. On their heels, a couple of hours later came a rising blitzkrieg of light, heat,   shock waves, and rings and knots of gas and all manner of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum  —   all the panoply of a star devouring itself in one of the great cataclysms of nature, a supernova explosion. SN1987A, as it is known, was the nearest supernova to be discovered since humans started using telescopes, and it sent astronomers rushing to observatories in Chile and Australia where the star was dying straight overhead. Since then, it has been studied by telescopes in space and on every continent, including Antarctica. And the show is still going on, as can be seen in new images obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope and released in honor of the event’s 30th anniversary. “There’s the shredded star in the center, the circumstellar ring that looks like a string of pearls,” Robert Kirshner, a longtime Harvard professor and currently science program director for the Moore Foundation, who has studied the supernova for 30 years, mused in an email. At its peak, SN1987A was radiating more energy than 100 million suns and was visible to the naked eye. Among other things, astronomers traced the explosion to a blue supergiant star that has now disappeared. The observations have allowed scientists to recreate the steps by which it started coming apart tens of thousands of years before the final cataclysm. The data confirmed that most of the light from the supernova was caused by the decay of radioactive cobalt produced as the star shrank catastrophically and then rebounded even more catastrophically in a thermonuclear fury. But another mystery remains. According to theory, the emission of neutrinos should have meant that the core of the doomed star was collapsing into a neutron star, a ball about the size of Manhattan but dense as an atomic nucleus, whose magnetic fields spinning and sweeping space like a lighthouse beam produce the clocklike signals known as pulsars. But there is no sign that a neutron star has been seen yet. “We’ve looked, but we don’t see any little dot in the center,” Dr. Kirshner said. Maybe it is hidden by dust, or maybe enough star material fell back onto the star to nudge it into collapsing into a black hole. The end of the story of this star is still unwritten. “The most interesting thing to test is whether we understand correctly how a star explodes and which elements it forms, by looking directly at the shredded star,” Dr. Kirshner said. “After all, you and the Earth are made of     supernova debris. ”",0

Obviously, she’s been living in her own corrupt world for many years and believes she’s untouchable. However, people are now finally seeing who the real Hillary Clinton is — a crook and a criminal. When she encountered the vocal Trump supporters at an early voting site and heard what they were implicating, her reaction is exactly how a guilty person would respond – she ignored them, plastering that fake grin across her face. She ignored the folks screaming ""Lock her up!"" pic.twitter.com/SpgHvawvUr

Of course, some people may argue that her reaction is what anyone would do, but I believe the contrary. If you’re innocent, you’re going to want everyone to know you didn’t do it and vocally deny any unexpected accusations. Of course, Hillary does the opposite as she has many years of practice on how to ignore people who call her out for her wrongdoings. 
Clearly, when FBI Director James Comey dropped his bombshell, reopening her criminal investigation, Hillary became frantic and desperate. She knows what she’s done and how guilty she is. 
Now, all she can do is pray nothing more comes to light before the big election. Sorry Hillary, not even your followers can be that dumb. I think it’s safe to say, Comey just handed Donald Trump the presidency.",0

Let’s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. The automated voice mail went out to every public school parent in San Francisco. “We are committed to providing a safe space for learning for each and every one of our students, including recent immigrants regardless of immigration status. We will continue to uphold San Francisco’s sanctuary city for all immigrants. ” Like major cities around the country, San Francisco city leaders have vowed to maintain their status as a “sanctuary city” for undocumented immigrants, limiting local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But students and parents continued to express anxiety over the election of Donald J. Trump. “A lot of students are coming to school with a lot of distress, there are students who genuinely fear for their future stability in the community based on the things they heard during the campaign,” said Gentle Blythe, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Unified School District. “I don’t think any of those students or those families are in any way reassured about any potential risk that would come in the new administration. ” The message, along with a lengthy letter, was sent in English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Vietnamese and Tagalog. Roughly   of the district’s students are immigrants, but there is no way to know how many are undocumented. San Francisco is not alone in its efforts to reassure students. The Los Angeles Unified School District is opening additional centers to direct parents to social services and legal help in light of the election. The University of California also reaffirmed its commitment to help undocumented students last week, saying it would not hand over any information about undocumented students without court orders. And the university’s president, Janet Napolitano, urged Mr. Trump to keep the program that grants temporary reprieve to young undocumented immigrants brought here as children. And on Monday, Kevin de León, the Senate president pro tem, introduced a package of bills intended to help undocumented immigrants by helping to provide legal representation, further limit local law enforcement cooperation and train public defenders on immigration law. It seems clear this is just the beginning of the state’s battle with a Trump administration over undocumented immigrants. • Oakland’s warehouse fire shows how rising rents can push desperate people toward unsafe housing.

There, after eight consecutive days of running, they both wept, Officer Cirrito, 47, said on Tuesday. “I’ve never felt that kind of emotion before. ” The officers each averaged 20 or so miles a day, sleeping in shifts of roughly four hours in a recreational vehicle and the occasional hotel room or firehouse. By about Day 4, Officer Cirrito was in dire straits, he said. His feet were bleeding inside his tactical boots. At one point he stopped to say hello to a man who turned up along the route with his    daughter. “He said: ‘This is my daughter and she’s fighting cancer. She’s my warrior.

11575,Western Lynch Mob on Russia Ties Itself up in Absurd Anots      : Information," Western Lynch Mob on Russia Ties Itself up in Absurd Knots By Finian Cunningham
October 31, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" RT "" - The Western lynch mob-like campaign to get Russia goes on, with the gathering this week of the United Nations Human Rights Council. By trying to suspend Russia from the council, the flagrant intent is to discredit and further demonize. The 47-member UNHRC, based in Geneva, is the United Nations premier inter-governmental forum on human rights. Members are selected on a rotational basis. On Friday, 14 seats on the council are up for renewal.
This week 80 mainly Western non-governmental organizations associated with human rights reportedly urged the UNHRC to drop Russias membership, citing allegations of war crimes committed during military operations to capture the Syrian city of Aleppo.
Over 80 NGOs call for Russia to be dropped from UN rights council over Syria https://t.co/uKTfWXWOLn
 RT (@RT_com) 24 октября 2016 г. Among the anti-Russia lobby were US-based and George Soros-funded Human Rights Watch. Notably, billionaire financier Soros is an open advocate for regime change in Russia.
The campaign to undermine Russia at the UNHRC was preceded last week when Britain  also a member of the council  convened a summit in Geneva. The council issued a resolution which pointedly condemned bombing of civilians in Syria, and implicitly laid the blame on Russia and allied Syrian state forces.
Russias permanent representative in Geneva Alexey Borodavkin rebuked the UNHRC for a one-sided, politicized statement, which he said sought to solely impugn Russia and Syria. He noted the rank hypocrisy of the United States, Britain and France, along with Gulf Arab states, which lobbied for the resolution.
Radar data proves Belgian F-16s attacked village near Aleppo, killing 6 - Russian military https://t.co/Aj8mgT39ri pic.twitter.com/XHU4ljZb4H
 RT (@RT_com) 20 октября 2016 г. These states have been arming and funding terrorist groups in Syria since the eruption of the war in March 2011. They are also sending their air forces on illegal bombing raids across the country  in the name of fighting terrorism  which has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and the destruction of social infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public buildings and residential homes.
In recent months, warplanes dispatched by the US, France and Belgium (the latter two current members of the UNHRC) have carried out air strikes on Syria causing dozens of civilian casualties.
So, of course, Western-orchestrated claims against Russia over alleged human rights violations in Syria are patently hypocritical and belie their own criminality.
The contrived effort to delist Russia from the UNHRC has the same hallmark as other Western media campaigns to discredit Moscow, such as the banning of Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics on dubious drug-abuse charges, or the pseudo-probe into the downing of the Malaysian airliner in 2014 over Ukraine, or overblown claims that Russian aggression is threatening the security of Europe. We can also include baseless accusations made by shadowy US intelligence agencies that Russia is hacking into computer systems to somehow disrupt the American presidential elections next month.
Saudi Arabia poised to be reelected to UN Human Rights Council https://t.co/sqWeSwjg48 #UNHR #SaudiArabia #humanrights
 RT (@RT_com) 27 октября 2016 г. The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating, demonizing and delegitimizing Russia.
Perhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia, both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seats.
That Saudi Arabia  widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth  is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oil-rich ally gain a seat, according to documents released last year by WikiLeaks.
A Saudi-led military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools, hospitals, mosques, marketplaces, funeral halls, factories and residential homes. Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen. It is also well documented that US, British, French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes. That makes these Western states fully complicit.

 RT (@RT_com) 21 октября 2016 г. Germany, for example, which is also a current member of the UNHRC, has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years, according to a report last week.
Britain, the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva, has sold over $4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015. Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity, the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots to help train Saudi counterparts, brazenly denying that there is any breach of international law.
There is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRC.
The hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and void.
Importantly too, is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites, but to also elucidate the anti-Russia claims as fabrications.
The information that Western governments, rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources. Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based, incongruously, either on claims issued by the British-located so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or by activist groups within terrorist-held east Aleppo, which are funded by Western governments, such as the purported rescue workers of the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center.
BREAKING: UN Human Rights Council votes to open probe into #Aleppo war crimes https://t.co/xrdojTxO3v pic.twitter.com/2gKhTiMovH
 RT (@RT_com) 21 октября 2016 г. In other words, Western governments, media, rights groups, and, sadly, UN agencies are promulgating an anti-Russia narrative that is recycled terrorist propaganda.Good proof of this is seen on the TV station called Free Syria broadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudi-owned satellite platform ArabSat.
Free Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy. It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman, along with Saudi troops, warplanes and tanks.
Free Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar al-Sham, which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS. Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogans.
Another regular contributor to the images and reports on this Saudi-funded, terrorist-supporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center. Thus, on this publicly available Free Syria channel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor, terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a self-incriminating amalgam.
What is even more damning is that the same  information is disseminated  albeit in a more polished form  through Western news outlets, such as CNN, BBC, France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers, like the New York Times and British Guardian.
Its an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted. Russias military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state. That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington, London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxies.
And to add insult to injury, these terrorist-sponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxies.
The utter insanity of it all. But maybe the Western lynch mob will eventually get hoisted on their own coiling ropes of deception.",0
11576,"In Turkey, U.S. Hand Is Seen in Nearly Every Crisis - The New York Times","ISTANBUL  —   Turkish officials accused the United States of abetting a failed coup last summer. When the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated last month, the Turkish press said the United States was behind the attack. And once again, after a gunman walked into an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year’s Day and killed dozens, the   news media pointed a finger at the United States. “America Chief Suspect,” one headline blared after the attack. On Twitter, a Turkish lawmaker, referring to the name of the nightclub, wrote: “Whoever the triggerman is, Reina attack is an act of CIA. Period. ” Turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border. But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies. Conversely, they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow, working with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to secure a   in Syria. One story in the Turkish press, based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey, was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack, which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for. Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military. Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious. Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism, the nightclub attack, even with the gunman still on the run, appears to have only accelerated Turkey’s shift away from the West, at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society. All of this is a reflection, many critics say, of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that, instead of unifying to confront terrorism, Turkish society is fracturing further with each attack. The West, symbolized by the United States, is the perennial bogeyman. While seeming to pile on the Obama administration in its waning days  —   by accusing it of supporting Turkey’s enemies, including the Islamic State Kurdish militants and supporters of an exiled Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for directing the coup  —   Turkish officials are also telegraphing something else: that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the United States once   Donald J. Trump takes office. “Our expectation from the new administration is to end this shame,” Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said this week while accusing the United States of providing weapons to Kurdish militants in Syria who are fighting the Islamic State, but are also an enemy of Turkey. “We are not holding the new administration responsible for this,” Mr. Yildirim said. “Because this is the work of the Obama administration. ” Meanwhile, the nightclub assailant is on the loose. The Turkish authorities said on Wednesday that they had identified the killer, but refused to release any other details, although photographs of the man, from surveillance cameras, have been released. Also, a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in Istanbul’s Taksim Square. A senior United States official, who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details, said the Turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in Istanbul. The official said the Turks now believed the killer was from Uzbekistan, not Kyrgyzstan, as many reports this week had first suggested. The official expressed alarm at the growing   in Turkey, which seems to accumulate after each crisis here, and said it put the lives of Americans in the country in jeopardy. The chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on Istanbul’s streets, with vehicle checkpoints, night raids on houses and   helicopters. “There is significant fear in ordinary people,” said Aydin Engin, a columnist at the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was detained last year as part of the government’s crackdown on the news media. “Fear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place, being in a crowd, going to a shopping mall, getting on the metro. ” With each passing day, public life descends deeper into what many Turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity, with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life. In the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the Bosporus, nationalists staged a mock execution of Santa Claus in the name of defending Islam a reporter for The Wall Street Journal was detained,   and placed in solitary confinement  —   for, according to the newspaper’s account, “violating a government ban on publication of images from an Islamic State video” and a   fashion designer was beaten up at the Istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts. “In a way, it’s basically a breakdown of order,” said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and academic, seeking to explain the tumult in society. “Everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it. ” Tugrul Eryilmaz, another longtime Turkish journalist, recalled the country’s military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed, and said, “I have never been in such a situation like today. ” He brought up the Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, who was known for surreal and absurd themes. “I feel like I am in his movies,” he said. While Turkey faces a growing terrorism threat, the country is also largely at war with itself, with deep divisions along many lines  —   religion, class, ethnicity  —   that make unity difficult even in a time of crisis. Perhaps the greatest source of division is between supporters of Mr. Erdogan, about half the country, and opponents who assert that he has become too powerful. “Turkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of Erdogan that, instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped, the   and   blocks in the country are blaming each other,” said Soner Cagaptay, a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “This is why I am deeply worried about Turkey and the country’s ability to stymie further terror attacks. ” Parliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup. The emergency grants Mr. Erdogan’s government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention. Tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs, on suspicion of having links to Mr. Gulen, who now lives in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan on Wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on Sunday morning, a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere, often giving speeches daily. Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist, rejected criticism that his government, in pushing an Islamist agenda, had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious. Many on social media, in the aftermath of the nightclub attack, noted that the Turkish government’s religious authorities had denounced New Year’s celebrations as  . “As the president of all 79 million citizens,” Mr. Erdogan said, “it is my duty to protect everyone’s rights, law and spaces of freedom. ” Mr. Erdogan, who spoke this week with President Obama in a condolence call, also told his audience what he believed Turkey, in facing so many terrorist attacks, was really up against: a plot by the West. Invoking the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the subsequent Turkish war against Western armies and their proxies, he said, “Today Turkey is in a new struggle for independence. ”",0
11577,Обама уничтожил американский продовольственный рынок в угоду украинским фашистам | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: США в мире Как отмечает в своей статье американский политический активист Калеб Маупин, в то время как рекордные урожаи гниют сегодня в амбарах по всем Соединенным Штатам, американские фермы сливают тысячи галлонов молока в сточные канавы в надежде хоть как-то повысить цены на этот продовольственный продукт. В то время как в США банкротятся малые фермерские хозяйства, крупные супермаркеты вроде WallMart закрывают десятки торговых точек, выгоняя своих работников на улицы. В то же время, пока в США зверствует продовольственный кризис, 13% американских семей находятся на грани голодания. Однако Вашингтон, который продолжает проводить учения НАТО у российских границ, платит за тысячи военных баз по всему миру и оказывает «экономическую помощь» таким государствам, как Израиль. Но американские власти все это мало беспокоит, ведь дотации малоимущим семьям в США продолжают снижаться. Конечно, Вашингтону мог бы крайне сильно помочь такой рынок продовольственного сбыта, как Россия, но он предпочел от него отказаться в пользу поддержки фашиствующего режима на Украине. Тем не менее режим экономических санкций, который Вашингтон и Брюссель ввели из-за нежелания России бросить на произвол судьбы этническое русское население Донбасса, оказал весьма благотворное влияние на российскую экономику. Сегодня российское фермерское хозяйство переживает настоящий бум, в то время как за океаном фермеры вынуждены уничтожать свои урожаи, чтобы хоть как-то повысить цены на продовольственное сырье. Автор отмечает, что-то должно быть не так с администрацией Обамы, если она предпочитает поддерживать иностранных фашистов, а не собственных фермеров.

11578,Cannabis Aficionados Develop THC-A Crystalline: The Strongest Hash in The World at 99.99% THC,"posted by Eddie While the sky-high potency may scare some away, Crystalline provides a surprisingly clean, focused, and inspired high. There’s a new kid on the block; her name is Crystalline, and she’s from the Hash Family. Crystalline hash is the latest craze in the hash community, and everyone wants a taste. The demand is so high that THC-A Crystalline is going for $200 a gram in southern California dispensaries . Testing in at an astonishing 99.9% THC, Crystalline is officially the strongest hash on the market. Other concentrates such as ice hash , rosin , and BHO range from 50-80% THC. Macro image of THC Crystalline. Photo courtesy of Allie Beckett. Cannabis concentrates are known for their variety of textures and forms, from shatter to wax to crumble, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. What many extract lovers don’t realize is that these various textures develop from the solvent used to make the concentrate and the methods of purging the solvent out of the final product. However, when THC is reduced to its purest state, it crystallizes, creating crystal ‘rocks’ which look very different than any other marijuana concentrate on the market. Crystalline turns many people off just because of its looks. The internet is filled with scornful reviews of its meth-like appearance, and this criticism is entirely valid. But don’t judge a book by its cover because cannabis crystalline is the purest form of THC and provides sufficient relief for many patients suffering from debilitating and fatal illnesses. And hey, it’s not THC’s fault that it’s a compound with a crystal structure. Guild Extracts, a Southern California extraction company, is the current leader of crystalline production. Their crystallizing process is kept under lock and key, but they claim the ability to make THC-A Crystalline out of any starting material ranging from hydrocarbon extract, CO2 extract, and ice water concentrate. One thing Guild Extracts has made clear is that they are not using a solvent to create this hash, rather, they are extracting pure THC from their starting materials. You may be wondering, what exactly is THC-A Crystalline? Well, before THC is combusted (lit on fire or vaporized) it sits in its raw acidic form, also known as THC-A. THC-A by itself is completely inactive, meaning if it is ingested it will not get you high (but it does have an extraordinary amount of medicinal benefits). When THC-A is activated through heat in a process called decarboxylation, the acidic carbon atom (the “A” in THC-A) is removed leaving behind the psychoactive THC that so many of us know and love. Macro image of THC Crystalline produced by Atom Labs. Photo courtesy of Allie Beckett. Now remember, this pure THC does not contain terpenes (the magical compounds that give cannabis strains their distinctive aroma and flavor profiles while contributing to their therapeutic effects). To make up for the lack of flavor, Guild Extracts has become famous for the “dip n dab,” dipping the crystalline concentrate into terpenes extracted from strains like Goji OG, Tangie, and Sherbert. While the sky-high potency may scare some away, Crystalline provides a surprisingly clean, focused, and inspired high. Plus, health nuts can rest easy knowing that THC-A Crystalline is completely free of any chemical inputs (think butane). source:",0
11579,"H.I.V. Cases Surpass a Million in Russia, but Little Is Done - The New York Times","ST. PETERSBURG, Russia  —   Quietly, the number of Russians who have received a positive H. I. V. diagnosis passed the one million mark this year. There is, however, little indication that the government will commit adequate resources to stem the acceleration of the virus from   groups into the general population. About 850, 000 Russians carry H. I. V. and an additional 220, 000 have died since the late 1980s, said Vadim Pokrovsky, the longtime head of the   Federal AIDS Center, who estimated that at least another 500, 000 cases of H. I. V. have gone undiagnosed. Although the label “epidemic” prompts denials from some senior officials, experts on the front lines like Mr. Pokrovsky are calling it just that. The overall estimate of victims constitutes about 1 percent of Russia’s population of 143 million, enough to be considered an epidemic, they argued. Beyond that, they said that heterosexual sex would soon top intravenous drug use as the main means of infection. “This can already be considered a threat to the entire nation,” Mr. Pokrovsky said, noting that the caseload is increasing by about 10 percent a year. In 2016, 100, 000 new infections are anticipated, about 275 daily. It is the largest H. I. V. epidemic in Europe and among the highest rates of infection globally. Despite the grim milestone, experts do not expect much change in Russia, where victims still face the kind of stigma prevalent in the 1980s in the West and where continuing trench warfare between the Kremlin and independent nongovernmental organizations saps collective efforts. In addition, some prominent voices push “family values” as the ideal prevention program. In many ways, Russia’s fight against H. I. V. is a case study in the constant tension between civil society and a Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin public activity outside government control is considered inherently suspect. Tensions heightened this year after the Justice Ministry blackballed a number of bantam N. G. O.s involved in combating H. I. V.  as “foreign agents” because they received grants from abroad. Anton Krasovsky, a prominent talk show host fired in January 2013 after coming out as gay on air, says he has spent his personal savings building an N. G. O. that tries to bridge that divide. “Since we are not talking about fighting Putin, but fighting a virus, people have to understand that they can fight this virus only if they are on the same side as Putin,” Mr. Krasovsky said. “It is impossible to change the situation without coming to some kind of an agreement. ” The president has remained largely silent on H. I. V. Over all, activists said, the combination of indifference toward victims, government financial austerity, hostility toward foreign funds and a powerful camp of AIDS deniers all amounts to the lack of a coherent national effort. Experts criticized a new, rather vague Russian government strategy on fighting H. I. V. that was released in October for lacking a plan of execution or any new money. Despite that, both sides in the H. I. V. battle agree that Russia has made some progress. The fact that a national strategy exists  —   as well as an advertising program promoting H. I. V. tests backed by Svetlana Medvedeva, the wife of the prime minister  —   at least implies some   interest. In St. Petersburg, one married couple, Dr. Tatiana N. Vinogradova and Andrei Skvortsov, straddles the  . G. O. divide on the issue. Dr. Vinogradova, slim beneath her white coat, with bobbed brown hair and beige stilettos, is a   H. I. V. warrior. Her grandmother, an   specialist, treated one of the first patients in St. Petersburg in the late 1980s and pushed the city to establish an AIDS Center. Dr. Vinogradova’s mother ran it, and she herself is now its deputy head of scientific research. Mr. Skvortsov, wiry, scrappy and H. I. V. positive  —   a reformed drug addict and    —   runs a small N. G. O. called Patients in Control. It was founded in 2010 to try to cajole, pressure and embarrass both federal and local governments into providing   treatment. At the St. Petersburg AIDS Center, Dr. Vinogradova, 41, has seen the prevalence among drug addicts shrink while cases among heterosexual couples soar. “Calling it an epidemic would be akin to admitting that the government let the problem get out of control over the past 30 years,” she said, explaining why the government avoids the term. But she uses the national strategy and any official statements she can find to try to wring more money out of politicians. “This is Russia, so everything has to be top down to get anything done. ” The couple has tried to use their marriage to help break the stigma that the disease is an untreatable plague limited to drug addicts, homosexuals or others likely to die anyway. “I watch people jump back a meter when he says he is living with H. I. V. ,” Dr. Vinogradova said, with older medical professionals particularly still fearful despite the raft of evidence that anyone taking antiviral drugs is not infectious. “Now whenever I hear about H. I. V. discrimination, I take it as a personal offense. ” When her husband needed an operation last year to repair with a metal implant a collarbone broken in a motorcycle accident, the surgeon refused after discovering his H. I. V. status. Mr. Skvortsov, 37, recently appeared on a talk show with Evgeniya Prokhoda, an H. I. V. activist in the southern city of Krasnodar, and one of the first Russians to speak about carrying the virus on national television without hiding her face. She detailed the gantlet of fear and discrimination she had faced, including when authorities put her son in an orphanage for about a year after her own mother sued to have him removed from home. The day after she appeared on television, Mrs. Prokhoda was fired. Activists and experts always come back to the lack of government support as the root problem. Under World Health Organization guidelines, to reduce the spread of the disease, at least 90 percent of H. I. V.  patients should receive antiviral drugs. In Russia, a little more than 37 percent receive such treatment, according to government statistics. “The prevention programs are not working, the coverage is not sufficient to break the curve,” said Vinay P. Saldanha, the Unaids regional director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Russia is among five countries that account for almost half the new infections globally the others are South Africa, Nigeria, India and Uganda, according to Unaids figures, although in some of them, a much higher percentage of the overall population is infected. Most of the $338 million annual Russian federal H. I. V. budget is spent on medicine, and almost nothing goes to preventive education. Veronika Skvortsova, the health minister, has repeatedly called expanding treatment programs a government priority. (The minister is not related to Andrei Skvortsov.) After a deep recession, however, little new money has materialized. At the same time, the Russian Orthodox Church and some politicians promote “conservative values” as the best way to combat H. I. V. Patriarch Kirill called for “moral education,” stressing that the “establishment of family values, ideals of chastity and marital fidelity” should be at the forefront of curbing the virus. Both the government and the church staunchly oppose sex education for children. One senior government official stated that classical literature was the best teacher. The state also adamantly opposes methadone for drug addicts, sometimes denigrated as a “narcoliberal” scheme. In other countries, methadone programs are used both to treat and to monitor patients infected by intravenous needles. The emphasis on traditional values dismays those fighting the disease. “Traditional values just means leaving everything as it is,” Mr. Pokrovsky said. “If we have traditional values and do nothing, the epidemic will keep spreading. ” Compounding the problems, the federal government has tried to silence organizations that challenged its policies, labeling them “foreign agents” for receiving grants from abroad, forcing some to close. The Andrey Rylkov Foundation for Health and Social Justice, which hands out free needles and condoms in southern Moscow, now has to staple a small label to its plastic bags saying “Foreign Agent” as required by law. Recipients said they could not care less, but it means that the foundation cannot work with government organizations. “H. I. V. is not a personal problem, it is a social problem, and it should be solved as a social problem,” Elena Plotnikova, who works for the foundation, said as she handed out supplies. “The basic attitude of the government is: You made a bad decision and we are not going to help you. ” N. G. O.s are considered crucial to reaching populations that avoid government contact, including drug addicts, prostitutes and gay men. Help varies widely from city to city. St. Petersburg is perhaps the most enlightened, treating all comers to its clinic and sponsoring an advertising campaign. Dr. Vinogradova and Mr. Skvortsov appear together on one poster encouraging people to get tested. The couple is startlingly open about their sex life, stressing that his being on antiviral drugs means that she remains H. I. V. negative even though they do not use condoms. In the poster, wearing navy blue shirts, they stare into each other’s eyes. “I know that there are no barriers to my love,” reads the text. “H. I. V. is not an obstacle to creating a family it’s possible to live a long life with H. I. V. ”",0

Sad part is when the media lies with the Hillary campaign to try to trick stupid people into thinking someone it takes ‘the russians’ to get into a gmail account. The only evidence when you look about Russia hacking anything is ‘we think it is russia cause that is the kind of thing they would do’ How much more of the manufacturing base of the u.s. has to be lost before someone stops supporting the people the destroyed it?

11581,"Philando Castile Was Pulled Over 49 Times in 13 Years, Often for Minor Infractions - The New York Times","ST. PAUL  —   Turning into a parking lot without signaling. Failing to repair a broken seatbelt. Driving at night with an unlit license plate. Driving with tinted windows. In a   span, Philando Castile was pulled over by the police in the  . Paul region at least 49 times, an average of about once every three months, often for minor infractions. His mother, Valerie, who was often called on to help when her son’s car was impounded, believes that the police were stopping Mr. Castile not because of his driving but because of his race. “Driving while black,” she said. But Mr. Castile did not follow his mother’s advice to lodge an official complaint about biased policing, possibly because he drove for six consecutive years without a valid license, as officers would quickly discover after they pulled him over. It was also, his mother said, not his nature to complain. “He didn’t quite look at it as being profiled,” she said. Mr. Castile, a    school cafeteria worker, had regained his license and had been driving legally for three years when a Hispanic police officer, Jeronimo Yanez, pulled him over in a tiny suburb called Falcon Heights, Minn. on July 6, ostensibly for a cracked taillight. According to his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was in the passenger seat, Mr. Castile tried to tell Officer Yanez that he was carrying a gun with a legal permit. Mr. Castile was  reaching for his identification when the officer shot him several times, Ms. Reynolds said. A lawyer for Officer Yanez said that Mr. Castile had not followed his client’s commands and that Officer Yanez had been reacting to Mr. Castile’s gun when he fired. The episode, to many, is a heartbreaking illustration of the disproportionate risks black motorists face with the police. In the past two years, at least two other    —   in Cincinnati and in North Charleston, S. C.  —   were fatally shot by officers after being pulled over for minor traffic infractions. The killings have helped fuel a growing national debate over racial bias in law enforcement. “This is years and years of racial profiling,” said Rashad Turner, an organizer with the St. Paul chapter of Black Lives Matter. “Now it’s come to the death of a pillar in our community, a black man who was taking care of business. ” Traffic stops are how most citizens interact with law enforcement, and they tend to shape perceptions of the police. They rarely turn violent, but even peaceful encounters, like all but one of Mr. Castile’s, can lead to fines, searches, arrests and days of sitting in courtrooms that disproportionately affect poorer citizens. In the seven states that collect the most comprehensive data on traffic stops, analysts have found   disparities in how   drivers are treated. In two of the states, Connecticut and Rhode Island, changes in traffic enforcement followed. There has been no such change in Minnesota. A   study in 2003 found that minority drivers were more likely than white drivers to be both stopped and searched, even though officers found contraband more often when searching white drivers. Myron Orfield, a University of Minnesota professor who was a   of the study, said that the findings strongly suggested widespread racial and ethnic bias in traffic enforcement. More recently, a study by the American Civil Liberties Union found that   and Native Americans in Minneapolis were eight times more likely than whites to be charged with a   infraction, such as trespassing or loitering. Mr. Castile’s encounters with law enforcement began when he was a teenager but never went beyond traffic infractions or misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession, which were dismissed. Nor was there ever any indication that he had been combative with the police. When a St. Paul officer pursuing a drug suspect stopped Mr. Castile’s car in 2005, the officer wrote that he knew him and that “normally Castile is very cooperative and friendly. ” In his first six years as a driver, Mr. Castile received nearly two dozen tickets, mostly for driving without insurance or with a suspended license. He managed to keep getting his license reinstated until late 2007, when it was revoked for a lack of insurance. Maria Mitchell, an assistant public defender in the county that includes Minneapolis, said Mr. Castile was typical of   drivers who lose their licenses, then become overwhelmed by snowballing fines and fees. “Clients just start to feel hopeless,” she said. “Kind of like when your credit gets out of control. ” St. Paul has limited public transportation, activists said, and Mr. Castile’s car allowed him to reach his job with the St. Paul school district, which hired him shortly after he graduated from high school. In the six years after he lost his license, Mr. Castile was pulled over another 21 times, repeatedly convicted of driving with an invalid license, fined and ordered not to drive. Amid the string of traffic stops was one in Maplewood, another suburb of St. Paul, one afternoon in 2008. Mr. Castile had driven a friend’s car, a 1997 black Mercury Marquis, to a Taco Bell for lunch. An officer pulled him over for tinted windows. The police report gives the following account: Mr. Castile said he had a license but could not produce it or proof of insurance. He was sweating heavily, appeared “very nervous” and fumbled for his wallet. The officer spotted a small bag of marijuana in the ashtray, ordered Mr. Castile out of the car, handcuffed him, undid his belt, loosened his pants and searched inside. The officer found only $377 in the pants pockets  —   which Mr. Castile said had come from cashing his paycheck. Mr. Castile was arrested and accused of possession of less than   of an ounce of marijuana, a charge later dismissed, and driving with a revoked license, for which he was convicted. Mr. Castile’s sister Allysza said her brother’s love of     cars, like the 1997 Oldsmobile he bought for $275 and was driving when he was shot, attracted police officers’ attention. Ms. Castile was pulled over three times when she borrowed his car, she said, because “those are mostly stereotyped as drug   cars. ” “I told him several times, ‘We need to go to the police station and report this, because this ain’t right,’” Valerie Castile, his mother, said in an interview. “Every time you get in that car and leave out the door you come back with another ticket, or they take it from him and I have to go get it. ” By   Mr. Castile had at last set his driving affairs in order. He had passed a new driver’s test. He had purchased car insurance. That year and the next, he paid off at least $1, 200 in fines, although he apparently still owed about $500. He had some extra cash because in 2014 the school district promoted him to cafeteria supervisor, a job that paid $19. 31 an hour. Mr. Castile had received only one ticket, for speeding, in nearly three years when Officer Yanez and another officer pulled him over in the early evening near the state fairgrounds in Falcon Heights, a spot where residents say traffic stops are common. The Police Department for the neighboring town of St. Anthony, which patrols Falcon Heights and two other suburbs, had declined to participate in the state’s 2003 study of racial profiling in traffic stops, even though the decision meant forgoing police cameras and other incentives, Professor Orfield said.   make up at most 8 percent of the residents in the cities policed by the department. But they amounted to 19 percent of those who received tickets and 41 percent of those arrested there last year, statistics show. Peter Lindstrom, the mayor of Falcon Heights, said residents were stunned and saddened that Mr. Castile had been killed in a town where the biggest controversies tended to be about issues like whether to build a sidewalk. At a somber City Council meeting on Wednesday, resident after resident, nearly all of them white, demanded changes in policing practices. One of them, Chuck Johnson, said, “I don’t want this to be done in my name in this town anymore. ”",0

11583,Поезд Сапсан задержался в пути из-за погодных условий,"0 комментариев 0 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как пишет РИА Новости, состав в итоге прибудет в северную столицу на 2,5-3 часа позже указанного в расписании времени. 
Следовавший из Москвы в Санкт-Петербург поезд из-за образовавшейся на путях наледи застрял в Новгородской области, отмечает издание. По данным Октябрьской железной дороги (ОЖД), ""к месту остановки состава выслан вспомогательный локомотив и резервный «Сапсан». Опоздание поезда составит ориентировочно 2,5-3 часа"". 
Издание отмечает, что в Санкт-Петербурге пассажиров опоздавшего «Сапсана» развезут по домам три автобуса. 
Напомним, ""Сапсан"" № 778 был задержан в среду в 22:21 мск на станции Мстинский Мост в Новгородской области. При этом в 22:45 мск по техническим причинам там же был остановлен еще один «Сапсан», который прибудет в Санкт-Петербург на полчаса позже запланированного времени. 
На той же станции в Новгородской области в 22:45 мск по техническим причинам остановлен еще один ""Сапсан"". Он прибудет в Санкт-Петербург на 30 минут позже запланированного времени. 
""Специалисты Октябрьской железной дороги делают все возможное для скорейшего ввода поездов в график"", - отмечает железная дорога. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что спешившая на скоростной поезд ""Сапсан"" пассажирка разбила стеклянную дверь автобуса во время движения по Невскому проспекту в Петербурге. 
Согласно информации пресс-службы предприятия ""Пассажиравтотранс"", инцидент произошел в среду вечером, когда маршрутный автобус № 3 подъезжал к остановке на Невском проспекте около дома № 77. В тот момент пассажирка автобуса, сильно торопясь успеть на свой рейс и не дожидаясь плановой остановки, выбила стеклянную дверь ногой и сбежала. На опубликованном в социальных сетях фото с места событий видно, что стекло в двери автобуса отсутствует полностью. 
По словам представителя ""Пассажиравтотранс"", поймать девушку на месте сразу не удалось, поэтому предприятие обратилось за помощью к полиции. О задержании спешившей пассажирки информации пока не поступало, как и том, успела ли девушка на ""Сапсан"". 
А недавно высокоскоростной ""Сапсан"", проезжая этот участок по пути из Петербурга в Москву, насмерть сбил двух мужчин. Скорость состава была 200 километров в час. По мере приближения к платформе, заметив двух людей, переходящих пути, машинист нажал тревожную кнопку, однако те не отреагировали на сигнал и не отошли, в результате чего их буквально затянуло воздушной волной. 
Как сообщили в местном управлении МВД, после экстренного торможения и наезда на людей машинист не остановился и продолжал маршрут. Погибшими оказались двое мужчин из Карелии, подрабатывавшими в этой области в электричках. Они были глухонемыми и не услышали важного сигнала. 
По факту инцидента проводится проверка.

11584,"BREAKING : Obama Encourages Voter Fraud on Live TV, Encourages Illegals To Vote!","This is completely disgraceful. Obama is advocating committing VOTER FRAUD on live television as ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS are not permitted to vote. 
Via AlternativeNews 

Barack Obama has gone on record encouraging illegal immigrants to vote in the United States presidential election.
Appearing on MiTu, a YouTube channel aimed at Latino millenials, Obama was asked by the host Gina Rodriguez if undocumented immigrants should be fearful of voting. But rather than setting her straight and telling her that voting is a sacred right of citizens, and if you are an undocumented immigrant you are not a citizen, Obama actually encourages illegals to sneak into a booth somehow and vote.
How desperate are the Democrats? As the polls tighten and Hillary’s campaign lurches from one scandal to another, the president of the United States, making the rules up as he goes along, is urging non-citizens to vote.

11585,Donald Trump Trashes Nafta. But Unwinding It Would Come at a Huge Cost. - The New York Times,"When you buy an “ ” car, you are probably buying a car that has an immensely complicated mix of components that were also made in Mexico and Canada. The same is true for many electronics, and advanced textiles like carpeting. The beef in your grocery store might be from a cow that was fattened and slaughtered in the United States, but that was very likely born across the border in Mexico. That is the world that has evolved in the almost 23 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted. These deep economic interconnections show why trying to unravel what Donald J. Trump, in last week’s debate, called “the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country” would be no easy feat. It would risk disrupting the very underpinnings of industries that employ millions of Americans. The view among mainstream economists is that Nafta, over all, has raised incomes in the United States while also costing it thousands of manufacturing jobs. But whether you view the agreement as a net positive or a net negative for the country, the reality is that the United States, Canada and Mexico are now for all practical purposes a single integrated economy. That has   consequences  —   especially if the next president tries to reshape or abandon the deal. At the border between Santa Teresa, N. M. and the Mexican town of San Jeronimo, up to 5, 000 head of cattle a day amble across the border they are less likely to become stressed and lose weight when they walk under their own power than when loaded into semis. After being bred in the hills of Northern Mexico, and after eating American corn, they become a key input for the American beef industry. It creates jobs in feedlots and slaughterhouses in the United States, where the animals are fattened, and produces less costly beef for consumers in the United States and in the global markets to which the beef is exported. A few miles away, Mexican workers in a Foxconn facility assemble Dell computers that were designed in Texas and will be sold all over the world. Low labor costs keep Dell on a competitive footing with global competitors like China’s Lenovo. Because of that, Dell can employ thousands of highly paid engineers and salespeople in the United States. And American automobile companies have supply chains that are so thoroughly integrated across the Canadian and Mexican borders that when huge traffic backups developed on the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, because of intensive security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Michigan auto factories were at risk of having to shut down for want of supplies. The auto industry is so intertwined among the three countries that it’s almost useless to think of a car as being “made in the United States,” even if the final assembly takes place within America’s borders. “You have what looks like an American car, with Mexican labor and materials that went into it and Canadian materials,” said James Bookbinder, a professor of logistics and manufacturing at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. “It’s really from the Nafta region, and in the process some of those jobs created are in Mexico, but there are also jobs in the United States because all these pieces fit together. ” As a general rule, Mexican suppliers make parts that can be done with   labor and relatively simple assembly  —   plastic bumpers, seats or dashboards. More complex parts like engines, transmissions and electronics components are more likely to be made in the United States or Canada, where the workers and suppliers with more advanced skills are in greater supply. “A transmission is a complicated piece of machinery and might go back and forth across the border three or four times as different components are added at different plants,” said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. There are parallels elsewhere in the world. In Europe, German manufacturing is extraordinarily successful on the world stage  —   but many of the more     inputs for German cars and other manufactured goods come from   countries in the European Union like Poland and Hungary. It’s true that there have been fewer   jobs in the United States since the introduction of Nafta. The 926, 000 jobs making motor vehicles and parts is down 15 percent since December 1993. But it’s hard to untangle the impact of trade and the shifting of some work to Mexico from the advanced technology like robotics that reduces the   it takes to build a car. Overall manufacturing employment in the United States is down 27 percent in the same span. “There’s this tendency to say, ‘It’s all moving to Mexico,’ ” said Bernard Swiecki, a senior analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. But the center’s research finds that automakers have spent $77 billion on new or upgraded capital projects in the United States since 2010, compared with $26 billion in Mexico. The improved competitiveness of American companies in the global auto market since the 1990s has happened in part because they have built more efficient North American supply chains. Different parts of the car are made in the place where the local labor force and cost structure are the best fit. “If a product uses really sophisticated materials like   steels and advanced composites, and more sophisticated processes,” Mr. Swiecki said, there’s a better chance you can find the people with the skills needed in the United States or Canada. Meanwhile, the lower price of   parts imported from Mexico helps control the cost of the overall automobile and makes it more competitive with cars built in Europe or Asia. Since the 1990s, major automakers based outside the United States have built American factories to gain access to these local supply networks and get closer to American consumers. That has to do with a lot more than Nafta, but the connections between North American parts suppliers across borders surely helped speed the process. The North American auto industry is not the only sector where such a transformation has occurred, Mr. Hufbauer says. American textile companies make technologically advanced fabrics like those for carpeting, parachutes or the steel mesh inside tires. They are exported to Mexico, where the more   work of turning those into finished goods is done. The same goes for many electronics. But even if you accept that these trends contribute to higher economic output, and to more   jobs and more competitive companies in the United States, it’s not as if the anxiety about losing jobs that Mr. Trump describes doesn’t have a realistic basis. After all, it’s fine to say that Dell is a more competitive, successful company by assembling computers in Juarez, which creates more   jobs for the people who design and sell those computers. But that isn’t much solace if you were one of the 905 people who lost jobs at the plant in   N. C. doing that same work. In other words, the narrative promulgated by trade skeptics that a more integrated global economy has worsened job opportunities for certain workers isn’t wrong. But it’s also not a given that the trend will reverse itself if the next president does seek to renegotiate Nafta. We don’t know exactly what a President Trump would do in seeking to renegotiate Nafta, or what exactly the consequences would be of a trade war between the United States and its partners. And a trade war could well erupt if he were to follow through on some of his aggressive statements. What we do know is that even relatively small tariffs can stand in the way of the kind of supply networks on which many modern industries are based. With these networks, goods can cross back and forth across national borders multiple times as part of the pipeline that leads to a finished automobile or a computer or even a side of beef. It’s not that companies couldn’t adjust over time they could. It’s that the networks evolved this way for a reason, and readjusting would come at a considerable cost. More fundamentally, trying to reject the   deal with America’s neighbors entirely would mean upending major industries and a generation’s worth of economic integration. Nafta has had its flaws and downsides. But either major American industries would have to figure out how to restructure themselves to rely less on the movement of goods across borders, or the United States would find itself poorer and more of an island in the global economy.",0
11586,China’s Growing Amphibious Capabilities (Part 1),"Syrian War Report – November 2, 2016: ISIS and Al-Nusra Attempt to Cut Off Govt Supply Line to Aleppo ‹ › South Front Analysis & Intelligence is a public analytical project maintained by an independent team of experts from the four corners of the Earth focusing on international relations issues and crises. They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. China’s Growing Amphibious Capabilities (Part 1) By South Front on November 3, 2016 …from SouthFront 
This is the first part of the military analysis of China’s amphibious capabilities and their influence on the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region. The second part of the analysis will be released next week. 
The Chinese government has achieved a great deal in terms of modernizing and increasing the capabilities of its armed forces in the past two decades and they are quickly obtaining parity with their counterparts in the West. China has made great strides along the long road to rebuild its military, so that it can compete and excel in the modern battlespace. Much has been written about the fledgling PLAN aircraft carrier program. With one conventional aircraft carrier in service, the Liaoning , and a second carrier being built, China has obviously made the commitment to acquire at least a small aircraft carrier strike capability. 
Another important development, perhaps less sensational and headline catching than aircraft carriers, is the growth and modernization of the amphibious capabilities of both the PLA and PLAN. Chinese military strategists realize that naval power, including naval aviation, can project power and can also provide China with the more subtle, yet very effective means of naval power presence in the region. The presence of Chinese naval power in the region can be leveraged to influence advantage in political struggles with its neighbors. Neither naval presence, nor naval power and naval air power can take (or retake) and hold ground, and thus China has decided that a modern and capable amphibious force of sufficient size is a necessary component of its overall maritime strategy. It is significant that this force has doubled in size over the past five years and has been equipped with new, high-tech weaponry and the beginnings of a viable sealift component that can carry it to battle. 
The beginnings of the Chinese interest in amphibious warfare dates back to the Korean War and the Peoples Republic of China’s efforts to defeat the Kuomintang in the 1950s. In 1953, the PLA established the PLA Marine Corps (PLAMC). Although comprising of two brigades of approximately 6,000 officers and men, the PLAMC have undergone a continuous transformation since the Taiwan Strait Crises of the 1990s. The force has been equipped with China’s most modern and capable small arms and equipment, and utilizes the new generation of ZBD05/ZBD2000 amphibious assault vehicles. In some ways modeled on the USMC, the PLAMC marines are highly trained in all forms of modern warfighting. They are considered a vital component of China’s rapid reaction forces, and are thus highly mobile and kept on a heightened state of readiness. 
The current force structure of the PLAMC is of two brigades, the 1 st Marine Brigade and 164 th Marine Brigade. Each brigade consists of one armored regiment and two marine battalions and various support elements. The PLAMC relies on the high speed of its ZBD05/2000 series vehicles to carry them from offshore amphibious platforms such as the Type 071 LPD. The ZBD05 is the world’s fastest armored amphibious assault vehicle, capable of a top speed of 45kph (27mph) in the water. In addition, PLA marines are skilled in air assault operations, small boat assaults and underwater diving operations. 
Although the PLAMC represents a very potent amphibious assault and rapid reaction force, the Chinese political and military leadership realized years ago, that the force is too small to respond to multiple threats across the full scope of China’s maritime boundaries, nor large enough to mount a successful invasion of Taiwan. A viable power projection capability in the form of amphibious assault and air assault forces is seen as essential in protecting the nation’s interests in Africa, the Indian Ocean, South China Sea and East China Sea, especially as it is confronted by U.S. attempts to contain it. 
Starting in 2014, the Chinese high command decided to expand the two established Amphibious Mechanized Infantry Divisions (AMID) to four. The 1 st and 86 th AMIDs are based in the Nanjing Military Region (Eastern Command), and the 123 rd and 124 th AMIDs are based in the Guangzhou Military Region (Southern Command). Each division is comparable to a mechanized infantry division in size and establishment. The expansion of the AMIDs gives the PLA a greater amphibious capability that might be required in the near future in deterring regional challenges to Chinese territorial claims in both the South and East China Seas, and providing a viable response to violations of its territorial integrity. 
None of China’s potential adversaries in the region, other than the United States Navy, have a comparable amphibious warfare force. When combined with the PLAMC, the AMIDS give Chinese diplomacy a very robust practical demonstration of force. Regularly held amphibious exercises showcasing the growing aptitude of these forces only reinforce this reality. Perhaps the most obvious challenges facing the marines and AMIDs, and a major shortcoming that is in the process of remedy, is the lack of heavy sealift capability to transport these units over long sea voyages and within striking range of their theoretical targets.

11587,Court in Egypt Overturns Mohamed Morsi’s Death Sentence - The New York Times,"CAIRO  —   One of Egypt’s highest courts overturned a death sentence imposed on Mohamed Morsi, who was the country’s first democratically elected president and was ousted in 2013 by the military. Mr. Morsi, who is serving a life sentence in prison for offenses related to espionage and inciting violence, is likely to remain in prison indefinitely. The annulment of his death sentence  —   as well as the sentences against five other leaders of Mr. Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood movement  —   suggests the government’s reluctance to execute leaders of the Brotherhood, which still maintains some public support after its role in the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. The Brotherhood, which held power for just over a year, has been classified as a terrorist group by the government of Abdel Fattah   the president and a former military leader, and thousands of the group’s leaders and members have been jailed or killed or have gone into exile. Even so, observers widely believe that executing top leaders like Mr. Morsi could lead to a new surge of violence. The Court of Cassation, an appellate panel that interprets and applies Egyptian law, ordered a retrial of a case in which Mr. Morsi was charged with orchestrating a prison break during the chaotic days of the 2011 uprising against Mr. Mubarak. The case must be heard again in the courts. Mr. Morsi may again be given the death sentence, said Khaled Nashar, the spokesman for the Ministry of Justice. “The Court of Cassation’s job is to make sure the courts followed the law,” Mr. Nashar said. “They have to redo the procedures now and then. They can issue whatever verdict they see fit. ” But even if Mr. Morsi is again sentenced to death, the penalty is unlikely to be carried out, “if only for the reaction it would provoke within Egypt,” said H. A. Hellyer, a scholar at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington. If Mr. Morsi were executed, he said, it could undo the uneasy calm that has settled in Egypt since 2013, when Mr. Sisi, who was then commander of Egypt’s armed forces, deposed Mr. Morsi amid a popular wave of anger against the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Morsi had been democratically elected president the year before. Mr. Sisi led a crackdown against the group, including killing at least 800 people, and possibly as many as 1, 000, when security forces dispersed a   in Cairo in August 2013. Executing Mr. Morsi would very likely make him a martyr to millions of Islamists and provide fuel for violence. It was that concern, rather than any desire for reconciliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, that would keep him alive, Mr. Hellyer said. “They are crazy, but they are not that crazy,” Mr. Hellyer said of the Egyptian authorities. “I don’t think they want to execute him, but it doesn’t mean he is getting out. ” Mr. Morsi has been sentenced several times to life in prison. One of those sentences, on charges arising from the killing of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012, does not permit parole. Last year, he was given lengthy prison terms on charges of spying for Qatar for Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza and for Hezbollah, the Shiite Lebanese group. He also is facing trial for another case involving insulting the judiciary. The next hearing is set for December, said Nicholas Piachaud, a researcher on Egyptian affairs at the human rights group Amnesty International. The Court of Cassation rules only on matters of law, not matters of fact.     one of Mr. Morsi’s lawyers, had argued that the death penalty should be overturned “because the initial trial was deeply flawed. ” Mr.   added: “It’s not like he is going home today. He already has a final sentence of 20 years in prison. But at least today he gets to take off the red suit. ” Prisoners awaiting the death penalty in Egypt wear red jumpsuits other prisoners wear blue.",0

11589,AFT President Weingarten: Trump’s Budget ’Takes a Meat Cleaver to Public Education’,"The president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) says President Donald Trump’s budget blueprint “takes a meat cleaver to public education. ”[At a press conference Thursday, Randi Weingarten said to members of the media, “Budgets tell you priorities, and what you have here is a budget that tells you that President Trump’s priority is not public education. The budget takes a meat cleaver to public education. ”  Trump’s budget hurts the working poor. From taking a meat cleaver to pub ed to job cuts, this is wrong. #SkinnyBudget https:  .   —   Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 16, 2017,  Weingarten and public education advocates have condemned Trump’s push since the end of his campaign for school choice programs as a means to bring about social justice for families living in   areas. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos worked in her home state of Michigan to develop school voucher programs that allowed parents to use taxpayer funds to have their children attend public charter, private and religious schools. Trump’s nomination of DeVos signaled his pivot toward school choice as the primary theme of his education agenda. Teachers’ unions especially say that school choice will draw taxpayer funding away from traditional public schools and toward public charter schools as well as private and religious schools. Trump’s 2018 budget calls for an increase in federal spending on school choice programs by $1. 4 billion, ultimately reaching an annual total of $20 billion. Additional spending in 2018 on school choice would include: A $168 million increase for charter schools, $250 million for a new private school choice program, and a $1 billion increase for Title I, dedicated to encouraging districts to adopt a system of   based budgeting and open enrollment that enables Federal, State, and local funding to follow the student to the public school of his or her choice. “The budget also includes both   and   voucher programs that further an ideological crusade against public education,” Weingarten said during the press conference. She continued: What we have here is what we feared when Betsy DeVos was nominated for this job. That  —   just like she did in Michigan  —   she tried to defund public schools with the aim of destabilizing and destroying them, and then lifting up other things that had really shoddy  …    track records. That’s exactly what the Title I portability proposal does. It’s a   voucher scheme which, frankly, was expressly rejected in the recently enacted bipartisan federal education law. Trump’s budget plan also calls for either eliminating or reducing “over 20 categorical programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other programs, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds. ” Among those programs mentioned are: Striving Readers, Teacher Quality Partnership, Impact Aid Support Payments for Federal Property, and International Education programs. The plan also eliminates $3. 6 billion in support for programs for instruction support, before and   and summer programs  —   all of which the blueprint observes, “lack evidence” of meeting the goals of improving student achievement. Overall, Trump’s budget for next year offers $59 billion in discretionary funding for the federal Department of Education, an amount the plan says represents “a $9 billion or 13 percent reduction below the 2017 annualized CR level. ” More than $1. 2B on vouchers  backdoor vouchers, while $1. 2B cut to   programs. This hurts working families #SkinnyBudget,  —   Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 16, 2017,  “The cuts to community schools mean that we are not going to take poverty on head on, we’re not going to meet children’s   needs,” Weingarten said. “The cuts in terms of lower class size mean that we are not going to be able to meet the needs of individual children, and cuts to professional development mean the things that teachers need to learn on an ongoing basis  —   there’s going to be fewer people for them to learn that. ” Breitbart News asked Weingarten if she had any comment about the fact that Trump’s budget blueprint maintains the current funding levels of $13 billion for students with disabilities under the IDEA program, and $492 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and   Institutions. “The funding for IDEA and the funding for Title I are not discretionary funding,” Weingarten responded. “It is required funding, and that is very important to have. ” “The HBCUs have asked for more funding,” she added. “They needed more funding, not less funding. And you can’t just have a   with HBCUs and not create more funding for them. These schools have been under austerity for years, and if they’re going to compete with others, they definitely need more funding. ”",0
11590,Purchasing Loyalty with Foreign Aid," Purchasing Loyalty with Foreign Aid By Jacob G. Hornberger
 FFF "" - A dispute that is taking place between Saudi Arabia and Egypt indirectly demonstrates the nature of U.S. foreign aid. After dumping a walloping $25 billion in foreign aid to help the Egyptian military dictatorships economic woes, the Saudis are hopping mad.
Why?
Because last month in the United Nations, contrary to Saudi Arabias wishes, Egypt voted in favor of a Russian resolution on Syria.
In the world of foreign aid, thats a super no-no. When a regime has received $25 billion from another regime, it is expected to vote the way its benefactor wants it to vote.
In a remarkable admission regarding foreign aid, at least in this particular case, the New York Times , in an article on the matter, wrote, The Saudis may have thought they were buying loyalty . The Times article pointed out that to punish the Egyptians for their independence, The state-owned Saudi oil company, Aramco, postponed a promised shipment of 700,000 tons of discounted oil in October, and the spokesman for Egypts oil ministry said the fate of Novembers shipment remains unknown.
Although the New York Times would probably be reluctant to describe U.S. foreign aid in the same way, thats precisely what it is  a way to purchase loyalty from foreign regimes, including dictatorships. The U.S. government loves to put foreign regimes on the federal dole because once that happens, U.S. officials know that they have bought them, lock, stock, and barrel. Once a regime is on the dole, it inevitably becomes dependent on it.
The racket works like this: The IRS collects money from hard-pressed U.S. taxpayers, which U.S. officials use to send millions of dollars in foreign aid to foreign regimes.
The foreign regimes then use the money to buy weaponry to fortify their hold on power or to just to line the pockets of government officials.
It doesnt matter to U.S. officials what the tyrants do to people within their country. They can abuse them, incarcerate them, torture them, or kill them. None of that matters to U.S. officials.
What matters to U.S. officials is the international arena. Like votes in the UN. Or public support for U.S. invasions, coups, interventions, assassinations, kidnappings, and the like. Or joining coalitions of the willing. Thats when U.S. officials expect loyalty, in the form of blind support, which was what Saudi Arabia was expecting from the Egyptian tyrants.
And heaven help any nation that takes the wrong position. The U.S. will respond in the same way the Saudis have responded to the Egyptians. It will threaten to do very bad things to the nation that opposes a U.S invasion, coup, or resolution within the UN. When a nation is on the U.S. dole, U.S. officials expect loyalty.
Americans cant do anything about foreign aid by the Saudi government. But they can do something about U.S. foreign aid. What they should do is demand that it be ended, immediately.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — President Obama threw the power of the White House behind Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. He faulted how the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, handled new emails related to the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s private server, and then shouted out to college students here in a pivotal battleground state that it was crucial that they vote because the “fate of the world is teetering.” 
Mr. Obama’s comments about Mr. Comey, broadcast early in the day as recent polls showed a tightening race, were striking for a president who has insisted he does not comment on F.B.I. investigations. But Mr. Obama appeared to be doing exactly that in implicitly criticizing Mr. Comey’s decision to send a vague letter last week to Congress — and by extension, the public — informing lawmakers about a discovery of new emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server as secretary of state. 
“We don’t operate on incomplete information,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with NowThis News. “We don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.”",0

[Brock, who founded the   watchdog Media Matters for America as well as Super PACs such as Correct the Record and American Bridge sees himself as a key figure in rebuilding the Democratic Party following Donald Trump’s ascent to the presidency.  Recently, Brock has pleaded for funding to help him build an   war room, which seeks to hold the the current administration accountable on a daily basis and, in his own words, “kick Trump’s ass. ” He aspires to make his Shareblue website “the Breitbart of the Left. ” However, according to multiple sources at The Daily Beast, many Democrats believe he damages the party and just wish he would go away. Talking to The Daily Beast, Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, described Brock’s ability to improve the party’s electability as “nonexistent,” adding that “he does not have the kind of understanding of what kind of coalition you have to bring together to win national races. ” “I don’t think David Brock has been helpful to the party to date, and I don’t think he will be a big part of its future,”a former Clinton campaign official also told the news site, while another said that they “did not want to deal with Brock’s bullshit,” describing his   campaign efforts as “useless,” adding that “you might as well have thrown those [tens of] millions of dollars down a well, and then set the well on fire. ” A source close to The Daily Beast also said that while Brock had reached out to various Clinton campaign staff to join his “war room” effort, they all declined because “no one wants anything to do with him. ” Other former employees of Brock also said that he tends to “overstate his level of impact and importance,” adding that “that he cares less about progressive policies and moving the ball forward, and is actually more focused on stroking his ego. ” Brock’s main project, the   watchdog Media Matters for America group, was in 2012 exposed as attempting the wholesale destruction of conservative media. A leaked internal document showed that Brock’s organization hoped to “bring litigation against Fox News and its feeders. ” However, the organization now reportedly pivots its focus towards Breitbart, instead of FOX News. Another one of Brock’s organizations, Correct the Record, spent $1 million to hire online trolls to “correct” supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) across social media. Defending his record, Brock told The Daily Beast that “people are free to question my motives, but it should be pretty clear by now that the groups that I’ve created are committed to a more progressive America.“ “I’m interested in building   organizational capacity to resist and oppose Donald Trump,” he continued. “I think that should be everybody’s goal on the left, to destroy Donald Trump, not to destroy each other. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
11594,The Fully Self-Driving Car Is Still Years Away - The New York Times,"Even as automakers and technology companies have been promoting a euphoric vision of the future in which cars will drive themselves and serious crashes will be rare, their engineers have been engaged in a sobering debate. Just how autonomous can and should cars become? the engineers are asking. Is there an inherent danger in technology that invites human drivers to sit back and relax  —   but still requires them to be ready to hit the brakes or grab the wheel at the first sign of trouble? Those questions have taken on a new urgency after the revelation this week that the driver of a Tesla Model S died in a crash in Florida while the electric car was operating in its Autopilot mode. The man, Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was driving on a divided highway, when a   truck made a left turn and crossed in front of Mr. Brown’s lane of traffic. Tesla said neither Mr. Brown nor the car’s   system noticed the white truck against a bright sky, and the brakes were never applied. For now, other automakers are giving no sign of slowing down their efforts to push forward with cars that can drive themselves. But mainly they say the technology isn’t ready yet  —   which for many is an implicit rebuke of Tesla’s willingness to tempt   drivers to turn tomorrow’s vision into today’s road reality. On Friday, even as the world was absorbing news of Mr. Brown’s death as the first known fatality of the autonomous driving revolution, the German automaker BMW said it intended to offer a “  car”  —   but not until 2021. And it will have much different technology than is now available on the Tesla Model S. “Today we are standing at the brink of a new revolution,” Harald Krüger, BMW chief executive, said at a news conference in Munich. Mr. Krüger added that the Tesla crash was “really very sad” and said BMW would need “the next few years” to perfect its autonomous driving system. “Today the technologies are not ready for serious production,” he said. The world’s largest carmaker, Toyota, is a notable holdout in the rush toward completely autonomous cars. Last year, the company said that it would invest $1 billion in a Silicon   research effort to focus on cars that will function as “guardian angels,” saving human drivers from errors, rather than replacing them. Tesla, which started its Autopilot feature last fall, has emphasized in discussing Mr. Brown’s death that the system isn’t intended to take over complete control of the car and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert and engaged. The point highlights the difference in approach that separates companies working on   technology. Ford Motor, Google, Volvo and others are aiming at offering fully autonomous cars that can operate safely without human intervention at all  —   an approach engineers call Level 4 automated driving. Those companies are wary of semiautonomous, or Level 3, technology that can drive the car for stretches of road under certain circumstances, but requires drivers to be ready to take over. Tesla’s Autopilot is not even a fully fledged Level 3 technology, and some experts say it is a risky approach. “There’s a huge inherent danger and it’s well proven  —   the computer making a mistake and the driver not taking over quickly enough,” said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. The trouble is that while semiautonomous systems like Tesla’s are guiding a car, human drivers can be lulled into feeling they are able to turn their attention away from the road. Mr. Brown, like some other Model S owners, posted videos showing the driver with no hands on the steering wheel. In one video, a driver climbs into the back seat. Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending machine company from Connellsville, Pa. owns a 2013 Model S that does not have Autopilot. But he drove a loaner with the feature earlier this year while his was being repaired. He loves his car and has deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when that car is available, yet he is “on the fence” about getting Autopilot. While the technology “was the greatest thing” on closed highways like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, it could become confused in more complicated environments like construction zones, Mr. Cordaro said. “My experience is it’s really not completely safe except in   highways,” he said. “It gives you a false sense of security. You get comfortable and think you can take your hands off the wheel but you really can’t. It should be called   instead of Autopilot, because that’s all it is. ” Even Amnon Shashua, an executive whose technology is part of Tesla’s   feature, said on Friday that he did not think  ’s time had yet come. Mr. Shashua is   and chairman of Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes camera and sensing technology. According to the Tesla website, Tesla uses Mobileye components but developed the   system in the Model S itself. Mobileye, along with the chip maker Intel, is at work in a partnership with BMW on the   car that the German automaker described in Munich on Friday that is supposed to be available in 2021. Mr. Shashua suggested that   technology was close, but still not quite ready for actual use without human drivers remaining engaged. “Five years is a very short time,” Mr. Shashua said. “On the other hand, it is a sufficient time to do the types of validations that are needed. ” The BMW car Mobileye is collaborating on will be capable of piloting itself on highways, but not necessarily in complex urban settings. Automakers and technology companies still need to do “hundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers of validation and simulations” in closed testing environments to be certain the technology is safe, Mr. Shashua said. “I think it is very important, especially given this accident and what we hear in the news, that companies are very transparent about the limitations of the system,” he said. Although Tesla has publicly said that it has enhanced the Mobileye technology, the company has not commented on whether it has enhanced the system to protect against what the industry describes as “lateral turn across path” —   the type of situation in the Florida accident. Others in the automotive industry are working on sensor technologies meant to detect vehicles from all angles. One approach is lidar  —   a system that uses rotating laser beams. Lidar is being used in the experimental autonomous vehicle being developed by BMW, as well as those by Google, Nissan and Apple. But it remains unclear whether the laser system will come down enough in price to use in   cars.",0
11595,7 Ways To Relieve Post-Election Stress Disorder,"7 Ways To Relieve Post-Election Stress Disorder Nov 9, 2016 0 0 
With the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election now at an end and with emotions running rampant throughout social media and throughout the world, post-election stress disorder is becoming a serious issue that many will need to address in the coming days and weeks. 
To begin, post-election stress disorder is an actual medically-established disorder, which Dr. Asim Shah is not well known, but is a serious issue. Dr. Shah is the vice chair for community psychiatry at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas and says that symptoms of the disorder include sweaty palms, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, loss of appetite and trouble sleeping. Post-election stress disorder can cause a great deal of stress. 
How We Can Deal With The Stress 
Whether you feel you actually suffer from post-election stress disorder or are just in general stressed out over the election period, there are some simple ways to deal with the stress in a healthy way. Go for a walk : Spiritual teacher Thich Nhat Hanh says that the best way to deal with strong emotions is to go for a walk and to walk until you are physically tired and you are emotionally calm again. Getting fresh air, sunlight and oxygen flowing through your veins and into your brain is an excellent way to help you regain control over your emotions and to relieve pent up stress. Use essential oils: When we smell essential oils, the molecules of the oil travel to the limbic system of our brain through the olfactory senses. The limbic system is the part of the brain that controls emotions, memory, blood pressure and stress hormone release. If you are stressed, cope with your stress in this healthy way by smelling and or applying essential oils. Good oils for relaxing are lavender, rose and geranium. Take Media Breaks: Take some time away from all forms of media, including social media. Reflect on the things that are important to you and refocus your energy on your dreams and wishes for you life. Essential oils can dramatically help improve emotional states of mind. Keep things in perspective: We live on a tiny blue planet traveling throughout the universe at incredible speeds with a neighboring star (the Sun) who gives us the opportunity for life each and every day. For the most part, things are okay. Reclaim personal sovereignty: We each have the choice as to how we react to situations in our life. One situation that might be viewed as troubling for one person can be viewed as peace for another. How can you shift your thoughts around situations to see the positive in it? Will this election not motivate even more people to be better people? Will it not catalyze more action from people around the world to create changes they wish to see? Deep breathing: Though it is simple, it is profound in helping to release emotions and deal with stress in a healthy and effective way. Breath slowly in for a couple seconds and breath out for a couple seconds. Oxygenating the brain helps to shift our emotions in a positive direction. Herbs: Instead of using alcohol or mind-numbing pharmaceuticals, look into the benefits of herbs like Passionflower, California Poppy, Lemon Balm, Rhodiola, Kava Kava and Chamomile. 
We are all learning and processing a lot of information right now as the election period has come to an end. Take care of yourself and deal with any stress in healthy ways. What are other healthy ways you are dealing with election stress or stress in general?

11596,BUSTED! Craigslist Ad Exposes Paid Anti-Trump Protesters Being Recruited for STAGED Event,"Go to Article 
This has to be one of the stupidest things we’ve ever seen. It’s probably connected to George Soros since he is the sugar daddy to almost all of the paid anti-Trump protests. 
Here’s an example of a Soros employee literally “posing” as a protester. Not all that “grass roots.” 
In this case, a Craigslist ad in Los Angeles shows that activists are wanted to block traffic in the heavy traffic intersection of Highlands and Hollywood. 
This an idiotic move for multiple reasons. First of all, California did go for Hillary and Hollywood in particular is a very liberal city. So what on earth do you gain protesting Trump by pissing off your own liberals by blocking traffic? They will probably inspire some pissed of Angelenos to join the Trump Train while they are annoyed the road is blocked. 
Here is a screen shot of the ad.

11598,Trump Said the Unemployment Rate Wasn’t Real. Here Are Some Other Options. - The New York Times,"With the January jobs report released Friday by the Labor Department, we know that President Trump took office amid a relatively low unemployment rate (it ticked up to 4. 8 percent in January) strong job growth (227, 000 positions added that month) and weak wage growth (average hourly earnings up 0. 1 percent in January and 2. 5 percent over the past year). There was even some welcome progress in the number of people who count themselves as part of the labor force. But Mr. Trump made amply clear in his campaign that he doesn’t care for the way that government agencies and mainstream economists summarize the state of the job market. The unemployment rate, he said in December, is “totally fiction. ” He claimed at one point during the campaign that the real jobless rate was not the number below 5 percent widely cited by economists, but something like 42 percent. There is certainly a filament of truth in that. The unemployment rate counts only people who say they want a job and have looked for one in the last month  —   meaning that millions of Americans who dropped out of the labor force during the aftermath of the 2008 recession do not count as unemployed by the standard definition. But we have some exciting news for the president. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t just issue the widely cited headline unemployment rate (again, 4. 8 percent in January). This month’s jobs report, for example, offers 42 pages’ worth of figures that allow anyone who knows how to read them an infinite variety of ways to examine the labor market. No one forces you to treat the standard unemployment rate as gospel it’s just a convention, and any economic analysts worthy of their spreadsheets use a wide range of data to assess how things are going. So if the White House wants to choose a different measure of job market health to emphasize on the first Friday of every month, we’re all ears. The nice thing about a convention is you can change it. Here, in fact, is a menu of labor market measures that might be plausible alternatives to the main number  —   and why the Trump administration may, or may not, want the world to watch it. Underemployment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes six different unemployment rates, from a relatively narrow definition to relatively broad. The jobless rate most often cited is the third of the six, known in bureaucratese as   and includes only people who say they want a job and have actively looked for one in the last month. The broadest of these unemployment rates,   also includes people who want a job but haven’t looked in the last month and people who have a   job but want   work. That rate: 9. 4 percent. Share of population not employed. If Mr. Trump really believes the 42 percent unemployment rate he floated last year is a useful measure of joblessness, here’s the math that almost gets him there. The proportion of the adult population that is working is 59. 9 percent, so the remainder of that  —   the share of American adults not working  —   was 40. 1 percent in January. Think of it as a measure of   not the more precisely defined unemployment. There are some problems with that measure. It includes people who are not working and who have no desire whatsoever to do so. It includes 17   high school students,    retirees, disabled adults and parents who voluntarily stay home with their children. Moreover, if Mr. Trump wants to focus on this measure, he may not be pleased with the results. Because the baby boom generation is hitting retirement age and voluntarily stepping out of the labor force, this measure of   is likely to rise in the years ahead. Share of   population not employed. One way to avoid the most obvious problems with that measure is simply to limit the age bracket you look at. Jordan Weissmann at Slate argues that a better   measure of the health of the job market is the share of the population between ages 25 to 54 who are working. That number was 78. 2 percent in January, so its remainder implies a 21. 8 percent jobless rate. This still isn’t perfect  —   it includes people who fall in that age bracket who have no desire to work, and also fails to include people under 25 or over 54 who really do want a job but can’t find one. But as a    measure of the health of the labor market, Mr. Weissmann is right that you could do a lot worse. Average hourly earnings. A common complaint about media focus on how many jobs are being created is that it doesn’t account for whether they are good jobs. But this is a tricky concept to measure everyone can agree that a     position is not as ideal as a highly paid computer programming gig, but it’s hard to get at more subtle differences. Is a job as a truck driver better or worse than one as a hotel assistant manager? It’s pretty subjective. What isn’t subjective is compensation. And data on average hourly earnings helps convey not just whether people are getting raises for existing jobs, but also whether the composition of jobs in the economy is shifting toward higher pay. Average hourly earnings for all private sector employees was $26 in January, and for nonmanagerial private sector employees it was $21. 84. An economy in which those numbers rise significantly faster than inflation is an economy in which   people are feeling better about the world and are seeing greater rewards for their labor. There are plenty more options for the Trump administration to consider as job market measures to emphasize. Unemployment in the construction sector (currently 9. 4 percent)? The jobless rate among people who didn’t go to college (currently 5. 8 percent)? The options are nearly endless. But  —   and this is important  —   if the president wants to set a different measure of the job market for his administration to focus on and improve, it would be best if he could let us know what it is now, so that we can really assess whether things are getting better or worse during his presidency.",0
11599,"Genetic Heart Disease Risk Eased by Healthy Habits, Study Finds - The New York Times","Is genetics destiny when it comes to heart disease? A new analysis of data from more than 55, 000 people provides an answer. It finds that by living right  —   by not smoking, by exercising moderately and by eating a healthy diet heavy in fruits, vegetables and grains  —   people can tamp down even the worst genetic risk. “DNA is not destiny it is not deterministic for this disease,” said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, the director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital. “You do have control over the problem, even if you have been dealt a bad genetic hand. ” The research, by Dr. Kathiresan and his colleagues, is the first attempt to use large data sets to tease apart the effects of genes and lifestyle in heart disease, researchers said. It was published on Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with the presentation of the results at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association. About 365, 000 people die of coronary heart disease  —   the most common type  —   annually in the United States, and 17. 3 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest killers. The investigators found that genes can double the risk of heart disease, but a good lifestyle cuts it in half. Just as important, they found, a terrible lifestyle erases about half of the benefits of good genetics. Dr. Michael Lauer, a cardiologist who is the deputy director for extramural research at the National Institutes of Health and was not involved in the analysis, called the study impressive. Its subjects were from four large studies, yet the results were consistent and convincing, even though the populations were quite varied. That sort of research, he said, “is not something we see very often, and certainly not with this degree of rigor. ” One study the group analyzed involved black and white Americans aged 45 to 64. A good lifestyle in those with the highest genetic risk cut the   likelihood of heart disease to 5. 1 percent from 10. 7 percent. Another study involved 21, 222 American women aged 45 and older who were health professionals their   risk fell to 2 percent from 4. 6 percent in the   group if they also had a healthy lifestyle. In a third study, Swedish participants aged 44 to 73 had a   risk reduction to 5. 3 percent from 8. 2 percent. And finally, in a study of Americans aged 55 to 80, those with genetic risk but a healthy lifestyle had significantly less calcium, a sign of heart disease, in their coronary arteries. Dr. Lauer also was encouraged by the finding that the fourth study, which used imaging, showed the same pattern as the others that used heart attacks and other signs of heart disease as endpoints. “That gives us more confidence that the findings are real,” he said. The results, he said, should quell the cries of both those who emphasize genes above all and those who emphasize elements of lifestyle above all. “It’s not nature or nurture, it’s both,” he said. The study got its start after Dr. Amit V. Khera, one of Dr. Kathiresan’s postdoctoral fellows, noticed that researchers had looked at genetic risks of heart disease  and had, in different studies, looked at the effect of environment and lifestyle risks. So, he wondered, why not look at lifestyles and genetics in the same populations and see how much each contributes? The researchers began about a year and a half ago, analyzing data from four large studies that not only had genetic data on participants but also had information on lifestyles and on which participants developed heart disease. The investigators developed a genetic score based on 50 genes associated with heart disease. They developed a lifestyle score based on whether people smoked, whether they exercised at least once a week, whether they followed a healthy diet  —   one with fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains and nuts  —   and whether they were obese. An optimum lifestyle score was defined as having three or all four of these elements, which is important, Dr. Kathiresan said, because many people who are obese have enormous difficulty losing weight and maintaining their weight loss. “You can get into this group even if you are obese by not smoking, exercising and eating a healthy diet, “ he said. Even better, said Dr. Lawrence J. Appel, the director of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at Johns Hopkins Medicine, you do not have to have an exemplary lifestyle to reap a big benefit. It looks as if the biggest protective effect by far came from going from a terrible lifestyle to one that was at least moderately good. Dr. John Michael Gaziano, a preventive cardiologist at the VA Boston Healthcare System and at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said the work showed the power of large data sets. Until recently, researchers mostly used much smaller data sets, which tend to have a lot of random variation, making results hard to interpret. The Million Veteran Program, a study that he is leading, and the National Institutes of Health’s precision medicine initiative that is recruiting a million participants should provide the sort of data that can make results like Dr. Kathiresan’s more feasible and more powerful. For Dr. Gaziano, the biggest surprise was that a test based on combining 50 genes, each of which had a tiny role in heart disease, was such a powerful predictor of risk. The larger studies underway now should allow researchers to understand more about how much each of those genes contributes, he added. Meanwhile, the new study shows a new way to think about genes and lifestyle, researchers say. “It’s very important,” said Dr. David Maron, the director of preventive cardiology at Stanford, who was not involved in the new study. “If you are dealt a bad hand, there are things you can do to attenuate the risk. ” Dr. Kathiresan is already using the study’s results when he sees patients, he said. The genetic test is not available outside of research studies, he said, but he often gets an idea of who has a worrisome genetic risk when he talks to patients. “A poor man’s substitute,” he said, “is: ‘My dad died at 45 of a heart attack. I have a strong family history. ’” He now replies, “You have it in your power to change that risk. ”",0
11600,Evil Mum Kept Young Son In Closets For 3 Years Before He Died,"A brave mother fought off a mountain lion that attacked her 5-year-old son outside their home in northwest Aspen, Colorado. (4 hours ago) 
When people asked Veronica Aguilar where her son was, she told them he had been placed in an institution in Mexico, according to court records. Only her three other children — two of whom slept on a bed just outside the closet door — knew the truth, and they said they were forbidden by their mother from saying anything, authorities say. 
Yonatan Daniel Aguilar’s tortured life came to an end in August. Police later found the 11-year-old’s battered, malnourished 34-pound body in the bedroom closet of the family’s tiny Echo Park home. 
The grim details are laid out in records The Times obtained from Los Angeles County Juvenile Court this week. The records help explain how the people charged with his well-being — school officials, police, social workers and therapists — lost track of him despite earlier allegations of abuse. But they also raise new questions about whether more could have been done to save the boy who, court records suggest, might have been autistic and thus was treated differently. 
Los Angeles police detectives investigating the case believed Aguilar’s efforts to hide the boy were so effective that even the boy’s stepfather, Jose Pinzon, didn’t know Yonatan lived with them all along. 
The day of Yonatan’s death, Moses Castillo, the supervising LAPD detective on the case, placed Pinzon and Yonatan’s siblings together in a room “to see the reaction,” Department of Children and Family Services records state. As detectives and a county social worker stood by, Pinzon “immediately confronts the children that he had no idea that minor [Yonatan] was living in the house the whole time they were there,” records state.

“How can you do this to me?” he asked.

Pinzon then started crying. 
“I carry a photo of him in my wallet,” he said, according to the records. “I’m the only one that cared for him.” 
On Aug. 22, Aguilar told Pinzon that Yonatan had died and asked him to care for her other children. He assumed she would be going to Mexico to bury the boy. Recommended VIDEO: The Woman Who Has Lived Off The Grid For 30 Years In A $3000 House

Instead, she led him to the bedroom closet. According to authorities, Yonatan’s body was wrapped in a blanket and covered in pressure sores from lying on the tile floor. There was foam in his nose and medicinal cups of pink and red liquid near his body. He was going bald. 
“I took care of the problem by ruining my life,” Aguilar told Pinzon, according to the court records. Police say Pinzon then ran out of the house to a nearby 7-Eleven, where he called authorities. 
Aguilar, 39, is facing murder charges and has pleaded not guilty. 
R. Lawrence Tripp, Aguilar’s public defender, said Thursday that he had not yet seen a completed coroner’s report and was awaiting more information about Yonatan’s death.

The Times petitioned the court to release DCFS case records, as well as police and coroner’s reports regarding Yonatan. Michael Levanas, the presiding judge of L.A. County’s Juvenile Court, ordered the release of more than 160 pages of partially redacted records, saying they “shed light on what was going on in the family’s home” and why the boy was left in his mother’s care. 
Yonatan’s family had been the subject of six reports to DCFS alleging possible abuse or neglect, records show. Yonatan’s risk of abuse at home had been marked as “high” four times from 2009 to 2012 by a computerized program intended to gauge social workers’ level of intervention. Social workers, records show, declined to open a case, saying the allegations of physical abuse were inconclusive or unfounded. 
DCFS Director Philip Browning said that the department had investigated several reports of abuse and neglect and that everyone interacting with the child and his family, including medical workers, teachers and police, thought “the child was in a safe environment.” 
“We talked to the school nurse, the school doctors, school counselors, the teachers, everyone, including the LAPD investigators, who all said everything was OK,” Browning said, “We were very surprised what occurred here. Our social workers were very distraught. … There is no way to predict this occurring.” 
Under the law, he said, the department has the authority to investigate abuse and neglect, but the oversight comes to an end once a determination is made that there is no ongoing issue. Recommended Father & Son Spend 41 Years Hiding In Vietnam Jungle Fearing US Airstrikes

“We don’t have the legal authority to follow up,” Browning said. 
Officials with the LAPD’s Juvenile Division said that although allegations of physical abuse regarding Yonatan also were reported to police, no police investigation was launched. 
The final contact DCFS had with Yonatan came in spring 2012, when teachers made two separate reports about him, saying that he had come to school with a black eye and that he was hungry and hoarding food. 
After that, the boy disappeared. He was pulled out of school and kept hidden as the family moved from home to home, documents show. DCFS officials said they received no further reports about the boy and had no legal right to inquire about him without a report. 
The department’s contact with the family began in 2002, before Yonatan’s birth. Aguilar had locked herself in a bathroom and cut her wrist because she was upset with her children’s biological father over his drinking, DCFS records state. Recommended 9/11 WTC Tower Had Power Turned Off For 36 Hours Weekend Before Attack 
A former data center worker who worked at one of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings before the 9/11 attacks has come forward with bombshell information that suggests explosives were planted in the buildings in the weeks prior to the attacks on September 11, 2001. (4 hours ago) 
In recent months, the four children lived with their mother and stepfather in the cramped one-bedroom house on Santa Ynez Street. Aguilar and Pinzon slept in the living room, and one child slept in a shed in the backyard. Two children shared a bed in the bedroom, while Yonatan — who was reportedly autistic — stayed in the bedroom closet, records state. 
Pinzon told detectives that he had not seen the boy in several years and that Aguilar had told him she sent him to Mexico, according to a coroner’s investigator’s report. The day before Yonatan’s death, Pinzon went to a dollar store to buy school supplies for the children, DCFS records state. Aguilar asked him to buy purple-colored jarabe, Spanish for syrup. 
“He said that any time he would go to the store, the mother would ask him to bring the syrup,” DCFS records state. “He would ask her why she was buying syrup, if they did not have money.” 
Yonatan’s oldest brother, who is 18, told authorities that the family recently moved to the Echo Park home but that they were able to hide Yonatan in the closet at a previous home as well. 
In an interview with police the day after Yonatan’s death, the brother initially lied about knowing Yonatan’s whereabouts, saying he worked a lot and wasn’t home much, the records show. Recommended Three Mile Island Nuclear Meltdown Happened 37 Years Ago 
Monday marked the 37th anniversary of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the first major nuclear power plant emergency to rattle the U.S. and the world. On March 28, 1979, a minor incident at a nuclear power plant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania quickly turned into a major nuclear accident with the world holding its breath as the reactor core went into meltdown.

“My mom does not talk about him because he is a troublemaker,” the brother told police. He accused Yonatan of acting out at school and pointed to a social worker observing the interview, saying: “You guys know about it. He has done so many crazy things.” 
The older sibling, whose name is redacted in the records, told police Yonatan “was very smart” and “knew what he was doing.” When he was younger, a therapist came to the home almost daily to provide services to Yonatan, the brother said. Yonatan Daniel Aguilar",0
11601,California May Allow Communists to Work Openly in State Government - Breitbart,"The California State Assembly passed a bill Monday to allow state employees to be communists  —   a surprise to observers who may have presumed many state employees were already communists. [The bill, AB 22, would amend existing laws  —   passed, the Sacramento Bee says, “during the ‘Red Scare’ of the 1940s and ’50s”  —   that allowed state employees to be fired if they were found to be members of the Communist Party.  Moreover, the bill would delete existing section of the state code declaring California’s official opposition to communism. The section of the state code proposed to be deleted states: The Legislature of the State of California finds that: (a) There exists a   revolutionary movement to establish a totalitarian dictatorship based upon force and violence rather than upon law. (b) This   revolutionary movement is predicated upon and it is designed and intended to carry into execution the basic precepts of communism as expounded by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. (c) Pursuant to the objectives of the world communism movement, in numerous foreign countries the legally constituted governments have been overthrown and totalitarian dictatorships established therein against the will of the people, and the establishment of similar dictatorships in other countries is imminently threatening. The successful establishment of totalitarian dictatorships has consistently been aided, accompanied, or accomplished by repeated acts of treachery, deceit, teaching of false doctrines, teaching untruth, together with organized confusion, insubordination, and disloyalty, fostered, directed, instigated, or employed by communist organizations and their members in such countries. (d) Within the boundaries of the State of California there are active disciplined communist organizations presently functioning for the primary purpose of advancing the objectives of the world communism movement, which organizations promulgate, advocate, and adhere to the precepts and the principles and doctrines of the world communism movement. These communist organizations are characterized by identification of their programs, policies, and objectives with those of the world communism movement, and they regularly and consistently cooperate with and endeavor to carry into execution programs, policies and objectives substantially identical to programs, policies, and objectives of such world communism movement. (e) One of the objectives of the world communism movement is to place its members in state and local government positions and in state supported educational institutions. If this objective is successful, propaganda can be disseminated by the members of these organizations among pupils and students by those members who would have the opportunity to teach them and to whom, as teachers, they would look for guidance, authority, and leadership. The members of such groups would use their positions to advocate and teach their doctrines and teach the prescribed Communist Party line group dogma or doctrine without regard to truth or free inquiry. This type of propaganda is sufficiently subtle to escape detection. There is a clear and present danger, which the Legislature of the State of California finds is great and imminent, that in order to advance the program, policies and objectives of the world communism movement, communist organizations in the State of California and their members will engage in concerted effort to hamper, restrict, interfere with, impede, or nullify the efforts of the State and the public agencies of the State to comply with and enforce the laws of the State of California and their members will infiltrate and seek employment by the State and its public agencies. The new bill, proposed by Assemblymember Rob Bonta ( ) would leave intact the provisions of the state code that bar state employees who belong to organizations that “advocated the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of any state by force or violence. ” Several Republicans, including Assemblymembers Randy Vopel ( ) and Travis Allen (  Beach) spoke out against the bill.

[11/3/16] Now that her coronation appears to be escaping her grasp, Democrat Party presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is showing another side of her personality . On Tuesday night a heckler interrupted her speech, waving a sign that read “Bill Clinton is a rapist.” Her response, instead of showing her usual controlled aplomb and restraint, surprised the crowd at its intensity and ferocity. Pointing at the offender and shouting at the top of her voice, Clinton exploded: 
I’m sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump! 
The protestor was immediately led away and his sign was torn apart. It turned out that the protestor was vying for a cash prize being offered by Alex Jones of InfoWars.com to anyone appearing either on television or at a Clinton rally chanting “Bill Clinton is a rapist” and wearing a t-shirt bearing the same slogan. 
NBC News tried to downplay the interruption, noting that while other protestors have shown up at rallies featuring President Obama and Bill Clinton himself, they are bringing attention to “decades-old allegations from three women who accuse Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.

11606,Bitcoin Plunges After Hacking of Exchange in Hong Kong - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   The digital currency Bitcoin plunged on Wednesday after Bitfinex, an exchange based in Hong Kong, said it had been hacked and funds stolen. The exchange said it had halted trading, deposits and withdrawals while it investigated which users had been affected. Bitcoin’s trading value fell about 20 percent early on Wednesday, local time in Hong Kong, but had recovered about half the loss by early afternoon. Zane Tackett, Bitfinex’s director of community and product development, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But he said in a posting on Reddit that 119, 756 Bitcoins had been  stolen. Before the hacking was made public, that number of Bitcoins would have been worth about $72 million. Now that the currency has slumped, the figure is closer to $65 million. The exchange, one of the world’s largest, said in a blog post that any outstanding settlements would be made at the price before the hacking. “As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing,   collateral affected by the breach,” Bitfinex said in the post. It added that customers’ losses would be addressed later. Security breaches of this type have raised questions about the viability of Bitcoin. The most notable episode was the collapse in 2014 of Mt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, in which hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins were stolen in a heist that experts and law enforcement officials are still trying to unravel. This past June, a hacker stole more than $50 million worth of Ether, another digital currency, from an experimental virtual currency project called the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Jack Liu, chief strategy officer at OKCoin, a large digital currency exchange, said he was not concerned about the security of his company because it uses a different system. But he noted that there should be more discussion between exchanges over best practices. “We care about the health of the ecosystem,” he said, although he emphasized that nobody should be dictating how Bitcoins are secured. “Hackers are only getting better and so adoption of the same solution may not be the safest for the industry. ” Although some view Bitcoin as the future of finance, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions, the Bitcoin community has been rived with infighting over the development of the technology. The blockchain ledger, part of the coding that underlies the currency, has also gained more mainstream traction, as banks see an opportunity to use the technology to speed up trades. Bitfinex said the theft had been reported to law enforcement.",0
11607,$25 Million in Breakthrough Prizes Given in Science and Math - The New York Times,"The biggest prize payday in science came around again Sunday evening when the Breakthrough Foundation  handed out more than $25 million in its annual prizes to more than a thousand physicists, life scientists and mathematicians. This year’s winners include five molecular biologists who won $3 million each for work in genetics and cell biology, one mathematician, a trio of string theorists who split one $3 million physics prize, and another 1, 015 physicists working on the LIGO gravitational wave detector split a special $3 million physics prize. In addition, there were six smaller “New Horizons” prizes totaling $600, 000 for 10 “early career” researchers, and a pair of high school students won $400, 000 apiece for making science videos. The Breakthrough Foundation was founded by Sergey Brin of Google Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe Jack Ma of Alibaba and his wife, Cathy Zhang Yuri Milner, an internet entrepreneur, and his wife, Julia Milner and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife, Priscilla Chan. It sprang from Mr. Milner’s decision in 2012 to hand out $3 million apiece to nine theoretical physicists, in the belief that physicists are equal to rock stars and deserve to be paid and celebrated like them. Over the years, as more sponsors have joined, the prizes have spread to life sciences and mathematics. The winners each year are chosen by a committee of previous winners. For the last few years, the awards have been given out in an   ceremony held at NASA’s Ames Research Center, with a variety of Hollywood celebrities, who this year include Morgan Freeman, Alicia Keys and Jeremy Irons. There were two physics prizes awarded this year. In May, Mr. Milner, the founder of the Breakthrough initiative, announced a special $3 million prize to the LIGO (for Laser Interferometer   Observatory) experiment, which detected gravitational waves from colliding black holes last year. A third of the money will be split among the three leaders of the experiment, Ronald W. P. Drever, Kip S. Thorne and Rainer Weiss. The remainder of the award money will be split among the other 1, 012 scientists on the team. In a return to the way it originally was, the regular Breakthrough prize this year is going to a trio of theorists who have made serious advances in string theory, the alleged but still unproven theory of everything, and what it might mean for black holes and the universe. They are Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa from Harvard, and Joseph Polchinski of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. According to string theory, all the forces and particles of nature are composed of tiny little wriggling strings. In 1995, Dr. Polchinski showed that the theory also contains objects of two dimensions or more, called “branes,” short for membranes. This led to a whole new branch of cosmology, in which branes could be island universes floating in an   space like leaves in a fish tank, colliding and otherwise interacting with each other through a higher dimension. In a celebrated calculation in 1996, Dr. Strominger and Dr. Vafa used string theory to compute the information content, or entropy, of a black hole. Their result verified a prediction made by Stephen Hawking using more approximate methods that black holes would leak radiation and eventually explode. In a career spanning four decades, Jean Bourgain, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N. J. has published, on average, 10 papers a year, tackling some of the hardest problems in a range of mathematical fields. Some recent work includes a “decoupling theorem”  —   a sort of very abstract generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applied to oscillating waves like light or radio waves. While Pythagoras merely showed how the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle are related to the longer hypotenuse, the decoupling theorem proven by Dr. Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter of Indiana University shows similar relationships in the superposition of waves. Stephen J. Elledge, 60, is a professor of genetics and medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher. He received the breakthrough prize for research explaining how “cells sense and respond to damage in their DNA and providing insights into the development and treatment of cancer. ” Dr. Elledge has described DNA as being constantly under attack but having the ability  —   he calls it a sort of chemical intelligence  —   to monitor its own integrity and activate various defense mechanisms. His research interests range far and wide. In 2015, he and his team reported that they had developed a test that, using less than a drop of blood, could reveal nearly every virus a person had ever been exposed to. Other scientists saw vast potential in the test, suggesting it could be used to track patterns of disease across populations and to learn more about how viruses, and the body’s immune response to them, contribute to chronic diseases and cancer. Last year, Dr. Elledge won another major prize: the Lasker Award, which is often described as the American Nobel. Harry F. Noller helped unravel the structure of ribosomes and identify the importance of RNA to their mechanics. Ribosomes are like factories that assemble proteins within a cell. They look like a tangled mess of rubber bands and coiled wires. But by decoding their twists and folds, scientists can better understand how the genetic code gets translated. Dr. Noller is a biochemist and director of the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He and his colleagues used   crystallography to obtain the first image of the ribosome’s molecular structure. His work also helped show that ribosomes are ribozymes, a type of RNA molecule that can facilitate chemical reactions. In this case, the ribozymes stitch amino acids together to build proteins. Roeland Nusse, professor of developmental biology at Stanford University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, helped discover the first Wnt gene in 1982. The gene is part of the larger Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in the development of embryos, stem cells, bone growth and the progression of cancer. It is also critical for    communication in adults and developing embryos. The Wnt signaling pathway is found in every branch of the animal kingdom. It is involved in things as diverse as setting off breast cancer in mice and helping orchestrate the body plan of fruit flies. It has become an important part in many aspects of biology because the molecular cascade it sets off affects the growth of the entire ecosystem of the body. Dr. Huda Zoghbi, a professor of neurology at Baylor College of Medicine, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and director of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children’s Hospital, discovered that a mutation to a gene known as SCA1 causes Spinocerebellar ataxia, a neurodegenerative disorder. It can rob people of their control over their hands, legs and speech. An estimated 150, 000 people in the United States currently suffer from the disease. There is no known cure and it ultimately is fatal. But insight into its inner workings may provide a way to combat its progression. Dr. Zoghbi’s findings have helped provide the groundwork to fighting the disease. Dr. Zoghbi also helped uncover the culprit behind another neurodegenerative disease, Rett syndrome. This crippling condition mostly affects young girls and is often fatal. There are fewer than 1, 000 cases a year in the United States. Her team searched for the cause behind the malady for 16 years, eventually identifying it as a mutation in the gene MECP2. By identifying the gene, she also found that it plays a part in other neurological disorders, providing a starting point to fighting the diseases. Yoshinori Ohsumi, a cell biologist and honorary professor from the Institute of Innovative Research at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan, helped pioneer our understanding of how cells recycle themselves  —   known as autophagy  —   through his research with yeast in the 1990s. Organelles, proteins and other molecules inside the cell are constantly becoming damaged or worn out, especially as the cell divides. If too much rubbish builds up, it can become toxic and kill the cell. Autophagy is also a tool that the cell uses to refuel itself if it is starving. During autophagy, the cell produces internal garbage bags called autophagosomes that capture waste. The autophagosomes are sealed by a double membrane that keeps in the junk. They then fuse with organelles called lysosomes, which carry enzymes that help dissolve whatever is inside. Researchers think that failures in autophagy could contribute to Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. They also think it could help us better understand the process of aging. This year, Dr. Ohsumi won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for illuminating the importance of cell cannibalism. In addition to the big $3 million prizes, there were six $100, 000 New Horizons prizes  —   half in physics and half in mathematics. The young physics winners are: Asimina Arvanitaki of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, Peter Graham of Stanford and Surjeet Rajendran of the University of California, Berkeley, who split one prize Simone Giombi of Princeton and Xi Yin of Harvard who split another prize and Frans Pretorius of Princeton. In mathematics, the New Horizons winners were Mohammed Abouzaid of Columbia University Hugo   of the University of Geneva and Benjamin Elias of the University of Oregon and Geordie Williamson of Kyoto University.",0
11608,Sometimes the road to diet change can be fun,"Sometimes the road to diet change can be fun Ad 728×90 – HBS Account – 2149237058061490 http://blogs.naturalnews.com/sometimes-road-diet-change-can-fun/ 
By Hesh Goldstein 
Posted Friday, October 28, 2016 at 07:36am EDT 
When I was a kid, if I were told that I’d be writing a book about diet and nutrition when I was older, I would’ve thought that whoever told me that was out of their mind. 
Living in Newark, New Jersey, my parents and I consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead, rotting, pig bodies, although we did eat bacon (as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean). Going through high school and college it was no different. In fact, my dietary change did not come until I was in my 30’s. 
Just to put things in perspective, after I graduated from Weequahic High School and before going to Seton Hall University, I had a part-time job working for a butcher. I was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store. Needless to say, I had no consciousness nor awareness, as change never came then, despite the horrors I witnessed on an almost daily basis. 
After graduating with a degree in accounting from Seton Hall, I eventually got married and moved to a town called Livingston. Livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income. To say it was a “plastic” community would be an understatement. 
Livingston and the shallowness finally got to me. I told my wife I was fed up and wanted to move. She made it clear she had to be near her friends and New York City. I finally got my act together and split for Colorado. 
I was living with a lady in Aspen at the end of 1974, when one day she said, ” let’s become vegetarians”. I have no idea what possessed me to say it, but I said, “okay”! 
At that point I went to the freezer and took out about $100 worth of frozen, dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us. 
Well, everything was great for about a week or so, and then the chick split with another guy. 
So here I was, a vegetarian for a couple weeks, not really knowing what to do, how to cook, or basically how to prepare anything. For about a month, I was getting by on carrot sticks, celery sticks, and yogurt. Fortunately, when I went vegan in 1990, it was a simple and natural progression. Anyway, as I walked around Aspen town, I noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called, “The Little Kitchen”. 
Let me back up just a little bit. It was April of 1975, the snow was melting and the runoff of Ajax Mountain filled the streets full of knee-deep mud. Now, Aspen was great to ski in, but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting. 
I was ready to call it quits and I needed a warmer place. I’ll elaborate on that in a minute. 
But right now, back to “The Little Kitchen”. Knowing that I was going to leave Aspen and basically a new vegetarian, I needed help. So, I cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook. I told them in return I would wash dishes and empty their trash. They then asked me what I did for a living and I told them I was an accountant. 
The owner said to me, “Let’s make a deal. You do our tax return and we’ll feed you as well”. So for the next couple of weeks I was doing their tax return, washing their dishes, emptying the trash, eating three squares a day and learning as much as I could. 
But, like I said, the mud was getting to me. So I picked up a travel book written by a guy named Foder. The name of the book was, “Hawaii”. Looking through the book I noticed that in Lahaina, on Maui, there was a little vegetarian restaurant called,” Mr. Natural’s”. I decided right then and there that I would go to Lahaina and work at “Mr. Natural’s.” To make a long story short, that’s exactly what happened. 
So, I’m working at “Mr. Natural’s” and learning everything I can about my new dietary lifestyle – it was great. Every afternoon we would close for lunch at about 1 PM and go to the Sheraton Hotel in Ka’anapali and play volleyball, while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner. 
Since I was the new guy, and didn’t really know how to cook, I never thought that I would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner. Well, one afternoon, that’s exactly what happened; it was my turn. That posed a problem for me because I was at the point where I finally knew how to boil water. 
I was desperate, clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle. Fortunately, there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and I asked him if he knew how to cook. He said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas. He said that his enchiladas were bean-less and dairy-less. I told him that I had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about, but I needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal. 
Well, the guys came back from playing volleyball and I’m asked what was for dinner. I told them enchiladas; the owner wasn’t thrilled. I told him that mine were bean-less and dairy-less. When he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible. Being the humble guy that I was, I smiled and said, “You expected anything less”? It apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week. In fact, after about a week, we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around Lahaina broadcasting, ‘enchilada’s at “Natural’s” tonight’. I never had to cook anything else. 
A year later the restaurant closed, and somehow I gravitated to a little health food store in Wailuku. I never told anyone I was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver. 
The guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands. I told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the State. That’s when they found out I was an accountant and “Down to Earth” was born. “Down to Earth” became the largest natural food store chain in the islands, and I was their Chief Financial Officer and co-manager of their biggest store for 13 years. 
In 1981, I started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures. I still do that show today. I pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty. One bit of a hassle was the fact that I was forced to get a Masters Degree in Nutrition to shut up all the MD’s that would call in asking for my credentials. 
My doing this radio show enabled me, through endless research, to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries, the big pharmaceutical companies, the biotech industries and the government agencies. 
This information, unconscionable as it is, enabled me to realize how broken our health system is. 
I left Down to Earth in 1989, got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie. After doing that for about four years I finally made it back to Honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the Honolulu Club, one of Hawaii’s premier fitness clubs. 
It was there I met the love of my life who I have been with since 1998. She made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. She said,” If you want to be with me you’ve got to stop working on naked women”. So, I went back into accounting and was the Chief Financial Officer of a large construction company for many years. 
Going back to my Newark days when I was an infant, I had no idea what a “chicken” or “egg” or “fish” or “pig” or “cow” was. My dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents. It was by the grace of God that I was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness. 
The road that I started walking down in 1975 has finally led me to the point of writing my book, A Sane Diet For An Insane World. Hopefully, the information contained therein will be enlightening, motivating, and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices. 
Doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow. I am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities I have encountered along my path, you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on, not only for your health but your consciousness as well.

11609,Trump Just Got Hit With Massive $32 Million Fraud & Tax Evasion Lawsuit,"Comments 
Republican nominee and lawsuit magnet Donald Trump has found himself the target of yet another accusation of fraud and financial misconduct – this time in another country. A Mexican official has filed a criminal tax complaint against Trump in Tijuana, Mexico, over yet another failed business venture – the Trump Ocean Resort, which collapsed before it even began construction. 
But before the housing market and the rest of the global economy collapsed with the onset of the Bush Recession, Trump and his partners sold $32.5 million in future properties to unwitting customers since 2006 and leaving their investors in the lurch. 
In addition, Donald Trump is accused of dodging an additional $32.5 million in taxes – surprise! – but has countered that he wasn’t actually involved, but that he was just “leasing” his name on the project. The investors, however, counter that Trump’s face was on the brochure and quoted him as saying it would be “the most spectacular place in all of Mexico.” 
Though Trump worked out the deal with Los Angeles-based developer Irongate Wilshire and Mexican company P.B. Impulsores, the lawsuit singles out Trump by name, calling him out “against the Mexican state because beyond defrauding investors he also committed fraud by not paying taxes in Mexico for the mercantile operations he took part in.”",0
11610,Transgender Texas Boy Gets New Birth Certificate,"Born Mary Grace, a    North Texas child is now officially named Max. His parents petitioned a court to change all of his legal documents, including his name, birth certificate, and Social Security card to reflect his male name and identity. [Max Briggle’s mother Amber told WFAA: “He’s always going to be transgender, but having that piece of paper, my hope is that it’s going to make it a little easier for him. ”  She called these changes, “another milestone,” and believed the new paperwork was essential for her child while the state legislature debates the proposed “bathroom bill,” SB 6. If passed into law, this legislation would mandate people use bathrooms based on the gender shown on their birth certificates. Amber and husband Adam, who reside outside of Dallas in Denton, became visible advocates for transgender children as the “bathroom bill” debate heated up nationally and in Texas. Max, then MG, became the face of Texas trans kids when his parents invited Attorney General Ken Paxton to dinner at their home. The family wanted to show Paxton they were a “  normal, remarkably unremarkable family,” according to The Dallas Morning News. Paxton and his wife accepted the invitation. The AG lead a   lawsuit against the former Obama administration over a transgender directive that advised public school students could use the bathroom and other facilities based on “gender identity. ” Ultimately, a federal judge blocked the Obama transgender guidelines. “As long as we’re going to pass laws saying which facilities you can and can’t use, it’s awfully nice to have a document saying he can use it,” said Amber Briggle. “At the same time, I just feel like it’s so unnecessary. Why do I have to change my son’s birth certificate so he can be treated like the boy that he is?” A changed birth certificate impacts more than bathrooms. In 2016, Texas public school superintendents resoundingly approved the University Interscholastic League’s (UIL) amendment requiring that school districts use a  ’s birth certificate to determine gender identification if questioned, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The UIL is the state’s governing body for competitive public school athletics, music, and academic events. Recently, North Texas transgender teen athlete Mack Beggs, transitioning from female to male, competed on the girl’s wrestling team because of UIL rules, Breitbart Texas reported. Altering Max’s name required a letter from a physician meeting specific requirements and a court order. According to WFAA, Texas Health  Human Services said only 34 people in the entire state met these requirements and could change their vital documents last year. In this case, the Briggle family went through the U. S. State Department to amend their trans child’s birth certificate since he was born in The Netherlands. The State Department issues a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) when American children are born in a foreign country. That document now states Max’s sex as male. A CRBA functions as a birth certificate for all official purposes. Amber Briggle believes going through the State Department simplified the lengthy process. “The fact that he was born abroad made it significantly easier for us than had he been born here in Texas,” she said. “In which case, I’m not sure it would have happened at all. At least not at this age. ” The family now plans to have a “ ” baby shower to commemorate the revised paperwork. “I want to have a baby shower for my baby boy,” said Amber Briggle. “He’s always been my son. But it’s been this very long, gradual process over nine years for us to get to this point, and I feel like that needs to be recognized. ” Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.",0

For Alik Pagayev, an Ossetian who manages a troupe at the Narty Theater in Vladikavkaz, creativity is in the blood of his people. 
”I was born in a mountain village and we had this joke: 'Throw a balalaika out of your window, anyone who catches it can play it,” he says. 
Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia, a small republic on Russia’s southern edge bordering Georgia, is called the “Caucasian St. Petersburg.” No other city in the North Caucasus has so many creative people: artists, photographers, designers and performers. 
Creative abilities, however, are not the only national trait of the Ossetians. Pagayev says that every Ossetian has military skills and talents for working with horses in their blood.

The Ossetians are descended from Iranian-speaking nomads – the Scythians and the Sarmatians. In historical writings from the 2nd century A.D. these tribes were known for their serious military and political might. 
By the 11th century A.D. the medieval kingdom of Alania had been established in the region. Its inhabitants were famous for their military skills: The main army consisted of the cavalry. Despite their glorious reputation, the Alans could not fight off the Tatar-Mongolian invasion and in the 14th century they were practically destroyed as a people. Only few hundred Alans remained in the mountains. However, the nation managed to survive and later it successfully assimilated in Russia. 
According to a 2010 census, today there are almost 700,000 Ossetians in the world, most of whom live in Russia. Most Ossetians live in North Ossetia (459,600 people), while in Moscow there are 7,900 Ossetians and in St. Petersburg slightly over 3,000. 
While 45,900 Ossetians live in the disputed territory of South Ossetia (recognized by just three nations, with the rest of the world continuing to see it as part of Georgia), they also live in Russia’s other Caucasian republics. In Kabardino-Balkaria there are more than 9,000 Ossetians, in the Stavropol Territory there are almost 8,000 and there is even a separate Ossetian village in Karachay-Cherkessia with 3,100 inhabitants. There are also Ossetian diasporas in other countries. In Turkey the fraternity counts 37,000 members and in Georgia – 14,300 outside South Ossetia. 
”The Caucasus started to become a part of Russia in the 18th century. Our republic was one of the first,” explains Anna Kabisova, a photographer and photojournalist. 
”The Ossetians are Christians. So it is easier for them, in comparison to the Muslim republics, to find common ground with the Russian population.” Source: Archive photo, 19th century 
”The Ossetians perceived these changes as a salvation since it is difficult to survive in the mountains and the intelligentsia understood that it was important to develop. A step towards Russia implied opportunity. Back then many Ossetians went to study in St. Petersburg. That is how this place acquired many artists, sculptors and then its own influential art school, its own distinguishing style,” she said. 
In her view, such open-mindedness to new cultures is also a national trait. ”The reason lies in religion. The Ossetians are Christians. So it is easier for them, in comparison to the Muslim republics, to find common ground with the Russian population.” Pies, beer and offerings to the gods 
Actually, the Christianity found in the republic is not entirely traditional. Pagan beliefs are also strong here. The Ossetians have dozens of popular religious celebrations with various rituals. There are symbolic peace sacrifices, for example, slaughtering a chicken or a sheep for guests at a feast. 
The famous Ossetian national pies are sacred food. These round, thin pies with meat, cheese and potatoes in the Ossetian worldview represent the sun. During a holiday each family places three pies on the table. They also have local breweries. 
”The Caucasus started to become a part of Russia in the 18th century. Our republic was one of the first,” explains Anna Kabisova, a photographer and photojournalist. Anna Kabisova 
For many occasions women brew beer according to the national recipe. The Ossetians have their own Oktoberfest. Each October Vladikavkaz holds an Ossetian beer festival/competition, to which Ossetians come from Russia and other countries. The drink, in its aspect and taste, is similar to kvas , the Russian malt drink, and is around 1.5-2 percent alcohol. 
The beer is brewed in a large cauldron over a fire. Its main ingredients are the typical ones: hops, malt. But there are also special ones such as lamb ribs and sugar – there are many different recipes. Not merchants 
”Ask me what I hate doing most and I'll respond: trading,” says Alik Pagayev, describing the national character. ""The Ossetians don't have an entrepreneurial spirit. We have many talented artists, good athletes, especially in freestyle wrestling, horse breeders, but commerce is really not our thing.” 
”Ask me what I hate doing most and I'll respond: trading,” says Alik Pagayev, describing the national character. Source: Archive photo, 19th century 
Pagayev also says that tolerance and tact are two other national traits. 
”I worked in [the neighboring republic of] Kabardino-Balkaria for three years and could not get used to the fact that they speak their national language. I would go to someone's house and they would speak their own language. I wouldn't understand anything and someone would have to translate the general meaning of the conversation. 
”In Ossetia it's not like that. If there’s even one guest among us, we speak Russian. A friend of mine from Chechnya would often visit us and once he heard people speaking Ossetian on a street in Vladikavkaz. He was surprised because he had thought that we always speak Russian.”

In fact, Pagayev explains, there are some young people who do not even know their national language, which he says is sad. 
”Our language must be preserved. At home my children speak only Ossetian. If I hear them speak Russian, I tell them, 'You'll speak Russian where you have to, but at home speak your native language,'” he says. 
Another important national trait is learning, he explains: ”People always wonder: A young guy from a remote mountain village goes to study in St. Petersburg or Moscow and in two years he fully integrates, speaks Russian without an accent and produces good results in his studies. This is an important trait. I think this is what helped our people survive the difficult times.” Subscribe to get the hand picked best stories every week Subscribe to our mailing list Facebook",0

11616,"Flagged Two Times in 2014, Ahmad Rahami Passed Scrutiny - The New York Times","When Ahmad Khan Rahami returned in March 2014 from a nearly yearlong trip to Pakistan, he was flagged by customs officials, who pulled him out for a secondary screening. Still concerned about his travel, they notified the National Targeting Center, a federal agency that assesses potential threats, two law enforcement officials said. It was one of thousands of such notifications every year, and a report on Mr. Rahami was passed along to the F. B. I. and other intelligence agencies. Five months later, when Mr. Rahami’s father told the police after a domestic dispute that he was concerned about his son having terrorist sympathies, federal agents again examined his travel history. And again, despite Mr. Rahami’s now having been flagged twice for scrutiny, the concerns were not found to warrant a deeper inquiry, one of the law enforcement officials said. Ahmad Rahami was not interviewed by federal agents. But now, the travel history of Mr. Rahami, who is accused of carrying out bombings in New York and New Jersey last weekend, has become a focus of investigators, a subject made all the more urgent by details contained in a notebook that suggests he drew inspiration largely from the Islamic State. In particular, Mr. Rahami cites a founding member of the Islamic State who called on Muslims around the world to take up whatever arms they could find and spill the blood of nonbelievers. The assessment of Mr. Rahami by the F. B. I. began in August 2014, and it once again reviewed the report by the National Targeting Center. The center was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to function as an intelligence analysis agency within the Department of Homeland Security. “By identifying   passengers and cargo well before they would cross our land borders, sail into our ports or touch down on our tarmacs, the N. T. C. team is on duty to protect our people and economy ” the federal government’s description of the agency says. It is unclear how much information the report contained about Mr. Rahami’s activities during the 11 months he was in Pakistan, starting in April 2013, and about any other trips he made while abroad. Investigators are interested in learning more about both a   trip he made to Afghanistan and another trip he may have made to Ankara, Turkey, according to the law enforcement officials, who spoke about the continuing investigation under the condition of anonymity. The report by the targeting center did not mention any travel to Turkey, according to one of the officials. Records the New York Police Department provided to customs officials indicate that Mr. Rahami traveled to Ankara for an unspecified length of time in January 2014, according to another law enforcement official and documents obtained by The New York Times. That trip would have happened at a time when international authorities were concerned about the flow of foreign combatants to Syria to fight in the civil war there, but before the Islamic State became widely known as a source of global terrorism. The Islamic State was just making its first expansion into Iraq then, taking the city of Falluja. Mostly, the group was seen as an Islamist rebel force in the Syrian conflict that had become focused on grabbing territory from fellow opposition groups  —   especially the Nusra front, which, like the Islamic State, had started as a branch of Al Qaeda but instead became an enemy. The questions about where Mr. Rahami drew his inspiration and whether he had help are at the center of the investigation even as an intense legal battle takes shape over how his case is being handled. Defense lawyers are fighting to get Mr. Rahami before a judge so he can be appointed a lawyer and have charges laid out against him, while prosecutors are pushing back. The new information being gleaned from Mr. Rahami’s notebook, a copy of which was provided to The Times by another law enforcement official, who was not authorized to speak to the press, paints a substantially different picture from what could be understood by the snippets highlighted in the criminal complaint filed in federal court on Tuesday night. That summary mentioned Anwar   once Al Qaeda’s leading propagandist, who is equally popular with the Islamic State’s followers, but made no mention of the ISIS spokesman and senior strategist Abu Muhammad  . The pages of Mr. Rahami’s journal echo the talking points of Mr. Adnani, who in May advised followers around the world to commit violence in their home countries if travel to Syria proved too difficult. Fragments of the journal  —   much of it rendered illegible because of blood stains  —   suggest that Mr. Rahami may have himself been frustrated in his attempts to reach Syria and was using that as justification for committing terror at home. One page has the word “blocked,” followed by: “You should have let us meet death overseas. ” On a subsequent page, he wrote “back to Sham,” an archaic regional name that has come to be used for Syria. He goes on: “I looked for guidance and Alhumdulilah,” he says, using an Arabic expression praising God. “Guidance come   Sheikh Anwar   Brother Adnani   Dawla. Said it clearly attack The Kuffar in their backyard. ” The last sentence appears to refer to Mr. Adnani’s speech this summer in which he beseeched followers to hurt unbelievers in whatever manner they could and wherever they found them. Mr. Rahami makes clear that he planned to die a martyr: In “my heart, I pray to the beautiful wise Allah   to not take jihad away,” he said. “I begged for shahada,” he continued, using the Arabic for martyrdom, “and inshallah this call will be answered. ” Mr. Rahami also refers to more recent comments Mr. Adnani made. “If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door to Hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad and make their act a source of pain to them,” Mr. Adnani said in a speech released by the Islamic State in May. “The smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us, and more effective and more damaging to them. ” The authorities are also still searching for two men who apparently stumbled on one of the bombs planted in Manhattan on Saturday evening and took the explosive device out of a bag before walking away with the bag  —   although officials said they were not believed to be part of the plot. On Wednesday, investigators, who believe the bag may be a valuable piece of evidence, released images of the men  —   one wearing a pink golf shirt and the other wearing a light brown   collared shirt. The images were taken from surveillance video that shows the men walking on 27th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue in Chelsea between 8 and 9 p. m. on Saturday. The authorities said they did not believe the men were tied to Mr. Rahami. “We have no reason to believe they’re connected,” Chief James Waters, head of the New York Police Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, said at a news conference on Wednesday morning. The city police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said they were considered witnesses. Mr. Rahami is recovering in Newark from wounds he sustained in a shootout with the police in Linden, N. J. on Monday morning, when he was taken into custody. The United States attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, said on Wednesday that the government would bring Mr. Rahami to New York City to face charges. “In the near future, it is our intention to bring the defendant to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York,” she said in remarks made in Washington. The chief federal public defender in Manhattan, David E. Patton, wrote late on Tuesday night to Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein, asking for a court hearing at the earliest possible time and proposing that if Mr. Rahami’s health did not permit his travel to Manhattan, Mr. Patton’s lawyers could represent him in New Jersey at the hearing by telephone or video. “The Sixth Amendment requires that he be given access to counsel on the federal charges, and that he be presented without delay,” Mr. Patton wrote. The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, asked the judge to deny the request. In court papers on Wednesday, his office said that because Mr. Rahami was arrested by the local police and is being held on state charges in connection with the shootout, he is not in federal custody. That, the prosecutors argued, means that he does not yet have a right to a prompt appearance in federal court and the provision of a lawyer there. Mr. Patton responded later on Wednesday that it was “undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning” Mr. Rahami, and that his office had decided to represent Mr. Rahami after determining that he qualified as an indigent defendant. But the judge, in a ruling issued on Wednesday night, found that the court did not have the authority to appoint Mr. Rahami a lawyer or order an appearance at this time. Peter Liguori, the deputy public defender in Union County, where the shooting of the Linden police officers took place, said he had not received notification that Mr. Rahami had requested a lawyer. “We want to make sure that his constitutional rights are protected,” Mr. Liguori said. “If he or his family has requested our assistance, we will certainly help him and make sure that he gets proper representation. ”",0
11617,Donald Trump Delays Moving Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem,"President Donald Trump signed a six month waiver to delay moving the U. S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, despite his campaign promise to do so. [In a statement, the White House said Trump was still committed to to his promise, but made the decision to delay the move of the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem for the sake of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine.  “As he has repeatedly stated his intention to move the embassy, the question is not if that move happens, but only when,” the statement from the White House read. Trump’s decision follows the precedent set by former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama who all signed a six month waiver of the 1995 law. The delay will disappoint supporters of the president who hoped for bold action, separated from years of tired political rhetoric on the issue. “[N]o one should consider this step to be in any way a retreat from the President’s strong support for Israel and for the United   alliance,” read the statement.",0
11618,"Meet Judith Clark, the Domestic Terrorist Granted Clemency by Gov. Andrew Cuomo - Breitbart","“Were you on drugs?” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asked convicted murderer Judith Clark before commuting part of her     sentence. “No,” she explained. “I was on politics. ”[Clark’s addiction long predated her participation in the October 20, 1981 robbery of an armored car that left a guard and two cops dead.  “There’s no question I was a red diaper baby,” she wrote in an autobiographical sketch. “I was still in diapers when my mother, Ruth, journeyed across two oceans with my    brother and me to the Soviet Union to join my father in a   sojourn. My father, Joe, was a CP organizer from the age fourteen. In 1949, when I was born, he was a Party leader and writer for the Daily Worker. My mother, like many Party women, was a mass organizer, working with settlement houses on the Lower East Side and on the congressional election campaigns of progressive politicians such as Vito Marcantonio. ” Like Brink’s robbery   Kathy Boudin, Greenwich Village townhouse casualty Ted Gold, and Weatherman comrade Eleanor Raskin, Judy Clark grew up Old Left only to find political expression in the New Left. “Some of them were trying to repudiate their past,” former Weatherman Mark Rudd tells Breitbart News of the   babies. “Some of them were trying to better their parents. ” As Clark herself explained during a 2003 appeal, “My choice of social activism and even the vehemence of my beliefs were, in some ways, consistent with my parents’ values and history. But my insistence on the need for violence represented a real break from their values. This was part of its attraction for me. While I was driven to take up their abandoned mission of transforming society, I also felt I had to atone for their failure to sustain their commitment. ” Whereas her parents displayed contempt for America by migrating to Stalin’s Russia, Judy Clark did so by taking the fight to the streets of America. Chicago cops arrested Clark at the Days of Rage, the 1969 orgy of violence that resulted in one of Mayor Richard J. Daley’s confidantes becoming a quadriparetic. Late that year at the Wargasm in Flint, where the Weathermen iconized Charles Manson, Clark created, along with future Brinks   Kathy Boudin and       Diana Oughton, a massive poster spelling out murdered actress Sharon Tate’s name in bullets. When the FBI caught up to Clark outside of a Manhattan movie house in late 1970, the federal fugitive ate pieces of paper while fleeing before kicking, swearing, and spitting on the arresting agents. A decade later, she greeted law enforcement similarly. Becoming the only   Weatherman fugitive apprehended by authorities during the group’s heyday proved disastrous for Clark —  and law enforcement. “The people aboveground tended to be pretty hardcore,” Rudd, who evaded arrest until turning himself in to the authorities in 1977, notes. Whereas members of the Weather Underground focused on staying underground, Clark and others aboveground fixated on revolution. “People found each other,” Rudd tells Breitbart News. “Somehow or another Judy must have found people aboveground, many of whom I’ve never met, who thought like she did. ” Clark ventured forth, with several   Weathermen including Boudin and Dave Gilbert, in something called the May 19 Communist Movement. The group embarked on a series of bombings, helped break   Assata Shakur free from a New Jersey prison, and pursued “expropriations” that resulted in numerous casualties, including, ultimately, its own members, who wasted away in prison. Clark’s group of white revolutionaries joined forces with the Puerto Rican FALN and the   Black Liberation Army. On October 20, 1981, an amalgam of the BLA and May 19 calling itself The Family, robbed a Brink’s truck outside of a mall in Nanuet, New York. Earlier that year, the group robbed a Brink’s truck in the Bronx of more than a quarter of a million dollars. Tyrone Rison, who swore to Clark’s participation in the Bronx job, confessed to killing a guard in that operation. Despite understanding the risks to innocent life, Clark participated in the robbery in Nanuet that resulted in the murder of a Brink’s guard and two Nyack, New York, cops. “Shamefully,” Clark later noted of the action, “I contemplated the irony that in the name of Black Liberation, a respected black police officer, Waverly Brown, had been murdered. ” “She was armed,” Kenneth Maxwell, the FBI’s case agent on the Nanuet Brink’s robbery, points out. “The way the Family operated, every single one of them was armed going out to the scene. She was much more than a getaway driver and a lookout. She was not, as certain media and government voices purport her to be, a peripheral player. She was a leader of the May 19 Communist movement that benefitted from these robberies. ” In addition to driving the muscle to the robbery, Clark carried a gun. Maxwell notes that upon arrest, cops discovered shattered glass on her person that came from the UHaul hiding the gunmen and from a police cruiser. Rather than a momentary lapse of reason, Clark’s behavior that day fit a pattern. On June 2 of that year, a gunman alleges she played a similar role in an assault on a Brink’s truck in the Bronx that left one guard dead and another wounded, netting $250, 000 for the group’s revolutionary delusions and cocaine addictions. Two years earlier, the May 19 Communist Movement helped break Assata Shakur from prison. The indictments in that case named Clark as an uncharged  . Because it looked certain that the remainder of Clark’s days would transpire behind bars, the authorities did not bother to charge her in the deadly Bronx robbery or the prison break. Her behavior in custody in 1981 mirrored her behavior after the 1970 arrest, when she spat, kicked and swore at FBI agents. “I had heard that story,” former special agent Maxwell tells Breitbart News of the resistance that earned a place in FBI lore. “It predated my entry into the FBI. It certainly was validated by her demeanor that she exhibited   after she was captured fleeing the scene in Nyack in 1981. When they took her into custody —  extremely uncooperative. ” No mellowing took place in Clark in the 11 or so years that transpired. “When the court ordered a lineup, here’s what she did,” Maxwell explains. “She repeatedly resisted any attempts to go into the lineup to the point where she kicked, scratched, bit, and spit in the faces of   folks, hissing and screaming in a demonic way. Jim Stewart, lieutenant detective in the Rockland County district attorney’s office, said she reminded him of the character in the movie The Exorcist. That’s how Judy Clark acted. ” Her unruly conduct resulted in law enforcement placing her in a straitjacket. Her strange behavior continued in the courtroom. “I am an   freedom fighter,” Clark announced at her 1983 murder trial. “I don’t recognize the legitimacy of this Court. ” The court reciprocated by not recognizing the legitimacy of the     counsel’s arguments. At her 1983 trial, Clark demanded    status, the right to wear armbands in solidarity with the New African Freedom Fighters, and a change of venue to another nation. She compared herself to George Washington and asked potential jurors, “Do your children play cowboys and Indians?” and “Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan?” She refused to remain in the court upon the reading of her sentence. “The D. A. calls what happened on October 20, 1981, a robbery and murder,” Clark explained to a befuddled courtroom. “We say it was an attempted expropriation because revolutionary forces must take from the powers that be to build their capabilities to struggle against this system. ” Something got lost in translation from sixties rhetoric to eighties reality. The Hiroo Onoda of the   ’t received a sentence of    . She received an additional sentence of two years in solitary confinement in 1985 after evidence implicated her in an escape plot. Until Governor Cuomo cut that mandatory minimum by more than half in late December, she looked forward to a parole date past her 100th birthday. Now she could gain release this year. Like so many of her comrades from the 1960s, Judith Clark traveled on a long, strange trip. That journey, from Stalin’s Russia to the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, ended perhaps more predictably than the trips of others.",0
11619,A New Era of Internet Attacks Powered by Everyday Devices - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When surveillance cameras began popping up in the 1970s and ’80s, they were welcomed as a   tool, then as a way to monitor traffic congestion, factory floors and even baby cribs. Later, they were adopted for darker purposes, as authoritarian governments like China’s used them to prevent challenges to power by keeping tabs on protesters and dissidents. But now those cameras  —   and many other devices that today are connected to the internet  —   have been commandeered for an entirely different purpose: as a weapon of mass disruption. The internet slowdown that swept the East Coast on Friday, when many Americans were already jittery about the possibility that hackers could interfere with election systems, offered a glimpse of a new era of vulnerabilities confronting a highly connected society. The attack on the infrastructure of the internet, which made it all but impossible at times to check Twitter feeds or headlines, was a remarkable reminder about how billions of ordinary   devices  —   many of them highly insecure  —   can be turned to vicious purposes. And the threats will continue long after Election Day for a nation that increasingly keeps its data in the cloud and has oftentimes kept its head in the sand. Remnants of the attack continued to slow some sites on Saturday, though the biggest troubles had abated. Still, to the tech community, Friday’s events were as inevitable as an earthquake along the San Andreas fault. A new kind of malicious software exploits a   vulnerability in those cameras and other cheap devices that are now joining up to what has become known as the internet of things. The advantage of putting every device on the internet is obvious. It means your refrigerator can order you milk when you are running low, and the printer on your home network can tell a retailer that you need more ink. Security cameras can alert your cellphone when someone is walking up the driveway, whether it is a delivery worker or a burglar. When Google and the Detroit automakers get their driverless cars on the road, the internet of things will become your chauffeur. But hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions, of those security cameras and other devices have been infected with a fairly simple program that guessed at their   passwords  —   often “admin” or “12345” or even, yes, “password”  —   and, once inside, turned them into an army of simple robots. Each one was commanded, at a coordinated time, to bombard a small company in Manchester, N. H. called Dyn DNS with messages that overloaded its circuits. Few have heard of Dyn, but it essentially acts as one of the internet’s giant switchboards. Bring it to a halt, and the problems spread instantly. It did not take long to reduce Twitter, Reddit and Airbnb  —   as well as the news feeds of The New York Times  —   to a crawl. The culprit is unclear, and it may take days or weeks to detect it. In the end, though, the answer probably does not mean much anyway. The vulnerability the country woke up to on Friday morning can be easily exploited by a   such as Russia, which the Obama administration has blamed for hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of Hillary Clinton’s campaign officials. It could also be exploited by a criminal group, which was the focus of much of the guesswork about Friday’s attack, or even by teenagers. The opportunities for copycats are endless. The starkest warning came in   from Bruce Schneier, an internet security expert, who posted a brief essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet. ” The technique was hardly news: Entities like the North Korean government and extortionists have long used “distributed   ” attacks to direct a flood of data at sites they do not like. “If the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has,” he wrote, “the attacker wins. ” But in recent times, hackers have been exploring the vulnerabilities of the companies that make up the backbone of the internet  —   just as states recently saw examinations of the systems that hold their voter registration rolls. Attacks on the companies escalated, Mr. Schneier wrote, “as if the attack were looking for the exact point of failure. ” Think of the mighty Maginot Line, tested again and again by the German Army in 1940, until it found the weak point and rolled into Paris. The difference with the internet is that it is not clear in the United States who is supposed to be protecting it. The network does not belong to the government  —   or really to anyone. Instead, every organization is responsible for defending its own little piece. Banks, retailers and social media hubs are supposed to invest in protecting their websites, but that does not help much if the connections among them are severed. The Department of Homeland Security is supposed to provide the baseline of internet defense for the United States, but it is constantly playing  . In recent weeks, it deployed teams to the states to help them find and patch vulnerabilities in their voter registration systems and their networks for reporting results. The F. B. I. investigates breaches, but that takes time  —   and, in the meantime, people want to bank online and stream television shows. On Nov. 8, Americans will have to look up where they are supposed to vote, and, in a few cases, they will cast their votes on the internet. Yet the voting system is not considered part of the nation’s “critical infrastructure. ” The head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, said recently that experts were looking at the problem the wrong way. “We are   on places and things,” he said in a talk at Harvard. “We need to focus on the data,” and how it flows  —   or doesn’t flow. That is where the internet of things comes in. Most of the devices have been hooked up to the web over the past few years with little concern for security. Cheap parts, some coming from Chinese suppliers, have weak or no password protections, and it is not obvious how to change those passwords. And the problem is quickly expanding: Cisco estimates that the number of such devices could reach 50 billion by 2020, from 15 billion today. Intel puts the number at roughly 200 billion devices in the same time frame. (Assuming the global population is around 7. 7 billion people in 2020, that would be about six to 26 devices per person.) Security researchers have been warning of this problem for years, but that caution has largely been written off as hype or  . Then Brian Krebs, who runs a popular site on internet security, was struck by a significant attack a few weeks ago. The company protecting him, Akamai, gave up. The malware behind the attack, called Mirai, had a   dictionary of common passwords and used them to hijack devices to become attackers. Chester Wisniewski, a principal computer research scientist at Sophos, a security company, said that attacks like the one on Dyn “might be the beginning of a new era of internet attacks conducted via ‘smart’ things. ” “There are tens of millions more insecure ‘smart’ things that could cause incredible disruptions, if harnessed,” Mr. Wisniewski added in an email. It is possible, investigators say, that the attack on Dyn was conducted by a criminal group that wanted to extort the company. Or it could have been done by “hacktivists. ” Or a foreign power that wanted to remind the United States of its vulnerability. The answer may not come by Election Day, but the next wave of attacks very well could.",0
11620,Colorado Weighs Replacing Obama’s Health Policy With Universal Coverage - The New York Times,"DENVER  —   For years, voters in this swing state have rejected tax increases and efforts to expand government. But now they are flirting with a radical transformation: whether to abandon President Obama’s health care policy and instead create a new,   public health system that guarantees coverage for everyone. The estimated $    proposal, which will go before Colorado voters in November, will test whether people have an appetite for a new system that goes further than the Affordable Care Act. That question is also in play in the Democratic presidential primaries. The   effort, which supporters here call the ColoradoCare plan, would do away with deductibles. It would allow patients to choose doctors and specialists without distinguishing between those “in network” and those “out of network. ” It would largely be paid for with a tax increase on workers and businesses, and cover everyone in the state. Supporters say most people would end up saving money. Insurance groups, chambers of commerce and conservatives have already lined up in opposition. They say the plan’s details are vague, its size and cost galling. The proposed health system would have a budget bigger than that of Colorado’s entire state government. A new 10 percent tax on payroll and incomes to pay for the system would push Colorado’s tax rates to some of the highest in the nation. The proposal’s chance of success is dubious. Colorado has a mixed record when it comes to ballot measures, though it has passed some notable ones over the years, including marijuana legalization and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, an     constitutional amendment. But the proposal had enough support to garner 100, 000 signatures, which put it on the ballot. It has also worried insurers, and some in the medical community and the business community, enough for them to organize in opposition, even enlisting a Democratic former governor to help in their campaign. In this season of political discontent, the notion of dismantling the health insurance system has tapped an aquifer of frustration from voters. People say that even after the Affordable Care Act, they still pay too much in premiums, plus thousands in deductibles, and still have to worry about being bankrupted by a disabling car crash or an extended hospital stay. “I think insurance is one of the biggest jokes and crooks,” said Brandon Barta, 38, of Denver. He said his father, Dixon, who worked at a gas station, never received aggressive enough treatment for his prostate cancer. He died last May at the age of 64. “He was overlooked,” Mr. Barta said. Mr. Barta said he was intrigued by the idea of a universal health plan that covered maternity care, checkups, emergency room visits and hospital stays, all the way through    care. Like millions of Americans, he has health insurance tied to his work. His coverage lapsed recently when he switched jobs to start working for a golf entertainment complex, and he is still waiting for his new plan to kick in. Still, he has questions about how universal coverage would work and how much it would cost taxpayers like him. The answers: If a majority of voters say yes, the system would start running in 2019, and essentially be a   health cooperative bigger than companies like Nike and American Express, according to the Colorado Health Institute, an independent policy group. A   elected board would set the benefits and budgets. The system would be financed by payroll taxes of 3. 3 percent for workers and 6. 7 percent for employers. It would impose a 10 percent tax on investment income, people who are   and some   income. In the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, echoing many moderate Democratic leaders here, has said that she wants to keep and improve the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature legislative legacy. But her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, who won Colorado’s Democratic caucuses last month by nearly 20 points, has advocated abandoning the health law for a “Medicare for all” approach. His proposal is similar to the ColoradoCare plan. The campaign over the Colorado initiative has had the unusual effect of putting conservative critics in the position of defending Mr. Obama’s health plan against an assault from the left. At the same time, it is energizing progressives, who say the Affordable Care Act was a giveaway to the insurance industry that, even with an estimated 20 million people newly insured, has left too many others without coverage. “No matter how long we hang in there with the Affordable Care Act, we will never cover everybody,” said Jeanne Nicholson, a former Democratic state senator and nurse who is a leading supporter of universal care here. “We don’t understand why we should compromise and say some people can have bronze coverage, some can have silver and some can have gold. Why can’t we all have platinum plus?” Nathan Wilkes, 42, who lives in the Denver suburbs, said that years of trying to get care for his son, who has hemophilia, had worn his family thin and made him an advocate for universal coverage. He said the family had spent thousands of dollars and destroyed its credit because of insufficient coverage. The Affordable Care Act offered some benefits, he said, but its gaps were still too big and “not sustainable. ” Unlike its conservative neighbors, Colorado jumped to get on board with the Affordable Care Act. It set up its own insurance marketplace and expanded Medicaid coverage for poorer residents. But there have been stumbles. People in mountain towns with few providers faced   premiums for coverage. Colorado’s biggest health cooperative, Colorado HealthOP, shut down in October, forcing more than 80, 000 people to find new plans. Colorado’s plan would replace many private workplace plans, but it would sit alongside Medicare and federal health coverage for veterans, and private insurers could still sell coverage to people who wanted more. The Colorado Health Institute, an independent policy group, said the plan’s passage would be “the most   health care reform in any state” since the Affordable Care Act. “It’s replacing a system that I think has become really dysfunctional,” said Irene Aguilar, a Democratic state senator and physician who is leading the effort. “The game has been rigged by the   corporations to ensure they win. ” Opponents say that it could wreck the state’s humming economy and drive away doctors and businesses, and that its costs could spiral out of control. If it passes, ColoradoCare would become part of the state Constitution, and become virtually impossible to significantly alter without a statewide vote. It would also fall outside the reach of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, a 1992 amendment to the Colorado Constitution that put strict limits on spending and new taxes. “It would be a disastrous economic impact on the state,” said Walker Stapleton, Colorado’s treasurer and a   of the opposition campaign. “If you think legalized pot brought a lot of people to Colorado, you should try free health care. ” Like many other Republicans here, Mr. Stapleton opposed the Affordable Care Act and continues to criticize how it has been put in place. But to defeat the new initiative, he now finds himself defending the federal health law. Sean Duffy, a Republican and a spokesman for the opposition campaign, said many of his neighbors in the conservative Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch had eagerly signed the petition to put the question on the November ballot because they saw it as a way to get rid of Obamacare. Some Democratic officials also oppose the state’s universal care effort. They include Gov. John Hickenlooper, who said during his 2014   fight that he was “no big fan of the Affordable Care Act. ” Colorado’s previous Democratic governor, Bill Ritter, also opposes it. Michelle Lucero, general counsel at Children’s Hospital Colorado, is among the health care officials lining up against the measure. (The hospital itself also opposes it.) She worries that it could threaten research dollars or drive away doctors. “They’re going to choose to go to a state that’s not hamstrung by this,” she said.",0
11621,Milestone for New Tappan Zee Bridge: It’s Halfway Done - The New York Times,"TARRYTOWN, N. Y.  —   The building of the   Tappan Zee Bridge, the first major new bridge in the New York area in half a century, has reached the halfway point. Already, more than a mile of concrete road deck has been laid, stretching from the bridge’s South Nyack end over the waters of the Hudson River.   of the 43 pairs of piers that will hold up the 3.  bridge are finished, with a framework of cornflower blue steel beams between many of them, so that more than half of the horizontal silhouette of the bridge is in place. Almost the entire steel skeleton should be completed by October, said Neil Napolitano, who manages work on the long approaches from both the Rockland and Westchester County shores. The toppling of a   crane on July 19 onto the roadway of the existing bridge, an accident that shut down traffic in both directions for five hours but remarkably caused no serious injuries, seems to have been a minor problem in the progress. In late July, workers began laying the bridge’s signature feature  —   the thick cables that will attach the main decks at midriver to eight   towers and help firmly brace them like suspenders holding up a pair of trousers. The first of 192 cables, a    cord made up of strands of braided steel, was stretched from the eastern tower of the   span and a projecting section of road deck, locking into anchors built into the deck. By Aug. 1, four cables were strung, in whole or in part. In all, the length of cable used will total roughly 14 miles. To passing travelers, the cables, sheathed in white plastic, might look like strings on a set of eight giant harps. “A   bridge is a perfect mix of form and function,” said Sky Lee, the   engineer supervising the construction of the main spans. “We are using cables to build the bridge, and ultimately it’s what everyone sees: the icon for the bridge. ” If everything goes according to plan, said Jamey Barbas, the engineer orchestrating the entire project for the New York State Thruway Authority, the first section should open to eight lanes of   traffic toward the end of next year. Demolition will then begin on the present Tappan Zee Bridge, which opened in December 1955, built cheaply during Korean War austerity for just $60 million ($531. 5 million in today’s dollars). Its replacement is expected to cost just under $4 billion. Sometime in 2018, seven years after work began, the second section should be finished, carrying four lanes of traffic heading westbound toward Rockland on the northern stretch and four lanes heading east toward Westchester on the southern stretch. Bicyclists and pedestrians will have their own scenic lane, whose terminus, after some controversy, has been shifted from a residential neighborhood to a traffic circle in South Nyack. The bridge is not progressing as fast as the first optimistic schedule had it (the Thruway Authority once said the first span would be ready early next year) but a key to the relatively timely progress has been the strategic decision to prefabricate pieces of the replacement bridge on land, saving months of perilous work above the river. The large steel girders  —   30 miles long in total  —   and 6, 000 concrete roadway panels are assembled 14 miles upriver at Tomkins Cove near Bear Mountain or at Port of Coeymans, 10 miles south of Albany. They are then shipped to the Tappan Zee site by barge, where cranes lift them up and, guided by workers, swing them slowly into place. Much of the concrete needed for piers, foundations, platforms and towers has been poured from floating plants on the river, requiring far fewer trips by truck through residential neighborhoods  —   30, 000 fewer, Ms. Barbas said. On a boat tour the other day, a reporter and photographer could see three barges lined up to deliver steel beams and other modular pieces to crane operators. A team of schedulers synchronize delivery of beams, concrete deck panels, nuts and bolts and other supplies as they are needed. Mr. Lee, a civil engineer, said one challenge of the Tappan Zee’s parallel main spans was that they were “so isolated on the river. ” Other bridges he has worked on, like the replacements of Gulf Coast bridges destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, had far more land access, while the central spans of the new Tappan Zee are in the middle of a    stretch of river. Work requires regular commutes by small boats from Tarrytown and deliveries by barge. “We’re in the middle of the Hudson River, so everything is multiplied by two,” he said. Because the work will take several years, his wife and    sons moved with him to Westchester from the New Orleans area. A classic suspension bridge like the George Washington has cables that are anchored to the shore. A   bridge like the new Tappan Zee has its cables anchored to tall towers, which bear the load. The construction of the four pairs of towers  —   massive   concrete structures each 40 stories tall and leaning outward about 5 degrees  —   use an inventive engineering process that relies on what are called jump forms. The blue steel and wood forms  —   boxlike work rooms without a ceiling  —   allow carpenters and ironworkers to construct the successive concrete segments of each tower, one huge block of steel rebar encased in concrete piled atop another. Then after the concrete block is cured, or hardened, the forms can be elevated on vertical rails attached to the block, so the next block of concrete can be built atop the previous one within a safe enclosed space. The size of each block varies from 12 to 18 feet tall, with those at the top narrower than those at the bottom it takes 26 lifts of a jump form to stack all the blocks for a tower that tops off at 419 feet tall. Though the towers are only   complete, crossbeams have already been extended from one tower to its sidekick to hold up the decks of the main spans. The cables, once pulled taut, will strengthen the grip. Seen from some angles, the towers look like four slender people doing an   yoga exercise. Several holes in which the cables will be anchored are already visible. There will eventually be 12 holes each on flip sides of a tower, which means that 192 cables  —   some 11 inches in diameter, others two feet thick, with the longest segments reaching almost 800 feet  —   will be supporting the main deck. Depending on where it is placed and the weight it must support, a cable can be made up of 30 or 60 or 80 strands of wire, each strand  —     of an inch thick  —   itself made up of seven slim wires braided together. The cables are so heavy and stiff that they need to be threaded through the holes not by human hands but by a cranklike winch. Supervising much of the work on the jump forms and cables are field engineers like Alessandra Rosso of the Bronx and John McCullough of Piermont, N. Y. Two or three times each day, they climb metal staircases to reach work areas in the towers that are 15 stories now and keep getting higher. “If you’re not in shape you get in shape pretty quickly,” Ms. Rosso said. Still, 90 percent of her job is coordinating the ordering and delivery of materials, finding ways to get tools to where they are needed, talking to crane operators who must be nearby to hoist the materials to where they are needed but who must not be left to idle long. “Crane time is like gold around here,” she said. At times the bridge has had two dozen cranes doing various jobs. The one that collapsed, which was using a vibrating hammer to force cylindrical support piles into the river bottom, was quickly replaced. “It’s not going to impact our work,” Ms. Barbas said of the toppled crane. This is Ms. Rosso’s first bridge. She previously worked on the East Side Access project that will connect Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. So she has had to adjust to working at daunting heights in all kinds of weather. “The first time it’s definitely scary, but then it’s just work,” she said. “I think about the task, not the heights. ” Mr. McCullough, who last worked on renovating the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey, seems simply awed by the scale of the job. “This is 400 times bigger, everything is much bigger,” he said. “You have to have a Plan B if Plan A doesn’t work and a Plan C if Plan B doesn’t work. ”",0
11622,Paris: One Year On - The New York Times," The night of Nov. 13, 2015, Islamic State militants attacked eight places in and around Paris, killing 130 people and wounding nearly 500. It was the most lethal attack in France since World War II. Confusion gripped the city as two teams of attackers struck nearly simultaneously. One struck at the Stade de France, just outside Paris, while the other shot up cafes and bars in the hip 10th and 11th Arrondissements. About 20 minutes later, a third team of attackers entered the Bataclan concert hall in the same neighborhood, taking hostages and killing scores. The New York Times interviewed 27 people who witnessed parts of those events and asked them to recount what they experienced: suicide bombs, gunfire, the terror of near death. Two of the people interviewed, the Paris fire chief and the brigade’s chief medical doctor, had a uniquely comprehensive view as they helped oversee the response, shuttling back and forth between the attack sites and their headquarters. The chronology here is taken from an official report on the attacks that was published by a French parliamentary inquiry. These accounts have been edited and condensed. This is the story of the attacks by those who lived through them. A soccer game between the national teams of France and Germany begins at 9 p. m. It is televised and watched by millions. Some 75, 000 people are at the stadium, including President François Hollande, several government ministers and a German delegation. The first bomber explodes his vest outside the stadium at 9:19 p. m. Gen. Philippe Boutinaud, 54 The commander of the Paris Fire Brigade. He had worked at NATO and the European Union in Brussels and had been on missions in Afghanistan and the Balkans. On Nov. 13, he had been invited to watch the game and was not there in an official capacity, but he soon went to work. I was at the Stade de France when the first explosion took place. The thing that stopped me from imagining that this was an attack was that there was no blast. It was like a firecracker. I immediately asked my driver, who was outside, to see what was happening. He had also heard the explosion, he got close, and he told me he believed it was a firecracker. He told me that there was a person wounded in the leg, but at first glance it didn’t seem very serious. There was no one nearby. The first suicide bomber who blew himself up, we don’t know why, but he blew himself up in the middle of nothing. Salim Toorabally, 43 A security guard at the Stade de France. Before the game, he stopped a man trying to force his way into the stadium. Five days later, he learned from the police that the man was one of the suicide bombers. I heard the first explosion. At that point I thought to myself that this wasn’t a smoke bomb and it wasn’t firecrackers. It was much more than that. I looked behind me, toward the interior of the stadium. The president was present, the players, a fair number of important people. And I thought to myself, I hoped that I was wrong. Noël Le Graët, 74 The president of the French Football Federation. He was in the stand along with Mr. Hollande. The president was warned by his services very, very quickly. There was a whole security system around our stand, with a video camera on each gate, so the president was told discreetly to come upstairs to see what was happening. And someone came to tell me: “Don’t move, no need to show panic, but you’re going to meet the president in two minutes, but very calmly, leave with your hands in your pockets so you don’t show any sign of panic. ” 9:22 p. m. A second suicide bomber explodes his vest outside the stadium. Mr. Toorabally  The second explosion was much more violent. I shook, the ground vibrated. I told everybody who was working on the exterior perimeter, my colleagues: “Guys, we are facing an attack. You need to get inside. You need to take shelter. ” Then I saw three people who were wounded, who were being carried by someone. I took the first victim, I put him on the ground. I didn’t have any gloves. He was hurting a lot. I saw a piece of flesh on his pants. I didn’t think that we were being attacked by suicide bombers. I would never have thought that we were going to see this type of attack in France. 9:24 p. m. Within five minutes, General Boutinaud is called by one of his deputies,   Tourtier, the chief doctor for the Paris Fire Brigade, who has received a call himself from the operational headquarters that there were explosions at the Stade de France, as well shootings in central Paris. General Boutinaud The second explosion had just happened, and I still did not have the sense that these were attacks. I exit, because something strange is going on. But when I leave the Stade de France, I stumble on the leg of a suicide bomber. I came across his mangled body, in the middle of nothing. I see the other leg on the other side of the street, and I see the rest of the body to the left and it’s completely twisted. The second striking image was the stuffing from the anorak [one of the bombers was wearing]. The second suicide bomber had blown himself up about 30 or 40 meters to my right, and there was a lot of stuffing from the anorak’s inner lining, a kind of white cotton that the wind was blowing. For me, there are no ifs or buts, it is obvious that these were suicide bombers. Because it was one of the scenarios that we had been working on for many months. Mr. Le Graët  The president asked me to speak to our players and not to tell anyone. And the game must go on because the [Interior] Ministry wanted to secure all exits. My mission was to go down to the locker rooms, make sure there was no television, nothing, not warn anyone. 9:53 p. m. A third explosion occurs near the stadium in front of a McDonald’s. A decision is made not to tell the crowd. The game is allowed to continue and ends about an hour later. Franck Bargine, 47 The announcer at the Stade de France and a radio personality known as Max. He addressed the crowd as it left. In light of external events  —   we keep the vocabulary soft  —   people can leave the stadium and a few exits are closed, and one or two parking lots are not accessible, but for the rest we’re safe, the stadium and the area around is safe. As people are evacuating the stadium, firecrackers go off nearby, and suddenly many in the crowd, aware from text messages and rumors that Paris appears to be under attack, turn and rush back into the stadium, pouring onto the field. General Boutinaud [The Stade de France] is clearly the center of gravity of the terrorist attacks. You don’t send three suicide bombers to blow themselves up in the middle of a crowd if it’s a secondary target. It was the primary objective. We asked that the stadium not be evacuated and that the match continue. It is this decision that avoided a massacre. The third terrorist, he walked around for half an hour, and then he found a target of opportunity, which was a McDonald’s, and, pardon me, but I think he chose a McDonald’s because it embodies America. But what he was waiting for during that   was for us to give the order to evacuate the stadium to blow himself up. I am personally convinced of it. At the Stade de France, sadly, there was one dead and 54 wounded. As a main target for the terrorists, it was a complete failure. 9:24 p. m. The cafe attacks began at Le Carillon bar and Le Petit Cambodge restaurant when a team of three attackers opened fire with   assault weapons, killing 15 people. By coincidence, General Boutinaud, Dr. Tourtier  and other Paris authorities had conducted a drill for a terrorist attack just that morning involving the use of assault weapons in 13 locations.  Dr.   Tourtier, 48 The chief doctor for the Paris Fire Brigade. He was home with his wife and children when the attacks started. I get a phone call telling me there are explosions at the Stade de France, and almost in the same moment, I get a call telling me there is shooting in Paris, and I immediately understand that we are dealing with a complex terror attack. I make two calls. The first one is to General Boutinaud, but he was already aware of the situation. The second call I made is to Professor [Pierre] Carli, the head of the emergency services. I tell him: “Pierre, something peculiar is happening. Prepare yourself to mount a   response. ” Some of the hospitals we contacted, at first, said, “So is this a   to the drill we did this morning?” So we had to tell them that ‘no’ this was definitely real. 9:26 p. m.  The three attackers quickly drive on and shoot at the terraces of the Casa Nostra pizzeria and of the Café Bonne Bière in the 11th Arrondissement, killing five more.   Triomphe, 58 A former civil servant in the Labor Ministry. He went to the Café Bonne Bière because he thought it would be a quiet place for a drink with a friend, and was wounded there. When I got to the cafe, the waiter asked me if I wanted to be on the terrace outside or inside, and since it was a mild night, I said at first the terrace, and I don’t know why, but at the moment when I sat down I said, “No, actually, I prefer inside. ” Each time I say to myself, that saved my life. The people who died at La Bonne Bière were those who were on the terrace. Me, I was just by the window. About 9:30 p. m. General Boutinaud leaves the Stade de France to go to the Fire Department’s operational headquarters, which answered 580 calls in the first   after the attacks began. Trailing in the wake of the attackers, his deputy, Dr. Tourtier, arrives at Rue Bichat, the crossroads where the carnage took place at Le Carillon bar and Le Petit Cambodge. Dr. Tourtier I find a sight close to one that I could have seen as a military doctor with a combat company under fire in Afghanistan or the Sahel with this small difference, which is that the public is not protected. So some wounds are extremely serious. We were walking on bullet cartridges from Kalashnikovs. There are already many dead, and we had to organize the chaos to do the best job possible. Mr. Triomphe The former civil servant, who was wounded at La Bonne Bière. I remember I was lying down, and I saw someone in white. For that reason, I thought it was an angel. [It was an Italian doctor.] She put on tourniquets to stop the bleeding, because I was still losing blood. She used napkins. She was the only doctor there, and she was very busy. The three attackers continue driving south through the 11th Arrondissement to another cafe, La Belle Équipe.  Mandy Palmucci, 34 An American  internet technology consultant. She had been in Nice to run a marathon, and then spent a couple of nights in Paris with her two best friends and the sister of one of her friends. At about 8:30, we went to a restaurant on the Rue de Charonne, Clamato, to put our names in. At about 8:45, 9:00, they told us they would call us in about 30 minutes when they had a table ready. And so we wandered down to the Belle Équipe to have a drink. Someone happened to notice a table on the patio, basically right next to the entry into the restaurant. It had three chairs, so we sat down. Myself and one of my friends shared a chair. At 9:35, the phone rang, and it was the restaurant saying our table was ready. 9:36 p. m. The shooters arrive. The carnage at La Belle Équipe is the worst of any at bars and cafes that night, leaving 19 dead.  Ms. Palmucci I did not see anybody because my back was to the street, but we heard a bunch of popping noises. I glanced to my right and began to see flashes. It was the gunfire. I apparently screamed, “Get down!” and the four of us dropped to the ground. I remember linking my arm with one of my friend’s arms and one with the other one. And every time somebody shot, feeling them shake, and I must have been shaking, too. I thought they were being hit with bullets because their bodies were jerking. They shot at us for 90 seconds, and there was a     pause and then they resumed shooting. In that pause, people were screaming. Just  —   I still remember the screams  —   and I remember thinking: Stop screaming or they’re going to keep shooting because they are going to know people are still alive on this patio. But they shot for another 60 seconds, and the screaming had decreased at that point. Listen to the owner of La Belle Équipe, Grégory Reibenberg, whose wife was killed, talk about returning to the bar after the attacks in a 360 video. François Vauglin, 46 The mayor of the 11th Arrondissement. It was an elected colleague, who lives above La Belle Équipe, who called me. “Listen, François, this is very serious: There are gunshots in the street. The people are wailing. It’s very serious. ” I called the commissioner of police, and I said: “I am going to go there. Apparently, there’s gunfire. ” The commissioner said to me: “No, no, no. Above all, don’t go to that place. The situation has not been stabilized. “Come to the Police Headquarters. ” General Boutinaud directs the emergency response from the Fire Department’s headquarters, receiving constant updates from fire companies on the scene.  The gunmen flee, but one goes into the nearby Comptoir Voltaire, a cafe.  General Boutinaud One of them blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire. We started to give him a heart massage. We hadn’t understood that he was a terrorist. The explosives had not completely blown up. His leg had been ripped off. When our guys opened his jacket to start the heart massage, they saw the electrical wiring. That’s when they understood that he was a suicide bomber. 9:40 p. m. The final set of three attackers arrive at the Bataclan, where an American band, the  Eagles of Death Metal, took the stage around 8:45 p. m. before a    crowd of about 1, 500 people. One attacker was killed by police officers who arrived within 15 minutes of when they opened fire on the crowd. Two attackers retreated upstairs with hostages. In all, 90 people were killed.  Audrey Guiny, 25 A stretcher carrier for ambulances. She went to the concert with two friends. She was wounded so badly that she has been unable to return to work. I don’t remember anymore what the first songs were, but they were just super great. The atmosphere was very good, very joyous. I had my telephone in my hands to take photos, and I was receiving notifications from Le Parisien [a newspaper] that told me that there was shooting not far away. I said to my friend who was on one side of me, “Ah, there’s gunfire not far from here,” and she said to me: “We’re not at risk. We’re in a concert hall. ” Aurelia Gilbert, 43 A worker for a Swedish security company. She has two daughters, ages 13 and 15. She went to the concert with a friend. At around 9:40 at the end of the sixth song, “Kiss the Devil,” during the guitar solo we heard what sounded like a firecracker. But I knew it was not a firecracker. I knew right away it was a gunshot. Then I heard screaming coming from behind me, more gunshots and people screaming. The guys from the band froze, and the lead guitarist and singer disappeared. Julian Dorio, 34 The drummer for Eagles of Death Metal. This tour was the first time he had played with them. I heard and felt the gunfire at first. I didn’t see it initially. We were near the end of playing a song when the rounds of gunfire began, but at the time we weren’t sure what it was. One thing that will always stand out was how powerful it was. As a loud rock ’n’ roll band, there’s not much that’s louder than us. I’ll never forget how small we felt. It dwarfed the band. I was surprised I wasn’t hit, because as a drummer on a riser I’m a sitting duck. Ms. Guiny I heard noise behind me, I realized that this was gunfire. My reaction was to pull my two friends to the floor. I turned my head to be aware of what was going on. I clearly saw the terrorist with his gun. Ms. Gilbert The main entrance to the Bataclan was at our backs and I turned around, and I saw some white flashes and heard the noise of machine guns, and dived to the floor. I told my friend and his daughter to get down. My friend said, “It must be a firecracker. ” I yelled: “No! Get down on the floor! Now!” Then we heard more screaming and the sound of gun shots. I was lying on the floor and people were lying alongside me. I turned my head and saw one of them reloading his gun. I saw him clearly and was able to later identify him at the police station. We couldn’t go backward toward the main entrance and the street because the gunmen came from there. We couldn’t go toward the concert pit. So we began to crawl toward a nearby door that led to the beginning of a staircase and several staff rooms. The stairs led to the balcony. I thought to myself: I am going to die today. But if I was going to die, I preferred to die moving than to die on the floor. Ms. Guiny They shot the first magazine, and then they reloaded. For us, it went on for an eternity: It was five or 10 minutes. We saw people next to us dying. We heard the sounds. We knew everything. I knew that right next to us there was death. He was reloading. It was now or never. Except it was based just on the terrorist that was aiming in our direction. Mr. Dorio I moved off the drum riser to my left so I could take cover behind some of the guitar amps. I’ll never forget looking up and seeing the first half of the audience coming towards the stage, and the back half I couldn’t see at all. In a matter of seconds, those people had hit the floor or they are running and trampling each other. It was awful. It’s at this point I can see the shooters firing aimlessly into the crowd. I looked out, and I saw some stuff that you can’t unsee. I saw the most unpleasant things I’d ever seen in my life. Daniel Psenny, 59 A journalist who writes about television for Le Monde and lives on the opposite side of the small street, the Passage    that runs alongside the Bataclan. It’s 35 years that I’ve lived here. At the end of the concerts, the artists leave by the emergency exit, and often the spectators, the fans, come to the artists’ exit. There is a bit of a scrum. I heard gunfire. I understood that it was gunfire and not fireworks. I was curious. I called the newspaper and said: “I want to alert you that there is something very serious happening at the Bataclan. People are dead. ” By reflex, I told myself I am going to film what’s happening. Listen to Mr. Psenny talk about the night of the attack in a 360 video outside the Bataclan. Ms. Guiny There were many of us, and we got up, but just then, we took fire from the other side. A person who was behind me fell on top of me, and I found myself back on the floor. I fell with him to the ground, because at that moment I was wounded and he was wounded, too. It was my left foot. Mr. Dorio I just started to crawl. I was flat on my stomach with my chin on the stage as low as I could get behind the drum riser. As I got across the stage, I was close enough to the stage door to hop up while the shooters were reloading. I made some wrong turns, but eventually I found an exterior metal door  —   the only way out  —   and braced myself even in that billionth of a second for there to be shooters outside. I didn’t hesitate  —   that wasn’t an option. Once I pushed open the door, there’s a side alley, and it was chaos. You can hear the gunfire. They are trying to hit people that are exiting. I remember people turning to help and asking, “Are you O. K.?” “Let’s go” and “Run. ” You see how kind and compassionate everyone is even though we’re all at risk. 9:57 p. m. Police officers, armed only with handguns, kill one of the terrorists. Mr. Psenny I was making the video from my window, trying to understand what was happening. The people would come out of the Bataclan, fall down. There was gunfire, cries. There was a father calling for his son: “Oscar, Oscar. ” There were neighbors helping the wounded. It was a war, really, not a fight. I went downstairs very carefully. I looked to see what was happening. It was a desolate landscape with many bodies lying there, some people who cried still, who were wounded. Just to the right of the entry hall, I see a man who is close. Afterward, I will know to call him Matthew and that he is American. Was he dead? Is he still living? I didn’t know. I touched him. I sense he’s alive. He speaks to me. He says something I don’t understand. A man wearing black helps me drag him into the entry hall of my building. In closing the door, I lean out a little bit to see what’s going on. It was then that I took a bullet. Afterward, I realized it was a bullet, but at the time, it burned me. It was like a firecracker had exploded on my arm. Ms. Gilbert Trying to reach an exit from the orchestra pit. When they stopped a second time to reload, someone said: “Go! Go! Go! We have to go! They are coming upstairs!” I saw two of them climbing the main stairs. People around me were dropping as they shot. There was a wounded guy on his back, and I tried to grab him. I screamed. It was 15 meters to the door, but it felt like it took hours to get there. There were 20 of us moving at that moment and 50 people on the [side] stairs when we finally arrived. A security guard told us there was no exit. When we looked back, we saw people lying on the floor. I remember yelling: “You have to move. You have to come join us. ” But they didn’t move. Before I shut the door, I saw two of the gunmen, and they were targeting individuals and shooting them. When I finally shut the door, I had the first feeling of security. 11:30 p. m. General Boutinaud, Dr. Tourtier and other members of the emergency services arrive at the Bataclan. Ms. Gilbert  At 11:30 p. m. we heard a lot of people moaning and crying and crying for help. We waited. Dr. Matthieu Langlois, 46 The chief doctor for the special police unit, known by its French initials, RAID, that responds to terrorist attacks and hostage situations. He had been at a jazz concert with his wife when he got the call for duty.  We enter the Bataclan with the RAID assault team. We are at the back of the column. I immediately see victims everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. In the lobby of the Bataclan, the entrance is strewn with victims, but my job is not to stop at the first victims but to have a comprehensive idea of what is going on. General Boutinaud When I entered the Bataclan, we found 78 bodies, when I went in the first time. But these were people who, the vast majority, were wounded with immediately deadly injuries. I am not a forensic doctor  —   but these were bullets to the head, in the lungs, with massive hemorrhages. Things that you can’t stop with a tourniquet. Dr. Langlois I am told that there are two terrorists and that they have an explosive. I tell my commander that I want to evacuate the [orchestra] pit, and they give me the authorization and tell me it’s secure and that in any case they’ll cover me. So they put shooters at the four corners of the pit. We were applying tourniquets and compressive bandages and treating collapsed lungs. There was also the human aspect where we were talking to the victims to explain to them what we were doing. Saying, “I’m a doctor, my name is Matthieu, we’re going to get you out of here. ” I remember the looks in their eyes, the words of some of the victims. One of the first things I did when I got to the pit was to shout  —   I have a loud voice that carries  —   “All the victims who can move on their own, please stand up and come over here. ” Unfortunately, all those who could move had either already fled or had hidden. Ms. Gilbert At around midnight, people heard the cops knocking at the door. People were asking, “Should we open the door?” The terrorists had gone to the bathroom where people were hiding and pretended to be special forces. So it was not obvious what to do. They opened the door, and we left to go through the exit near the stage. I saw the cops, and one was young and he looked so scared. I took one girl with me and told her to put her hands on her eyes. I walked through the central area near the stage, and it was war. Young people had been dancing two hours earlier, but now there was blood everywhere. It was horrible. Mr. Vauglin The mayor. I arrived [at Police Headquarters] to see televisions screens with images of the video protection [security cameras] of Paris that are connected to the police and that have   of what was happening in different places. Then there was this whiteboard, and it had all the sites listed on it and then columns for absolute emergency, relative emergency and dead. It seemed surreal to me. There were perhaps more people in the column “deceased,” at least at the beginning, than the other columns. General Boutinaud Inside the Bataclan. I will always live with the fact that I saw ringing cellphones that said “Papa,” “Maman,” on the dead. But the parents, they will have to live with the lasting loss of their loved ones. 12:18 a. m. The French police start their assault on the two attackers who had retreated upstairs with hostages. Both are killed, all the hostages are freed, and a police officer is seriously wounded when one of the assailants detonates his explosive vest. Antoine Leiris, 35 A father who lost his wife, Hélène   during the Bataclan attack, leaving him alone to raise their    son, Melvil. France is still recovering. There is a real threat and a legitimate fear. Everyone feels it. This fear is there, and it is rational. These are isolated acts, but we know that behind them there are also more   attacks being prepared. It is a reality. But we seldom say how remarkable it is that people are going on with their lives, and overcoming that fear. Taking the Metro, going to cafes to drink a beer, to concerts or shows  —   because Paris is still full of life. I don’t think we say enough how courageous this is.",0

11624,What If….,"all 30,000 of the “missing” Hillary emails are on Weiner’s laptop, plus hundreds of thousands more that were deliberately ditched and we never knew existed in the first place, evidencing not only lying about the content of the 30,000 emails but the existence of hundreds of thousands more?
What if among the authenticated email traffic is John Podesta saying, just days before the Clinton campaign was compelled to produce said material they they had to “dump those emails”, apparently proving intent to obstruct justice?
What if all of the emails that came from big public cloud providers are provably, to a near-forensic standard, to be exactly as WikiLeaks has presented them and could not have been tampered with because those providers digitally sign every email that comes from them and those signatures all validate back against those cloud providers, and those emails are thus in fact already known to be authentic?
What if the evidence on that laptop adds to the already known fact that Bill Clinton took a number of trips on Epstein’s “Lolita Express” aircraft, some of them after dismissing his Secret Service detail, and implicates what was about to, or did, happen on those trips?
What if the evidence on that laptop shows that Hillary was present on at least one of those trips and either knew about or participated in those acts?
What if the evidence shows that the Clinton Foundation operated as a major pay-to-play operation and national security interests were implicated such as, for example, in the sale of uranium to the Russians. 
What if some of the “pay to play” activity involves nations we have a sketchy relationship with or even those that are under some sort of active embargo, but the Foundation was able to “get around”?
What if these “pay to play” activities implicate federal Racketeering and/or bribery statutes?
What if some of the “pay to play” activity involves nations that have been implicated in international Muslim terrorism, arguably therefore rising to the act of treason since by our own government’s own statements we are in a war against said international terrorism?
What if the Clintons actively conspired with Loretta Lynch to obstruct the ongoing investigations including but not limited to Bill Clinton’s “chat about family matters” aboard Lynch’s aircraft, a meeting for which no minutes or recording has been produced for the public?
What if for the first time in known history of FBI and DOJ investigations of such serious conduct with national security implications utterly nobody was served with a subpoena, nobody had evidence seized and material witnesses were allowed to corroborate and be present when others were testifying, and those acts were undertaken by the DOJ for the explicit purpose of both crippling the investigation and preventing a Grand Jury from seeing and judging the evidence in the case?
What if the FBI Deputy Director who headed up — and is still in charge of — the Hillary email server investigation has a wife who received nearly $700,000 in political contributions from a major Clinton operative and yet despite this clear and publicly-known conflict of interest has not recused himself or been forced to step aside? 
What if James Comey was browbeaten into making a public announcement that was beyond his legal authority (that “no reasonable prosecutor” would indict) through political pressure but upon being presented with the new evidence on Weiner’s laptop he couldn’t stand by his previous decision because this new evidence made him sick to his stomach, convinced him that the damage to this nation was so severe that we might not survive it — or both? 
What if it turns out that Hillary’s campaign cheated multiple times during the primary season when it came to being fed debate questions and other means of tampering with the primary election process, denying her primary opponent a fair election?
What if Hillary should have never been nominated in the first place due to her cheating in the primaries and the race should be “Trump .vs. Sanders”? What does that say about the legitimacy of the upcoming election if one candidate on the ballot cheated to get there and is thus not legitimately entitled to stand for election in the general at all? 
What if the evidence shows how people “divested” and transferred financial interest in foreign firms so as to evade federal reporting requirements that would have otherwise triggered scrutiny on some of the Foundation’s deals?
What if Friday afternoon comes and goes, Saturday, Sunday and Monday come and go, all or a sufficiently-damning group of the above turn out to be true and as a result the person who was at the center of all of these things stands to be able to pardon herself and everyone else associated with what would be, quite-arguably, the most outrageous series of acts of public corruption in our nation’s history? 
That we are here, just a few days before an election, that we have a DOJ that has actively obstructed the investigation for at least months if not longer and has a history of doing this during Obama’s Presidency, including I remind you with “Fast-n-Furious” where a whole bunch of people got killed as a result of our government’s illegal gun-running is an outrage.
The only thing more-outrageous than what has already happened would be if we were to get to Monday night, on the eve of voting, and all of those “What Ifs” up above remained unanswered.
Oh wait, I tricked you and I admit it — some of those “what ifs” — including some truly damning ones — have already been answered in the affirmative. 
If you know the answers to any of the remaining questions — not a belief of what the answers might be but you are in possession of hard facts that prove any of the above, either in the positive or negative, you have a duty to this Republic and the people in it to make those answers known. 
If you do not then you stand as equally responsible for every “Yes” answer that is ultimately proved, and the harm that comes to this Republic as a consequence.

11625,"Chaiwali, an Indian Restaurant That Feels Like Home - The New York Times","Greeting us when we walked into Chaiwali, the Indian restaurant she runs on the first two floors of her brownstone in Harlem, Anita Trehan had two tables to offer. All the others were taken. It was a busy Friday night. “I have this long wood table here,” she said. “Or,” she continued, extending one arm toward the foot of the staircase leading to a   dining room, “I have this beautiful little marble table right there. ” She sounded as if it were a prize she had been saving for the first people she thought would appreciate it. Now, this table sits in a tight corner. Its edges are deeply scalloped, so once our samosas and smoked eggplant arrived, it became clear that the marble surface was even smaller than it looked. But by that point, it didn’t matter. The owner, who is also the chef, the decorator and the occupant of the house’s upper stories, had proudly seated us at a piece of furniture she had bought and placed there because she liked the way it looked. What were we going to do but settle in and see what else she wanted to share with us? This must be one reason large, diverse crowds have descended on Chaiwali since it opened last year despite its fairly low profile outside the neighborhood. So many restaurants that draw more publicity seem interchangeable: Nobody would notice if they traded menu items, light fixtures or any employees short of the chef. Chaiwali does not always have their caliber of professionalism servers are genial but may forget dishes, and when it’s time to clear the table, they may disappear into the vapor. But it does have its own way of looking at the world. Ms. Trehan seems to have built the restaurant on the belief that the things she likes will make the rest of us happy, too. You see this in eccentric bits of decoration, like the stuffed peacock that perches on the upstairs bar. The whole second floor is a bit of a peacock there’s also a taxidermied antelope head and a flamboyant mural of a tigress and butterflies. A wall of glass looks out over Lenox Avenue, but the real scenery is inside. The downstairs dining room is calmer, with an intricate pattern traced on the exposed brick walls and a row of windows facing the garden, where a big communal table sits inside what looks like a giant birdcage. Maybe the peacock used to live there. The menu feels personal, too. It reminds me of the relaxed,   modern food that Americans with roots in India, like Ms. Trehan, may cook at home. Her recipes probably aren’t her grandmother’s, but she pays attention to the quality and balance of saffron, fenugreek, ginger and coriander. What comes out of her kitchen looks attractive, but it hasn’t been whipped into stiff peaks of   artiness. I could imagine being invited to a dinner party where Chaiwali’s smoked eggplant dip, full of garlic and juicy black olives, was put out with hot sheets of flatbread while everybody limbered up over cocktails. “Just Samosas,” as the menu calls them, might appear next. They have a   filling with a decidedly peppery bite. It’s a treat to find samosa wrappers as thin and greaseless as these in a restaurant. In the winter, the first course could be Chaiwali’s silky carrot soup, intensely flavored with saffron and a few fried curry leaves that float on the surface. In summer, maybe the appetizer would be the Goa shrimp ceviche, sweetened with little cubes of mango the host would tell everybody to dump the little saucer of puffed rice and fried threads of chickpea flour over the top for crunch. Then, if you were in luck, she might carry vindaloo lamb chops to the table, having marinated the meat with vinegar for tenderness and ginger for flavor. Chaiwali makes vindaloo with complexity and nuance, nothing like the   the color of a rusted tailpipe served in generic Indian restaurants. It comes with potatoes softly roasted with whole mustard seeds, a recipe that I am going to steal. Other main courses can expose the kitchen’s vulnerabilities. The small pieces of black pepper chicken were dry both times I tried the dish. The pool of lightly curried tomato gravy helped, though, and I enjoyed the nutty and firm red quinoa served in place of the traditional rice. The okra fries served with the excellent sautéed fish, seasoned with mustard seeds and herbs, then dredged in a delicate   batter, sounded great in theory. In practice, their crust was going soggy one night, and while it was quite crisp and hot on another, some of the long green pods, cut lengthwise, were a little stringy. Still, I’d order either dish again, which I wouldn’t say about the Desi pasta, which changes night to night but which, when I met up with it, was tossed with a   sauce. I remember nothing about it except the color, which I’d call  . The clever veggie burger, a tall fritter of kale pakora with avocado, lettuce and tomato on a bun, made a more appealing meatless dinner. Desserts find a happy medium between too basic and too complicated. The one called Alice’s Jamaican rum and biscuit pudding tastes something like a tiramisù spiked with booze. Mango whipped with yogurt and goat cheese is like a lassi turned into a mousse. (There’s an actual mango lassi on the drinks menu, and it’s good, too.) The one dessert that scared me was the one I liked best: the curry cumin cookies. These little   bites, crumbly like shortbreads, are refreshing and bright, with a black pepper finish that took me by surprise in the best way. The cookies worked a small miracle that nothing else has ever accomplished: They actually made me want a cup of chai. But the chai at Chaiwali is not the lukewarm broth of dirty milk in a paper cup that you get in coffee shops. It is a potent   drink, like a cortado made with strong black tea and spices. It was Ms. Trehan’s desire for a cup of chai made the Indian way, the way she used to enjoy it in Delhi, that drove her to open Chaiwali. Of the many reasons people have for starting a restaurant, the desire to serve something they themselves want to eat and drink is one of the best.",0
11626,‘Nothing Short of a Miracle’: No Serious Injuries in Tappan Zee Crane Collapse - The New York Times,"In the ambitious business of New York bridge building, it has been a tragic consequence of the work: More than 20 people, including the bridge’s lead engineer, lost their lives during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. As workers raised the   Bridge in the 1960s, three people paid the ultimate price. And during construction of the original Tappan Zee Bridge in the 1950s, a worker fell to his death. But when a large crane being used to construct what will eventually be the aging Tappan Zee’s replacement came toppling down on Tuesday, landing squarely across the roadway, something astounding happened: Nobody died. “This was nothing short of a miracle,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at an afternoon news conference in Tarrytown at the base of the bridge, citing the lack of serious injuries from the accident. At least four people received minor injuries in the collapse, including three motorists who were trying to avoid the crane, officials said. A construction worker was also injured, officials said. The crane, one of 28 being used in the construction of the bridge’s $3. 9 billion  replacement  —   what is being called the largest infrastructure project in the country  —   fell around noon on the Rockland County side of the bridge, the authorities said. No vehicles were struck by the crane, the authorities said. Irving Martinez, a truck driver from New Haven, was heading home after delivering a load of cars in Blauvelt, N. Y. when, from about a quarter of a mile away, he saw the crane list and topple. “The crane was rotating normally and then it just suddenly fell sideways onto the highway,” Mr. Martinez, 25, said. “It was out of nowhere. ” While most drivers hit the brakes, he said, others accelerated to avoid the crash. “You know New Yorkers,” he quipped. “Always in a hurry. ” Aerial images showed the crane draped across all lanes of the bridge, its frame splintered into pieces as traffic was brought to a standstill. With the bridge blocked, many motorists were stranded for several hours. Some took to social media to document the travail. The collapse raised concerns about the integrity of the Tappan Zee Bridge, the state’s longest, which is used by 138, 000 vehicles traveling between Rockland and Westchester Counties on weekdays. Built on the cheap, it was designed to last for only 50 years. And it also snarled traffic along the New York State Thruway, which traverses the bridge, and feeder roads. Traffic was blocked on Interstate 287 heading west toward Rockland at least as far as the Sprain Brook Parkway exit, as well as on the Thruway heading east toward Westchester. The Tappan Zee Express Bus Service, which transports commuters between Westchester and Rockland, was suspended, as officials rearranged transit schedules and other road availabilities. But after officials inspected the bridge, they gradually reopened all of its lanes except for one southbound lane. Mr. Cuomo described the damage to that lane as significant but not extensive, saying it could take days to repair. Officials said the crane, which was new, was engaged in a routine task  —   wielding a vibratory hammer to install pilings. “This was not one of the   operations of bridge building,” Mr. Cuomo said. Jeff J. Loughlin, the business manager of International Union of Operating Engineers Local 137, which represents the crane’s operator, said the crane was an MLC 300 manufactured by Manitowoc Cranes. An official said the crane’s boom was 256 feet long. Mr. Loughlin said the operator remained at the scene with a union representative, and was expected to undergo drug and alcohol testing. “It’s a miracle that the boom fell across six lanes of traffic, cars that are doing 60 to 70 miles an hour, and not one car was hit by the boom,” Mr. Loughlin said. Officials said they were investigating the cause of the crane’s crash. But they ruled out the wind. There have been no deaths or serious injuries involving bridge workers since construction began on the new Tappan Zee Bridge in 2013. Mr. Cuomo said that the project’s track record had been extraordinary for an undertaking of its size but noted that “things happen. ” “Somebody will drop a hammer,” he said. While Mr. Cuomo said that four people were injured in Tuesday’s accident, Ed Day, the Rockland County executive, said that five people suffered minor injuries. The crane’s collapse drew new focus to the construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge. The bridge, which is being built just north of the old bridge and is scheduled to be completed in 2018, has been mentioned by Mr. Cuomo as well as President Obama as an exemplary infrastructure project. On Monday during an event in Brooklyn, Mr. Cuomo praised the process used to contract the bridge’s construction out to private companies. But Mr. Cuomo said on Tuesday afternoon that the accident did not jeopardize the new bridge’s construction or its time frame for completion. He said it was a lucky break that the crane fell in the middle of the day when traffic was lighter. Victor Fargas, 57, a glass worker from the Bronx who had to delay some of his jobs after getting stuck in the traffic, decided to pass the time by taking a nap in his truck. “Now I’m doing all I can do,” he said, “patiently waiting and praying to the traffic gods. ”",0
11627,What You Should Watch: ‘Please Like Me’ and Films Leaving Netflix - The New York Times,"Welcome to Watching, The New York Times’s    guide. We comb through releases big and small, famous and esoteric, to email readers twice a week with our timely recommendations. Our most recent suggestions also appear below. To receive our guide straight to your inbox, sign up here. I know   seasons are increasingly de rigueur, and lots of European series have even fewer episodes than that, but I still feel a little robbed when season finales come this quickly after season premieres. This is it for “Veep?” We’ve only just begun! This weekend I’ll be watching several   events  —   United States gymnastics championships, swimming and diving trials  —   because I am a total Olympics nut. Televise more, NBC! I’d watch judo. I’d watch preliminary javelin rounds. I’d watch mascot tryouts. If you have any questions you’d like to see answered here (for either me or Watching film writer Monica Castillo) we’d love to hear them: watching@nytimes. com. “Please Like Me,” on Hulu Watch if you like thoughtful, observational comedy and    stories. The show’s creator Josh Thomas stars as a loose version of himself in this extraordinarily lovable Australian comedy about a college student who has just come out. He’s dealing with doofy roommates, a suicidal mother and his own (sweet) awkwardness. If you like “My Mad Fat Diary,” or if you wish quirky indie movies had more developed stories, try “Please Like Me. ” There’s even a cute dog. Hulu currently has 16   episodes but 26 have aired in Australia. “Center Stage: On Pointe,” Saturday, 8 p. m. Lifetime. Watch if you like dance movies or Peter Gallagher when he’s angry. When “Center Stage” came out in 2000, who among us would have guessed it would spawn two     . This one, arriving eight years after “Center Stage: Turn It Up” aired on Oxygen, follows in its predecessors’   footsteps: It’s heavy on dance and light on convincing dialogue. If you are expecting highbrow greatness, let’s step aside and have a little talk about looking for love in all the wrong places. But if you are in search of several   montages, shot after shot of muscular legs and the kinds of dirty looks you typically only encounter on a   Mexican telenovela, this is your jam. “The Bureau,” available on iTunes, where the first episode is free. Watch if you like foreign thrillers and slow burns. This French series centers on a spy (Mathieu Kassovitz, “Amélie”) who returns home to Paris after six years undercover in Syria. Six years that included a serious love affair with someone he’s not quite ready to say goodbye to. There’s also another agent who has disappeared under strange circumstances, a daughter who’s not sure what to make of her   father and agency   who may or may not be supporting his best interests. My partner and I routinely struggle with what to watch. One of our favorite shows ever was “The Comeback. ” Lisa Kudrow’s   character was nothing short of amazing (and somehow she pulled off being simultaneously funny and sad all at once). Is there any other    show type thing that you’d suggest for us? Or any show with that same awkward sense of humor?  —   Patrick You seek “BoJack Horseman. ” And not just because Lisa Kudrow is in Season 2, though there’s also that. The Netflix animated series is about a   ‘90s sitcom star with severe depression and a pathological need to be liked, but from afar like Valerie Cherish, BoJack has this gasping desperation, and it’s not clear how much of that is the fallout from them no longer being famous and how much of it is what made them want to be famous in the first place. The first six episodes of “BoJack” lay the groundwork for what the show grows into, so don’t write it off early. Trust me. In terms of the     there’s a whole Christmas Special that’s an episode of BoJack’s T. G. I. F.  show “Horsin’ Around. ” (Watch on Netflix) If you like your comedies with a serious dose of pathos, you might like “Getting On,” about the staff and patients of a hospital’s geriatric wing. It’s less cruel than “The Comeback,” but just as open with its characters’ frustrations. There’s a British original and an American adaptation, and both are great if you can handle sad humor. (Watch on HBOGo or see the British version on Hulu.) If you like stress humor, I’m going to assume you’ve seen “Curb Your Enthusiasm. ” So finally, if you like shows that are comfortable with discomfort  —   and don’t mind or maybe even enjoy that internal scream of “aaaahhh, no, oh God”  —   try “Nathan for You. ” The host Nathan Fielder “helps” small businesses by coming up with nutty, often completely absurd marketing schemes, but it’s never totally clear who is on the inside of this inside joke. I’m cringing just thinking about it. (Watch on Hulu.) • Most soccer fans already know, but the Copa América finals will see Argentina facing off against Chile. (8 p. m. Fox Sports 1, Univision, and Univision Deportes) • The 2013   “Dancing on the Edge,” about jazz in 1930s London and starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matthew Goode, makes its way to public broadcasting. (Part 1, 8 p. m. PBS) • It’s Shark Week. Things kick off with specials about tiger sharks and mako sharks before finally getting to the great whites. (8, 9 and 10 p. m. Discovery Channel) • “Game of Thrones,” “Veep” and “Silicon Valley” all air their season finales. Each show has already been renewed fret not. “Vinyl,” on the other hand . .. (9, 10, and 10:30 p. m. HBO) • “Ray Donovan” has its Season 4 premiere. (9 p. m. Showtime) • Alec Baldwin hosts the latest attempt to revive “The Match Game. ” (10 p. m. ABC) • “Roadies,” Cameron Crowe’s cloying new show starring Luke Wilson, about rock ’n’ roll roadies on tour, premieres. (10 p. m. Showtime) It may be the beginning of summer, but with all of these movies disappearing from HBO and Netflix, I don’t see myself at the beach quite yet. Get around to these titles that have been sitting in your queue before they’re gone late next week.  —   Monica Castillo Netflix (titles expiring July 1) A League of Their Own: Sadly, the Rockford Peaches are ending their season just as the weather is warming up, but this movie is a perennial choice if you’re looking for a   . Geena Davis stars in this fictionalized retelling of the inaugural season of the   Girls Professional Baseball League, with all the heartbreak and good cheer of a classic sports movie. Remember, “there’s no crying in baseball!” (Watch on Netflix) Best in Show: Focusing his signature mockumentary lens on another wacky realm, the director Christopher Guest (“Waiting for Guffman”) ropes in a large cast of characters for an absurd look at a regional dog show. The dogs prove to be better behaved than their owners, some of who are busy taking their pet to therapy or hiding affairs with their trainer. This is a perfect companion for dog lovers with a sense of humor. Adorable pups  . (Watch on Netflix) The Quiet Man: John Wayne ditches the cowboy hat to go    with a fiery Maureen O’Hara in the Irish countryside. In this 1952 romance, Wayne leaves America for Ireland to reclaim his family home when he falls for the Irish lass next door portrayed by O’Hara. (Watch on Netflix) Also: “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “Bulworth,” “The Central Park Five” HBO (titles expiring June 30) Malcolm X: Before Ava DuVernay put Martin Luther King Jr. ’s story on the big screen with “Selma,” Spike Lee gave King’s contemporary a more sprawling biopic treatment. Denzel Washington would earn an Oscar nomination for his performance as the title character. (Watch on HBO) One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest: If you find yourself feeling a little anarchic and want a movie to match, try this one before it escapes. Jack Nicholson pours all of his manic energy into the character of Randle Patrick McMurphy, a provocateur in a mental institution challenging every authority figure in sight. But he may have met his match in the chilling Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). (Watch on HBO) What We Do in The Shadows: This offbeat mockumentary follows a houseful of vampires as they cope with the modern world. The brainchild of “Flight of the Conchords” star Jemaine Clement and his frequent collaborator Taika Waititi looks at the lives of the undead with witty, deadpan humor. (Watch on HBO) Also: “The Godfather Epic,” “Pretty in Pink,” “Music and Lyrics”",0
11628,Donald Trump’s New York Times Interview: Full Transcript - The New York Times,"Following is a transcript of   Donald J. Trump’s interview on Tuesday with reporters, editors and opinion columnists from The New York Times. The transcription was prepared by Liam Stack, Jonah Engel Bromwich, Karen Workman and Tim Herrera of The Times. More on the Trump transition here. ARTHUR SULZBERGER Jr. publisher of The New York Times: Thank you very much for joining us. And I want to reaffirm this is on the record. DONALD J. TRUMP,   of the United States: O. K. SULZBERGER: All right, so we’re clear. We had a very nice meeting in the Churchill Room. You’re a Churchill fan, I hear? TRUMP: I am, I am. SULZBERGER: There’s a photo of the great man behind you. TRUMP: There was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the Oval Office. SULZBERGER: I heard you’re thinking of putting it back. TRUMP: I am, indeed. I am. SULZBERGER: Wonderful. So we’ve got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists. I just want to say we had a good, quiet, but useful and   conversation in there. So I appreciate that very much. TRUMP: I appreciate it, too. SULZBERGER: I thought maybe I’d start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions you’re going to get this administration. [laughter] TRUMP: O. K. Well, I just appreciate the meeting and I have great respect for The New York Times. Tremendous respect. It’s very special. Always has been very special. I think I’ve been treated very rough. It’s well out there that I’ve been treated extremely unfairly in a sense, in a true sense. I wouldn’t only complain about The Times. I would say The Times was about the roughest of all. You could make the case The Washington Post was bad, but every once in a while I’d actually get a good article. Not often, Dean, but every once in awhile. Look, I have great respect for The Times, and I’d like to turn it around. I think it would make the job I am doing much easier. We’re working very hard. We have great people coming in. I think you’ll be very impressed with the names. We’ll be announcing some very shortly. Everybody wanted to do this. People are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks. But they’re giving up a lot. I mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is. But I think we’re going to see some tremendous talent, tremendous talent coming in. We have many people for every job. I mean no matter what the job is, we have many incredible people. I think, Reince, you can sort of just confirm that. The quality of the people is very good. REINCE PRIEBUS, Mr. Trump’s choice for chief of staff: [inaudible] TRUMP: We’re trying very hard to get the best people. Not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people, because that hasn’t been working. So we have really experts in the field. Some are known and some are not known, but they’re known within their field as being the best. That’s very important to me. You know, I’ve been given a great honor. It’s been very tough. It’s been 18 months of brutality in a true sense, but we won it. We won it pretty big. The final numbers are coming out. Or I guess they’re coming out. Michigan’s just being confirmed. But the numbers are coming out far beyond what anybody’s wildest expectation was. I don’t know if it was us, I mean, we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind of, everything, the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people. As you probably know, I did many, many speeches that last   period. I was just telling Arthur that I went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different places, that were, the massive crowds we were getting. If we had a stadium that held  —   and most of you, many of you were there  —   that held 20, 000 people, we’d have 15, 000 people outside that couldn’t get in. So we came up with a good system  —   we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left. I would do, during the last month, two or three a day. That’s a lot. Because that’s not easy when you have big crowds. Those speeches, that’s not an easy way of life, doing three a day. Then I said the last two days, I want to do six and seven. And I’m not sure anybody has ever done that. But we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 o’clock in the morning in Michigan. And we had 31, 000 people, 17, 000 or 18, 000 inside and the rest outside. This massive place in Grand Rapids, I guess. And it was an incredible thing. And I left saying: ‘How do we lose Michigan? I don’t think we can lose Michigan.’ And the reason I did that, it was set up only a little while before  —   because we heard that day that Hillary was hearing that they’re going to lose Michigan, which hasn’t been lost in 38 years. Or something. But 38 years. And they didn’t want to lose Michigan. So they went out along with President Obama and Michelle, Bill and Hillary, they went to Michigan late that, sort of late afternoon and I said, ‘Let’s go to Michigan.’ It wasn’t on the schedule. So I finished up in New Hampshire and at 10 o’clock I went to Michigan. We got there at 12 o’clock. We started speaking around 12:45, actually, and we had 31, 000 people and I said, really, I mean, there are things happening. But we saw it everywhere. So we felt very good. we had great numbers. And we thought we’re going to win. We thought we were going to win Florida. We thought we were going to win North Carolina. We did easily, pretty easily. We thought strongly we were going to win Pennsylvania. The problem is nobody had won it and it was known, as you know, the great state that always got away. Every Republican thought they were going to win Pennsylvania for 38 years and they just couldn’t win it. And I thought we were going to win it. And we won it, we won it, you know, relatively easily, we won it by a number of points. Florida we won by 180, 000  —   was that the number, 180? PRIEBUS: [inaudible] TRUMP: More than 180, 000 voted, and votes are still coming in from the military, which we are getting about 85 percent of. So we won that by a lot of votes and, you know, we had a great victory. We had a great victory. I think it would have been easier because I see every once in awhile somebody says, ‘Well, the popular vote.’ Well, the popular vote would have been a lot easier, but it’s a whole different campaign. I would have been in California, I would have been in Texas, Florida and New York, and we wouldn’t have gone anywhere else. Which is, I mean I’d rather do the popular vote from the standpoint  —   I’d think we’d do actually as well or better  —   it’s a whole different campaign. It’s like, if you’re a golfer, it’s like match play versus stroke play. It’s a whole different game. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you’d go to a few places. I think that’s the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. SULZBERGER: Until now. [laughter] TRUMP: Until now. I guess now I like it for two reasons. What it does do is it gets you out to see states that you’ll never see otherwise. It’s very interesting. Like Maine. I went to Maine four times. I went to Maine 2 for one, because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270. We learned that was false because we ended up with what,  . PRIEBUS: I’ve got to get, we’ve got to get Michigan in. TRUMP: But there is no path to 270, you have to get the one in Maine, so we kept going back to Maine and we did get the one in Maine. We kept going to Maine 2, and we went to a lot of states that you wouldn’t spend a lot of time in and it does get you  —   we actually went to about 22 states, whereas if you’re going for popular vote, you’d probably go to four, or three, it could be three. You wouldn’t leave New York. You’d stay in New York and you’d stay in California. So there’s a certain genius about it. And I like it either way. But it’s sort of interesting. But we had an amazing period of time. I got to know the country, we have a great country, we’re a great, great people, and the enthusiasm was really incredible. The Los Angeles Times had a poll which was interesting because I was always up in that poll. They had something that is, I guess, a   technique in polling, it was called enthusiasm. They added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great enthusiasm, and Hillary’s people didn’t have enthusiasm. And in the end she didn’t get the   vote and we ended up close to 15 points, as you know. We started off at one, we ended up with almost 15. And more importantly, a lot of people didn’t show up, because the   community liked me. They liked what I was saying. So they didn’t necessarily vote for me, but they didn’t show up, which was a big problem that she had. I ended up doing very well with women, which was  —   which I never understood why I was doing poorly, because we’d go to the rallies and we’d have so many women holding up signs, “Women for Trump. ” But I kept reading polls saying that I’m not doing well with women. I think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with women, especially certain women. DEAN BAQUET, executive editor of The New York Times: As you describe it, you did do something really remarkable. You energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in Washington. But along with that  —   and this is going to create a tricky thing for you  —   you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the   convention in Washington this weekend. Who have a very   …     TRUMP: I just saw that today. BAQUET: So, I’d love to hear you talk about how you’re going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its  —   along racial lines. My first question is, do you feel like you said things that energized them in particular, and how are you going to manage that? TRUMP: I don’t think so, Dean. First of all, I don’t want to energize the group. I’m not looking to energize them. I don’t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group. They, again, I don’t know if it’s reporting or whatever. I don’t know where they were four years ago, and where they were for Romney and McCain and all of the other people that ran, so I just don’t know, I had nothing to compare it to. But it’s not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why. What we do want to do is we want to bring the country together, because the country is very, very divided, and that’s one thing I did see, big league. It’s very, very divided, and I’m going to work very hard to bring the country together. I mean, I’m somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years. It was interesting, my wife, I went to a big event about two years ago. Just after I started thinking about politics. And we’re walking in and some people were cheering and some people were booing, and she said, you know, ‘People have never booed for you.’ I’ve never had a person boo me, and all of a sudden people are booing me. She said, that’s never happened before. And, it’s politics. You know, all of a sudden they think I’m going to be running for office, and I’m a Republican, let’s say. So it’s something that I had never experienced before and I said, ‘Those people are booing,’ and she said, ‘Yup.’ They’d never booed before. But now they boo. You know, it was a group and another group was going the opposite. No, I want to bring the country together. It’s very important to me. We’re in a very divided country. In many ways divided. BAQUET: So I’m going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions. MAGGIE HABERMAN, political reporter: I’ll start, thank you, Dean. Mr. President, I’d like to thank you for being here. This morning, Kellyanne Conway talked about not prosecuting Hillary Clinton. We were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means  —   does that mean just the emails, or the emails and the foundation, and how you came to that decision. TRUMP: Well, there was a report that somebody said that I’m not enthused about it. Look, I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious probably, I assume you sold a lot of newspapers. [laughter] I would imagine. I would imagine. I’m just telling you, Maggie, I’m not looking to hurt them. I think they’ve been through a lot. They’ve gone through a lot. I’m really looking   …     I think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward. SULZBERGER: If I could interject, we had a good conversation there, you and I, and it was off the record, but there was nothing secret, just wanted to make sure. The idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying. That we need to now get past the election, right? MATTHEW PURDY, deputy managing editor: So you’re definitively taking that off the table? The investigation? TRUMP: No, but the question was asked. PURDY: About the emails and the foundation? TRUMP: No, no, but it’s just not something that I feel very strongly about. I feel very strongly about health care. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that I think even the people in this room can be happy. You know, you’ve been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and nothing’s ever happened. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that’s fair and just and a lot of other things. There are a lot of things I feel strongly about. I’m not looking to look back and go through this. This was a very painful period. This was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through. This was a very painful period of time. I read recently where it was, it was, they’re saying, they used to say it was Lincoln against whoever and none of us were there to see it. And there aren’t a lot of recordings of that, right? [laughter] But the fact is that there were some pretty vicious elections they say this was, this was the most. They say it was definitely the most vicious primary. And I think it’s very important to look forward. CAROLYN RYAN, senior editor for politics: Do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the Clintons? What would you say to them? TRUMP: I don’t think they will be disappointed. I think I will explain it, that we have to, in many ways save our country. Because our country’s really in bad, big trouble. We have a lot of trouble. A lot of problems. And one of the big problems, I talk about, divisiveness. I think that a lot of people will appreciate   …     I’m not doing it for that reason. I’m doing it because it’s time to go in a different direction. There was a lot of pain, and I think that the people that supported me with such enthusiasm, where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech. It was actually Election Day, they showed up at, so that was essentially Election Day. Yeah, I think they’d understand very completely. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, opinion columnist: Mr.   can I ask a question? One of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the campaign, and haven’t spoken about yet, is one very near and dear to my heart, the whole issue of climate change, the Paris agreement, how you’ll approach it. You own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world   …     [laughter, cross talk] TRUMP: [laughing] I read your article. Some will be even better because actually like Doral is a little bit off   …     so it’ll be perfect. [inaudible] He doesn’t say that. He just says that the ones that are near the water will be gone, but Doral will be in great shape. [laughter] FRIEDMAN: But it’s really important to me, and I think to a lot of our readers, to know where you’re going to go with this. I don’t think anyone objects to, you know, doing all forms of energy. But are you going to take America out of the world’s lead of confronting climate change? TRUMP: I’m looking at it very closely, Tom. I’ll tell you what. I have an open mind to it. We’re going to look very carefully. It’s one issue that’s interesting because there are few things where there’s more division than climate change. You don’t tend to hear this, but there are people on the other side of that issue who are, think, don’t even   …     SULZBERGER: We do hear it. FRIEDMAN: I was on ‘Squawk Box’ with Joe Kernen this morning, so I got an earful of it. [laughter] TRUMP: Joe is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And I’m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we’re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. SULZBERGER: Well, since we’re living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We’ve seen it personally. Straight up. FRIEDMAN: But you have an open mind on this? TRUMP: I do have an open mind. And we’ve had storms always, Arthur. SULZBERGER: Not like this. TRUMP: You know the hottest day ever was in   98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at M. I. T. He was a great engineer, scientist. He was a great guy. And he was   …     a long time ago, he had feelings  —   this was a long time ago  —   he had feelings on this subject. It’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was that, in Geneva or wherever five years ago? Terrible. Where they got caught, you know, so you see that and you say, what’s this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you know, you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some great, great, very successful golf courses. I’ve received so many environmental awards for the way I’ve done, you know. I’ve done a tremendous amount of work where I’ve received tremendous numbers. Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind. JAMES BENNET, editorial page editor: When you say an open mind, you mean you’re just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isn’t connected? TRUMP: I think right now   …     well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it’s going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now. They’re really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks ago, I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches, that we’ve lost 70, 000 factories since W. Bush. 70, 000. When I first looked at the number, I said: ‘That must be a typo. It can’t be 70, you can’t have 70, 000, you wouldn’t think you have 70, 000 factories here.’ And it wasn’t a typo, it’s right. We’ve lost 70, 000 factories. We’re not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. We’re not competitive for a lot of reasons. That’s becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business with, they make deals with our president, or whoever, and then they don’t adhere to the deals, you know that. And it’s much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So I’m going to be studying that very hard, and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened to, especially by people that don’t believe in it. And we’ll let you know. FRIEDMAN: I’d hate to see Royal Aberdeen underwater. TRUMP: The North Sea, that could be, that’s a good one, right? ELISABETH BUMILLER, Washington bureau chief: I just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into Hillary Clinton. Did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation  —   you will not pursue either one of those? TRUMP: Yeah, look, you know we’ll have people that do things but my inclination would be, for whatever power I have on the matter, is to say let’s go forward. This has been looked at for so long. Ad nauseam. Let’s go forward. And you know, you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made mistakes, etc. etc. I think it’s time, I think it’s time for people to say let’s go and solve some of the problems that we have, which are massive problems and, you know, I do think that they’ve gone through a lot. I think losing is going through a lot. It was a tough, it was a very tough evening for her. I think losing is going through a lot. So, for whatever it’s worth, my, my attitude is strongly we have to go forward, we have so many different problems to solve, I don’t think we have to delve back in the past. I also think that would be a very divisive, well I think it would be very divisive, you know I’m talking about bringing together, and then they go into all sorts of stuff, I think it would be very, very divisive for the country. SULZBERGER: I agree, I think speaking not as a journalist now, it’s very healthy. There, and then we’re going to go MICHAEL D. SHEAR, White House correspondent: Mr. Trump, Mike Shear. I cover the White House, covering your administration   …     TRUMP: See ya there. [laughter] SHEAR: Just one quick clarification on the climate change, do you intend to, as you said, pull out of the Paris Climate   …     TRUMP: I’m going to take a look at it. SHEAR [interrupts]: And if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on American goods to offset the carbon that the United States had pledged to reduce, is that O. K. with you? And then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency. There’s already, even just in the 10, two weeks you’ve been   instances where you’ve met with your Indian business partners   …     TRUMP: Sure. SHEAR: You’ve talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course. People, experts who are lawyers and ethics experts, say that all of that is totally inappropriate, so I guess the question for you is, what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things separate, and are there any lines that you think you won’t want to cross once you’re in the White House? TRUMP: O. K. First of all, on countries. I think that countries will not do that to us. I don’t think if they’re run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation they’re in no position to do that to us, no matter what I do. They’re in no position to do that to us, and that won’t happen, but I’m going to take a look at it. A very serious look. I want to also see how much this is costing, you know, what’s the cost to it, and I’ll be talking to you folks in the    future about it, having to do with what just took place. As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest. That’s been reported very widely. Despite that, I don’t want there to be a conflict of interest anyway. And the laws, the president can’t. And I understand why the president can’t have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of interest, but I have, I’ve built a very great company and it’s a big company and it’s all over the world. People are starting to see, when they look at all these different jobs, like in India and other things, number one, a job like that builds great relationships with the people of India, so it’s all good. But I have to say, the partners come in, they’re very, very successful people. They come in, they’d say, they said, ‘Would it be possible to have a picture?’ Actually, my children are working on that job. So I can say to them, Arthur, ‘I don’t want to have a picture,’ or, I can take a picture. I mean, I think it’s wonderful to take a picture. I’m fine with a picture. But if it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. That would be like you never seeing your son again. That wouldn’t be good. That wouldn’t be good. But I’d never, ever see my daughter Ivanka. UNKNOWN: That means you’d have to make Ivanka deputy President, you know. TRUMP: I know, I know, yeah. [room laughs] Well, I couldn’t do that either. I can’t, that can’t work. I can’t do anything, I would never see my, I guess the only son I’d be allowed to see, at least for a little while, would be Barron, because he’s 10. But, but, so there has to be [unintelligible]. It’s a very interesting case. UNKNOWN: You could sell your company though, right? With all due respect, you could sell your company and then   …     TRUMP: Well   …     UNKNOWN: And then you could see them all the time. TRUMP: That’s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world, which now people are understanding. When I filed my forms with the federal election, people said, ‘Wow that’s really a big company, that’s a big company.’ It really is big, it’s diverse, it’s all over the world. It’s a great company with great assets. I think that, you know, selling real estate isn’t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different, it’s in a much different world. I’d say this, and I mean this and I said it on “60 Minutes” the other night: My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I’m doing, ’cause I don’t need money, I don’t need anything, and by the way, I’m very   I have a very small percentage of my money in debt, very very small percentage of my money in debt, in fact, banks have said ‘We’d like to loan you money, we’d like to give you any amount of money.’ I’ve been there before, I’ve had it both ways, I’ve been   I’ve been   and, especially as you get older,   is much better. UNKNOWN: Mr.     …     TRUMP: Just a minute, because it’s an important question. I don’t care about my company. I mean, if a partner comes in from India or if a partner comes in from Canada, where we did a beautiful big building that just opened, and they want to take a picture and come into my office, and my kids come in and, I originally made the deal with these people, I mean what am I going to say? I’m not going to talk to you, I’m not going to take pictures? You have to, you know, on a human basis, you take pictures. But I just want to say that I am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we discussed, in terms of health care, in terms of so many different things. I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it. They’ll say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, so every time somebody stays at that hotel, if they stay because I’m president, I guess you could say it’s a conflict of interest. It’s a conflict of interest, but again, I’m not going to have anything to do with the hotel, and they may very well. I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O. K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can’t help that, but I don’t care. I said on “60 Minutes”: I don’t care. Because it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country. MICHAEL BARBARO, political reporter: Mr.   can I press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things that, for example, were reported in The Times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of Brexit about wind farms   …     TRUMP: About meeting with who? BARBARO: Leaders of Brexit about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to keep, what structures, can you talk about that meeting, by the way? TRUMP: Was I involved with the wind farms recently? Or, not that I know of. I mean, I have a problem with wind   …     BARBARO: But you brought it up in the meeting, didn’t you? TRUMP: Which meeting? I don’t know. I might have. BARBARO: With leaders of Brexit. MANY VOICES: With Farage. TRUMP: Oh, I see. I might have brought it up. But not having to do with me, just I mean, the wind is a very deceiving thing. First of all, we don’t make the windmills in the United States. They’re made in Germany and Japan. They’re made out of massive amounts of steel, which goes into the atmosphere, whether it’s in our country or not, it goes into the atmosphere. The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other words, we’re subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I mean, for the most part they don’t work. I don’t think they work at all without subsidy, and that bothers me, and they kill all the birds. You go to a windmill, you know in California they have the, what is it? The golden eagle? And they’re like, if you shoot a golden eagle, they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them by, they actually have to get permits that they’re only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird population, O. K. With that being said, there’s a place for them. But they do need subsidy. So, if I talk negatively. I’ve been saying the same thing for years about you know, the wind industry. I wouldn’t want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just said, including the birds, and some don’t. But it’s hard to explain. I don’t care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country. BARBARO: But the structures, just to be clear, that’s the question. How do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president   …     TRUMP: O. K. BARBARO:   …     are trying to influence something, like wind farms? TRUMP: O. K. I don’t want to influence anything, because it’s not that, it’s not that important to me. It’s hard to explain. BARBARO: Yes, but the structures? TRUMP: Now, according to the law, see I figured there’s something where you put something in this massive trust and there’s also  —   nothing is written. In other words, in theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business, which I am phasing out of very rapidly, you know, I sign checks, I’m the   type. I like to sign checks so I know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer button, boom, and thousands of checks are automatically sent. It keeps, it tells me what’s going on a little bit and it tells contractors that I’m watching. But I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that’s happening right now. But in theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly. And there’s never been a case like this where somebody’s had, like, if you look at other people of wealth, they didn’t have this kind of asset and this kind of wealth, frankly. It’s just a different thing. But there is no  —   I assumed that you’d have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know. And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it. So in theory I don’t have to do anything. But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don’t care about my business. Doral is going to run very nice. We own this incredible place in Miami. We own many incredible places, including Turnberry, I guess you heard. There’s one guy that does  —   when I say Turnberry, you know what that is, right. Do a little [inaudible]. But they’re going to run well, we have good managers, they’re going to run really well. So I don’t have to do anything, but I want to do something if I can. If there is something. BARBARO: Can you promise us when you decide exactly what that is, you’ll come tell The New York Times about it? [laughter] TRUMP: I will. I’ve started it already. SULZBERGER: One of our great salesmen, by the way. TRUMP: I can see that. I’ve started it already by, I mean, I’ve greatly reduced the   and the business. I’ve greatly reduced meetings with contractors, meetings with different people that, you know, I’ve also started by  —   ’cause I’ve said over the last two years, once I decided I wanted to run, I don’t want to build anything. ’Cause building, like for instance, we built the post office, you’ll be happy to hear, ahead of schedule and under budget. Substantially ahead of schedule. Almost two years ago of schedule. But ahead of schedule, under budget, and it’s a terrific place. That’s the hotel on Pennsylvania. FRIEDMAN: Just so you know, General Electric has a big wind turbine factory in South Carolina. Just so you know. TRUMP: Well that’s good. But most of ‘em are made in Germany, most of ‘em are made, you know, Siemens and the Chinese are making most of them. [cross talk] TRUMP: They may assemble  —   if you check, I think you’ll find that the, it’s delivered there and they do most of the assembly. JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, White House correspondent: Mr.    —   I’m sorry I entered late, but I did want to ask you about   …     BAQUET: You should introduce yourself. DAVIS: I’m Julie Davis, one of the White House correspondents. TRUMP: Hi, Julie. DAVIS: I apologize for my delayed flight. I wanted to ask you about personnel. They say personnel is policy. TRUMP: I can’t quite hear. DAVIS: Personnel. TRUMP: Personnel. DAVIS: You hired Steve Bannon to be the chief strategist for you in the White House. He is a hero of the  . He’s been described by some as racist and  . I wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government you’ll run. TRUMP: Um, I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or   or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn’t even think about hiring him. First of all, I’m the one that makes the decision, not Steve Bannon or anybody else. And Kellyanne will tell you that. [laughter] KELLYANE CONWAY: 100 percent. TRUMP: And if he said something to me that, in terms of his views, or that I thought were inappropriate or bad, number one I wouldn’t do anything, and number two, he would have to be gone. But I know many people that know him, and in fact, he’s actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know him, and people that are on the left. But Steve went to Harvard, he was a, you know, he was very successful, he was a Naval officer, he’s, I think he’s very, very, you know, sadly, really, I think it’s very hard on him. I think he’s having a hard time with it. Because it’s not him. It’s not him. I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a very, very smart guy. I think he was with Goldman Sachs on top of everything else. UNKNOWN: What do you make of the website he ran, Breitbart? TRUMP: The which? UNKNOWN: Breitbart. TRUMP: Well, Breitbart’s different. Breitbart cover things, I mean like The New York Times covers things. I mean, I could say that Arthur is   because they covered an   story. SULZBERGER: [laughing] I am, I am. I’ll take whatever you say. I am always right, but I’m not  . [laughter, cross talk] TRUMP: The New York Times covers a lot of stories that are, you know, rough stories. And you know, they have covered some of these things, but The New York Times covers a lot of these things also. It’s just a newspaper, essentially. It’s a newspaper. I know the guy, he’s a decent guy, he’s a very smart guy. He’s done a good job. He hasn’t been with me that long. You know he really came in after the primaries. I had already won the primaries. And if I thought that his views were in that category, I would immediately let him go. And I’ll tell you why. In many respects I think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think. DAVIS: But you are aware, sir, with all due respect, that   and Jews and many folks who disagree with the coverage of Breitbart and the slant that Breitbart brings to the news view him that way, aren’t you? TRUMP: Yeah, well Breitbart, first of all, is just a publication. And, you know, they cover stories like you cover stories. Now, they are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than The New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that’s become quite successful, and it’s got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. I mean it’s a pretty big, it’s a pretty big thing. And he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization. Now, I’ll tell you what, I know him very well. I will say this, and I will say this, if I thought that strongly, if I thought that he was doing anything, or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would think, I would ask him very politely to leave. But in the meantime, I think he’s been treated very unfairly. It’s very interesting ’cause a lot of people are coming to his defense right now. PRIEBUS: We have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations. It’s been the total opposite. It’s been a great team, and it’s just not there. And what the   is saying is 100 percent true. [cross talk] TRUMP: And by the way, if you see something or get something where you feel that I’m wrong, and you have some info  —   I would love to hear it. You can call me, Arthur can call me, I would love to hear. The only one who can’t call me is Maureen [Dowd, opinion columnist]. She treats me too rough. I don’t know what happened to Maureen! She was so good, Gail [Collins, opinion columnist]. For years she was so good. [cross talk] SULZBERGER: As we all say about Maureen, it’s not your fault, it’s just your turn. [laughter] ROSS DOUTHAT, opinion columnist: I have a slightly different, but somewhat Steve   question, I guess. It’s about the future of the Republican Party. You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in decades, especially Midwestern Rust Belt states. And I think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican. You had different things to say on trade, entitlements, foreign policy, even your daughter Ivanka’s child care plan was sort of distinctive. And now you’re in a situation where you’re governing and staffing up an administration with a Republican Party whose leaders, and Reince, may differ with me a little on this, but don’t always see    on those views. TRUMP: Although right now they’re loving me. [laughter] UNKNOWN: Well, right now they are. [cross talk] TRUMP: Paul Ryan right now loves me, Mitch McConnell loves me, it’s amazing how winning can change things. I’ve liked Chuck Schumer for a long time. I’ve actually, I’ve raised a lot of money for Chuck and given him a lot of money over the years. I think I was the first person that ever contributed to Chuck Schumer. I had a Brooklyn office, a little office, in a little apartment building in Brooklyn in Sheepshead Bay where I worked with my father. And Chuck Schumer came in and I gave him, I believe, I don’t know if he’s willing to admit this, but I believe it was his first campaign contribution, $500. But Chuck Schumer’s a good guy. I think we’ll get along very well. DOUTHAT: I guess that’s my question is, how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a   Congress as a different kind of Republican. And do you worry that you’ll wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the Rust Belt and people will say, well, he governed more like Paul Ryan than like Donald Trump. TRUMP: No, I don’t worry about that. ’Cause I didn’t need to do this. I was telling Arthur before: ‘Arthur I didn’t need to do this. I’m doing this to do a good job.’ That’s what I want to do, and I think that what happened in the Rust Belt, they call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If you go through it, you look back 20 years, they didn’t used to call it the Rust Belt. You pass factory after factory after factory that’s empty and rusting. Rust is the good part, ’cause they’re worse than rusting, they’re falling down. No, I wouldn’t sacrifice that. To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people. And frankly if the political people don’t take care of these people, they’re not going to win and you’re going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what you’re looking at right now. These people are really angry. They’re smart, they’re workers, and they’re angry. I call them the forgotten men and women. And I use that in speeches, I say they’re the forgotten people  —   they were totally forgotten. And we’re going to bring jobs back. We’re going to bring jobs back, big league. I’ve spoken to so many companies already, I say, don’t plan on moving your company, ’cause you’re not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product. You think you’re going to just sell it across what will be a strong border, you know at least we’re going to have a border. But just don’t plan on it. And I’ll tell you, I believe, and you’ll hear announcements over the next couple of months, but I believe I’ve talked numerous comp  —   in   conversations with top people  —   numerous companies that have, leaving, or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs. FRIEDMAN: Are you worried, though, that those companies will keep their factories here, but the jobs will be replaced by robots? TRUMP: They will, and we’ll make the robots too. [laughter] TRUMP: It’s a big thing, we’ll make the robots too. Right now we don’t make the robots. We don’t make anything. But we’re going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we’re going to do that. We’re going to have more factories. We can’t lose 70, 000 factories. Just can’t do it. We’re going to start making things. I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a   . And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking. I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I’m giving a big tax cut and I’m giving big regulation cuts, and I’ve seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I’ve met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would’ve never said that’s possible, because the tax cut’s going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they’re leaving also because of the regulations. And I would say, of the two, and I would not have thought this, regulation cuts, substantial regulation cuts, are more important than, and more enthusiastically supported, than even the big tax cuts. UNKNOWN: Mr.   I wanted to ask you, there was a conference this past weekend in Washington of people who pledged their allegiance to Nazism. TRUMP: Boy, you are really into this stuff, huh? PRIEBUS: I think we answered that one right off the bat. UNKNOWN: Are you going to condemn them? TRUMP: Of course I did, of course I did. PRIEBUS: He already did. UNKNOWN: Are you going to do it right now? TRUMP: Oh, I see, maybe you weren’t here. Sure. Would you like me to do it here? I’ll do it here. Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn. SULZBERGER: We’ll go with that. I’d like to move to infrastructure, apologies, and then we’ll go back. Because a lot of the investment you are talking about, a lot of the jobs you are talking about  —   is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few years? TRUMP: No, it’s not the core, but it’s an important factor. We’re going for a lot of things, between taxes, between regulations, between health care replacement, we’re going to talk repeal and replace. ’Cause health care is  —   you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and they’re not even getting anything, the deductibles are so high, you have deductibles $16, 000. So they’re paying all of this money and they don’t even get health care. So it’s very important. So there are a lot of things. But infrastructure, Arthur, is going to be a part of it. SULZBERGER: It’s part of jobs, isn’t it? TRUMP: I don’t even think it’s a big part of it. It’s going to be a big number but I think I am doing things that are more important than infrastructure, but infrastructure is still a part of it, and we’re talking about a very   infrastructure bill. And that’s not a very Republican thing  —   I didn’t even know that, frankly. SULZBERGER: It worked for Franklin Roosevelt. TRUMP: It didn’t work for Obama because unfortunately they didn’t spend the money last time on infrastructure. They spent it on a lot of other things. You know, nobody can find out where that last  —   you know, from a few years ago  —   where that money went. And we’re going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways. I have a friend, he’s a big trucker, one of the biggest. And he orders these incredible trucks, the best, I won’t mention the name but it’s a certain truck company that makes  —   they call them the   of trucks. You know, the most expensive trucks. And he calls me up about two months ago and he goes, ‘Man, I’m going to buy the cheapest trucks I can buy.’ And I said, ‘Why?’ and  —   you know, and this is the biggest guy  —   he goes, ‘My trucks are coming back, they’re going from New York to California and they’re all busted up. The highways are in such bad shape, they’re hitting potholes, they’re hitting everything.’ He said, ‘I’m not buying these trucks anymore, I’m going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires I can get.’ That’s the exact expression he used, ‘the cheapest trucks and the strongest tires.’ We’re hitting so many bad points, we, you know, I said, ‘So tell me, you’ve been doing this how long?’ 45 years. He built it over 45 years. I said, ‘Have you ever seen it like this?’ He said, ‘The roads have never been like this.’ It’s an interesting   …     BAQUET: What did, what did, I’m curious what Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan said when you said, ‘I’m going to launch a   infrastructure program.’ Are they reluctant to spend that? TRUMP: Honestly right now   …     DOUTHAT: Trillion. Trillion, I think, was the figure. BAQUET: Because they would be in the wing of the Republican Party that would say, ‘That’s great, but you’re not going to be able to do that and balance the budget.’ TRUMP: Let’s see if I get it done. Right now they’re in love with me. O. K.? Four weeks ago they weren’t in love with me. Don’t forget  —   if I read The New York Times, and you don’t have to put this on the record  —   it can be if you want, you might not want   …     SULZBERGER: You say if, but you do   …     TRUMP: Well, I do read it. Unfortunately. I would have lived about 20 years longer if I didn’t. SULZBERGER: There’s Nixon’s quote right there if you’d love to reread it  —   TRUMP: I know. But when you look at the different, all the newspapers, I was going to lose the presidency, I was going to take the House with me, and the Senate had no chance. It was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country. And instead I won the presidency, easily, and I mean easily  —   you look at those states, I had states where I won by 30 and 40 points. I won the presidency easily, I helped numerous senators  —   in fact the only senators that didn’t get elected were two  —   one up in New Hampshire who refused to say that she was going to vote for me, who by the way would love a job in the administration and I said, ‘No, thank you.’ That’s on the record. This is where I’m different than a politician  —   I know what to say, I just believe it’s sort of interesting. She’d love to have a job in the administration, I said, ‘No, thank you.’ She refused to vote for me. And a senator in Nevada who frankly said, he endorsed me then he unendorsed me, and he went down like a lead balloon. And then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and I said, ‘No thank you, good luck.’ You know, let’s see what happens. I said, off the record, I hope you lose. Off the record. He was! He was up by 10 points  —   you know who I’m talking about. So, others  —   if you look at Missouri, [Senator Roy] Blunt, he was down five points a few days before the election, he called for help, I gave him help, and I think I was up like over 30 points in Missouri. I was leading by a massive amount, 28 points. I gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something. I brought a number of them. Pennsylvania, brought over the finish line. Let’s see, we brought Johnson, in, you know, that was a good one. We brought him over the line in Wisconsin. Winning Wisconsin was big stuff, that’s something that   …     FRIEDMAN: Mr.   I came   …     TRUMP: So right now I’m in very good shape, but FRIEDMAN: I came here thinking you’d be awed and overwhelmed by this job, but I feel like you are getting very comfortable with it. TRUMP: I feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. I am awed by the job, as anybody would be, but I honestly, Tom, I feel so comfortable and you know it would be, to me, a great achievement if I could come back here in a year or two years and say  —   and have a lot of the folks here say, ‘You’ve done a great job.’ And I don’t mean just a conservative job, ’cause I’m not talking conservative. I mean just, we’ve done a good job. SHEAR: To follow up on Matt, after you met with President Obama, he described you to folks as  —   that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you. So I wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that you’re about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that you’ve had on the phone since then. And then maybe talk a little bit about foreign policy, that’s something we haven’t touched on here, and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order  —   a world order led by America in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the world, which have been in place for decades. TRUMP: Sure. I had a great meeting with President Obama. I never met him before. I really liked him a lot. The meeting was supposed to be 10 minutes, 15 minutes max, because there were a lot of people waiting outside, for both of us. And it ended up being  —   you were there  —   I guess an     meeting, close. And it was a great chemistry. I think if he said overwhelmed, I don’t think he meant that in a bad way. I think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job. But I’m not overwhelmed by it. You can do things and fix it, I think he meant it that way. He said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him. I really enjoyed my meeting with him. We have  —   you know, we come from different sides of the equation, but it’s nevertheless something that  —   I didn’t know if I’d like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldn’t, but I did, I did like him. I really enjoyed him a lot. I’ve spoken to him since the meeting. SHEAR: What did you say to him? TRUMP: Just a basic conversation. I think he’s looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and I really, I’m telling you, we had a meeting, Arthur, that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours. It was a great  —   it was just a very good meeting. UNKNOWN: Sort of like this meeting. [cross talk, laughter] TRUMP: He told me what he thought his, what the biggest problems of the country were, which I don’t think I should reveal, I don’t mind if he reveals them. But I was actually surprised a little bit. But he told me the problems, he told me things that he considered assets, but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest problems, in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the country, which I’d rather have you ask him. But I really found the meeting to be very good. And I hope we can have a good  —   I mean, it doesn’t mean we’re going to agree on everything, but I hope that we will have a great   relationship. I really liked him a lot and I’m a little bit surprised I’m telling you that I really liked him a lot. Let’s go foreign policy, sure. Sure. FRIEDMAN: What do you see as America’s role in the world? Do you believe that the role   …     TRUMP: That’s such a big question. FRIEDMAN: The role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global balancer, paying more for things because they were in our ultimate interest, one hears from you, I sense, is really shrinking that role. TRUMP: I don’t think we should be a nation builder. I think we’ve tried that. I happen to think that going into Iraq was perhaps   …     I mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil war, O. K.? I think going into Iraq was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country. I think getting out of it  —   I think we got out of it wrong, then lots of bad things happened, including the formation of ISIS. We could have gotten out of it differently. FRIEDMAN: NATO, Russia? TRUMP: I think going in was a terrible, terrible mistake. Syria, we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting, fighting forever. I have a different view on Syria than everybody else. Well, not everybody else, but then a lot of people. I had to listen to [Senator] Lindsey Graham, who, give me a break. I had to listen to Lindsey Graham talk about, you know, attacking Syria and attacking, you know, and it’s like you’re now attacking Russia, you’re attacking Iran, you’re attacking. And what are we getting? We’re getting  —   and what are we getting? And I have some very definitive, I have some very strong ideas on Syria. I think what’s happened is a horrible, horrible thing. To look at the deaths, and I’m not just talking deaths on our side, which are horrible, but the deaths  —   I mean you look at these cities, Arthur, where they’re totally, they’re rubble, massive areas, and they say two people were injured. No, thousands of people have died. O. K. And I think it’s a shame. And ideally we can get  —   do something with Syria. I spoke to Putin, as you know, he called me, essentially   …     UNKNOWN: How do you see that relationship? TRUMP: Essentially everybody called me, all of the major leaders, and most of them I’ve spoken to. FRIEDMAN: Will you have a reset with Russia? TRUMP: I wouldn’t use that term after what happened, you know, previously. I think  —   I would love to be able to get along with Russia and I think they’d like to be able to get along with us. It’s in our mutual interest. And I don’t go in with any preconceived notion, but I will tell you, I would say  —   when they used to say, during the campaign, Donald Trump loves Putin, Putin loves Donald Trump, I said, huh, wouldn’t it be nice, I’d say this in front of thousands of people, wouldn’t it be nice to actually report what they said, wouldn’t it be nice if we actually got along with Russia, wouldn’t it be nice if we went after ISIS together, which is, by the way, aside from being dangerous, it’s very expensive, and ISIS shouldn’t have been even allowed to form, and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand. You know they thought it was bad that I was getting along with Putin or that I believe strongly if we can get along with Russia that’s a positive thing. It is a great thing that we can get along with not only Russia but that we get along with other countries. JOSEPH KAHN, managing editor: On Syria, would you mind, you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the Syria conflict, can you describe that for us? TRUMP: I can only say this: We have to end that craziness that’s going on in Syria. One of the things that was told to me  —   can I say this off the record, or is everything on the record? SULZBERGER: No, if you want to   …     TRUMP: I don’t want to violate, I don’t want to violate a   …     SULZBERGER: If you want to go off the record, we have agreed you can go off the record. Ladies and gentlemen, we are off the record for this moment. [Trump speaks off the record.] TRUMP: Now we can go back on. SULZBERGER: I’m going to play the cop here. We’ve got only two and a half minutes left, because they have a hard stop at 2. And by the way, I want to thank you again, on behalf of all of us   …     TRUMP: Thank you. SULZBERGER:   …     for this meeting, and really I mean that. We are back on the record. Maggie, you get the last question. TRUMP: Is he a tough boss, folks? Is he tough? HABERMAN: I have two questions, very, very quickly. One is your vice   left open the idea of returning to waterboarding. You talked about that on the campaign trail. I’m hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this point, and also what are you hoping that Jared Kushner will do in your administration and will you bring him in formally? TRUMP: O. K. O. K. So, I didn’t hear the second question. HABERMAN: Jared Kushner. What will Jared Kushner’s role be in your administration? TRUMP: Oh. Maybe nothing. Because I don’t want to have people saying ‘conflict.’ Even though the president of the United States  —   I hope whoever is writing this story, it’s written fairly  —   the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants  —   he or she wants. But I don’t want to go by that. Jared’s a very smart guy. He’s a very good guy. The people that know him, he’s a quality person and I think he can be very helpful. I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. I would love that, that would be such a great achievement. Because nobody’s been able to do it. HABERMAN: Do you think he can be part of that? TRUMP: Well, I think he’d be very good at it. I mean he knows it so well. He knows the region, knows the people, knows the players. I would love to be  —   and you can put that down in a list of many things that I’d like to be able to do. Now a lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it’s impossible, you can’t do it. I’ve had a lot of, actually, great Israeli businesspeople tell me, you can’t do that, it’s impossible. I disagree, I think you can make peace. I think people are tired now of being shot, killed. At some point, when do they come? I think we can do that. I have reason to believe I can do that. HABERMAN: And on torture? Where are you  —   and waterboarding? TRUMP: So, I met with General Mattis, who is a very respected guy. In fact, I met with a number of other generals, they say he’s the finest there is. He is being seriously, seriously considered for secretary of defense, which is  —   I think it’s time maybe, it’s time for a general. Look at what’s going on. We don’t win, we can’t beat anybody, we don’t win anymore. At anything. We don’t win on the border, we don’t win with trade, we certainly don’t win with the military. General Mattis is a strong, highly dignified man. I met with him at length and I asked him that question. I said, what do you think of waterboarding? He said  —   I was surprised  —   he said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful.’ He said, ‘I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.’ And I was very impressed by that answer. I was surprised, because he’s known as being like the toughest guy. And when he said that, I’m not saying it changed my mind. [An earlier version made a mistake in transcription. Mr. Trump said “changed my mind,” not “changed my man. ”] Look, we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and we’re not allowed to waterboard. But I’ll tell you what, I was impressed by that answer. It certainly does not  —   it’s not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think. If it’s so important to the American people, I would go for it. I would be guided by that. But General Mattis found it to be very less important, much less important than I thought he would say. I thought he would say  —   you know he’s known as Mad Dog Mattis, right? Mad Dog for a reason. I thought he’d say ‘It’s phenomenal, don’t lose it.’ He actually said, ‘No, give me some cigarettes and some drinks, and we’ll do better.’ SULZBERGER: So, I, with apologies, I’m going to go to our C. E. O. Mark Thompson, for the last, last question. TRUMP: Very powerful man   …     MARK THOMPSON: Thank you, and it’s a really short one, but after all the talk about libel and libel laws, are you committed to the First Amendment to the Constitution? TRUMP: Oh, I was hoping he wasn’t going to say that. I think you’ll be happy. I think you’ll be happy. Actually, somebody said to me on that, they said, ‘You know, it’s a great idea, softening up those laws, but you may get sued a lot more.’ I said, ‘You know, you’re right, I never thought about that.’ I said, ‘You know, I have to start thinking about that.’ So, I, I think you’ll be O. K. I think you’re going to be fine. SULZBERGER: Well, thank you very much for this. Really appreciate this. TRUMP: Thank you all, very much, it’s a great honor. I will say, The Times is, it’s a great, great American jewel. A world jewel. And I hope we can all get along. We’re looking for the same thing, and I hope we can all get along well.",0
11629,Mary Keitany of Kenya Wins 3rd Straight New York City Marathon - The New York Times,"Mary Keitany, a    mother of two, went out for a run on Sunday morning. She started at the foot of the   Bridge on Staten Island and worked her way through the city. About 10 miles into her run, in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Keitany picked up the pace, the first signal to those running with her that she was not in the mood for a group run. She soon surged again, effectively saying, “Goodbye, everyone I’ll see you at brunch. ” It was no ordinary weekend run. Keitany, a marathon dynamo who trains at 7, 500 feet in Kenya’s western highlands, put on a virtuoso solo performance that is uncommon for the streets of New York. It resulted in her third consecutive New York City Marathon title. She was so far in front of her competitors that she could have taken a stroll through the Sheep Meadow in Central Park on her way to the finish line. Instead, Keitany took the most direct path, at a punishing pace that no one else could maintain, her      body gliding along for 26. 2 miles without any apparent struggle. Keitany finished in 2 hours 24 minutes 26 seconds, with the   finisher nowhere in sight. “I was not planning to do this, but I had a time I wanted to run, and I needed to keep the pace,” Keitany said of her breakaway. “I’ve run alone many times, and I trained well. And if anyone caught me, I was going to chase them. ” A    from Eritrea, Ghirmay Ghebreslassie, won the men’s race. He emerged from a tight pack of three at Mile 20 and blew kisses at onlookers as he won in 2:07:51. He is the youngest winner in race history. Ghebreslassie, who won the world championship in Beijing in 2015 at 19, took fourth place in the Rio Olympics. He was followed Sunday by Lucas Rotich of Kenya (2:08:53). Abdi Abdirahman, a      who is based in Arizona, finished in third (2:11:23). Keitany’s unexpected break from the lead pack threw the women’s race into early upheaval as her competitors stretched out one by one along the course, jockeying for the remaining two podium spots. Sally Kipyego of Kenya, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in the 10, 000 meters, placed second in 2:28:01, more than three and a half minutes behind Keitany, and Molly Huddle of the United States, in her marathon debut, was third in 2:28:13. Keitany’s push so early in the race seemed to wreak mental havoc on her competitors, who were forced to either try to keep up or hope that she could be caught later. “On the breakaway, I had to decide if I go or stay,” Huddle said. “I kind of went a little harder around Mile 8 and was alone for a while. Then slowed down a little bit too much on the bridge at Mile 15, and I think that just  —   I need to measure myself a little better. ” Huddle held back, but that meant Keitany’s lead would grow. Joyce Chepkirui, also from Kenya, chose to follow. But that proved fatal she was unable to sustain the pace and fell back before the halfway mark. Overtaken by Huddle, she faded to fourth. Taking off alone is a risky move, particularly early in a race, when a chase pack has more than an hour to band together in pursuit. In this case, Keitany’s strategy led to the largest margin of victory in the woman’s race  —   3 minutes 34. 98 seconds  —   since Grete Waitz won in 1980. Breakaways in this marathon are common, but early ones can ruin a   as often as they carry her to victory. Many make their moves at Mile 16 when they have safely cleared the Queensboro Bridge and are in Manhattan  —   and they are often overtaken in wild chases through the final miles of Central Park. In 2000, Abdelkhader   of Morocco ran away from the Kenyans chasing him far earlier than he was supposed to, leaving even the pacesetter behind and causing an upset. And in 1988, Steve Jones of Britain ran alone to set the fastest time in seven years, with a 3:21 margin of victory that almost rivaled Keitany’s. Meb Keflezighi, then 38, used the tactic in the 2014 Boston Marathon, when at Mile 11 he eluded a formidable field of younger athletes who figured the aging Keflezighi would fade back. Other Americans, including Ryan Hall, said they realized Keflezighi had an opportunity to win and slowed the pace of the chase pack. By the time his younger, fitter rivals realized his lead was insurmountable, it was too late. Keflezighi became the first American to win the race since 1983. Frank Shorter pulled away just beyond nine miles to take gold in the 1972 Munich Olympics. And at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Joan Benoit Samuelson took the lead early on as well, at Mile 3 in the first Olympic women’s marathon, heading to her historic victory. “I tell people all the time, you need to run your own race,” Benoit said Sunday. “That’s what Mary did if you play into somebody else’s hands, especially early on, it can foul your plans. ” Benoit’s decision to take the lead was spontaneous. “I didn’t want to take the lead that early, but I knew what I was capable of running, and I went with it,” she said. “You’ve got to go with what you know. ” It has grown less common for women to risk taking off alone in the New York City Marathon, especially after the race switched to the separate start for the women’s professional field in 2002. In a pack, runners can take turns keeping a pace and blocking headwinds. But running together often leaves the race decided by decisive breakaways in the final miles. So if a marathoner is confident that she can maintain the pace while running alone, absorbing all of the wind, she might try to break away from the pack early to avoid a tactical sprint near the finish. In the 2011 New York City Marathon, Keitany broke away but was overtaken by two Ethiopians who steadily reeled her in. Buzunesh Deba of Ethiopia, who lives in the Bronx, ran nearly the entire course minutes ahead of the rest of the professional field with her friend and teammate Tigist Tufa through bracing wind in 2013 before Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya caught her in Central Park. Deba finished second. Keitany said she did not plan to challenge the field so assertively. But of the women on the podium, she was the only one who had completed a marathon before Sunday. Kipyego, who dropped out of this race last year, said: “I wanted to run within myself and stick to something that I felt was more conservative. I kind of came in thinking that I’d rather run a much more conservative race, hold something back, and be able to have a good experience just because this a new distance for me. ” Huddle agreed. “I was kind of just surviving at the end and looking ahead and really trying to catch Joyce and trying to catch Sally, but you were too fast,” Huddle said to Kipyego. “So just kind of flailing the last 10K probably, well, probably the last 10 miles. ” Keitany became the first woman to win New York three times in a row since Waitz won five from 1982 to 1986. As her orange sneakers bounced steadily off the pavement through the five boroughs and into Central Park, Keitany showed that she had no problem running alone  —   provided she has a chance to start at all. Although she is the   woman in history and her country’s   (2:18:37) Kenya left her off its Olympic team this year. The snub left her to focus on her fall race. She chose to execute a bold maneuver against a weak field, vacated by those who had already spent themselves at the Olympics in August or at other fall marathons. Keitany acknowledged the risk in her race strategy Sunday. “Sometimes if you break off and you’re not ready to follow through, they will catch you,” she said. “But I was ready. ”",0
11630,"Harsher Security Tactics? Obama Left Door Ajar, and Donald Trump Is Knocking - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   As a presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump vowed to refill the cells of the Guantánamo Bay prison and said American terrorism suspects should be sent there for military prosecution. He called for targeting mosques for surveillance, escalating airstrikes aimed at terrorists and taking out their civilian family members, and bringing back waterboarding and a “hell of a lot worse”  —   not only because “torture works,” but because even “if it doesn’t work, they deserve it anyway. ” It is hard to know how much of this stark vision for throwing off constraints on the exercise of national security power was merely tough campaign talk. But if the Trump administration follows through on such ideas, it will find some assistance in a surprising source: President Obama’s     approach to curbing what he saw as overreaching in the war on terrorism. Over and over, Mr. Obama has imposed limits on his use of such powers but has not closed the door on them  —   a flexible approach premised on the idea that he and his successors could be trusted to use them prudently. Mr. Trump can now sweep away those limits and open the throttle on policies that Mr. Obama endorsed as lawful and legitimate for sparing use, like targeted killings in drone strikes and the use of indefinite detention and military tribunals for terrorism suspects. And even in areas where Mr. Obama tried to terminate policies from the George W. Bush era  —   like torture and the detention of Americans and other people arrested on domestic soil as “enemy combatants”  —   his administration fought in court to prevent any ruling that the defunct practices had been illegal. The absence of a definitive repudiation could make it easier for Trump administration lawyers to revive the policies by invoking the same sweeping theories of executive power that were the basis for them in the Bush years. Two decisions by Mr. Obama in 2009 set the tone for his      approach. They involved whether to keep indefinite wartime detentions without trial and to continue using military commission prosecutions  —   if not at the Guantánamo prison, which he had resolved to close, then at a replacement wartime prison. Told that several dozen detainees could not be tried for any crime but would be particularly risky to release, and that a handful might be prosecutable only under the looser rules governing evidence in a military commission, Mr. Obama decided that the responsible policy was to keep both the tribunals and the indefinite detentions available. The president refused to use either power on newly captured terrorism suspects, instead prosecuting them in civilian court. But by leaving the options open, he helped normalize them and left them on a firmer legal basis. Mr. Obama followed a similar course with several national security practices that became controversial during his first term. After his use of drones to kill terrorism suspects away from war zones led to mounting concerns over civilian casualties and other matters, he issued a “presidential policy guidance” in May 2013 that set stricter limits. They included a requirement that the target pose a threat to Americans  —   not just to American interests  —   and that there would be near certainty of no bystander deaths. But the Obama administration also successfully fought in court to establish that judges would not review the legality of such killing operations, even if an American citizen was the target. Mr. Trump  —   who has said he would “bomb the hell out of ISIS,” beyond what Mr. Obama is doing, and go after civilian relatives of terrorists, prevailing over any military commanders who balked  —   could scrap the internal limits while invoking those precedents to shield his acts from judicial review. Similarly, after a surge of criminal prosecutions against people who leaked secret information to the news media and bipartisan outrage at aggressive investigative tactics targeting journalists, the Obama Justice Department issued new guidelines for leak investigations intended to make it harder for investigators to subpoena reporters’ testimony or phone records. It also decided not to force a reporter for The New York Times to testify in a leak trial or face prison for contempt. But the Obama administration also successfully fought in court to establish that the First Amendment offers no protection to journalists whom the executive branch chooses to subpoena to testify against confidential sources. Mr. Trump, who has proposed changing libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations, could abandon the   internal restraints and invoke the   court precedent to adopt more aggressive policies in leak investigations. Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who is a friend and adviser to Mr. Obama, defended the president’s approach. He said that after 2010, when Republicans took over the House, internal executive branch restraints were the only option because Congress was not going to enact legislation limiting national security powers. He also said that even if Mr. Obama had gotten rid of indefinite detention or military tribunals, Mr. Trump could have brought them back. “Short of legislation that restricts things, there is not much a president could do in these matters to restrain a successor,” Professor Stone said. Still, Bruce Ackerman, a Yale University law professor who is helping with a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Obama is waging an illegal war against the Islamic State because Congress never specifically authorized it, said Mr. Obama had contributed to the growth of executive powers that Mr. Trump would inherit. That includes “the fundamental institutional legacy” of relying on executive branch lawyers to produce creative legal opinions clearing the way for preferred policies, Professor Ackerman said. The two areas where Mr. Obama broke most cleanly with   practices were torture and the indefinite military detention of Americans and other terrorism suspects arrested on domestic soil. Mr. Obama issued an executive order requiring interrogators to use only techniques approved in the Army Field Manual, and he later signed a bill codifying that rule into statute. He also resisted repeated calls by Republicans to put newly captured terrorism suspects arrested in the United States into   military detention. But the Obama administration also ruled out criminal investigations into   officials for involvement in torture practices that the Justice Department had blessed as legal under a sweeping theory that the commander in chief could not be bound by   laws. And the Obama administration fought lawsuits brought by Jose Padilla, an American terrorism suspect who had been imprisoned and interrogated as an “enemy combatant. ” The administration successfully argued that courts should dismiss the litigation without ruling on whether his treatment had been lawful, preventing any clear repudiation of the   legal theory. A spokesman for Mr. Obama’s National Security Council declined to comment. But Gregory B. Craig, who was Mr. Obama’s first White House counsel and participated in early policy deliberations about what to do about   policies, said that in 2009, the president “was not thinking about 10 years out, but about 10 days out. ” And he especially did not want to send signals to Republicans that he was a zealot or out for revenge, Mr. Craig said. Mr. Obama, Mr. Craig said, “was thinking about working with Republicans and developing postpartisan relations on   national security issues, not about what was going to happen a decade later. ” Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sharply criticized the Obama administration’s approach, said it was now clear that Mr. Obama had “missed an opportunity” to fundamentally reject the sort of policies that the Bush administration put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “Obama’s failure to rein in George Bush’s national security policies hands Donald Trump a fully loaded weapon,” Mr. Romero said. “The president’s failure to understand that these powers could not be entrusted in the hands of any president, not even his, have now put us in a position where they are in the hands of Donald Trump. ”",0

Accuracy in Media 
With radical Muslim Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) already in the running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), another extremist is considering entering the race. Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, made a name for herself at the Democratic National Convention with a speech proclaiming that she had an abortion because a baby would interfere with her career plans. 
“I wanted a family, but it was the wrong time,” Hogue said in her speech justifying her abortion. 
A veteran of the “progressive” movement, she worked for David Brock’s Media Matters , a George Soros-funded group that works to push the media even further to the left by eliminating conservative news and viewers. She also worked for MoveOn.org, another Soros-funded group that got its name from a desire to “move on” from Bill Clinton’s disgraceful sexual affair with a White House intern, and stop the Republican Congress from impeaching the former president. Clinton was impeached by the House but not convicted in the Senate. 
Hogue’s speech was described as the first time that a woman boasted about having an abortion at a national political party convention. Cecile Richards of Planned Parenthood, which performs abortions, said she was “so proud” to watch it. 
Hogue’s old employer, Media Matters, said the speech was designed to eliminate the “stigma” that abortion is morally wrong and/or socially unacceptable, and that the media should have given it more attention. 
But the millions of Democrats who are pro-life, an estimated one in three, may not have appreciated the spectacle. 
Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, says , “For years, Democrats have been eroding their base of pro-life voters as abortion opponents flee to the Independent category and Republican Party. Democrats for Life of America staff have done an analysis that shows a close correlation between loss of pro-life Democratic seats and the overall decline of Democrats in Congress. The recent election reflects the party’s shift to wholesale support for the abortion industry.” 
She said the Democratic Party lost the November 8 election, “thanks in large part to the party’s extreme abortion position,” and that “the party is slowly dying and on the way to being irrelevant if it does not start a dialogue with its pro-life members.” 
Hillary Clinton supported abortion up until the moment of birth and advocated taxpayer funding of abortion. 
“Standing on a severe party platform on abortion, Hillary Clinton lost soft Republicans, anti-abortion Independents, and millions of pro-life voters in her own party,” the group said. “She lost key states, long part of the Democrats’ Blue Wall, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin…” If the Democratic Party continues moving left on the issue, she said, it risks becoming “the party of coastal, urban elites” without support in Middle America. 
Hogue’s group, NARAL Pro-Choice America, was established in 1969 as the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. NARAL’s co-founder, Dr. Bernard N. Nathanson, was an abortionist who converted to the pro-life cause when he became convinced by science that the fetus was an unborn baby with the right to life. Later, he converted to Catholicism. 
Another important item on Hogue’s resumé, her time serving as a “Senior Advisor” to the Soros-funded Media Matters, has become more significant after the release of one of the Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaks. It shows staffers for Media Matters attending the national Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in order to discover and expose “truly crazy” views held by conservatives and wondering if any other liberals were there “on the sly” to secretly monitor what was going on. 
The idea that women should celebrate abortion because it enables feminists to pursue careers may have been popular at the Democratic Party’s convention, but it is not considered morally acceptable by many people, including women. 
“What Hogue and NARAL don’t seem to grasp is that their definition of feminism, along with the targeting of a weaker individual—a woman’s own child—diminishes women as a whole,” countered Carole Novielli at Live Action News. “The sign of a strong woman is not in how quickly she will sacrifice her own flesh and blood for personal ambition, but in how she maintains her dignity and that of her child while working through a challenging situation to find real solutions.” 
Former abortionist Nathanson said in an interview that the abortion rights movement used deception and dirty tricks to make abortion legal and socially acceptable in the United States. One tactic, he said, was to depict Catholic opponents of abortion as “socially backward.” He said “the media drum-fired all this into the American people, persuading them that anyone opposing permissive abortion must be under the influence of the Catholic hierarchy and that Catholics in favor of abortion are enlightened and forward-looking.” 
As revealed in the Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks, the same strategy is still being used today. John Halpin, a senior fellow for the Soros-funded Center for American Progress, referred to Catholic beliefs on sexuality matters as “severely backwards.” 
Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput cited this and other material in the emails as evidence that the Clinton entourage was “riddled with anti-Catholic bigots.” He noted that Sandy Newman, president of Voices for Progress, had emailed Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta to ask about whether “the bishops opposing contraceptive coverage” in Obamacare could be the tinder for a revolution. “There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages [sic] dictatorship,” Newman wrote. 
“Of course it would be wonderful for the Clinton campaign to repudiate the content of these ugly WikiLeaks emails,” Chaput said. “All of us backward-thinking Catholics who actually believe what Scripture and the Church teach would be so very grateful.” 
Rather than repudiate the emails, a pro-abortion feminist who is proud of her abortion is now apparently in the running for the position of DNC chair. 
If she does run, The Huffington Post says the DNC contest could be seen in “progressive circles as a proxy do-over of the Sanders-Hillary Clinton Democratic primary, with all the acrimony that came with it.” Ellison backed Sanders and Hogue supported Hillary. 
Hogue was photographed on the verge of tears as the news came in on election night that Clinton was going down to defeat. Cheers, not tears, greeted her news at the convention that she had an abortion because having a baby was an inconvenience. Cliff Kincaid

11633,Climate Change Has Already Altered Nearly Every Ecosystem on Earth,"in Climate Change — by Nadia Prupis — November 15, 2016 The researchers say 82 percent of “core ecological processes” on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that has not been expected “for decades.” (Photo: Lwp Kommunikáció/flickr/cc) 
Climate change is already affecting life on Earth, despite a global temperature increase of just 1°C, according to a new study published in the journal Science on Friday. 
Nearly every ecosystem on the planet is being altered, and plants and animals are being so affected that scientists may soon be forced to intervene to create “human-assisted evolution,” the study, titled The Broad Footprint of Climate Change from Genes to Biomes to People , found. 
The researchers say 82 percent of “core ecological processes” on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that had not been expected “for decades.” 
Co-author and professor John Pandolfi of the University of Queensland said , “Temperature extremes are causing evolutionary adaption in many species, changing them genetically and physically. These responses include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex-ratios, reduced body size, and migration of species.” 
“Understanding the extent to which these goods and services have been impacted allows humans to plan and adapt to changing ecosystem conditions,” he said. 
Dr. James Watson, associate professor of planning and environmental management at UQ’s School of Geography, added, “We are simply astonished at the level of change we observed which many of us in the scientific community did not expect to see for decades.” 
The changes have manifested in some species shifting to higher or lower ground as the planet heats up, while others are becoming smaller, “as a higher surface-area-to-body-mass ratio makes it easier to stay cool,” the Independent reported . The outlet wrote: 
For example, six species of woodland salamander in the Appalachian Mountains have undergone an average eight per cent reduction in body size over the past 50 years. 
Slightly smaller lizards might not sound like something to overly concern humans, but there is evidence this response is also affecting important sources of food. 
“These multi-level biological impacts of climate change will affect humans. Increasing disease outbreaks, inconsistent crop yields, and reduced fisheries productivity all threaten our food security,” said co-author Dr. Tom Bridge. 
Average global temperatures have risen 1°C since the industrial era. The study states that this has “already had broad and worrying impacts on natural systems, with accumulating consequences for people. Minimizing the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes must now be a key policy priority for all nations.” 
The study called on governments to follow through on the promises made in the Paris climate agreement , which aims to keep global warming below a 1.5°C threshold—although an increasing amount of scientists are sounding the alarm that even those pledges may be too little, too late. 
“Time is running out for a globally synchronized response to climate change that integrates adequate protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services,” the study continued. 
“It is no longer sensible to consider this as a concern for the future—if we don’t act quickly to curb emissions it is likely that every ecosystem across Earth will fundamentally change in our lifetimes,” said Dr. Watson.

11634,Comment on Sweden on the brink? Police force pushed to breaking point by violence amid migrant influx by Paul Blake,"  DCG | 5 Comments 
Ain’t multiculturalism grand? 
From Daily Express : The Scandinavian country is facing an existential crisis with on average three police officers handing in their resignations a day. If the alarming trend continues, and police officers continue to resign more than 1,000 officers will have quit the service by New Years. 
Since the migrant crisis began last summer, Sweden has been hit by a series of brutal crimes and violent incidents . In 2015 alone Sweden, with a population of 9.5million, received over 160,000 asylum applications and the country is expected to take as many as 190,000 refugees, or two per cent of the population, by the end of 2016. 
Since the Second World War Sweden has prided itself on helping migrants who cross their borders despite some moves to the political right in recent years. 
But police have now admitted the force has reached breaching point as more than 50 areas in the country have now been placed on a “no-go zone” list . 
In February a report from Sweden’s National Criminal Investigation Service announced there were 52 areas where officers would not cope with the levels of crime being committed . Sex assaults , drug dealing and children carrying weapons were just some of the incidents mentioned in the report. In September, Swedish officials were forced to add another three areas to the list. 
Now the Police Association have said they need at least 200 new officers to regain control in the south-east of the country. 
Thomas Stjernfeldt, from the region’s police association, told SVT : “We are missing extremely many officers in the operational sector, right now we need 200 more officers to be added to the force to establish a reasonable working environment in the southeast of Götaland .” Götaland is one of the regions in the country that has been hit hard by the car fire attacks, which have been occurring throughout Sweden. 
On Monday, Express.co.uk reported a number of the arsonist attacks in the city of Växjö, in Götaland, had been committed by frustrated migrants . Currently there are more than 6,000 suspected crimes that are unsolved in the area and 400 of these cases are suspected to be rapes, murder or attempted murder. 
Mr. Stjernfeldt said the figures are alarming and police officers are constantly forced to work overtime in an attempt to solve the reported crimes. 
The Police Association admitted it fears the public will lose faith in the force and their ability to protect citizens if the situation is not resolved. 
The union’s call for more resources echoes National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson’s February warning, where he said he needed a further 4,100 officers and specialist staff to reestablish law and order in Sweden.

11636,NBA Hopes to Give All-Star Game Back to Charlotte If Bathroom Bill Repealed - Breitbart,"National Basketball Association Commissioner Adam Silver has put North Carolina on notice that the league is not quite done extorting the state over its bathroom law. [During last weekend’s media availability at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans just ahead of   Saturday night, Silver warned Texas not to pass its own bathroom bill or risk receiving the same punishment leveled by the league on North Carolina.  But Silver also revisited what the league did to North Carolina last year by canceling the   Game scheduled for Charlotte and moving it to Louisiana. The move was made because of North Carolina’s HB2 Law that mandates that people using bathrooms on state property use only those facilities corresponding to their birth sex, not the sex they feel like assigning to themselves. Silver noted that he is considering bringing the   Game back to North Carolina if the state repeals its HB2 law. “I have talked to Governor Cooper, the new Governor of North Carolina since he was elected, really to express our desire to return to North Carolina [in 2019] for our   Game,” Silver said in New Orleans. “We have a team in North Carolina. We have a development team, soon to be a   team, in North Carolina. And 20 other teams will visit North Carolina this season. So we’d very much like to get back there. ” “We had a discussion so I understood, certainly, his position, when he was running for office, was   the bill that ultimately led to our leaving,” Silver continued. “So I really was talking to him more to understand, from his standpoint, how he was hoping to move forward in terms of changing that law. My pain purpose of talking to him was to express our desire to return. ” This, of course, is an extortion plot with Silver directly saying that if the state’s duly elected lawmakers don’t bend to the will of a mere sports league and subvert their own political and legislative process, then the NBA will continue to hold the state’s economic   hostage. The NBA isn’t the only sports league looking to extort states over political ideology, of course. The NCAA and the ACC also punished North Carolina over its bathroom law. The NFL jumped into the fray as well, by warning Texas not to pass its own version of North Carolina’s HB2 law. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy warned Texas that the league would take The Lone Star State out of the running for future Super Bowls if such a law makes the books. Needless to say, Texas Governor Greg Abbott did not take kindly to the NFL’s threats. Still, with all these threats and punishments flying around among half a dozen sports leagues, the outcome proves that none of these leagues really have the courage of their convictions. It is all Sturm und Drang signifying nothing  —   at least meaning no real sacrifice for the leagues. After all, notice what the leagues are doing as a protest in support of Black Lives Matter or transgender rights. These leagues are moving games that are easily moved, games that are above and beyond their regular season bouts. They are moving   Games and tournaments, but notice what they aren’t doing? They aren’t taking a real stand by disenfranchising or somehow sanctioning teams in the states they want to punish. In other words, the leagues are making loud statements but making no real sacrifices to prove their convictions. Furthermore, with the always escalating demands of liberals taken as a given, how long will social justice warriors be placated by these easy shows of force by the leagues? How long will it be until they demand that the leagues stop doing all business in states with laws that run against the will of the left? How long until social justice warriors begin demanding that the leagues pull out of these states altogether? We can see a test example in the case of the Washington Redskins. Initially, the social justice warriors only demanded that the team change its name. But it wasn’t long before activists graduated to demanding that the league take action and force the team to change its name. Finally, since the league hasn’t taken any concerted action, these same activists then graduated to appealing to the city, state, and federal governments to bring a boot heel to the neck of Redskins management and ownership. The left always escalates its actions, and it won’t be long before the social warrior set realizes just how empty these moves are by the leagues that have punished North Carolina and are now threatening Texas. Are the leagues prepared to really hurt themselves financially as well as with the fans all just to uphold their proclaimed political beliefs? If not, isn’t what they are doing now empty of real conviction? Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
11637,HARD TRUTH About How a Country Evolves Towards Fascism [MEME],"You are here: Home / US / HARD TRUTH About How a Country Evolves Towards Fascism [MEME] HARD TRUTH About How a Country Evolves Towards Fascism [MEME] October 27, 2016 
Kimberly Morin reports that in 2015, Hillary Clinton gave a speech on Labor Day in Illinois that should seriously send shivers down your spine. 
The woman sounds more like a fascist dictator than a candidate running for United States President. 
In her effort to try and ‘woo’ the union crowd away from socialist Bernie Sanders, she made ridiculous claims like saying it was unions who created the middle class. 
Newsflash Hillary: It was Capitalism that created the middle class, not unions. Unions are working hard to destroy it in the public sector and they are doing a damn fine job thanks to help from lunatic Democrats. 
From Grabien : 
Speaking at a Labor Day rally in Hampton, Ill., today Hillary Clinton threatened to imprison employers for “wage theft.” 
“We’re going to go back to enforcing labor laws,” Clinton said. “I’m going to make sure that some employers go to jail for wage theft and all the other abuses that they engage in.” 
“And we are going to make it harder and harder to stop what should be the right of every American: to join a union and bargain collectively through that union,” she continued. “But, I’ll tell you, we’ve got a fight on our hands.” 
What is she talking about when she mentions ‘wage theft’ and how is she going to jail employers because of it? How will this help the economy? The only ‘wage theft’ that happens in the United States is by the government in the form of taxes. 
The woman is clearly out of her collective mind. She continues to talk about Obama mandating federal contractor provide 7 paid sick days a year to their employees. This is more days than a majority of private sector business offer across the country. Benefits are between an employer and employee. It’s not up to the government to mandate them. 
Make no mistake, just like with most Democrats, Clinton is on board with killing more jobs and hurting small businesses. All while lying through her teeth about wanting to ‘help them.’

11638,Syria’s War for Humanity—The Series,"Copyright Mark Taliano, Global Research, Montreal 2016.

Scroll down for I-BOOK Table of Contents “Syria’s War for Humanity” by Mark Taliano is part of Global Research’s Online Interactive I-Book Series which brings together, in the form of chapters, a collection of Global Research feature articles, including debate and analysis, on a broad theme or subject matter. To consult our Online Interactive I-Book Reader Series, click here. Preface We bring to the attention of our readers Mark Taliano’s I-Book entitled Syria’s War for Humanity . In contrast to most geopolitical analysts of the Middle East, Mark Taliano focusses on what unites humanity with the people of Syria in their struggle against foreign aggression. Author: Mark Taliano Taliano talks and listens to the people of Syria. He reveals the courage and resilience of a Nation and its people in their day to day lives, after more than five years of US-NATO sponsored terrorism and more than two years of US “peacemaking” airstrikes which have largely targeted Syria’s civilian infrastructure. Everybody in Syria knows that Washington is behind the terrorists, that they are financed by the US (at tax payers expense) and its allies, trained and recruited by America’s Middle East partner. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, have been financing and training the ISIS-Daesh, al Nusra terrorists on behalf of the United States. Israel is harboring the terrorists out of the occupied Golan Heights, NATO in liaison with the Turkish high command has since March 2011 been involved in coordinating the recruitment of the jihadist fighters dispatched to Syria. Moreover, the ISIS-Daesh brigades in both Syria and Iraq are integrated by Western special forces and military advisers. While all this is known to the Syrian people, Western public opinion is led to believe that the US is leading a “counter-terrorism campaign” in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State (ISIS-Daesh), an entity created and supported by US intelligence. Image: Damascus National Museum, M Chossudovsky, 2011 “Everything that we saw in Syria speaks of humanity’s common heritage”, says Mark Taliano. Syria is the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia, the Land of Two Rivers, where the early civilizations of the fertile crescent took their roots. This is what the Washington Neocons want to destroy. But to reach their objective they need to wage a dirty propaganda campaign which conveys the illusion that America is involved in a “humanitarian” “peace-making” undertaking. The Syrian people know who the real terrorists are. “The Western assault on this country is an assault on our common humanity, and an assault on Syria’s progressive and forward-looking future”, says Taliano. Mark Taliano focusses on the truth as an instrument for building peace and counter-propaganda: “S hould the West’s “regime change” operations succeed, the secular, pluralist government of President Assad will be replaced by its opposite: a barbaric, sectarian regime, and chaos. Yet Western politicians are seemingly propagandized by their own lies. Or perhaps they see no choice but to cravenly follow diktats from above. Humanity’s better nature, however, demands that we all open our eyes, that we learn from history, and that we embrace the rule of international law rather than the diktats of a criminal Empire. Syria and Syrians must be saved, not destroyed.” Currently, my interests lie in digging for political truths in a world that is rushing headlong into war and barbarism, on a bedrock of lies. When I find such truths, their trajectories invariably lead to peace rather than war. So now, my “crusade’ is to help share the truth, to make it broad-based, and to make a positive difference. The dirty war on Syria is such a blatant example of the supremacy of war, deception — and evil — over civilization, and our common humanity, that my current research interests are defined by what does or does not happen there. If Syria wins, we all win. Right now, she is winning.” Mark Taliano refutes the mainstream media. The causes and consequences of the US-led war on Syria, not to mention the extensive war crimes and atrocities committed by the terrorists on behalf the Western military alliance are routinely obfuscated by the media. Taliano is committed to reversing the tide of media disinformation, by reaching out to Western public opinion on behalf of the Syrian people. “Syria’s stand against the Western agencies of death and destruction is a stand for all of humanity against the dark forces that fester beneath our politicians’ empty words and the courtesan media’s toxic lies.” 
These twenty-seven chapters of Mark Taliano’s Syria’s War for Humanity provide an overview of life in Syria, the day to day struggle of the Syrian people to protect and sustain their national sovereignty. 
Michel Chossudovsky, October 30, 2016 * * * Introduction by Mark Taliano I recently traveled to war- torn Syria because I sensed years ago that the official narratives being fed to North Americans across TV screens, in newsprint, and on the internet, were false. The invasion of Libya was based on lies; so was the Iraq war; likewise for Ukraine. All of the 9/11 wars were sold to Western audiences through a sophisticated network of interlocking governing agencies that propagandize both domestic and foreign audiences. But the dirty war on Syria is different. The degree of war propaganda leveled at Syria, and contaminating humanity at this moment, is likely unprecedented. I had already studied and written about Syria for years, so I wasn’t entirely surprised by what I saw. But what I felt was a different story. 
First Impressions When I awoke on the first morning of my visit, and sat at a table on the polished marble floor beside the fountain, it was still and quiet. The walls of the hotel courtyard surrounded me — rows of hard, dark basalt stone block and intricately carved soft brown stone were woven together with alcoves and archways, all radiating ancient artistry. High vaulted windows overlooked the palazzo, with plants flowing from balconies and the railings of the narrow corridors leading to rooms. Above was the pale blue cloudless morning sky. A pigeon lumbered in and perched inside, sheltered by the ancient walls. A native bird, bluish white, swift and silent, swooped in towards the pigeon, and they were both gone, swept away into the Damascene morning. The quiet returned and the pale blue sky became darker and deeper. Syria will find peace again when this is all over. Syria is an ancient land with a proud and forward looking people. To this ancient and holy land we sent mercenaries, and hatred, and bloodshed, and destruction. We sent strange notions of “exceptionalism”, and waves upon waves of lies. As a visitor I felt shame, but Syrians welcomed me as one of them. This is their story. And these are their voices. 
Testimonies from Syrians 
In this video , Dr. Joseph Saddeh, standing in front of desecrated Christian icons in the ancient and holy city of Maaloula, where Aramaic, the language of Jesus, is still spoken, explains that what happened in Syria was not a “revolution”, and that the terrorists want to destroy everything that is good, and that “they want to make us like them or they will kill us.” 
The terrorists did invade this ancient and holy place, they did destroy religious icons, and they did kill many people. Terrorist-damaged religious iconography at Maaloula, Syria Former al Nusra Front Headquarters, Maaloula, Syria Syrian soldier Dr. Ali Salem – a veterinarian during times of peace – explained that terrorists include “imports” from about 80 countries, street people, thieves, smugglers (diesel fuel and drugs), and those who were forced to fight under the threat of death or the death of family members. 
He said that by now people must understand the truth about what is happening, despite the propaganda that demonizes the Syrian government and its people. The army is the people, he explained, and the government is not a “regime”. When this is over, he said, young people will have to be taught the truth about what happened. Terrorist-destroyed Shrine of Saint Takla, Maaloula, Syria. Listen to the video here. Religious icons were either destroyed or burned. We met soft-spoken, accommodating, Dr. Ali Haidar at at his office. He had earlier explained to Jamal Daoud, leader of the Third International Tour of Peace to Syria , that in 2011, he was offered a large sum of money from Qatar to boycott a “consultation summit” with the government. When he refused the bribe, he received threats, and his son was murdered. The process of national reconciliation, headed by Dr. Haidar, is emblematic of Syrian decision-making processes. The externally-orchestrated war is being resolved internally – by Syrians, for Syrians — and the solutions are often the fruit of a genuine democratic processes, in contrast to the fake democratic processes masquerading as “democracy” in the West, where Western politicians and citizens are heavily propagandized. 
All Syrians are paying a horrible price for the sins of the West. Ammar recounted this nightmare: “As everyday morning my sister was going to the university when a bloody Takfiri Salafi Wahhabi suicide bomber blew up bomb car at the bus stop which led to the martyrdom and injury of many civilians and university students who were going to their exams, after 10 minutes another suicide bomber blew up himself at the same place taking advantage of the gathering of people and ambulance teams, usually when a terror attack happens we call all family members and friends to make sure they all are ok but this time no one answered! Then we started looking for her in hospitals … the shock was in the bloody views there; many burned bodies and human body parts were on the ground , there i saw my sister a body without soul …” 
Madj explained his sentiments: 
“ I am Syrian… living in Syria in the middle of everything. We have seen horrors. It was never a revolution nor a civil war. The terrorists are sent by your government. They are al Qaeda Jabhat al Nusra Wahhabi Salafists Talibans etc and the extremist jihadists sent by the West, the Saudis, Qatar and Turkey. Your Obama and whoever is behind him or above him are supporting al Qaeda and leading a proxy war on my country. 
We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them. 
The majority here loves Assad. He has never committed a crime against his own people… The chemical attack was staged by the terrorists helped by the USA and the UK, etc. Everyone knows that here. 
American soldiers and people should not be supporting barbarian al Qaeda terrorists who are killing Christians, Muslims in my country and everyone. 
Every massacre is committed by them. We were all happy in Syria: we had free school and university education available for everyone, free healthcare, no GMO, no fluoride, no chemtrails, no Rothschild IMF- controlled bank, state owned central bank which gives 11% interest, we are self-sufficient and have no foreign debt to any country or bank. 
Life before the crisis was so beautiful here. Now it is hard and horrific in some regions. 
I do not understand how the good and brave American people can accept to bomb my country which has never harmed them and therefore help the barbarian al Qaeda. These animals slit throats and behead for pleasure… they behead babies and rape young kids. 
They are satanic. Our military helped by the millions of civilian militias are winning the battle against al Qaeda. But now the USA wants to bomb the shit out of us so that al Qaeda can get the upper hand. 
Please help us American people. They are destroying the cradle of civilization. Stop your government. 
Impeach that bankster puppet you have as president… support Ron Paul or Rand Paul (as Libertarians they have opposed foreign interventions—Editors) or anyone the like who are true American patriots. but be sure of one.thing…if they attack and I think they will….it will be hell. 
Be sure that if it were to be a world war, many many will die. Syria can and will defend itself and will sink many US ships. Iran will go to war..Russia and China eventually if it escalates… and all this for what ? For the elites who created al Qaeda through the US government and use it to conduct proxy wars and destabilize countries which do not go along with their new world order agenda !!? 
American people…you gotta regain control of your once admirable country. Now everyone hates you for the death you bring almost everywhere. 
Ask the Iraqis…the Afghans…the Pakistanis…the Palestinians…the Syrians…the Macedonians and Serbs…the Libyans…the Somalis…the Yemenis ….all the ones you kill with drones everyday. Stop your wars. Enough wars. Use diplomacy…dialogue…help…not force.” Jad also shared his tragedy. He told me that his brother was kidnapped last year, and that the terrorists tortured him and destroyed his knees. Now he can’t walk. He also told me that his cousin, who was serving in the Syrian Arab Army, lost his leg when Wahhabi suicide bombers attacked his military vehicle, and that another cousin was kidnapped in 2012, and remains in captivity. The tragedies are legion, but all of the Syrians to whom I spoke assured me that they support the government of Bashar Al-Assad. They are unified in the battle against Western terrorists. The sanctions, the terrorists, the death and destruction, are not working. The alternative, a Western-installed Wahhabi stooge government, is not an attractive option. The ongoing dirty war on Syria is particularly odious because the elected President of Syria, Dr. Bashar Al-Assad, and his wife, represent the best of what Syria’s future promises to be. The Assads are well-educated – like all of the Syrians whom I had the pleasure of meeting – and they are moving ancient, holy Syria into a better future than that promised by the uni-polar, “exceptional” imperialists who are trying to destroy Syria with their Wahhabi-inspired terrorists. 
Syrians have seen the devastation of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Ukraine. They refuse to be the next domino. Syria’s future will include the rule of international law, nation-state sovereignty, self-determination, pluralism, respect for all people, and multi-polar geo-political relationships. Syria has strong institutions, strong people, a strong military, strong allies, and a strong government; and she will not be pulled into the abyss of terrorism like the other aforementioned countries. 
For this we should all be grateful. 
We have just witnessed the pain and hardship that Syria and Syrians are enduring. The next question is, How did the West arrive at the point where otherwise intelligent and morally upright citizens support the illegality and barbarity of their nations’ foreign policies? The simple answer is that the collective mindset of the public has been contaminated by an unprecedented and on-going propaganda campaign that engineers consent for unspeakable crimes that “benefit” transnational elites and impoverish the rest of us. [This is the longstanding nature of US foreign policy, dating back more than a century, even prior to the Civil War, when early imperialist and “Manifest Destiny” believer James Polk seized half of Mexico under trumped-up pretexts and false flags. Meanwhile, the American media have always supported these international crimes, as they do today.—Editors.] The dreadful reality is that the Global War on Terror is actually a global war for terror. The foreign policies of Western nations are increasing the reach of terrorism exponentially, because the West uses these terror brigades as foot soldiers for illegal wars of aggression. In its Syrian campaign, as with its previous Libyan campaign, the West is literally the air force for the terrorists on the ground. This is all well documented with Western sources. US-led NATO is aligned with the Gulf Monarchies, and Israel, to flood Syria with mercenary terrorists, to balkanize and destroy the country, and to remove President Assad, so that it can advance its agenda for a New World Order of conquest under the false banner of the Global War On Terror (GWOT). Through its actions and inactions, its sanctions, its arms dealings, and its pre-planned invasions, the West and the terrorists in Syria are one and the same. We support all the imaginary “moderates”, and every other terrorist organization operating in Syria. Again, the evidence is ample, and well-documented using western sources. US-led NATO is aligned with the Gulf Monarchies, and Israel, to flood Syria with mercenary terrorists, to balkanize and destroy the country, and to remove President Assad, so that it can advance its agenda for a New World Order of conquest under the false banner of the Global War On Terror (GWOT). This on-going project necessarily entails death, destruction, and wide-spread poverty. Neo-con planners hope that the widespread destruction will enable them to control destroyed countries and open them up for predatory and parasitical economic programs — similar to domestic neoliberal economic models that are ravaging domestic economies beneath the lies and diversions. Despotic stooge puppet regimes are easier to control and manipulate than independent sovereign governments that represent the democratic will of their peoples and the rule of international law. Again, this favoured totalitarian style rule is mirrored at home, but more subtly. The notion that we live in democracies is absurd. 
Tentacles of predatory neoliberal capitalism have yet to invade Syria’s famous souks/markets Spices at the Souk F alse flag terrorism is part of the apparatus of deception which serves to advance policies that are contrary to the wishes of those who are deceived.
There’s nothing new about “synthetic terrorism’; it is military doctrine, and examples of its use are legion, but it is a taboo topic and a “conspiracy theory”, so it works. 
The Canada Day pressure-cooker bomber plot was a proven false flag (though not acknowledged as such by mainstream media), and it served the apparatus of deception as did other domestic terrorism cases. 
Even if the Ottawa shooting crisis unfolded exactly as the official narratives described it, the conflation between the shooting and ISIS is surely unfounded, as noted by Senator Mobina Jaffer. 
But the accumulated impact of these events, coupled with largely unquestioned official narratives, has the intended effect of creating a consensus of ignorance wherein otherwise intelligent people support illegal warfare, terrorism, and police state legislation. 
Preeminent Constitutional lawyer Rocco Galati assesses Canada’s C-51 legislation in these words : 
It takes all our private information and shares it with all government agencies, including foreign government. For some citizens that becomes an eventuality of torture and/or death when travelling abroad. 
It restricts arbitrarily who can travel. 
Freedom of expression and political criticism with respect to “terrorism and the government’s role” (becomes) a terrorist offence in itself. So words and thoughts become an act of terrorism under this bill. 
It allows CSIS to disrupt covertly constitutionally-protected rights of association, expression, and protest. 
It does all of this by taking away all and any transparent judicial oversight. 
He says that “We’ve entered into the final fascist state.” 
Consequently, both domestically and abroad, we are living what author Naomi Wolf describes as a “fascist shift” , wherein we unwittingly embrace our own enslavement, global war, and poverty, all for the “benefit” of transnational oligarch classes, and the known catastrophic impacts for humanity. 
Syria is standing strong against these Western cancers of ignorance and evil. She, and her allies, are swooping down on these globalist interlopers. Her victory will be our victory. 
Outline of This Book T he purpose of this book is to shed some light on how the propaganda works, and to decode it and other events, so that we can arrive at a better understanding of what is really happening in Syria, and why.
The degree of war propaganda leveled at Syria, and contaminating humanity at this moment is unprecedented. 
I have yet to meet a single Syrian who would prefer a stooge, Wahhabi dictatorship to the current government. Every single Syrian opposition leader prefers the current government to an imperial -imposed government. The on-going campaign of lies directed at Syria is particularly odious because the elected President of Syria, Dr. Bashar Al-Assad, and his wife, represent the best of what Syria’s future promises to be. 
The Assads are well-educated – like all of the Syrians whom I had the pleasure of meeting – and they are moving ancient, holy Syria into a better future than that promised by the uni-polar, “exceptional” imperialists who are trying to destroy Syria with their Wahhabi-inspired terrorists. 
Syrians have seen the devastation of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Ukraine. They refuse to be the next domino. 
Syrians are unified. Their future will include the rule of international law, nation-state sovereignty, self-determination, pluralism, respect for all people, and multi-polar geo-political relationships. Syria has strong institutions, strong people, a strong military, strong allies, and a strong government; she will not be pulled into the abyss of terrorism like the other aforementioned countries. 
For this we should all be grateful. 
The compilation of articles in this book decode the propaganda apparatus which creates an engineered consensus that serves the covert agenda of expanding the parasitical economic model called “neoliberalism”. 
Neoliberalism impoverishes domestic and foreign populations, and enriches a transnational oligarch class. The transnational oligarch class — enriched by “deregulation”, “privatization” schemes, and “free trade” agreements — contaminates the collective mindset of humanity with its foundations, its lobbying, and its undue influence, so its real nature, and its very existence, remains hidden. Rarely will a mainstream publication even use the word “neoliberalism”, which is the economic foundation of the current class system. 
Part One is the story of Syria as told by Syrians, unfiltered by mainstream media (MSM) propaganda. We see and hear the trauma lived by defiant, heroic Syrians, and we discover that this ancient, holy land will surely survive the current barbarian invasion, and will rise again as a beacon of civilization, hope, and dignity, in contrast to so many of those countries that seek to destroy it. 
Voices from Syrian citizens are absent from mainstream media stories. Syrians are like you and me. This is what they have to say: 
“We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them.” I Am A Syrian Living in Syria: “It was Never a Revolution nor a Civil War. The Terrorists are sent by your Government” 
The externally-orchestrated war is being resolved internally – by Syrians, for Syrians — and the solutions are often the fruit of a genuine democratic processes, in contrast to the fake democratic processes masquerading as “democracy” in the West, where Western politicians and citizens are heavily propagandized. 
NATO et al. terrorists destroy everything that contradicts their deviant ideology. They seek a “blank slate” that denies and negates the real Syria. 
Syria insists on being a sovereign nation; it refuses Empire’s head-chopping criminality. 
“Syria was prosperous, with a growing economy. It had food sovereignty, with a “strategic” stock of millions of tons of high quality wheat , not the “Franken-food” bio-tech variety; it had a strong central bank with no usurious IMF loans ; it had a popular, reformer President; it had a mostly well-educated, secular, pluralist, forward-looking population; and it was the fourth safest country in the world.” 
Part Two elaborates upon the real story about Syria, and the drivers behind the current dirty war, in which the U.S-led Empire is using terror proxies to advance its predatory reach, contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of Syrians. 
The alternative to Syria’s elected government is genocidal despotism and Sharia law. The (non-existent) “moderates” can’t be separated from the “extremists”, because all of the mercenary terrorists share the same goals and the same ideologies. 
The predictable result of engineered deception is that domestic Western populations remain deceived and politically passive. The truth is inverted, and large swaths of the population remain deluded. Whereas the West and its allies support all the terrorists invading Syria, domestic populations think that we are fighting terrorism. This is the great fraud of the “Global War On Terror”. 
The West uses mercenary terrorist proxies to advance its predatory reach; to destroy foreign countries; and to increase global terrorism exponentially, all for the benefit of the oligarch classes. There is nothing new about this. 
“The secular governments of Iraq, Libya, and Syria all — prior to Western invasions — opposed terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda.” Dedication 
This book is dedicated to the people of Syria, all of whom are on the front lines in the fight against international terrorism.

11640,Democrats Facing Elections Refusing to Hold Town Hall Meetings,"As the media focuses on a handful of contentious town hall meetings held by Republican senators, several Democrats who face   campaigns this year have quietly decided to skip town halls to meet their constituents. [With the Republican Party in the majority, Senate Democrats are keeping a low profile in the hopes of giving voters fewer reasons to vote against them, the Associated Press reports.  The AP notes, “The nation’s most vulnerable Senate Democrats are avoiding town hall meetings as their Republican counterparts get pummeled by an energized electorate frustrated with President Donald Trump’s early agenda. ” Missouri’s Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill, for instance, has rebuffed offers to hold a town hall in a state that went for Donald Trump by 18 points last year. “Seems to me that all these members of Congress are afraid to face their constituents,” Hillary Shields, a member of Kansas City Indivisible, said after the senator turned down its invitation. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has also decided to bag a town hall event for his voters. Manchin has been one of the leading Democrats to give Trump and Republicans some measure of support, and it is not too surprising to see Manchin throwing in with Republicans on some issues. After all, West Virginia voted Trump with a lopsided 68. 7 percent to Hillary Clinton’s low 26. 5 percent. But Manchin clearly understands that he is vulnerable to being challenged by a Republican in a state turning red. As to others, the AP noted that Ohio’s Sherrod Brown has only held phone conference calls that do not lend themselves to mass protests. Also, Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey promised to hold a town hall but has not scheduled any yet, and Montana Senator Jon Tester’s office noted he has already held several appearances, though none of them were town   events. Democrats are forewarned, though, especially after the hostile crowd Arkansas’ Republican Senator Tom Cotton faced this week, Senator Cotton was barely allowed to get a word in edgewise as   liberal protesters screamed at him, chanted at him, and berated him for the Trump administration’s agenda.

11642,Hillary’s Criminal Plan for the Internet,"American Thinker October 27, 2016 
You’re probably appalled at the American media’s shameless whoring for Hillary Clinton, asking yourself why they would so thoroughly debase their much-touted journalistic ethics. President Obama has answered that question. 
As reported by Agence France Presse, during a recent speech in Pittsburgh he postulated: 
“We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to. 
“There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world.” 
Set aside the outrageous, un-American gall in proposing that any central authority should “curate” information put out to the public, and walk with me for a minute down a meandering path of speculation. 
It is, or course, the World Wide Web in which Obama’s informational “wild-wild west” exists. This is the realm of Breitbart, Cybercast News Service, the Drudge Report , World Net Daily , American Thinker , and other non-establishment outlets that persist in making the president uncomfortable. 
And what has happened recently to affect the World Wide Web? The U.S. government has handed over control to ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the nonprofit agency that assigns website domain names. 
Is it in the president’s mind that ICANN might someday assume the “curating function” he sees as necessary to insure “truthiness” in web-based news reporting? 
Well, according to ICANN Board Chair Stephen D. Crocker, diverse membership in the organization makes such a thing unthinkable. Quoted by the tech site C/NET, Crocker said: 
“This community validated the multistakeholder model of internet governance. It has shown that a governance model defined by the inclusion of all voices, including business, academics, technical experts, civil society, governments and many others is the best way to assure that the internet of tomorrow remains as free, open and accessible as the internet of today.” 
His confidence is echoed by the Internet Governance Coalition, a group of technology firms that includes Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Verizon, among others. They issued a statement that lauds ICANN’s “strong accountability measures” and upholds “the bottom-up approach that embodies the very nature of the open internet we experience today.…” 
Pardon the skepticism to which I’ve become increasingly prone, but this sounds very much like the “collaborative” concept of governance that prevails in the academic world. 
If you’ve ever applied for a position at a college or university, you know that what a search committee wants most urgently to know about you is whether you have a “collaborative style” of working. 
What exactly is a “collaborative style,” as understood in today’s academic world? It means that you won’t do anything to contradict the orthodoxy in thought and procedure reigning on campus — in other words, that you are “politically correct” in your outlook.",0
11643,Panama Papers Show How Rich United States Clients Hid Millions Abroad - The New York Times,"Over the years, William R. Ponsoldt had earned tens of millions of dollars building a string of successful companies. He had renovated apartment buildings in the New York City area. Bred Arabian horses. Run a yacht club in the Bahamas, a rock quarry in Michigan, an   company in Canada, even a   hedge fund. Now, as he neared retirement, Mr. Ponsoldt, of Jensen Beach, Fla. had a special request for Mossack Fonseca, a   law firm well placed in the world of offshore finance: How could he confidentially shift his money into overseas bank accounts and use them to buy real estate and move funds to his children? “He is the manager of one of the richest hedge funds in the world,” a lawyer at Mossack Fonseca wrote when the firm was introduced to Mr. Ponsoldt in 2004. “Primary objective is to maintain the utmost confidentiality and ideally to open bank accounts without disclosing his name as a private person. ” In summary, the firm explained: “He needs asset protection schemes, which we are trying to sell him. ” Thus began a relationship that would last at least through 2015 as Mossack Fonseca managed eight shell companies and a foundation on the family’s behalf, moving at least $134 million through seven banks in six countries  —   little of which could be traced directly to Mr. Ponsoldt or his children. These transactions and others like them for a stable of wealthy clients from the United States are outlined in extraordinary detail in the trove of internal Mossack Fonseca documents known as the Panama Papers. The materials were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and have now been shared with The New York Times. In recent weeks, the papers’ revelations about Mossack Fonseca’s international clientele have shaken the financial world. The Times’s examination of the files found that Mossack Fonseca also had at least 2, 400 United   clients over the past decade, and set up at least 2, 800 companies on their behalf in the British Virgin Islands, Panama, the Seychelles and other jurisdictions that specialize in helping hide wealth. Many of these transactions were legal there are legitimate reasons to create offshore accounts, particularly when setting up a business overseas or buying real estate in a foreign country. But the documents  —   confidential emails, copies of passports, ledgers of bank transactions and even the various code names used to refer to clients  —   show that the firm did much more than simply create offshore shell companies and accounts. For many of its American clients, Mossack Fonseca offered a   guide of sorts on skirting or evading United States tax and financial disclosure laws. These included locating an individual from a “ ” jurisdiction to be the straw man owner of an offshore account, concealing the true American owner, or encouraging one client it knew was a United States resident to use his foreign passports to open accounts offshore, again to avoid scrutiny from regulators, the documents show. If the compliance department at one foreign bank contacted by Mossack Fonseca on behalf of its clients started to ask too many questions about who owned the account, the firm simply turned to other, less inquisitive banks. And even though the law firm said publicly that it would not work with clients convicted of crimes or whose financial activities raised “red flags,” several individuals in the United States with criminal records were able to turn to Mossack Fonseca to open new companies offshore, the documents show. Federal law allows United States citizens to transfer money overseas, but these foreign holdings must be declared to the Treasury Department, and any taxes on capital gains, interest or dividends must be paid  —   just as if the money had been invested domestically. Federal officials estimate that the government loses between $40 billion and $70 billion a year in unpaid taxes on offshore holdings. Experts in federal tax law, money laundering and offshore accounts  —   asked by The Times to examine certain documents or at least to identify legal issues raised by the money management techniques that Mossack Fonseca advocated  —   said the law firm at times had come up with creative, but apparently legal, strategies to save clients money. A common tactic: selling real estate as a shift of corporate assets, instead of as a piece of property subject to transfer taxes. While the experts were reluctant to declare that the law firm or its clients had broken any laws given that no charges have been filed, they said they were surprised at how explicitly Mossack Fonseca had offered advice that appeared carefully crafted to help its clients evade United States tax laws. “The more correspondence that you have between a U. S. person and a bank or law firm discussing tax issues and efforts at concealment, the stronger the government will see it as a potential case worth prosecuting,” said Kevin M. Downing, the lead Justice Department prosecutor in the UBS offshore banking and tax evasion cases, now at the Washington law firm Miller  Chevalier. Mossack Fonseca has said repeatedly in recent weeks that its lawyers and staff members have honored international tax and banking laws, and that it is the victim in this case of an illegal hacking attack. But presented with summaries of several cases by The Times, Mossack Fonseca did not try to explain its actions. It simply said that its standards had improved in recent years, as rules internationally had tightened. “Our significantly expanded compliance office today not only evaluates new client candidates, but also existing accounts, and especially those that were established prior to the new international regulatory regime coming into effect,” a spokeswoman said in a written statement, referring to a 2010 law passed by Congress. “It wasn’t always this way. ” The firm’s American client list does not appear to include the sort of   political figures who have emerged from reporting on the Panama Papers in many other countries around the world. But the services offered by Mossack Fonseca, with 500 employees in more than 30 offices worldwide, were in high demand by the rich and famous in the United States. In 2001, Sanford I. Weill, then the chief of Citigroup, set up an offshore account called April Fool for his yacht. Alfonso Soriano, a former Major League Baseball   player with the Yankees and other teams, had a Panamanian corporation created for him. John E. Akridge III, a leading real estate developer in Washington, flew to Panama to meet with Mossack Fonseca lawyers, who in 2011 created the Cyclops Family Foundation in Panama, along with a related bank account. A spokesman for Mr. Weill said the accounts were used for legitimate purposes, and “appropriate disclosures were filed. ” Mr. Akridge and Mr. Soriano did not respond to repeated requests for comment. For its best customers, like the Ponsoldts, who declined repeated requests to discuss their work with Mossack Fonseca, the firm’s ministrations went far beyond legal services and banking. It acted as a concierge for “all details regarding your properties and worldwide business affairs,” for example, helping the family confidentially purchase (and dispose of) luxury condominiums at resort destinations and even arranging repairs for a car stored at a vacation home and hiring a contractor to fix broken poolside tiles, the documents show. “You deserve the best Mr. Ponsoldt, and we will try to help you the most we can,” the firm explained in an email. The firm’s American clients often expressed disbelief at how much they could lighten their tax burden by using the techniques advocated by Mossack Fonseca. “At hearing that he can make nearly $8 million per year just on tax savings,” a client from Pennsylvania “was now wide awaken,” a Mossack Fonseca staff member wrote. “I could even detect sweats coming down from his forehead and his cheeks were beginning to blush with crimson excitement. Noticing his interest, I went in for the kill. ” In 2006, using a secret email account set up by Mossack Fonseca so his correspondence would not be traced by the authorities, a businessman from Washington State asked a common question among the firm’s potential American clients: “How does a US citizen legally get funds to Panama without the knowledge of the US government and how can those funds be profitably invested without the US government knowing about them?” The reply came from Ramsés Owens, then a partner who helped run the firm’s trust division, offering clients “effective solutions to enhance your privacy, protect your wealth. ” Mr. Owens laid out a basic menu of services: a package deal setting up an offshore company in what he promised would be a relatively cheap and quick transaction. “We have right now a special offer by which we create a Private   combination for a flat fee of US$4, 500. 00,” Mr. Owens said. “It includes Charter Documents, Regulations, nominee officers and directors, bank account and management of funds, provision of authorized signatories, neutral phone and fax numbers and mail forwarding services for both the private foundation and its underlying company. ” With this legal structure in place, Mr. Owens went on to explain, any money placed in these accounts would essentially go into a black hole. “If we create a Private Foundation and the underlying company for you, the funds become completely private (US cannot know) as soon as the funds are deposited under a bank account or investment account in the name of the underlying company or the private foundation,” he wrote. The benefits of such an arrangement were numerous, he added, detailing how the client could effectively evade United States tax laws while protecting himself  —   and the firm. “You can take the money in cash, you can do a bad investment you can purchase something and not receive anything (an expensive piano, an expensive software),” Mr. Owens wrote. “You can receive an invoice from Panama or any other location and that would justify some of the outgoing moneys. You can also declare everything to the tax administration. “Any decision you make, please be aware that you will have to sign a ‘disclaimer’ to us. We can only ‘suggest,’ but the final decision to take the money out of the country is fully yours, and under the professional opinion of someone in USA. ” This was the sort of menu sold to the Ponsoldt family  —   in a very big way. William Ponsoldt, now 74, had come to Mossack Fonseca with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, the firm’s staff estimated in “due diligence” memos that also laid out how he had become so wealthy. “He has started off in the 70ties purchasing   apartment buildings in New York, in order to refurbish and sell them off,” noted one memo from 2007, shortly after the firm had started to handle the family’s investment accounts. “Having done this for a while he spread out to various businesses and his CV is the typical profile of a serial entrepreneur. ” The memo went on to list nine businesses he had created, taken over or helped run, including Glas Aire Industries Group, an automotive parts supplier Zeus Energy Resources, a Texas   company Regency Affiliates, which owned a Michigan rock mine and Pegasus Ranch, one of the country’s largest    operations. Few American clients, the records show, demanded and received as much attention as Mr. Ponsoldt and two of his children, Tracey and Christopher, each of whom was assigned a secret email account and a code name  —   “father,” “daughter” and “son. ” Mossack Fonseca’s “V. I. P. service” consisted of everything from securing lunch reservations at a popular French bistro in Panama City to pressing the government to make an exception and grant Mr. Ponsoldt and his wife Panamanian passports. Over the years, tens of millions of dollars flowed into a series of shell companies  —   Escutcheon Investment, with its money at the Banca Privada in the Pyrenees principality of Andorra Probity Investments, with deposits at Andbanc Grup Agricol, also in Andorra Royal Pacific Investments, with deposits at Balboa Securities in Panama and Valdano Investments Group, with deposits at Berenberg Bank in Switzerland, among others, the bank records and other documents show. Mossack Fonseca employees were named as the companies’ officers, avoiding whenever possible any link to the Ponsoldt family. The firm even asked a Hong Kong branch of Barclays, the international bank, to override its rules for proof of the   beneficial owners of the accounts. “This is a very special client of ours,” a Mossack Fonseca lawyer wrote, conceding that the firm had intentionally created such a maze of companies so it “leaves us in the position to legally argue that our client is NOT the owner of the structure. ” It was not clear if the bank complied. The most important part of this elaborate structure was an entity called the Edenstone Foundation. Panama has long specialized in creating unusual foundations like Edenstone that are neither subject to Panamanian taxes nor required to support charitable causes. They do, however, allow the investors who “contribute” their financing to shield themselves from legal claims in the United States. In secret meetings documented in the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca named the Ponsoldt family as the beneficiary, through the foundation, of the money placed in bank accounts around the world. Among the early requests: confidentially transfer $800, 000 from “father” to “son,” meaning moving the money to yet another offshore account  —   called LBFH of Panama  —   which Mossack Fonseca had set up on Christopher Ponsoldt’s behalf with bank accounts in Andorra and Panama. One motivation for Christopher Ponsoldt to stash money overseas in accounts not traceable to him: He owned a dirt racetrack in Florida, and he was concerned racers “may get hurt and might then try to sue him for damages,” the law firm notes on his case file said. “Please notify me when the money is deposited in American dollars,” Christopher Ponsoldt wrote to the law firm a few months after his father’s accounts had been set up and $800, 000 was in the process of being transferred to another offshore account Christopher Ponsoldt controlled via the firm. “I want to have U. S. dollars, Australian Dollars, Indian Real’s and some kind of China index, to be determined. ” Mossack Fonseca agreed to “prepare a service agreement” between two of the legal entities it managed for the family, to make it look as if there were an actual expenditure of money for a business purpose. “After receiving the money, we will explain to them the nature of this transaction without giving details of your name,” the firm explained to William Ponsoldt, regarding the Caribbean bank through which the money was moving to his son. “Please let us know if you agree with this and if you will instruct the relevant parties to execute the wire transfer. ” Federal law generally limits such   transfers between family members to $14, 000 a year. But for this transfer, described as a “  distribution,” the documents give no indication that any United States gift taxes were paid, as would most likely have been required, said Jack Blum, a lawyer and expert in international tax evasion who served for more than a decade as a consultant to the Internal Revenue Service. “This is one way in which people with a lot of money step away from being average,” Mr. Blum said after reviewing the documents. Christopher Ponsoldt declined to comment. “I am sorry, I can’t help you,” he said before hanging up. Tracey Ponsoldt Powers, William Ponsoldt’s daughter, approached the firm in October 2008 with an urgent request for help in secretly moving some of her family’s money to Panama and then into gold coins. She feared political developments at home. “I feel VERY unsettled with this election and how the media is censoring information and spinning the American Public to vote Obama,” she wrote to Mr. Owens at Mossack Fonseca. “It is so obvious to me, that they are setting us up with a Socialist  —   but most people can’t see it happening before their eyes! It’s like propaganda that is brainwashing Americans to forget the Principles of Hard Work, Ingenuity, Risk and Boundless Success!” Mr. Owens suggested shifting the money into a “charity” account, controlled by the firm on the family’s behalf, in increments of less than $100, 000, so it would not be detected. Separately, that same month, William Ponsoldt moved $100, 000 from a company Mossack Fonseca controlled on his behalf into the name of his daughter. This was confirmed in an email from Mossack Fonseca to the code name “daughter. ” “The USD 100. 000 is deposited as call Money with high liquidity at Berenberg Bank Schweiz, Zürich,” said the email, which added: “Your Father initiated this process as you know. We will treat you with the same esteem and conditions and service as the family is used to. ” The subsequent series of complicated transfers  —   money from the account would eventually be used by Mossack Fonseca in 2013 at Ms. Powers’s request to buy real estate  —   would be a challenge for American enforcement authorities, Mr. Blum said. “Simply by constructing all this in such a complex way, they make it extremely hard for enforcement officials to ever have resources to reconstruct what taxes should have been paid,” he said. “What this is all about is obscuring the trail. ” Ms. Powers did not respond to a series of calls and emails, and then declined to answer questions when reached on a cellphone. “I have no idea what you are talking about,” she said before hanging up. Across the United States, Mossack Fonseca picked up clients who had similarly urgent and delicate demands. For more than 30 years as the founder of Boston Capital Ventures, Harald Joachim von der Goltz has built a reputation as a savvy investor in emerging companies. What few know, however, is that over roughly that same span of time and with the help of Mossack Fonseca, Mr. von der Goltz has also come to command a vast offshore empire: interconnected corporations, foundations and bank accounts with about $70 million in assets, according to internal emails. A lawyer for Mr. von der Goltz said the beneficial owner of all of the trusts and accounts is Mr. von der Goltz’s    mother, who resides in Guatemala. One document also suggests that the tens of millions of dollars in the accounts originally came from businesses operated by Mr. von der Goltz’s father. But numerous other documents prepared by Mossack Fonseca and signed by Mr. von der Goltz list him as the founder, manager and “first beneficiary” of the foundation that controls most of the family’s wealth. Mr. von der Goltz also put assets from companies he helped operate into the accounts, documents show. Most important, Mossack Fonseca registered Mr. von der Goltz as a resident of Guatemala, which tax experts said could help him protect the family money from certain United States tax obligations. “MF Trust has registered Harald Joachim von der Goltz as a client of Guatemala. However, we know he lives in Miami and makes his residence for 5 months of the year in Boston,” Mr. Owens, the Mossack Fonseca partner, wrote in an email in 2009 to top executives at the firm. The firm recognized that claiming the Guatemala residency represented a risk, but considered it a risk worth taking, given Mr. von der Goltz’s importance to the firm. “My suggestion: Leave everything as it is with von der Goltz, i. e. stay and live this potential risk, we might prefer to send money orders and cashier’s checks, which have a slightly lower risk than bank transfers. It’s all well done, customer understands well and accepts it as is,” Mr. Owens wrote. “I agree with your suggestion on my part,” responded Ramón Fonseca, one of the firm’s founders. Money was frequently transferred from several of the offshore accounts to accounts in the United States to fund investments at Mr. von der Goltz’s firm, the documents show. A foundation paid for his daughter’s education, as well as his granddaughter’s high school tuition. In a 2008 email, Mr. von der Goltz’s   accountant asked executives at Mossack Fonseca to wire money from Mr. von der Goltz’s mother, Erika. “Erika would like to make a gift to Tica of $100, 000 for his birthday. She hadn’t given him anything,” the email said, providing an account for Mr. von der Goltz at Espírito Santo Bank in Miami. “Ohh, yes, I know ERIKA wants it to be done quickly, we will proceed,” Mr. Owens responded before confirming that the money should be moved as requested. Legal experts consulted by The Times said it was difficult to determine definitively if the arrangements related to Mr. von der Goltz violated United States laws. But they said such moves were commonly used by investors seeking to hide their assets and evade federal taxes. “There is reason to question if she was really directing that shift of money,” Mr. Blum said, referring to Mr. von der Goltz’s mother. In a statement, Mr. von der Goltz said the companies were established for legal purposes, and that both he and the companies were compliant with United States tax and reporting requirements. “There has never been any illegal activity associated with these companies,” the statement said. Other case files examined by The Times show how Mossack Fonseca may have turned a blind eye in the vetting process while helping Kjell Gunnar Finstad, a Texas resident, set up an oil company offshore in 2013. Mossack Fonseca has long maintained that it will not work for individuals with criminal records or whose conduct raises “red flags” during its   process. But the firm somehow either missed or overlooked Mr. Finstad’s past when it conducted a background search of potential directors for the new offshore oil company, OK Terra Energy, which was run out of Houston but registered in the British Virgin Islands. Three years earlier, Mr. Finstad, the company’s controlling partner and lead investor, had been convicted in Norway for various breaches of securities and accounting laws involving a company called Norex Group. The case was major news in Norway. The records examined by The Times show that Mossack Fonseca collected a copy of Mr. Finstad’s passport, and conducted a basic internet search and a cursory background check. But there is no mention of the fraud case, and no discussion of whether to proceed with setting up the new company, in light of Mr. Finstad’s involvement. Reached at his office in Texas and asked about the Panama Papers, Mr. Finstad said only, “I don’t want to talk about that. ” For another client, Mossack Fonseca offered a special service for a premium price. Marianna Olszewski, the New York   author of “Live It, Love It, Earn It: A Woman’s Guide to Financial Freedom,” wanted to shift $1 million held by HSBC in Guernsey to a new overseas account. The catch? She did not want her name to appear anywhere near the transaction. Mr. Owens, the Mossack Fonseca lawyer, again offered a solution. Mossack Fonseca would locate what he called a “natural person nominee” in a “ ” jurisdiction to stand in for Ms. Olszewski as the owner of the account. “The Natural Person Trustee is a service which is very sensitive,” Mr. Owens wrote. “We need to hire the Natural Person Nominee, pay him, make him sign lots of documents to cover us, make him sign resignations, make him get some proofs evidencing that he has the economic capacity to place such amount of moneys, letters of reference, proof of domicile, etc. etc. ” The process, he suggested, would cost her at least $17, 500. Ms. Olszewski approved the maneuver  —   only to see the firm, at one point, accidentally disclose her name to the banks involved. “Ramses, Please call me ASAP!! This is important! !!!” she wrote to Mr. Owens. “HSBC said someone said marianna olszewski is the principal   beneficary! Who has done this!! I need you to call me immediately and tell them hsbc that was a mistake! !!!! !!!!! This is not good and I asked you NOT to do this! this is why we have this structure. ” Mr. Owens sought to calm her down, saying that Mossack Fonseca could tell the bank that the natural person nominee actually controlled the account. “This can be solved,” he wrote. Mr. Owens did not tell his client the identity of the natural person nominee, saying simply, “We would appoint a UK citizen residing in Panama since 50 years ago, engineer, entrepreneur,” as they needed someone who would be expected to have such a large amount of money available to transfer. Twelve days later, Mr. Owens sent HSBC a copy of a passport for a man named Edmund James Ward. “Kindly please find hereto attached the due diligence documents of the beneficial owner,” said the email sent to HSBC, noting that “the documents duly correct. ” The $1 million from Ms. Olszewski was then transferred to the new accounts, with an assurance that she need not worry. “If for any reason something happens, please also bear in mind that Mossfon is covered by insurance policies for US$10 Million (per event),” Mr. Owens wrote. “We have never used our insurance policy to cover a ‘fraud,’ or something like this. ” The use of a   to hide the true ownership of an account is one of the remaining illegal ploys favored by Americans today as international banks, under pressure from the United States, demand proof of account ownership, said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor from Miami who specialized in criminal tax offenses, adding that he could not comment directly on this case. “The fact that a law firm was willing to do this legitimizes the process for their clients,” he said. Many of the client files  —   like those for Mr. Weill, the banker Mr. Soriano, the ballplayer and Mr. Akridge, the developer  —   contain little information on the purpose of the offshore accounts, or how they were used after they were set up, making it impossible, based on the records available, to assess whether they were used legitimately. But the experts who reviewed some of the documents related to the Ponsoldts, Mr. von der Goltz and Ms. Olszewski said that the firm itself seemed to realize it was taking risks. “They were not always sure themselves which side of the line they were on at any given moment,” said Ross S. Delston, a former federal banking regulator who now specializes in combating   efforts. “It is apparent that members of the firm were aware they were treading very close to the line. ” In fact, the files contain instances, beginning before the Panama Papers came to light, of Mossack Fonseca lawyers   their actions. (In recent weeks, the firm has shut down many of its operations in Nevada, as well as British locations in Jersey and the Isle of Man, and is closing the   division that served many of its United States clients.) In 2013, Mossack Fonseca advised Ms. Olszewski to seek outside counsel and consider reporting herself to the I. R. S. warning of possible “severe” repercussions if she did not. The warning came in the wake of a Justice Department investigation of the role that certain Swiss banks had played in helping United States citizens evade federal taxes. Records show that Mossack Fonseca had been paid at least $102, 000 over nine years to help Ms. Olszewski handle various transactions. Ms. Olszewski took the firm’s advice, and belatedly disclosed her accounts to the I. R. S. the documents show. And by 2014, she asked Mossack Fonseca to shut down her accounts and offshore entities, which collectively held at least $1. 7 million. “I’m in complete compliance with all my U. S. tax and reporting requirements,” Ms. Olszewski said in an emailed statement when The Times asked about the accounts. In a second statement, she said she had relied on the advice of legal counsel to establish a trust for her family while living abroad. “I am confident that I have acted properly,” she added, “and any insinuation otherwise is false. ” Reached by telephone in late May, Mr. Owens, who is no longer with the law firm, said only, “Regretfully, I cannot speak about individual clients or my time at Mossack Fonseca. ” Mossack Fonseca sent a series of similar and increasingly dire warnings to the Ponsoldts in 2013 and 2014, telling them that they had to provide a Swiss bank with documentation that they had paid all required United States taxes  —   or face possible investigation. “Neither your ex Trustees nor us would like to be involved into any measure the US Department of Justice might try to enforce,” the firm wrote. “In this regard, again we strongly urge you to take the necessary steps to avoid any negative consequences for you as well as us. ” The records examined by The Times give no indication whether the Ponsoldts complied, and family members would not say when asked. “I don’t know what you are talking about,” Christopher Ponsoldt said in a second brief conversation before he again hung up.",0
11644,#GrammysSoWhite Came to Life. Will the Awards Face Its Race Problem? - The New York Times,"Before the rapper   of A Tribe Called Quest shouted “Resist! Resist! Resist!” at the top of his lungs at the Grammy Awards before Busta Rhymes called Donald J. Trump “President Agent Orange” and referenced his “unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban” before Tribe and Anderson . Paak kicked their way through an oversize wall and brought dozens of people of a wide range of nationalities onstage (along with a dance troupe that recalled Public Enemy’s   S1Ws)   introduced his group’s performance with some words of encouragement and defiance: “We’d like to say to all of those people around the world, all of those people who are pushing people who are in power to represent them: Tonight, we represent you. ” These were words for the disenfranchised from a stage that has long connoted power and influence. In the current political moment, in which membership in the American experiment is subject to greater and greater obstacles, this performance was a loud statement of pushback. That is especially true given that the Grammys find themselves in the throes of similar friction over belonging. Simply put, the Grammys, like America, have an inclusion problem  —   or more to the point, an exclusion problem. The 59th annual installment of the ceremony, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night, was as noteworthy for who won as who didn’t, for who attended as for who opted to sit out. It was a show about borders  —   who is allowed to cross, who isn’t and who doesn’t even bother trying. Adele won all five Grammys she was nominated for, including album of the year (for “25”) record of the year and song of the year (for “Hello”) besting Beyoncé in all three categories. “25” is Adele’s least impressive album, but its    soul belting is the sort of classicism likely to appeal to the Recording Academy voting members, who tend to skew older and more traditional. Beyoncé’s album “Lemonade” (and the song “Formation,” nominated in the other two categories) is musically provocative and wide ranging, and rife with commentary about the meaning of blackness in the United States. At the end of the night, when Adele won album of the year, she deferred to Beyoncé: “The way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering,” Adele told her from the stage, while behind her, a huge gaggle of predominantly white male songwriters and producers clapped enthusiastically. In that moment, just a few feet separated Adele and Beyoncé, but the chasm between their treatment by the Grammys was huge, and potentially unbridgeable. It was #GrammysSoWhite come to life. For years, Kanye West has complained about how black artists  —   himself, but also others  —   are mistreated in the main Grammy categories. This year, Frank Ocean, fatigued with the Grammys’ handling of black music, opted to not even submit his music for consideration. (The other big   category, best new artist, was won by a black artist, Chance the Rapper.) The Grammys’ race problem is so pernicious that some white winners have chosen contrition over exuberance  —   Adele’s embrace of Beyoncé, Macklemore’s apology to Kendrick Lamar in 2014 (Macklemore reportedly did not submit his most recent album for consideration this year)  —   demonstrating a greater understanding of the fundamental imbalance of the Grammys system than the Grammys themselves. Despite minor rule changes and lip service to the idea of better representation, the Grammys remain on the defensive. In the days leading up to this year’s telecast, the show’s longtime producer, Ken Ehrlich, deflected Mr. Ocean’s criticisms in an interview with Rolling Stone, earning a rebuke from Mr. Ocean on Tumblr: “Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I’m one of the best alive. And if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it. ” The Grammys’ consistent celebration of   white acts feels like   rule in an evenly divided nation, while the royalty from the other side  —   Beyoncé and Jay Z, Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna  —   looks on politely from the front rows. (Or, in the case of Mr. West and Mr. Ocean, who did not attend the Grammys, not even looking on.) There was also frisson in the ceremony’s lumpy attempts to bridge the age gap: When the show tried to highlight the work of Neil Diamond, via a clumsily executed version of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” routine, it was clear that most of the assembled stars didn’t know the words to “Sweet Caroline. ” And in a country in which around 15 percent of the population  —   more than 50 million people  —   speaks Spanish, there were no   or even bilingual, performances. The language was heard only during the   segment, and in a Johnnie Walker ad that featured a pointed bilingual cover of “This Land Is Your Land” by the Los Angeles band Chicano Batman. Again, strictly controlled borders. It’s in these moments that the Grammys’ lack of imagination and tolerance contrasts with the general progressive political stances of the artists it celebrates. During the show, Ms. Lopez quoted Toni Morrison on the role of art in fraught political times. Katy Perry performed “Chained to the Rhythm,” her new    single, with an armband that read “PERSIST”  —   a reference to  Elizabeth Warren’s recent Senate silencing  —   and concluded in front of an image of the Constitution. Beyoncé performed in a gold crown that suggested a futuristic Lady Liberty, and during her acceptance speech for best urban contemporary album, preached about the power of inclusion: “It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families  —   as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys  —   and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent and capable. ” Honoring Beyoncé in categories devoted to black music goes part of the way to fulfilling that vision, but it’s where she’s not honored that feels more pointed: She has won 22 times, but only four of those awards have been in   categories. (She has lost album of the year three times, to Beck, Taylor Swift and Adele.) So long as the Grammys continue to strike a blow for the values of yesteryear over the energy of today, they will remain an agent of the status quo, not resistance or evolution. But when an institution stands still while its citizens are pressing for change, how long can the borders hold before everyone outside is let in, or everyone inside decides it’s not worth staying, and leaves?",0
11645,Why Even Some Republicans Are Rejecting the Replacement Bill - The New York Times,"Republicans in Congress are fond of calling Obamacare a death spiral of escalating costs and declining coverage. But their replacement plan could make those problems even worse. Tuesday, the morning after two House committees released legislation that would replace the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care Act, the plan received a tepid, even hostile reaction from many outside conservative groups and Republicans in Congress. The bill does less than many conservatives had hoped to open up the market for health insurance. And it still offers the kind of subsidies to   people that they see as too generous. Mike Lee, a conservative senator from Utah, described the bill as “not the Obamacare repeal bill we’ve been waiting for. ” (It perhaps goes without saying that it has been universally panned by Democrats.) And here’s why. Republicans are constrained by their small majority in the Senate. Instead of passing a normal piece of legislation that could change the Affordable Care Act’s many insurance regulations, they are limited to changes that can be accomplished through a technical budgetary maneuver, a reconciliation bill. The result is likely to be higher prices for insurance, and fewer people with the ability to buy it. ”The individual market seems less stable under this bill than under the Affordable Care Act,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. “This bill comes across as a bit of a Frankenstein health bill because of the legislative strategy that’s being used. ” Many conservative legislators would prefer a reprise of a 2015 bill that would have simply swept away much of Obamacare. But the current bill’s drafters have felt political pressure from President Trump and their constituents to preserve some of the health law’s coverage gains. Their efforts to preserve popular parts of the law and work within the special budget rules have led to the uneasy mix of policies in the bill. The bill keeps many of the Affordable Care Act’s rules for insurance companies that Republicans have decried for raising costs. Here’s what stays. ■ The health law’s rule that insurance companies must sell polices to the healthy and the sick at the same price. ■ Its rule that insurance companies can’t limit the benefits they pay out in a year or a lifetime. ■ Its requirements that all plans cover 10 categories of benefits, including preventive health services without a   rehabilitation services and maternity care. ■ The law’s caps on how much customers can be asked to pay for health care through deductibles and  . Those are popular provisions they tend to make insurance coverage comprehensive but also somewhat costly. (The main reason that health insurance plans are expensive, of course, is because medical care is expensive, and the bill doesn’t do anything about that either.) Because they all stay, the rest of the policy changes are built atop a chassis of health insurance products that cost what today’s plans cost. The bill effectively slashes subsidies that help many   people buy insurance, starting in 2020. A    earning $20, 000 in Lincoln, Neb. currently gets a subsidy of $18, 470 to help her buy insurance, with extra subsidies to help her pay deductibles and   according to calculations made by Kaiser. Under the new legislation, she would get a subsidy of $4, 000, and no help with cost sharing. The bill also does away with Obamacare’s requirement that people have insurance or pay a fine. That provision is unpopular, but it is seen as an important incentive for healthy people to buy insurance every year. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating that provision would lead to premiums that are 20 to 25 percent higher, even without any cuts in subsidies. As a counterweight, the bill does some things that would tend to stabilize prices. It gives states a big pot of money to help keep markets working. It allows insurance companies to charge higher prices to old customers and less to younger ones. That is not so good for our hypothetical    in Nebraska, but might help lure some healthy    into the market who don’t buy insurance now. It also creates a new kind of financial incentive to buy insurance: People with a lapse in insurance coverage of more than a couple of months would have to pay a 30 percent higher price for their insurance when they   the market. Advocates say this provision would get people to stay insured when they are healthy so they can afford coverage later. But some critics think it could backfire, since only sick people would be willing to pay the extra fee, which might not be enough to cover the extra cost of their care. “The people who are going to take this gamble are going to be the healthiest,” said Craig Garthwaite, the director of the health program at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “The only time you are going to get them into the market is if they get sick. ” Insurers have been vague so far on how they feel about this mix of policies. And the Congressional Budget Office, Washington’s official scorekeeper, has not weighed in with estimates of how many people would be covered or what the bill would cost the federal government. But several health policy experts have said they believe the policy changes could result in the loss of health insurance for 10 million Americans or more. Joe Antos, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he sees some good ideas in the health bill, but estimated that it would cost 10 to 15 million people their insurance over the coming decade: “It can’t be a cohesive whole, because the things that can’t be in a reconciliation bill aren’t here. ”",0

11647,DHS Shuts Down Anti-Deportation Office - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has   an   program to have 21   agency officials cooperate with     groups. [“The [21 officials’] job was to go meet politicians, Congress people, advocate groups, and local law enforcement,” complained Sarah Saldaña, a top DHS official from 2014 to early 2017.  “Let them see you as a person, as opposed to big, bad ICE,” said Saldana, who created the cooperation program when she ran DHS’s U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement division from 2014 to 2017.  Trump’s DHS executives “really are taking away the [21 officials’] ability to go out in the community and do what it is that we were hoping they would get done,” Saldaña told Foreign Policy magazine. The “we” in her comment refers to the Democratic Party, which replaced by the   Trump administration on January 20. The 21 employees assigned to the program have now been assigned to Trump’s new Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office, which helps Americans recover from the huge number of crimes inflicted by the illegal aliens who were allowed into the country during President Barack Obama’s   tenure. VOICE is just a “report your local illegal” program, Saldana responded. “From what I understand is being reported, it’s: ‘Oh, I see my   neighbor’s landscaper. He looks Mexican. I want to report him. Maybe someone ought to pick him up,’” said Saldana, who told a Capitol Hill panel in 2015 that ICE’s job was “public safety,” not actual enforcement of the nation’s popular immigration laws. According to Foreign Policy: Saldaña maintains that before Trump’s election ICE was poised to greatly expand the outreach program and “remove the curtain” from immigration enforcement activities. Community relations officers were being trained to assuage fear in immigrant communities with facts about the agency’s priorities and activities. Since 2014, ICE’s focus has changed [from deporting illegals] to deporting violent criminals, gang members, and recent arrivals. Saldaña said this policy opened the door to building trust with a variety of community groups, encouraging them to report serious criminal activity   …     “I was trying to go out to the communities and explain: ‘We are interested in criminals, not in the family of four who has been here 40 years and has not broken any other laws,’” Saldaña said. Under Obama, federal officials slashed efforts to repatriate illegals and even foreign criminals. DHS Secretary John Kelly directed the new policy change in a February 25, 2017 memo, where he said:  I direct the Director of ICE to immediately reallocate any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens (except as necessary to comply with a judicial order) to the new VOICE Office, and to immediately terminate the provision of such outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens. Analysts estimate that roughly 11 million illegal aliens are living in the United States. Roughly 8 million of the illegals hold jobs, which adds up to one job for each of the four million young Americans who turn 18 each year. The illegals’ inclusion in the nation’s labor pool makes it harder for young Americans to get   jobs, and annually transfers roughly $500 billion from employees to employers, according to George Borjas, a Harvard professor. In addition, illegal immigrants inflict a huge number of crimes on Americans.  For example, almost   of a million aliens were registered at Texas jails from June 2011 to May 2017. Their convictions included 496 murders, 26, 000 assaults, 8, 400 burglaries, 246 kidnappings and 2, 900 sexual assaults.  ",0
11648,The ‘Saddest’ Polar Bear Lives in a Mall in China - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   In a shopping mall in southern China, a polar bear named Pizza paces past murals of icebergs in his glass enclosure. He shakes his shaggy head under artificial lights. He crouches by an air vent to sniff the outside world. All are distress behaviors, say Chinese animal welfare advocates, who on Tuesday called on Zhu Xiaodan, the governor of Guangdong Province, where Pizza lives in an aquarium at the Grandview Mall in Guangzhou, to move the bear to a more appropriate environment. Pizza has become known as “the world’s saddest polar bear,” the advocates, from 48 organizations, wrote in an open letter to Mr. Zhu. They added that they hoped that “the Guangdong government would close Grandview Polar Sea World. ” Hundreds of animals are housed in small enclosures over several floors of the mall, including arctic wolves and beluga whales. They share the retail emporium with an electronic games arcade for children, a   movie theater, a supermarket and leading domestic and international clothing brands. Escalators in an atrium run past signs advertising Swarovski and Estée Lauder products, noodle restaurants and coffee shops. The activists say Pizza’s plight is part of a disturbing trend in China: exhibiting wild animals in malls to attract customers as more people turn to often cheaper and more convenient  . At a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, representatives of four of the animal welfare groups showed reporters photographs of an elephant used to sell cellphones outside a mall on the outskirts of Beijing and sea lions offered for interactions with shoppers who spend more than 500 renminbi, about $75, at another mall in Beijing. A “mall zoo” similar to Grandview is under consideration in Shijiazhuang, in Hebei Province, they said. “Animals deserve so much better than being enclosed in a glass box, with very little in it, to attract shoppers,” said Hu Chunmei of the Endangered Species Fund. “It shows a complete lack of regard for their welfare. ” In Beijing, squirrels, parrots, llamas and goats, as well as domestic animals such as cats and dogs, are sometimes displayed in cages or glass enclosures in shopping malls. At lunchtime, the crowds massed around them can be several people deep. Asked to comment this week, the Grandview Mall aquarium defended itself against the criticism, which has spread around the world. Recently, the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in England offered to take in Pizza  —   an offer indignantly declined by the aquarium. “Pizza is very healthy,” it said in an emailed statement, adding that the aquarium was engaged in scientific education and research and in the protection of biodiversity. “You can’t entirely separate animal welfare from these social benefits. ” The aquarium is no different from other facilities in China or the world, the statement said. It has 130 specialists caring for its hundreds of animals, it said. News reports that Pizza is suffering in inadequate conditions are distorted and have been referred to the authorities, it said, in a thinly veiled warning of possible legal action. Pizza is popular with shoppers, according to reports in the Chinese news media, with thousands of people visiting on peak days to take selfies and knock on the glass. Wild animals like polar bears require a large natural habitat to maintain their physical and mental health, said Wendy Higgins, a spokeswoman for Humane Society International. “Their environment is so unique. They’re such   animals, and they start to decline quite rapidly in captivity,” Ms. Higgins said in a telephone interview. “Pizza spends every single day on his own with nowhere to hide, just subjected to people banging on the glass and taking photographs,” she said. Qin Xiaona, the director of the Capital Animal Welfare Association, said that criticism by the mall management, which has accused the activists of doing foreigners’ bidding, was an insult to China’s people and culture. “They say, ‘You are using a Western point of view’ in order to oppose us,” Ms. Qin said. “But we can’t forget that we have a tradition in China of ‘respecting heaven, caring for animals.’ ” She added, “Because of economic competition, we’ve regressed,” leading to the widespread abuse of animals  —   and people  —   in recent decades. “We want to revive our tradition,” she said. Yu Hongmei of VShine, an organization in Dalian, agreed on the impulse behind the campaign to help the animals at Grandview Mall: “It’s not foreign. It’s our tradition, too. ’’ China has not had an animal welfare law since the 1930s, under the Nationalist government of Chiang   who was defeated by the Communists in 1949. A Wildlife Protection Law came into force in 1989 and was updated in July, but it allows the capture and breeding of wild animals for commercial purposes and permits the use of wild animals for public displays and performances. A draft law on animal cruelty that would extend protection to pets, farm livestock and laboratory animals was proposed in 2009 but has yet to be adopted. Practices such as the dog meat festival in Yulin continue to attract headlines. Calls to the Guangzhou provincial government and the Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Bureau for comment on Tuesday went unanswered.",0
11649,Exclusive — President Trump: Oscars ‘Were Focused so Hard on Politics’ They Could Not Get the Basics of the Ceremony Right - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   President Donald Trump, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in the Oval Office, said that the Academy Awards failure on Sunday evening was due in large part to Hollywood’s obsessive focus on politics —  attacking him, generally speaking. [Trump told Breitbart News in the exclusive interview that the Oscar fail may have been avoided had Hollywood’s finest focused less on attacking him and more on getting the event’s details right.  “I think they were focused so hard on politics that they didn’t get the act together at the end,” President Trump said. “It was a little sad. It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn’t feel like a very glamorous evening. I’ve been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad. ” The Oscars comprised just one part of a lengthy interview, which ranged in topics from healthcare to tax cuts to immigration to trade and more. The rest of the interview is forthcoming here on Breitbart News. At the Oscars on Sunday evening, the Academy Award for Best Picture was read out by presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as being for La La Land —  not the actual winner, Moonlight. The flub —  already being dubbed the worst in the Academy Awards’ history —  has forced accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to apologize after overseeing the   process for 83 years. “We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,” the firm said in a release, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation. ” The Hollywood Reporter’s Erik Hayden explained the  : In years past, the firm has provided two sets of winners’ envelopes in briefcases that are sent to the Dolby Theatre, one briefcase for either side of the stage. In what was was supposed to just be a memorable movie reunion, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway ended up fumbling the presentation of best picture, as they were apparently holding the best actress envelope instead. Not only did Dunaway read off La La Land as the best picture winner, the confusion wasn’t fixed until after several members of the Lionsgate movie’s team had already spoken. “I opened the envelope and it said ‘Emma Stone, La La Land.’ That’s why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny,” Beatty clarified, laughing nervously. The awful mistake came after hours of   by the Hollywood elites, who hammered the president in joke after joke. Now, the president has got the last laugh as he hammers Hollywood for its epic fail. More from President Trump’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News is forthcoming.",0

Joy Behar asked, “So Mark your name has actually been tossed around as a potential presidential candidate. Let’s make news here. Are you into it?” Cuban replied, “Definitely. No. We’ll see what happens. ” Discussing Trump’s tweets, Cuban said “He is an idiot. I don’t care what he says. Right? I got a thick skin. He doesn’t. ” Cuban said that it is not Trump’s inexperience that is the problem saying, “No one is ever totally qualified to be the president. What it takes is leadership skills, so you know what you don’t know  …    You’re never going to know everything to be the president. You have to be smart enough to say, here’s where my strengths are. Here’s what I don’t know, and let me find the best people to do that. And then listen to those people. You can make an argument that Donald Trump has hired some good people around him. Maybe some you don’t love. He has hired good people, but he never listens. And if you are not willing to listen, if you are not willing to learn —   the entire job  —   the only certainty of the job of president is the uncertainty. You don’t know what’s next. ” He added that Trump was “oblivious to life. ” “He has no  .

11651,"How to Love: Legendary Zen Buddhist Teacher Thich Nhat Hanh on Mastering the Art of ""Interbeing""","How to Love: Legendary Zen Buddhist Teacher Thich Nhat Hanh on Mastering the Art of ""Interbeing"" “To love without knowing how to love wounds the person we love.” By Maria Popova / brainpickings.org 
What does love mean, exactly? We have applied to it our finest definitions ; we have examined its psychology and outlined it in philosophical frameworks ; we have even devised a mathematical formula for attaining it. And yet anyone who has ever taken this wholehearted leap of faith knows that love remains a mystery — perhaps the mystery of the human experience. 
Learning to meet this mystery with the full realness of our being — to show up for it with absolute clarity of intention — is the dance of life. 
That’s what legendary Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, teacher, and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh (b. October 11, 1926) explores in How to Love ( public library ) — a slim, simply worded collection of his immeasurably wise insights on the most complex and most rewarding human potentiality. 
Indeed, in accordance with the general praxis of Buddhist teachings, Nhat Hanh delivers distilled infusions of clarity, using elementary language and metaphor to address the most elemental concerns of the soul. To receive his teachings one must make an active commitment not to succumb to the Western pathology of cynicism , our flawed self-protection mechanism that readily dismisses anything sincere and true as simplistic or naïve — even if, or precisely because, we know that all real truth and sincerity are simple by virtue of being true and sincere. 
At the heart of Nhat Hanh’s teachings is the idea that “understanding is love’s other name”— that to love another means to fully understand his or her suffering. (“Suffering” sounds rather dramatic, but in Buddhism it refers to any source of profound dissatisfaction — be it physical or psychoemotional or spiritual.) Understanding, after all, is what everybody needs — but even if we grasp this on a theoretical level, we habitually get too caught in the smallness of our fixations to be able to offer such expansive understanding. He illustrates this mismatch of scales with an apt metaphor: 
If you pour a handful of salt into a cup of water, the water becomes undrinkable. But if you pour the salt into a river, people can continue to draw the water to cook, wash, and drink. The river is immense, and it has the capacity to receive, embrace, and transform. When our hearts are small, our understanding and compassion are limited, and we suffer. We can’t accept or tolerate others and their shortcomings, and we demand that they change. But when our hearts expand, these same things don’t make us suffer anymore. We have a lot of understanding and compassion and can embrace others. We accept others as they are, and then they have a chance to transform. Illustration from Hug Me by Simona Ciraolo 
The question then becomes how to grow our own hearts, which begins with a commitment to understand and bear witness to our own suffering: 
When we feed and support our own happiness, we are nourishing our ability to love. That’s why to love means to learn the art of nourishing our happiness. 
Understanding someone’s suffering is the best gift you can give another person. Understanding is love’s other name. If you don’t understand, you can’t love. 
And yet because love is a learned “dynamic interaction,” we form our patterns of understanding — and misunderstanding — early in life, by osmosis and imitation rather than conscious creation. Echoing what Western developmental psychology knows about the role of “positivity resonance” in learning love, Nhat Hanh writes: 
If our parents didn’t love and understand each other, how are we to know what love looks like? … The most precious inheritance that parents can give their children is their own happiness. Our parents may be able to leave us money, houses, and land, but they may not be happy people. If we have happy parents, we have received the richest inheritance of all. Illustration by Maurice Sendak from Open House for Butterflies by Ruth Krauss 
Nhat Hanh points out the crucial difference between infatuation, which replaces any real understanding of the other with a fantasy of who he or she can be for us, and true love: 
Often, we get crushes on others not because we truly love and understand them, but to distract ourselves from our suffering. When we learn to love and understand ourselves and have true compassion for ourselves, then we can truly love and understand another person. 
Out of this incomplete understanding of ourselves spring our illusory infatuations, which Nhat Hanh captures with equal parts wisdom and wit: 
Sometimes we feel empty; we feel a vacuum, a great lack of something. We don’t know the cause; it’s very vague, but that feeling of being empty inside is very strong. We expect and hope for something much better so we’ll feel less alone, less empty. The desire to understand ourselves and to understand life is a deep thirst. There’s also the deep thirst to be loved and to love. We are ready to love and be loved. It’s very natural. But because we feel empty, we try to find an object of our love. Sometimes we haven’t had the time to understand ourselves, yet we’ve already found the object of our love. When we realize that all our hopes and expectations of course can’t be fulfilled by that person, we continue to feel empty. You want to find something, but you don’t know what to search for. In everyone there’s a continuous desire and expectation; deep inside, you still expect something better to happen. That is why you check your email many times a day! Illustration from The Missing Piece Meets the Big O , Shel Silverstein’s minimalist allegory of true love 
Real, truthful love, he argues, is rooted in four elements — loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity — fostering which lends love “the element of holiness.” The first of them addresses this dialogic relationship between our own suffering and our capacity to fully understand our loved ones: 
The essence of loving kindness is being able to offer happiness. You can be the sunshine for another person. You can’t offer happiness until you have it for yourself. So build a home inside by accepting yourself and learning to love and heal yourself. Learn how to practice mindfulness in such a way that you can create moments of happiness and joy for your own nourishment. Then you have something to offer the other person. 
[…] 
If you have enough understanding and love, then every moment — whether it’s spent making breakfast, driving the car, watering the garden, or doing anything else in your day — can be a moment of joy. 
This interrelatedness of self and other is manifested in the fourth element as well, equanimity, the Sanskrit word for which — upeksha — is also translated as “inclusiveness” and “nondiscrimination”: 
In a deep relationship, there’s no longer a boundary between you and the other person. You are her and she is you. Your suffering is her suffering. Your understanding of your own suffering helps your loved one to suffer less. Suffering and happiness are no longer individual matters. What happens to your loved one happens to you. What happens to you happens to your loved one. 
[…] 
In true love, there’s no more separation or discrimination. His happiness is your happiness. Your suffering is his suffering. You can no longer say, “That’s your problem.” 
Supplementing the four core elements are also the subsidiary elements of trust and respect , the currency of love’s deep mutuality: 
When you love someone, you have to have trust and confidence. Love without trust is not yet love. Of course, first you have to have trust, respect, and confidence in yourself. Trust that you have a good and compassionate nature. You are part of the universe; you are made of stars. When you look at your loved one, you see that he is also made of stars and carries eternity inside. Looking in this way, we naturally feel reverence. True love cannot be without trust and respect for oneself and for the other person. Illustration by Julie Paschkis from Pablo Neruda: Poet of the People by Monica Brown 
The essential mechanism for establishing such trust and respect is listening — something so frequently extolled by Western psychologists, therapists, and sage grandparents that we’ve developed a special immunity to hearing it. And yet when Nhat Hanh reframes this obvious insight with the gentle elegance of his poetics, it somehow bypasses the rational cynicism of the jaded modern mind and registers directly in the soul: 
To love without knowing how to love wounds the person we love. To know how to love someone, we have to understand them. To understand, we need to listen. 
[…] 
When you love someone, you should   bring relief and help him to suffer less. This is an art. If you don’t understand the roots of his suffering, you can’t help, just as a doctor can’t help heal your illness if she doesn’t know the cause. You need to understand the cause of your loved one’s suffering in order to help bring relief. 
[…] 
The more you understand, the more you love; the more you love, the more you understand. They are two sides of one reality. The mind of love and the mind of understanding are the same. 
Echoing legendary Zen teacher D.T. Suzuki’s memorable aphorism that “the ego-shell in which we live is the hardest thing to outgrow,” Nhat Hanh considers how the notion of the separate, egoic “I” interrupts the dialogic flow of understanding — the “interbeing,” to use his wonderfully poetic and wonderfully precise term, that is love: 
Often, when we say, “I love you” we focus mostly on the idea of the “I” who is doing the loving and less on the quality of the love that’s being offered. This is because we are caught by the idea of self. We think we have a self. But there is no such thing as an individual separate self. A flower is made only of non-flower elements, such as chlorophyll, sunlight, and water. If we were to remove all the non-flower elements from the flower, there would be no flower left. A flower cannot be by herself alone. A flower can only inter-be with all of us… Humans are like this too. We can’t exist by ourselves alone. We can only inter-be. I am made only of non-me elements, such as the Earth, the sun, parents, and ancestors. In a relationship, if you can see the nature of interbeing between you and the other person, you can see that his suffering is your own suffering, and your happiness is his own happiness. With this way of seeing, you speak and act differently. This in itself can relieve so much suffering. 
The remainder of How to Love explores the simple, profoundly transformative daily practices of love and understanding, which apply not only to romantic relationships but to all forms of “interbeing.” Complement it with John Steinbeck’s exquisite letter of advice on love to his teenage son and Susan Sontag’s lifetime of reflections on the subject , then revisit the great D.T. Suzuki on how Zen can help us cultivate our character .

11652,Hillary Finally Concedes: “This Is Painful and It Will Be for a Long Time”,"
After what appeared to be a refusal to concede late last night (via John Podesta), followed by Trump’s victory speech, in which he referred to a concession call by his opponent, Hillary Clinton finally issued her concession speech at around 11:30 AM Eastern time.
The tone was clearly bitter, though it was cloaked in the hopeful language of continued efforts.
After questions about whether or not Donald Trump would have the wherewithal to admit defeat and accept election results, it turned out to be Hillary who had apparent difficulty in giving up.
SEE: Is Something Wrong With Hillary? Will NOT Concede Tonight – Refuses To Speak To Crowd – Health Episode? 
But reality set in, and she went on stage, albeit more than an hour after she was scheduled to do so, to admit her loss.
She played to what might have been her largest and most enthusiastic crowd to date on the 2016 campaign trail.

Partial transcript: 
Thank you so very much for being here. I love you all, too. Last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. 
I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I’m sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. 
But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together. This vast diverse creative unruly energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. 
I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it, too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this. 
Our campaign was never about one person, or even one election. It was about the country we love and building an America that is hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America, and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power. 
[…] 
To anyone that sent contributions, even as small as $5, that kept us going, thank you. To all of us, and to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this — I have, as Tim said, I have spent my entire life fighting for what I believe in. 
I’ve had successes and setbacks and sometimes painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional, public, and political careers — you will have successes and setbacks too. 
This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it. 
[…] 
And so we need — we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me: I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. 
Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will — and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. [Cheers and applause] 
And to all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams. [Cheers and applause]

11653,Pacific Islanders may have DNA of unknown human species,"Science Alert Tue, 25 Oct 2016 Hints of an unidentified, extinct human species have been found in the DNA of modern Melanesians – those living in a region of the South Pacific, northeast of Australia. According to new genetic modelling, the species is unlikely to be Neanderthal or Denisovan – two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record – but could represent a third, unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists. 
“We’re missing a population, or we’re misunderstanding something about the relationships,” Ryan Bohlender, a statistical geneticist from the University of Texas, told Tina Hesman Saey at Science News. Bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid DNA that modern humans still carry today, and say they’ve found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn’t the whole story. 
It’s thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of Africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass. This contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes. And that’s not all they’ve given us. 
Earlier this year, researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals , and found that they’re associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression, heart attack, and a number of skin disorders. And a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts – otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) – were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa. 
While our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the Denisovans – the distant cousins of Neanderthals – is less clear. The problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia, but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008 . 
Using a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans, Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent. That result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. 
But when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia – a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, West Papua, and the Maluku Islands. 
As Hesman Saey explains for Science News: 
“Europeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry, and people in China have a tiny amount – 0.1 percent, according to Bohlender’s calculations. But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals. And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. 
While investigating the Denisovan discrepancy, Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians.” 
“Human history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,” he told her. 
This find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, who analysed DNA from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 locals from the Papua New Guinea highlands. 
As we reported last month, this was the most comprehensive genetic study of Indigenous Australians to date, and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth, dating back more than 50,000 years ago. But the results revealed something else – DNA that was very similar to that of the Denisovans, but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third, unidentified hominid . “Who this group is we don’t know,” lead researcher Eske Willerslev told Hesman Saey. 
Until we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesised third human species (some fossils would be nice), we can’t prove this , and we should point out that Bohlender’s estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed , so they might shift with further scrutiny. And it could be that our identification of Denisovan DNA is more ambiguous than we think, given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth. 
But the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we’d assumed, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise, when you think about it. Just because we don’t see them in the fossil record doesn’t mean they didn’t exist – preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn’t easy, and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up. 
Hopefully, the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies, the more hints we’ll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn’t make it to modern times. 
The results of Bohlender’s analysis were presented last week at the 2016 American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Canada. © Guido Amrein Switzerland/Shutterstock Melanesian children of Papua New Guinea Share:",0
11655,Self-Help and the War on Common Sense,"=By= Jimmie Moglia Editor's Note The mechanism of control of the population is hiding in plain sight. It is the unwavering focus on self. Whether it is self-help, self-exploration, the inner self, the inner child, the focus is inward and a lifetime of training in narcissism. However, it is the planting of a seed that roots so deep that is on one hand and uncertainty of self, and on the other is a gut level distrust of the world. Then it is all muxed so thoroughly that there is a constant need of reassurance and the psycho babble self help self first over all. Welcome to faux individualism twenty-first century style. “… I talk of dreams, which are the children of an idle brain, begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind 
Romeo and Juliet, act 1, sc. 4 W e know of the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war on crime and sundry others. Less known is the war on common sense. It is waged daily on the victims and preys of the Self-help and Actualization Movement, or SHAM. It is a 9 billion $/year industry selling verbal fluff, illusion and fraud with total impunity.
The impunity is guaranteed by the implicit and indirect association of the self-help industry with organized religion. The difference being that whereas religion sells happiness in the next life, self-help sells success in the current, under the guise of fulfilling the customer’s dreams. For, taking issue with the claims of the former is unthinkable. Hence organized religion provides a wide umbrella for all kinds of activities promising results without proof of delivery. 
The army of the self-help salesmen consists of instructors with over-inflated and/or non existing credentials, veritable “riddling merchants for the nonce,” (1) promising to buyers that the winter of their discontent (2) will bloom into the summer of their satisfaction, if they purchase their advice at a considerable price. 
They flatter the imagination with glittering ideas of wealth, power and ultimate fulfillment, easily obtainable by just wishing for them. Their ‘recipes’ for self-help are like Polonius’ “ springes to catch woodcocks ” (3) and those woodcocked by television, tabloid magazines and infomercials. 
The self-help “instructors” are thousands – they deliver their pearls of wisdom, with statements like, for example, “Ya gotta want it!” The utterer of this profound truth was Tommy Lasorda, an ex baseball player turned helper for the self-helpless. He charges or charged $30,000 an hour for advice as follows, “The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person’s determination.” 
The encyclopedia of platitudes and nonsense-in-drags supplied by self-help providers would be thick – I can only quote some examples. 
Here is an extract from the manual “Stop Selling, Start Partnering – The New Thinking About Finding and Keeping Customers.” 
Customers learn the new mode of thought at the Pecos River Learning Center in New Mexico. The three-day course combines classroom-style learning with physically challenging outdoor activities, such as falling off walls and descending mountain walls attached to a rope. Other similar centers include self-confidence building by resisting starvation or thirst. But here is a winning ticket from the Pecos River Learning Center (italics as in the original) “Playing to Win. We called this spirit, visit life strategy, playing to win. Playing to Win is the alternative strategy to playing not to lose. Playing to Win has nothing to do with the conventional understanding of winning, which is that if I win, someone else has to lose. Playing to win is a personal strategy defined as going as far as you can with all that you’ve got. The underlying tenet of blank to win is that life is about growing, accepting challenges, and never giving up. The most fulfilled, productive, and loving lives are those in which people have overcome challenges, have grown as a result, and constantly go as far as they can with everything they’ve got. Make no mistake. Playing to win is by far the more difficult strategy, because we often need to endure a short term pain to achieve long-term gain. For example saying you want to start your own business. That usually means you must quit your current job, get a second mortgage on your home, run the risk of failing, and struggle for a few years before it pays off. In the end, if it does stay off, you get to enjoy feelings of fulfillment and success. Yet, most people, when considering the choice, shy away from commitment, from the risk and the possibility of discomfort.” 
Anyone can see that “Playing to win” compounds obviousness with emptiness. Here, and in hundred similar cases, we are witnessing evidence that “The empty vessel makes the greatest sound.” (4) 
And yet, it is emptiness that survives even death. When the founder of the “Pecos River Learning Center” died, in his obituary it was possible to read, “Larry Wilson, who provided training through Wilson Learning and Pecos River Learning Center to a wide range of organizations that included Disney, the Minnesota Vikings and the CIA, has died.” 
Unsaid was, however, that after the Minnesota Vikings undertook the extremely expensive training, the team arrived last in the championship of that year. We must shudder to think what results the CIA achieved, after mastering the art of “Playing to Win.” 
The Pecos River Learning Center was later sold to another similar conglomerate for 16 million $. 
Self-Help organizations, or self-helper individuals posing as organizations are in the thousands. I choose at random the “Option Institute.” Among many different “courses” here is the “Inner Strength Boot Camp” – a week-long program that will lighten the purse of each student of 4,650 dollars. 
Baffled about a boot camp for “Inner Strength”? No problem. Here is the explanation, quote We’re all familiar with the term “boot camp.” An intensive, no-holds-barred, all-out, 8-cylinder experience where participants walk through the fires of deep personal challenge. And, in the end, they have rebuilt themselves into something – someone – vastly stronger and more powerful. Inner Strength BOOT CAMP takes this concept deeper. In truth, we can go through an “outer” strength boot camp, but no amount of physical exercise prepares us for the heavy lifting we face in our lives – financially, with our health, in our relationships, and within our careers. In the end it all comes down to Inner Strength – creating a way for ourselves to think and feel so that we have an unwavering, unstoppable, indestructible sense of our own strength, confidence, self-acceptance, and clarity. To accomplish this, we’ve constructed a course that powers through nine straight days of intensive work on you. (But you’re still only away for one workweek.) In this course, we help you to dig deep into every aspect of yourself. Once you’ve done that, we can (lovingly and non-judgmentally) challenge you to build who you are into the version of yourself that you always wanted to be, always thought you could be, but haven’t quite seen yet. In the end, we may not be able to control everything. But we can become people who determine how we handle everything. We can gain the tools to construct a core of strength, confidence, and clarity on the inside that’s impervious to events on the outside. We can be our own rock. And that’s why Inner Strength BOOT CAMP isn’t about changing the world. It’s about changing YOUR world. Would you like to: *** Remain truly relaxed and unfazed in the face of the judgments and criticism of others? *** Know who you are – without taking what others do personally or needing them to validate you? *** Create more loving relationships with the people that matter most to you? *** Overcome the obstacles that keep you from being present to what’s really important in your life? *** Speak authentically without fear? *** Sustain a sense of peace and comfort with an unpredictable world? *** Stay strong in what you believe and what you want? *** Understand exactly how you work…so you can change and rebuild the parts that don’t? If so, Inner Strength BOOT CAMP is for you. The way it works is that you arrive on Friday night, and then go full-blast from Saturday until the next Sunday. You will be shocked at how far you can get by taking a course in this totally immersive style (while still only being away for one workweek). Some special methods unique to Inner Strength BOOT CAMP: *** The Inner Strength Diary:A unique method of tracking your changes – and keeping yourself accountable *** Happiness Interaction Training Tactics (HITTS): Practical strategies getting people to treat you the way you want to be treated while living what you’ve learned *** The Book:The most powerful interactive exercise we’ve ever taught for learning to be totally present and focused *** The Two Sides of You: A special activity where we use digital enhancement technology to show you sides of yourself you might never have imagined *** What If???:A navigational path we help you create for yourself that allows you to completely trust your ability to take care of yourself – no matter what *** The “Ask Anything” Project: A method allow you to to get to know your fellow participants – and anyone else in your life – in a unique way unquote 
And, should you still have doubts about the uniqueness of all this obviousness, there is an abundance of “testimonials.” People providing them span the range of human characters and are engaged in all pursuits that swarm upon the earth, from chef/caterers to software engineers. Here is the testimonial from a chef/caterer. quote I signed up for Inner Strength with a feeling that if it didn’t help, I’d be lost. Not only did the program give me practical, easy-to-use tools to help build my inner strength, it also helped me discover strengths I did not know I had. I’m now equipped to face anything in my path, and to deal with all issues with clarity and happiness. My life is no longer a battleground – it’s a playground! unquote 
But where are the roots and which are the reasons for the extraordinary success of this ultimate industry of fluff? 
It is a case of “Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied…” (5) For, the idea of obtaining instructions on the ways of the world is as old as the Bible, the Greeks and the Romans. In my view, the best “self-help” manual ever written is still Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations.” 
More recently, in 1937 Dale Carnegie published “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” The appeal of the book, in my view, consists not so much in the advice, which is sound, but in making the reader feel better emotionally. In fact, though by and large people do not behave at all as the manual suggests, the reader realizes that cultivating humanitarian and genteel feelings towards others has some kind of official sanction – even if, in practice and too often, kindness and openness are rated as symptoms of weakness. Unless, of course the “influenced people” see profit in being influenced. 
The same considerations apply to N.V. Peale’s “The Power of Positive Thinking.” It is amply proven that when man is no longer cold, hungry or fearful, he becomes unhappy. It is “… the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul.” (6) The book suggests measures to alleviate the symptoms. 
Nevertheless, the seminal event, triggering the chain reaction of self-help mania, was the 1967 book “I’m OK – You are OK.” Which, by the way, prompted the much more realistic publication of “I am dysfunctional, you are dysfunctional.” 
Yet, “There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things.” (7) It is not by chance that the blossoming of the self-help industry coincided with the de-industrialization of the country, the “downsizings”, the “consolidations” and the explosive growth of part-time jobs. In essence, the factual impoverishment of the country paralleled the enrichment of the financial industry, which essentially is air, or rather paper, for practical reasons. Paper can be more easily manhandled, maneuvered, hidden, stolen and monopolized, hence the dramatic divergence in prosperity between the 1% and the rest. 
Unable to fight back, “the miserable have no other medicine but only hope.” (8) Searching for solutions, large sections of the populace became the natural target (or victims) of the self-help industry. Whose psychological modus operandi is as follows: Dissecting the meaning of basic ideas such as right and wrong, good and bad, winning and losing etc. Giving alternative new connotations to words and concepts, e.g. family, love, discipline, blame, excellence and self-esteem. 
Afterwards, or as a result of this lexical sleigh-of-hand, the ‘market’ is split into two segments: The victims, whose motto is “It’s not my fault”, and The empowerers, whose motto is “I think, therefore I win, I daydream, therefore I accomplish.” 
The victimhood syndrome has found acceptance even outside the realm of the self-help industry. As I was writing this article, the daily newspaper of where I live, told the story of a criminal just condemned to 10 years in jail. He had stolen someone’s car, and a few days later, by chance, the rightful owner of the car spotted it in the parking lot of a store. Having another set of key, he opened the door of his car. Whereupon the thief reached him, threw him to the ground, stomped on his head and almost killed him – leaving him permanently disabled. 
I think the sentence was lenient. But the defendant, with a 30-year long career in crime, brought up in his defense, his troubled childhood (i.e. “It’s not my fault.”) 
But I digress. 
The victimhood syndrome has also successfully instilled into people, especially women, worry, guilt, insecurity and inadequacy, turning an otherwise (possibly) uneventful life into a permanent winter of discontent. 
The empowerers, or rather the sense of empowerment has convinced people that simply aspiring to do something is the same as achieving it. “Feeling good” about oneself and “positive self-worth” are more important than the much more challenging task of acquiring the skills required to gain recognition. 
The “self-help” mania has a kind of counterpart, for example, in the “Jesus Festivals” held by prosperous and opulent preachers in the mega-churches of the US Bible Belt. 
Yet, the desire to unquestionably accept the unbelievable runs deep in the American soul. In 1830, Frances Trollope, mother of the successful English novelist Anthony Trollope undertook a 2-year voyage to America, followed by the publication of a fascinating book, “The Domestic Manners of the Americans,” in which she also describes a religious “revival.” “The preacher described with ghastly minuteness, the last feeble fainting moments of human life, and then the gradual progress of decay after death, which he followed through every process up to the last loathsome stage of decomposition… Suddenly he bent forward as if to gaze on some object beneath the pulpit… And the preacher made known to us what he saw in the pit that seemed to open before him. The device was certainly a happy one for giving the effect to his description of hell. Repeatedly he invited and exhorted the young girls of the congregation not to be ashamed of Jesus, but to put themselves upon “the anxious benches” and lay their heads on his bosom. After that, three priests walked down and began whispering to the poor girls seated at the “anxious benches”. These whispers were inaudible to us, but the sobs and groans increased to a frightful excess. Young creatures, with features pale and distorted, fell on their knees on the pavement and soon sunk forward on their faces; the most violent cries and shrieks followed, while from time to time a voice was heard in convulsive accents exclaiming, “Oh Lord, Oh Lord Jesus, help me Jesus” and the like. Violent hysterics and compulsions seized many of them, and when the tumult was at the highest, the priest who remained above, again gave out a hymn as if to drown it.” 
Trollope concludes, “It was a frightful sight to behold innocent young creatures, in the gay morning of existence, thus seized upon, horror-struck and rendered feeble and enervated for ever. … For myself, I confess that I think the coarsest comedy ever written would be a less detestable exhibition for the eyes of youth and innocence than such a scene.” 
Returning to the present, the self-help movement has evolved from the personal realm to include the political. It is a contributing factor, for example in the adherence to the so-called political correctness, daughter of both victimization, or the culture of blame, and the self-esteem movement, a product of empowerment. 
But, inspired by the vision of large profits at little or no cost, self-help (in the sense of platitudinal advise sold at high price), has branched even into hospitals and universities. 
The World Health Organization now defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Starting from this platform, any reader can deduce that the sky is the limit. The Organization allocates funds to “wellness-based” models, which include research on loneliness and special after-school play programs, all aimed at achieving the ‘state of perfect health.’ 
Through the same reasoning, public health official have invested millions in so-called “outreach programs” for drug abusers. Here is a declaration by an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, on the subject of women of color contracting HIV from dirty needles and unprotected sex, “In response to daily assault of racial prejudice and denial of dignity, women may turn to readily available mind-altering substance for relief. Seeking sanctuary from racial hatred through sexual connection as a way to enhance self-esteem, also may offer rewards so compelling that condom use becomes less of a priority.” It’s pure victimization at work, and out go the millions for other self-help programs, as their respective deliverers laugh all the way to the bank. 
Even mid-sized companies engage high-priced lecturers to inspire motivation through ‘positive thinking,’ though there is no evidence of any positive effect. Considering that often, the company promoters of these program are the very ones who contradict the principles that the programs are supposed to inspire. 
Or take the case of the sales seminar where the trainer tells 250 real-estate professionals from the same company that all of them could be the number one salesmen of the year. Self-help can even defy the most simple of mathematics. One of the salesmen will be, the others won’t. 
Self-help has surreptitiously changed at large the general outlook on life. From, “The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill go together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues” (9) to the philosophy embodied in the popular bumper sticker ‘BADASSE’ – Blame All Disappointments And Setbacks On Someone Else.” 
By default, design, skill or luck, the self-help industry has found the formula for ‘success.’ Familiar sounding words applied in a different context puzzle the will (as in the example above, “Inner Strength Boot Camp.”) And hyperbolical images that fire the imagination prompt the willing victim to believe the unbelievable rather than accepting the inherent uncertainties of life. 
In the end, self-help makes cowards of its victims, whose hue of resolution is sicklied over by the pale cast of thought, (10) or rather, by the evanescent and ridiculous promises destined to melt into air, into thin air. While the baseless fabric of the self-help visions, (11 ) the promised successes, praises, glories, wealth and happiness, dissolve, and leave only expensive bills behind. 
And, as writer Steve Salerno has aptly concluded in his book SHAM, from where I extracted some of the examples, “The Self Help Industry has made America Helpless.”

11656,"Oregon Jury Rules in Favor of 1st Amendment, Finds Malheur Refuge Occupiers Not Guilty of ‘Conspiracy’","In what is being hailed as a ‘ truly astonishing ‘ verdict, a jury has found 7 Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupiers ‘not guilty’ of federal conspiracy charges stemming from a weeks long standoff with the Bureau of Land Management in Burns, Oregon earlier this year.
Thursday, the Oregon jury ruled in favor of the defense who argued that the six week standoff led by the infamous Bundy brother’s was a constitutionally protected act of protest against the treatment of two imprisoned Oregon ranchers.
For those unfamiliar with the case, here is a brief recap:
January 2016 – Militia members from across the country began a six week long armed protest at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in protest over the arrests of ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond who were accused of arson after lighting a controlled burn on their private property.
The federal government alleged that the controlled burn which was started on the Hammond’s property grow out of control and subsequently damaged federal lands outside of the ranch’s property line.
Following the government’s decision to prosecute the Hammond’s for arson, a protest in the town of Burns took place which ultimately lead to the seizure of the refuge by militia members.
Via OregonLive 
A jury Thursday delivered a stunning across-the-board acquittal to the leaders and participants in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a Nevada family to open public lands to ranchers, miners and loggers.
The verdicts finding Ammon Bundy, older brother Ryan Bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a time-honored tradition of First Amendment protest and civil disobedience.
“Maybe this is a lesson that that’s not the way to engage with these people, who want nothing more than just to be heard, just to have a forum to talk about the injustices like the case of the Hammonds and the treatment of ranchers,” said Lisa Ludwig, standby counsel for Ryan Bundy.
The high-profile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. The jury’s decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the land-rights movement.
The Bundy brothers still face prosecution in Nevada with their father, Cliven Bundy, all accused in the 2014 standoff at the patriarch’s ranch over unpaid grazing fees that pitted the family and their supporters against federal Bureau of Land Management agents.

In stunning remarks made yesterday, Jim Rickards says that Trump “will probably win” and, if he does, stock markets will crash 10% and gold will rise $100 over night. “If Hillary wins nothing happens, if Trump wins you will have an earthquake.”

Jim Rickards: Trump “Will Probably Win” and Gold “May Rise $100” Overnight 
The US election is just two weeks away on November 8th, and one of Hillary Clinton’s most vocal critics on the business side is finance commentator and monetary expert Jim Rickards. Jim is in Sydney this week, armed with his latest book, hot off the press entitled ‘The Road to Ruin – The Global Elites’ Secret Plan for the Next Financial Crisis’ and gave an interesting television interview to ‘The Business’ on ABC Australia. 
Rickards says that Trump “will probably win” and, if he does, stock markets will crash 10% and gold will rise $100 over night. 
The markets and polls believe Clinton will win and t hat is priced into markets in the same way that a ‘Bremain’ was priced into markets prior to the ‘Brexit’ vote. 
Kilkenomics 2016 – Where Comedy Meets Economics 
“If Hillary wins nothing happens, if Trump wins you will have an earthquake.” 
Should Trump win, which looking at the polls is not an impossibility, gold would likely surge $100 per ounce overnight, says Rickards. 
What Hillary did was appalling Rickards says in relation to the Clinton email scandal. There will be ‘another reckoning on November 8th’ which the market has failed to price in, creating a good scenario for gold. He says you don’t have to agree that Trump will win, but agree that that in reality he could win. 
For Rickards, this is an excellent opportunity for investors, particularly those who have an allocation to physical gold which he believes is set to rise in the coming months and years. 
Jim is editor of Strategic Intelligence for Agora Financial as well as the founder of the James Rickards Project: an inquiry into complex dynamics of geopolitics and capital. He is also the author of New York Times bestsellers The New Case for Gold, Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis and The Death of Money: The Coming Collapse of the International Financial System.

The people at or near the top of the power pyramid are just as vulnerable to being sheep as we all are. In fact, they’re even more likely to fall to pressure from their peers because they have so much more at stake if they make the wrong choice. 
That stake is money, power and other forms of capital. It’s their entire lifestyle at risk. If they rock the boat, there goes their business deals, their favors, their prioritization. 
And these aspects of their life most likely define their identity, as sad as that might be. 
That’s because all these consequences are of a nature which do not account for honor, integrity and morality. Connecting with the self to become an authentic man or woman is one of the real successes in life, so if they disregard this basic tenet to being human, then they’ve sold their soul for nothing less than a false path. 
These sorts of people have a lot of influence that they’re failing to utilize for the benefit of humanity, as well as the environment. The core effect they could achieve is based in helping people to expand their understanding, and therefore their consciousness, to facilitate bringing about an era of truth, justice, peace and abundance for humankind. 
Who exactly is being referenced here? They include celebrities, politicians, bureaucrats, military and police personnel, journalists, business moguls, so-called self-help gurus and pretty much anyone who is connected to the oligarchical families that are orchestrating the grand plan of global governance. 
Now of course not all of them are alike. But let’s face it; how many of those with a massive social influence are speaking out against not just the peripheral problems, but the core ones such as the scams embedded into our system itself? 
Fuck all; that how’s many. 
Entering into their minds, it’s easy for them to be persuaded by the fear if they talk about some of the seriously uncomfortable truths of the world they’d be labeled as a conspiracy theorist. Yet the reality is that many conspiracy ‘facts’ are backed up with so much evidence they are simply ‘matter as fact’. 
Like so many of us do, the truth needs to be shared. We all need to hear, understand and embody it into our thoughts and actions. 
Simply, it stands to reason that we all need to play our part, especially those who have taken on a role with societal responsibility. 
In any case, there are obviously many other reasons why these people don’t speak up. Examples include that they’re: subtly pretending to themselves that nothing is happening, ensuring they are a very unconscious person; turning a blind eye, even though they know and feel it; just simply ignorant of how the world works, like most people; psychopaths and/or sociopaths, where they’re involved in deeply disgraceful ideologies and practices; programmed and conditioned to support the status quo; dazed and confused in an overwhelming game of so-called power; a fake and weak human being; and/or in the drift of an existential crisis, which means their tide might actually turn. Final Thoughts 
In the awakening community, we talk a lot about the people having the ultimate power, because we’ve got the numbers. So, if we want the sham of our system to cease, then all we have to do is organize to at least some degree to bring about the next steps of our societal evolution. 
Well, what about all these people embedded in the parasitic culture that has hijacked humanity’s future? Can’t they be a beacon of light too? 
Of course they can. To do so, they, like all of us, need to do their proper research and open their minds and hearts to both the madness and magic that permeates our existence of duality. If they do, they’ll deeply connect with their true role as a light shining into the darkness. 
After all, no shadows exist when the light is shone from all angles.

The commander of US forces in Afghanistan has promised an investigation into the recent death of more than 30 Afghan civilians, including women and children, in an airstrike. 
General John Nicholson said Saturday that the airstrike on the village of Buz Kandahari, just outside the northern city of Kunduz on Thursday, would be probed. 
Three Taliban leaders were supposed to be targeted in the raid, but the forces met “significant enemy fire from multiple locations"" and called for help from a US aircraft, which left 33 civilians, including 17 children, dead. 
""An initial investigation has determined that efforts near Kunduz on November 3 to defend Afghan National Defense and Security Forces likely resulted in civilian casualties,"" Nicholson said in a statement. ""We will work with our Afghan partners to investigate and determine the facts and we will work with the government of Afghanistan to provide assistance."" 
The targets were high-ranking elements of the Takfiri group that were supposed to be hit in their houses, according to Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri. 
""They weren't ordinary people who had gathered. They were leading fighting in Kunduz. They were the commanders of their military commission,"" Waziri said. 
Taliban militants were removed from power following the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but they have stepped up their activities in recent months, attempting to overrun several provinces. 
Afghan forces have been engaged in fierce clashes with Taliban to contain the ongoing insurgency across various parts of the violence-wrecked country. 
The rising violence in Afghanistan comes despite the presence of thousands of foreign troops in the country. Loading ... ",0

Having never read any medieval German folk tales, Hillary Clinton is counting her chickens before they've hatched and preparing to hand out jobs that no one has handed her to hand out. She's busy planning her fantasy cabinet for her fantasy administration. 
And her big pick makes sense. 
Reportedly she would like to make Joe Biden the Secretary of State. Biden is the obvious choice. He's arrogant, dumb and brimming with bright ideas like just giving Iran money or splitting Iraq into little pieces. Obviously this wouldn't be a competency pick. The last time we had someone qualified as Secretary of State was during President Bush's time in office. 
Then Democrats decided they would give the job as a consolation prize to failed presidential candidates. Because our foreign policy is just that important. 
And who could be counted on to make an even bigger mess than Hillary Clinton or John Kerry... Joe Biden. It's a perfect plan. If you want a fall guy to blame everything on, they don't come any more obvious than Joe Biden. 
And if you want someone shadowed by the soft bigotry of low expectations, you've gotta go Joe. 
Joe Biden could accidentally start WW3 and everyone would shrug and say, ""That's just Joe.""",0
11661,"Rome Police Arrest Homeless Man in Murder of Beau Solomon, a U.S. Student - The New York Times","ROME  —   A homeless man was detained on Tuesday in connection with the death of a    student from Wisconsin who disappeared just hours after he landed in Rome, the Italian authorities said. The man, Massimo Galioto, 40, of Rome is suspected of involvement in what the police in Rome said was the murder of Beau Solomon, a visiting student from the University of   who was found in the Tiber River on Monday with a head wound and blood on his shirt. Mr. Solomon disappeared after going to a pub Thursday night, not long after he arrived in the city for a summer program at John Cabot University, an American school in central Rome. The university said in a statement that Mr. Solomon’s roommate, who has not been identified, was with him at a pub in Trastevere, an area near the university known for its night life, and that he lost contact with him around 1 a. m. He alerted administrators at the university when Mr. Solomon failed to appear at orientation the next morning, it said. More than $1, 700 was charged to Mr. Solomon’s credit card after he disappeared, according to Italian news reports, including a large purchase on Friday in a Milan store, about 350 miles north of Rome. His cellphone is missing. Mr. Solomon’s body was found about 2½ miles south of the Garibaldi Bridge, roughly 2, 000 feet from the pub where he left his friends. The crowds in the area are even larger at this time of year because of a summer fair along the river, where food and goods are sold from stalls along the waterfront. A picture of a smiling Mr. Solomon in his football uniform dominated the front pages of many papers on Tuesday, and representatives of the University of Wisconsin and John Cabot University expressed their condolences. “Beau Solomon was a bright and caring young man who lived the Wisconsin Idea. All of us at   are greatly saddened by this loss,” Rebecca Blank, chancellor of the University of   wrote on Twitter. Soldiers and police officers are regularly stationed near the Piazza Trilussa, which gives access to the cobblestones and labyrinthlike streets of Trastevere. But this is not the first time an American student has encountered trouble in Rome, where alcohol can be easily obtained in bars, restaurants and supermarkets, even for those under 21. Last year, an American student was raped in a bathroom of a bar in the area. In 2013, after a night of drinking, an American student died as he fell from a bridge on the river, and another American student was found dead near the train tracks of a tunnel after leaving a bar the next year.",0
11662,"AP: Illegal Immigration in March Was Lowest in 17 Years, Says Wednesday Testimony by DHS Chief - Breitbart","The number of migrants illegally coming across the U. S. southern border in March dropped to the lowest level in 17 years, says a leaked agency statement given to the Associated Press. [The statement is included in testimony slated for delivery on Wednesday, April 5, by Gen. John Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Typically, routine testimony is provided early to the legislators so they can prepare questions for the witness, but it is rarely leaked.  According to the Associated Press: Another report on Tuesday said the data showed a 67 percent drop in migrants seeking to cross the border. David V. Aguilar, former U. S. Border Patrol and acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that March 2017 figures he reviewed indicate illegal border crossings are down 67 percent [compared to March 2016]   …    . “It’s actually up to 67 percent drop compared to last year,” Aguilar told the Senate committee. During his   tenure, former President Barack Obama reduced border barriers and allowed at least 300, 000 migrants from Central America to cross the border and get temporary residency, plus work permits and access to Americans’ schools. That wave of migrants helped solidify public opposition to immigration, aided Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and helped cause many extra crimes in the United States. However, the flow of new illegal immigrants is only a small part of the nation’s   oversupply. Currently, at least 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the United States, of which at least 8 million hold jobs. Many of the recent illegal immigrants arrive legally as tourists or workers but fail to leave when their visas expire. In 2015, for example, almost 500, 000 people overstayed their visas and remained for some time as illegal immigrants. Also, the federal government annually invites 1 million people to legally immigrate to the United States, and provides work permits to a shifting population of up to 1. 45 million       plus at least 200, 000    . The immigrants and contract workers compete for jobs sought by the 4 million young Americans who join the workforce each year. Overall, the huge inflow of migrants, both legal and illegal, help lower Americans’ salaries and wages by roughly $500 billion per year. In turn, that money is scooped up by employers and Wall Street investors as higher profits. President Trump has promised to toughen border security by building a barrier along most of the border, and he has already directed border officers to end Obama’s “catch and release” policy. He has also rejuvenated repatriation policies and has promised to curb business’ use of temporary contract workers in place of Americans.  ",0
11663,Clonmel Youth Call For Apology After Cat Autopsy Reveals Hit And Run,"0 Add Comment 
TEENAGERS in the county Tipperary town of Clonmel have today called for a public apology from adults, politicians and gardaí after they were incorrectly blamed for murdering a local cat with a firework. 
Reputable news publications originally reported the claim as fact, but have since taken down their misinformed story without a correction, which said the cat was ‘targeted by unknown individuals who strapped a firework to its mouth, killing it’. Pictures of the dead cat were then circulated online for maximum effect. However, a post-mortem this morning has revealed the cat was in fact killed in a hit and run incident – a conclusion backed up by Gardaí, who reviewed CCTV of the incident which revealed the cat was struck by a car. 
“Too be honest, I do be too skagged out of me head to be chasin’ cats and wasting heroin money on fireworks,” Clonmel teen Martin Dunphy told WWN today, “T’was gas how quick all de straight heads pointed the finger at us, and then it turns out it was one of their own drivin’ a car. We demand an apology… or a few euro for the bus if ye have it?” 
Clonmel gardaí have since closed the investigation, despite the driver of the vehicle being at large in the area, sparking conspiracy claims around the town. 
“It’s one law for us, and another for them,” voiced another teenager, “If they can do this to an animal, the worry is what they’ll do to a person”. 
Since the revelation, youth campaigners have set up a Facebook page, Cats Lives Matter, calling for justice for the animal, urging gardaí to relaunch a full investigation into the “hit and run”.",0

11666,What Scientists Found Inside This 800-Year-Old Pot... Is Changing History!,"Share on Facebook In 2008, on a dig in the First Nation’s Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, archaeologists made a small but stunning discovery: a tiny clay pot. Though it might not have seemed very impressive at first glimpse, this little piece of pottery was determined to be about 800 years old. And inside that pot? Something that changes how we're looking at extinction, preservation, and food storage, as well as how humans have influenced the planet in their time on it. It's amazing to think that a little clay pot buried in the ground 800 years ago would still be relevant today, but it's true! It's actually brought an extinct species of squash that was presumed to be lost forever. Thank our Indigenous Ancestors! Even they knew what preservation meant. They knew the importance of the future, Is it not amazing that they are affecting our walks of life even to this day? Here it is! The pot was unearthed on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, where it had laid buried for the past 800 years. Inside, archaeologists found a stash of seeds. The seeds were probably buried in the pot as a method of storing food supplies. They were determined to be an old, now-extinct species of squash. Now, seven years after making this stunning discovery, students in Winnipeg decided to plant the 800-year-old seeds… to everyone's amazement, something grew! The squash was named Gete-Okosomin. It means “cool old squash” in the Menominee language. (Respect to the science people for respecting the indigenous people who's land this was found on, we see your good nature!) Now, they're working to cultivate the squash so that it doesn't go extinct… again. It may be just a humble squash, but it's also a symbol of first nations' community and history, as well as a fascinating look into how amazing plants can be. It just goes to show you that plants can be pretty incredible… and that sometimes, history has a funny way of coming back around. The Wheel of Life really stands out in this instance of history. Our Indigenous roots are strong and very much tied to the land. I was taught once that the people of Turtle Island were keepers of the land, not owners. I feel like this Squash is proof of that teaching. Check out the original story & the role of White Earth Land Recovery Project (where seed keepers tend to these seeds) or Winona LaDuke (who named the squash)! Related:",0
11667,Moving Past Gender Barriers to Negotiate a Raise - The New York Times,"ASKING for a raise is the type of conversation that can make even the most confident among us uncomfortable. Women, however, may have good reason to feel that way. Discrimination persists in the workplace and it isn’t necessarily intentional or overt, experts on gender and negotiation say. But it can emerge when women act in ways that aren’t considered sufficiently feminine, and when women advocate for themselves, these experts say, some people find it unseemly, if on a subconscious level. As a result, women need to take a more calibrated approach, whether in asking for a higher salary or a new position. Otherwise, they can risk being perceived as overly demanding and unlikable, experts say, and their requests can backfire. “We are asking women to juggle while they are on the tightrope,” said Linda C. Babcock, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and founder of its gender equity program. “It’s totally unfair because we don’t require the same thing of men. But if women want to be successful in this domain, they need to pay attention to this. ” Research on gender and negotiation has largely focused on requests for a raise, but the same strategies can  —   and probably should  —   be applied to a broad range of requests, including negotiating for a new position or job title. “How women negotiate their career paths is arguably a more important determinant of lifetime earnings than negotiating a little extra money,” said Hannah Riley Bowles, a senior lecturer at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, who has conducted many studies on gender and negotiation. Some women may bridle  —   justifiably  —   at adjusting their behavior to conform to stereotypes. But the negotiation experts say that they think about these strategies pragmatically. “These stereotypes will hold us back, so we might as well use them to move forward,” added Joan C. Williams, a   of “What Works for Women at Work. ” Here are some strategies for approaching negotiations at work: Groundwork Asking for a raise shouldn’t be rushed or boiled down to one short conversation. To prepare, keep a record of every piece of positive feedback you receive over time, and catalog any objective metrics that help illustrate your contributions. This is easy to overlook when you’re busy. Be careful about how you present the information  —   in a performance review might be more effective instead of naked  . Women also benefit when other people highlight their accomplishments with the   experts said. That’s why it’s important for women to seek not only mentors, but also what some call sponsors, professionals who actively trumpet your work.   Women tend to negotiate less for themselves than men, when there aren’t clear standards on what they should be asking for, studies found. In fact, women worked longer and made fewer errors but paid themselves less than men did for similar tasks, according to another study. But that effect went away when women were given data on what others paid themselves. There are several ways to gather objective numbers supporting why a particular salary is merited. “The next time a recruiter calls you up, she is your new best friend, even if you don’t want to move,” said Ms. Williams, also founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings College of Law. Or seek one out. “Talk to her because she is the one who knows what you are worth on the open market. ” Women need to speak with men about salaries, too. If they network only with other women, experts said, they are more likely to come up with numbers that are systematically less. Specific Language When negotiating for higher pay, research has found that it is not enough for women to act in a way that conforms to stereotypes. Acting feminine enough  —   that is, showing they care about maintaining good relationships as well as the communal good over themselves, for instance  —   helps women in the likability department. And that’s important. But that doesn’t necessarily make the person in the position of power any more likely to grant a woman’s request. Women also need to legitimize their requests, or find ways to make them seem more appropriate, according to a study that Prof. Riley Bowles and Prof. Babcock published in 2012. That means saying something like, “My supervisor suggested that I to talk to you about raising my compensation. ” Women should also frame requests from the employer’s perspective. “The key thing is to turn it around and think about what it is legitimate to this person and what they value,” Professor Riley Bowles added. She refers to this as the “ ” strategy: You might be thinking about something from your perspective, but when you make the pitch, it should come out as “we. ” This, she says, is good advice for men, too. It just may be particularly important for women. Negotiate in Person Negotiation by email can backfire. “It comes across very cold, very hard and very direct, so all of the things that women tend to do in conversation that soften their approach are impossible to do in email,” Professor Babcock said. Email also requires waiting for a response. “If you are having a conversation, you can judge more accurately about how your request is going over,” she added, “and you can adjust your request as you see the reaction. ” That’s what may have caused one woman to have a recent job offer rescinded, a situation that recently made the rounds in the blogosphere and media. The candidate, known only as W. was offered a position as a philosophy professor at Nazareth College in Rochester. In response, she emailed the job search committee and listed    items that would “make my decision easier. ” W. also said in the email that she knew some requests would be easier to grant than others, indicating that she knew she wouldn’t get everything. Nazareth says it declines comment on personnel issues. In a blog post, W. said she figured asking couldn’t hurt. But it apparently did: In response, the college reportedly emailed her back and said it had determined that she was more interested in teaching at a research university. “It is impossible to say in any particular case whether” gender played a role, Professor Babcock said. “The research could not be more clear in that we tolerate more aggressive or assertive behavior by men more than women. ” Outside Offers Receiving an offer for a more lucrative position may seem like a prime opportunity to negotiate. But this tactic may harm women because it can be perceived as a threat, experts said, “Every negotiation textbook says to use an outside offer, except for mine,” said Professor Babcock, who with Professor Riley Bowles, studied the effects of using outside offers in an experimental setting. “That is seen as aggressive when used by a woman. ” If you do want to use this strategy, she said you have to be careful about how you craft your language. Approach the situation as a dialogue instead of a negotiation. She said women might say something like, “Hey, there is something I really want to talk about. I want to stay. Is there a way to make this happen for me?”   Keeping all this in mind isn’t easy, which is why experts suggest   the situation with a friend or partner.

Also, one typically doesn’t use the word “again” unless it’s happened before — and in this context, a lot of times before. 
I am not privy, of course, to the inner workings of Hillary Clinton’s world. In fact, very few people are, considering that Clinton isn’t exactly ruler of the Principality of Transparencyland. However, given her history, I find that it’s usually safe to assume the worst when it comes to her. 
It’s not that we’ve been lied to yet again. If I got angry every time Hillary Clinton lied to us, my blood pressure could run a hydroelectric power plant. It’s that she lied so cravenly about an issue that affects our national security .

11669,Think the N.C.A.A. Bracket’s Too Easy? Try One of These Pools - The New York Times,"Starting in the 1970s, eight prosecutors in the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section set up a standing meeting. Once a year, they would gather in the deputy attorney general’s conference room and run an elaborate pool for the N. C. A. A. men’s basketball tournament. “We mostly followed the law,” said Reid Weingarten, one of the pool’s charter members. The pool lasted decades, surviving long after the colleagues had left for other jobs. Like most N. C. A. A. tournament pools, it brought friends together for good   fun. Any financial stakes paled in comparison to the competitive ones. Participants got carried away with preselection research. And they were merciless in lambasting one another’s pet predilections. “Eric”  —   that would be Eric H. Holder Jr. the future attorney general  —   “would always pick U. C. L. A. because he was a Kareem guy,” Weingarten said, referring to Kareem  ’s alma mater. “And he would always pick the Ivy League team, because he went to Columbia. ” But what made the bracket truly unusual was its structure. The participants did not pick games rather, they drafted teams. (Random selection dictated the drafting order.) Owning the team that won it all merited the largest reward, of course, but it also was worth something to have a team that made the Final Four or the   team to make the round of 16. This was not, in other words, your ordinary office pool. “I find blind pool picking tedious, ridiculous and not fun,” Weingarten said. That is not to say there is anything wrong with simple pools millions of Americans take part in one every March, often merely for the prize of office or family bragging rights. In fact, one recently existed in a place even higher than the Justice Department. For the previous six N. C. A. A. tournaments, Kyle Lierman, then of the White House Office of Public Engagement, ran BOTUS  —   Bracket of the United States  —   for hundreds of members of President Barack Obama’s staff. (He will run the pool again this year it has been rechristened BOTUS 44.) There were no financial stakes, Lierman said, and the president’s bracket, publicly filled out on ESPN, was automatically entered every year. “He did well a couple years,” Lierman said. “Other years, not so well. ” The N. C. A. A. tournament, which kicks off Tuesday, is the Super Bowl of sports wagering. Actually, it is the Super Bowl twice over. The American Gaming Association, a trade group for the casino industry, estimated that Americans will wager more than $10 billion on the tournament this year, most of it illegally, compared with $4. 7 billion on the Super Bowl. And that figure does not include the multitudes of office pools, with their $5 or $10 entry fees. Officially, the N. C. A. A. opposes “all forms of legal and illegal sports wagering. ” “Despite the N. C. A. A.’s protests against gambling,” said Geoff Freeman, the chief executive of the gaming association, which supports the broad legalization of sports wagering, “they’ve created the biggest gambling event in American history. They wisely did it with great marketing, tremendous use of the bracket and infiltration into the American cultural lifestyle. ” Most pools are straightforward: Take a blank bracket, predict winners for every game and submit it before the first one tips off. But for a certain breed of fan, like those aforementioned anticorruption lawyers, the standard     pool is not enough. Several have devised sophisticated, even byzantine alterations on the theme. Noah Chestnut, a product manager at the sports website Bleacher Report, crafted a   pool several years ago that is similar to the one used by the lawyers. In his pool, drafting is  . Entrants are allocated a $100 budget that must be spent on four to six teams whoever offers the most for a given team buys it. (When Kentucky entered the 2015 tournament undefeated, the successful draftee paid $96 for the privilege of selecting the Wildcats, who lost in the semifinals.) “I’ve always preferred to draft to everything else in life,” Chestnut said. “I don’t actually enjoy the games as much as the time before the games. ” A common tweak in irregular pools is to adjust how many points a participant receives for picking an underdog in order to make every game closer to an effective tossup. Picking a 14th seed that wins its first game, some reason, should be worth more than picking a No. 3 seed that holds serve. Chestnut, for example, weighted the scoring so that additional points were available when a team upset a favorite: 3 points, for instance, when a No. 10 beat a No. 7. And The Wall Street Journal reported several years ago on a biostatistician who used sophisticated mathematical formulas to determine point values for every matchup based on how previous, similar matchups had turned out. Similarly, in the early 1980s, Stephen Brown raided the microfiche at the University of Virginia where he was a graduate student. Armed with pencil and paper, he consulted past bracket results from The New York Times and, based on previous outcomes, calculated upset bonus points, which increased as the bracket narrowed. “I was supposed to be writing my dissertation on an   poet named Edward Young,” said Brown, now an English professor at Rhode Island College. The bonus points, though, were secondary to Brown’s core innovation:    picking. Instead of filling out an entire bracket before the first game, participants picked games in the second round after knowing the results in the first, and so on. The structure keeps more participants in the running, as anyone with a bad first round, say, can make up for it with a good second round  —   particularly if there are more upsets, and thus more available upset bonus points. “I never liked the idea of filling out the brackets,” he said, adding, “It makes so much more sense, and would take more judgment and skill, if you knew who was actually playing every game. ” Brown’s pool survives to this day, administered by his nephew. So does a   offshoot centered in the Washington area. (Full disclosure: The offshoot is this reporter’s annual pool of choice.) Finally, for those who prefer getting ready for the party to the party itself, Bryan Cimorelli’s pool, the Conference Tournament Challenge, is for you. It covers not the one N. C. A. A. championship tournament, but the 32 Division I conference tournaments, which this season comprised 294 games, per his calculation. Each tournament is treated like the N. C. A. A. tournament, with point values increasing each round. Additional points are awarded for upsets, calculated by a method too exasperating to explain here. Values are additionally multiplied depending on how prominent the conference is: Conferences like the Southwestern Athletic are the baseline, while points in the Ivy League are multiplied by 3. 5 the Atlantic 10 by 4. 5 and the six power conferences by 5. “I like things that are really complicated and take a lot of thought,” said Cimorelli, perhaps stating the obvious. Cimorelli, whose day job in budgeting also involves spreadsheets, emails a preview every morning and a recap every night to ensure his pool’s 40 participants remain engaged. A recent preview was more than 15, 000 words. It informed competitors that only one had picked   Richmond to win the Atlantic 10, discussed coaching seniority in the Southeastern Conference and made the observation that while more than half the pool had picked Rice to upset   Paso in one game, none had the Owls reaching the Conference USA final. On Sunday, the C. T. C. ended and, soon after, the selection committee handed down the N. C. A. A. tournament bracket. For Cimorelli, it always is perhaps the year’s biggest letdown. “I don’t even want to look at a bracket,” he said. “I fill one out because it’s my sports fan’s obligation, but after 300 games in 13 days, I get to the actual tournament and I’m like, This is boring. ”",0
11670,Judge Jed Rakoff Throws Down Gauntlet to Judges on Lack of Due Process in America,"by Yves Smith 
In Why You Won’t Get Your Day in Court in the New York Review of Books, judge Jed Rakoff offers a measured yet devastating critique of how all but the richest Americans lack effectively lack access to the courts. Rakoff, a highly regarded securities law expert best known for refusing to rubber-stamp SEC settlements that he deemed provided him with too little information to determine whether they were fair, walks through why Americans are shortchanged: 
Over the past few decades, ordinary US citizens have increasingly been denied effective access to their courts. There are many reasons for this. One is the ever greater cost of hiring a lawyer. A second factor is the increased expense, apart from legal fees, that a litigant must pay to pursue a lawsuit to conclusion. A third factor is increased unwillingness of lawyers to take a case on a contingent-fee basis when the anticipated monetary award is modest. A fourth factor is the decline of unions and other institutions that provide their members with free legal representation. A fifth factor is the imposition of mandatory arbitration. A sixth factor is judicial hostility to class action suits. A seventh factor is the increasing diversion of legal disputes to regulatory agencies. An eighth factor, in criminal cases, is the vastly increased risk of a heavy penalty in going to trial. 
For these and other reasons, many Americans with ordinary legal disputes never get the day in court that they imagined they were guaranteed by the law. A further result is that most legal disputes are rarely decided by judges, and almost never by juries. And still another result is that the function of the judiciary as a check on the power of the executive and legislative branches and as an independent forum for the resolution of legal disputes has substantially diminished—with the all-too-willing acquiescence of the judiciary itself. 
Rakoff goes through all of theses issues and explains the consequences, which include more people attempting to represent themselves in court, where they lose at a much higher rate than parties that have counsel. Readers of this site know how common it was during the foreclosure crisis for homeowners to attempt to defend themselves, with little success. Even now, I regularly have individuals who are trying to keep their homes or overturn a successful foreclosure e-mail me along with a long list of other people which regularly includes prominent officials like Elizabeth Warren. Even when they might have a germ of an argument, these missives are often so screechy and poorly organized that they come off as being the work of cranks rather than those at the end of their ropes. And this is reaction of someone sympathetic to the idea that the servicer done them wrong. 
As bad as the situation is in civil cases, it’s worse on the criminal side of the bar. Even though defendants do get representation, court appointed lawyers are rarely a match for prosecutors. And the issue isn’t simply that hiring good counsel is costly. It’s also that the consequences of losing a criminal case are draconian, and even with the best representation, litigation is still a crapshoot. Recall that Aaron Swartz killed himself because the cost of defense in a Federal case starts at $1.5 million, which would have impoverished his parents, and if he lost, he faced up to 35 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million. 
Even in my very tame and cloistered social circle, the stories I have heard of encounters with the criminal justice system have been sobering. Someone I met in passing was charged criminally in a southern state for practicing medicine without a license. Even though he was not offering medical services or making medical claims, he’d been licensed as a osteopath in another state and his receptionist called him “Dr. Marty,” which his clients took up. He did hire his own attorney rather than rely on a court defender, and went to trial rather than accept a plea bargain. He was confident he’d win because the prosecution presented no evidence (no witnesses, no documentary evidence) that he was practicing medicine, much the less that he’d done any harm. However, his attorney did not fight the venue being in an itty bitty backwater town, as opposed to the large city in which the defendant worked. As the local who recounted the tale said, judge and juries there are fixed all the time. “Dr. Marty” lost on 16 counts and was sentenced to four years in prison. 
Similarly, I know a highly skilled former Wall Street tech expert, and am pretty confident that the professionals in his circle (who are shameless gossips) would not lie for him. The story that several parties independently recounted was that he dumb enough to not move out when a long-standing roommate turned to drug dealing. Mr. IT convinced himself he was not at risk as long as he never touched any illicit substances or handled cash. 
One evening, someone came and kept pounding on the door, threatening to (and sounding as if he could) knock it down. After increasingly loud efforts at breaking into the apartment to get his drugs, Mr. IT relented, and found and handed him the envelope and took money. Unbeknownst to him, his roommate had just been busted and told he needed to turn other people, and as a result, the buyer was wearing a wire. And the amount in the envelope was only a misdemeanor dealing amount but was marked up in the evidence room to a felony quantity. 
Mr. IT pled guilty and expected to go to prison. But because he was HIV positive and had spots on his face at his sentencing hearing, the prosecutor and judge figured he has Kaposi’s sarcoma, and they’d rather have him die on his own nickel rather than get state support. So he got probation instead. It turned out that whatever he had wasn’t that, and he’s still alive. But the prosecution and felony conviction deeply traumatized him, as well as making it very difficult for him to find employment. 
I strongly urge you to read this important article in full . From its close: 
But while the larger solutions to this denial of access must await a change in the legislative climate, there is, I am convinced, no reason short of ignorance or ideology for judges to continue to give their approval to devices that effectively deny Americans access to their courts. The Supreme Court, for example, could easily overrule or at least narrow decisions like Concepcion and Chevron, on the ground that they deprive Americans of meaningful access to their courts. And lower court judges, state and federal, could take a harder look at some of the practices described here that have the same effect. 
This would require a considerable change of thought on the part of many judges. Indeed, it is hardly surprising that judges who often have substantial dockets tend to look favorably on arrangements that will lessen their work burden, whether by mandatory arbitration, denial of jurisdiction, reliance on prosecutors and administrators, or similar measures. Too often, however, such relief morphs into an effective reduction of judicial responsibility, with dire consequences for the long-term ability of the courts to serve as an effective check on the power of the legislature and the executive. Arguably even worse, the situation I’ve described reinforces the belief of citizens that the courts are not an institution to which they can turn for justice, but are simply a remote and expensive luxury reserved for the rich and powerful. If the judges themselves do not take steps to counter this insidious trend, who will? 0 0 0 0 0 0",0
11671,Mayor de Blasio Avoids Terrorism Label in Manhattan Explosion - The New York Times,"It was on the minds of New Yorkers, who immediately drew comparisons to Sept. 11, 2001. It could be felt in the police response, which included teams of heavily armed officers stationed at key targets and the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Police Department. But for Mayor Bill de Blasio and top city officials, terrorism was the word that could not be spoken on Sunday. Seeking to project a responsible and measured reaction, the mayor pointedly avoided calling the bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on Saturday that injured 29 people  —   and the presence of a seemingly related but undetonated device a few blocks away  —   a possible act of terror, declining at several points on Sunday to do so. He emphasized that there would be no “easy answers” and that no suspect had yet been apprehended. Absent a motivation, Mr. de Blasio suggested the word terrorism should not be used, shaking his head in disapproval at the notion that the basic facts of the bombing could be described that way. “Here is what we know: It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing  —   that’s what we know,” he said on Sunday, flanked by law enforcement officials at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. “To understand there were any specific motivations, political motivations, any connection to an organization  —   that’s what we don’t know. ” The approach appeared to be aimed at calming nerves in a city on edge, and at avoiding a rush to conclusions, both in New York City and across the country. Unlike other past events that were labeled terrorism, including a 2014 ax attack on police officers in Queens by a man said to have been inspired by the Islamic State, the authorities have yet to identify a suspect or suspects in the bombing that would allow them to determine  —   through interviews or a history of online activity  —   the underlying reason for the attack. The F. B. I. as of late Sunday, had not officially labeled the attack as terrorism, though Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president who is supported by Mr. de Blasio, released a statement that characterized it as among three “apparent terror attacks” on Saturday, including an explosion in New Jersey and a knife attack in Minnesota. “It could have been something personally motivated,” Mr. de Blasio said. “We don’t know yet. ” The approach by Mr. de Blasio at news conferences over the weekend appeared similar to the initial response to another recent explosion in Manhattan, in which a man from Virginia was seriously injured in July when he jumped on a device similar to a homemade firework in Central Park. City officials quickly tried to dissociate that explosion from any broad terrorism plot, instead labeling it the act of a hobbyist experimenting with fireworks. This drew criticism from some New Yorkers, who felt officials did so in haste simply to quell fears. No one has been arrested for placing or assembling the Central Park device, and the police have not wavered from their initial hypothesis about the explosion. The police later announced the device contained substances “which are commonly and legally available for sale in certain hardware stores. ” One of the chemicals was TATP, or triacetone triperoxide, which has been used to detonate bombs in terror attacks overseas and has become the Islamic State’s explosive of choice. On Sunday, police officials said there was no link between the Central Park explosion and the one in Chelsea. In striking a tone of deliberation on Sunday, Mr. de Blasio risked creating a dissonance between the dictionary definition of terrorism  —   violence with a political motive  —   and the creeping sense of inevitability that the terror attacks more common elsewhere in the world would find their way to New York. To some, Mr. de Blasio also appeared to conflate terrorism in general  —   a deadly tactic with many political motives  —   with terrorism motivated or carried out by the Islamic State and other radical Muslim groups. “I believe the mayor was saying there was no connection with international terrorism and that is correct,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, said on Sunday, referring to the mayor’s comments the night before, when he said there was no initial indication the bombing was terrorism. ”A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism,” Mr. Cuomo added. “But it’s not linked to international terrorism. In other words, we find no ISIS connection. ” The city has experienced bombings with a variety of motivations over the years, from the Weather Underground, which opposed the Vietnam War, to George P. Metesky, the Mad Bomber who in the 1940s and ’50s terrorized the city with bombs in subway stations, movie theaters and a Macy’s department store. His motive appeared to be anger at the electric company Consolidated Edison. Of late, however, many episodes later deemed terror attacks have been committed by homegrown extremists inspired by the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. Before the news conference at Police Headquarters on Sunday, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo toured the bombing scene on West 23rd Street near Avenue of the Americas and spoke with residents and visitors at a diner, a barbershop and inside a Starbucks. The two men  —   bitter political rivals  —   embraced before their tour and offered words of reassurance to tourists and locals alike. “Don’t let them scare us,” Mr. Cuomo said to a woman from the neighborhood. Mr. de Blasio applauded a woman who made her regular Sunday trip to church in Chelsea. “We don’t even know what this is yet,” he told her.",0
11672,Report: International Religious Freedom Worsening in both ‘Depth and Breadth’,"The U. S. Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) offers a grim assessment of the state of religious liberty worldwide in its 2017 report, noting that the state of affairs “is worsening in both the depth and breadth of violations. ”[“The blatant assaults have become so frightening —  attempted genocide, the slaughter of innocents, and wholesale destruction of places of worship —  that less egregious abuses go unnoticed or at least unappreciated,” the report states.  The report goes on to lament that many observers “have become numb to violations of the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion” and now simply take them for granted. The USCIRF takes care to distinguish religious liberty from mere freedom of worship, to include the freedom —  either alone or in community with others and in public or private —  to manifest one’s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance. Along with its appraisal of the global situation regarding religious freedom, the Council also offers an evaluation of individual nations in its 2017 report. Noteworthy in this regard is its inclusion of Russia for the first time ever in its list of “Countries of Particular Concern” (CPC) for “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. ” The report makes note of a decision by the Russian Supreme Court to ban the existence of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in that country as a particularly egregious example of these violations. Their right to religious freedom, the report observes, is being eliminated thoroughly —  and yet “legally” under Russian law. Russia’s continued use of its “ ” law as “a tool to curtail religious freedoms” is one of the reasons USCIRF has recommended that Russia be designated as a “country of particular concern,” the report stated. Not long ago, the Pew Research Center reported that Egypt is now the country with the highest level of government restrictions of religion in the entire world, yet despite this distinction, the 2017 USCIRF report removed Egypt as a CPC, placing the country on its “Tier 2,” its former “Watch List. ” Curiously, the Jehovah’s Witnesses have been banned in Egypt since 1960 —  the very crime the USCIRF adduced for placing Russia on its list of CPCs. Religious persecution in Egypt has been under scrutiny of late, due to the heightened presence of the Islamic State in the region of North Sinai and elsewhere. On Palm Sunday, Islamic State suicide bombers bombed two Christian churches near Cairo, killing at least 45 worshipers and injuring scores more. The USCIRF report acknowledges “the government’s widespread repression of human rights,” while claiming that religious freedom conditions improved in several areas over the past year. As positive signs, the report states that President Abdel Fattah Sisi consistently condemned sectarian attacks and pressed for assistance for victims and accountability for perpetrators, pushed for reform in religious discourse, and attended a Coptic Christmas Eve mass for the third consecutive year. By early 2017, the government also completed rebuilding and restoring more than 50 churches destroyed by extremists in 2013. Egyptian courts have made some progress in bringing to justice perpetrators of past attacks, the report states, and in 2016, prosecutions, convictions, and imprisonment of Egyptian citizens for blasphemy and related charges decreased. As an independent, bipartisan U. S. federal government advisory body, the USCIRF is uniquely positioned to offer counsel to the President and the State Department. Follow Thomas D.

11673,Paul Ryan: ’Health Care Is Not Dead’ - Breitbart,"The GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare is still moving forward, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan confirmed in London Wednesday. [Ryan answered questions at the Policy Exchange think tank in London Wednesday. When asked about plans to move forward with a Republican Health care plan, the Speaker was unequivocal. “Health care is not dead, we’re still working on it,” he said.  “We have to step in front of this crisis,” Ryan said about the future of president Barack Obama’s signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Healthcare Act, commonly called “Obamacare. ” Ryan characterized the current system as “collapsing under its own weight” and pointed to numerous states and counties in which only a single insurance company is still offering coverage. “We’re talking about a system in dire need of reform,” he cautioned. The plan Ryan himself wholeheartedly pushed to replace Obamacare, the “American Health Care Act (AHCA),” had to be withdrawn before it reached a vote due to insufficient support on the House floor and even less favorable public polling. In the intervening weeks, however, there have been indications the different factions within the House Republican majority, including the Freedom Caucus so instrumental in defeating the AHCA, have been readying a second attempt at repeal and replace. Speaker Ryan seemed to  confirm that such a regrouping is in the works. “We’re in the midst of negotiating sorta finishing touches,” he said of an    unannounced plan. “It’s difficult to do. We’re very close. It’s basically ‘make good on the promises that were made. ’” While details were skant, Ryan offered up what he considered the goals of the next Republican effort to make good on one of the party’s   standing campaign issues. “We want to have a system in America where everyone has affordable access to good health insurance   …     including people with   conditions. That is not what the current law does and it’s just gonna take us a little time to make good on that,” Ryan said. Ryan also explained his reasoning for keeping the order of his legislative priorities unchanged: finishing health care first before moving on to tax reform. “It makes it much easier for us to do tax reform if we first do health care reform,” Ryan said. According to him, repealing Obamacare will necessarily repeal nearly $1 trillion in taxes. “The way that works in our numbers is ten points of corporate tax rate reduction. ”",0

11677,How Donald Trump and President Obama Put Republicans in a Bind - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When Donald J. Trump goes low, congressional Republicans go quiet. Their tolerance of Mr. Trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . But on one point, all sides agree: They have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. And Mr. Trump’s provocations are making the Republicans’ control of the Senate, perhaps even the House, more tenuous. Many Republicans, even those whose contempt for Mr. Trump matches their ill will for President Obama, still view the choice between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. They believe that Mr. Trump, guided by a   Congress, will break their way more than Mrs. Clinton ever would. For others, the vacancy on the Supreme Court  —   and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years  —   overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. “The Supreme Court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, where Mr. Trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly Republican state. Congressional Republicans who are up for    —   especially the handful like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire who still face primaries  —   have made a basic calculation. They have criticized Mr. Trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. And party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and Mr. Trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. Alienating Mr. Trump’s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. Their fears at this point appear justified. A poll conducted the last week of July by CBS News found that support for Mr. Trump among Republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. So the leaders largely responded to Mr. Trump’s attacks with feigned indifference. “Republican elected officials are in a tough spot,” said Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor of The Rothenberg  Gonzales Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “They are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. Some Republicans are reluctant to attack Donald Trump because they’d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. ” Mr. Trump pointedly declined on Tuesday to endorse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the nation’s   elected Republican, and verged on outright opposition to Mr. McCain and Ms. Ayotte, just hours after Mr. Obama challenged Republicans to denounce their nominee. Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump have put Republicans into an untenable position: Criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for    —   but sitting idly as Mr. Trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. “If you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” Mr. Obama asked during a news conference on Tuesday. Mr. Ryan’s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought Mr. Trump’s endorsement, and Ms. Ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, “I call it like I see it,” in reference to her defense of a fallen Army captain whose family Mr. Trump had derided. While many Republicans are hoping for ticket splitters  —   those who might vote Democrat for president but Republican on the rest of the ticket  —   the parsing is all the more difficult. Many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. “In 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,” said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. “It was not like Passover, where the door was marked, ‘This one should be spared.’ No, the Angel of Death came in and said no ‘Let’s kill them all.’ ” It is not just a question of individual desires to win    —   although that certainly drives many of the statements about Mr. Trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. Republicans believe they need to maintain the House and the Senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. “The speaker’s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican operative who once worked for former Speaker John A. Boehner. “The political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. ” Republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the Washington establishment. This was the lesson Senator Ted Cruz of Texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the Republican convention last month for declining to get behind Mr. Trump, and accounts for some of the heat that Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a founder of the Never Trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. Then, there is the vehement opposition to Mrs. Clinton, especially how they view her role in the Benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among Republicans. “I happen to think that lying to the American people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of Donald Trump,” said Mr. Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. He added: “Nothing united Republicans more than Hillary Clinton. ” Some still may pull away. On Tuesday, Representative Richard Hanna, Republican of New York, said he would endorse Mrs. Clinton for president, calling Mr. Trump “unfit to serve. ” But Mr. Hanna is not representative of the broader Republican conference. “He came to Congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,” Mr. Gonzales said. “He would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . But since he’s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what’s on his mind. ” But if Mr. Trump falls in the polls and Republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, Mr. Hanna might not be alone.",0
11678,Non-GMO 'crop circles' showing up in corn fields in Nebraska,"Non-GMO 'crop circles' showing up in corn fields in Nebraska 
  Daniel Barker Tags: anti-GMO , crop circles , Our Little Rebellion (NaturalNews) An American company has hit on a novel way to promote its non-GMO corn snacks while raising awareness concerning the dominance of GM agriculture in the country – by using crop circles as an advertising medium.Our Little Rebellion – a company that sells a line of non-GMO corn snack products called PopCorners – has joined up with Nebraska farmer Jim McGowan to create a giant message in his cornfield urging people to ""Join The Corn Revolution.""The 9-acre crop artwork also features a large-scale version of the PopCorners website address and the logo of the Non-GMO Project, an organization that verifies Our Little Rebellion's products.Courtney Pineau, associate director of the Non-GMO Project, said:""It's super creative – we're really excited about it. I've never really seen a brand undertake an endeavor like this, so that's one of the things that we really loved about it.""The project involved some high-tech GPS mapping, a crop circle artist and a week of hand-cutting corn by a team of 15 people.A drone camera captured the creation of the artwork, as seen in the video below:Fifth-generation farmer McGowan said:""We're really excited to be able to see the whole circle here come into effect. Most of the time in production agriculture, it's treated as a regular raw commodity and you don't even know what happens to it. To see the actual chain complete with this product from that field is really special.""From Eco Salon :""The project seeks to draw attention to the baffling 92 percent of American corn acreage currently being grown with genetically modified seeds – and to Our Little Rebellion's efforts to source the 20 million pounds of corn it uses annually from the other eight percent."" Meeting a growing demand for non-GMO foods To manufacture its products, Our Little Rebellion has had to take a creative approach, partnering with dozens of small farmers like McGowan to restructure supply chains so that they can obtain enough non-GMO corn to keep production steady.The Non-GMO Project says that the growing demand for non-GMO corn, soybean and canola is encouraging more farmers to plant non-GMO crops.Despite massive lobbying and propaganda campaigns on the part of the GM agriculture industry, Americans have consistently spoken out in favor of GMO labeling and the right to have a choice between purchasing GMO and non-GMO foods.There is a market for natural, organic, GMO-free foods , and those who are willing to put the time and effort into developing these products and the supply chains to support them are likely to be rewarded in the long run. GMO industry lies exposed, public now facing the truth Public awareness of the issues surrounding GMOs is growing. More people than ever now realize that the industry has failed to live up to its promise to ""feed a hungry world.""GMO crop yields are not bigger, the GM agricultural model hurts small farmers and poisons the planet with glyphosate, and GM cross-contamination and the development of herbicide-resistant superweeds are threatening the entire agricultural spectrum – and the public is finding out about it.The GMO deception is no longer sustainable, just as GM crops are not a part of a truly sustainable agricultural system. The sooner food producers realize that and begin giving the public what it wants – i.e. healthy, organically-raised , sustainable food products – the more chance they will have to survive and thrive in an evolving and highly competitive marketplace.Smaller companies like Our Little Rebellion and established food giants like Dannon (which recently made a pledge towards GMO-labeling transparency and introducing non-GMO products) are likely to benefit over the long haul for having joined the ""non-GMO rebellion"" early on.The demand for healthy food is real, and the market will eventually be forced to meet that demand.

11679,"‘Moonlight,’ ‘La La Land’ and Everything Else That Happened at the Oscars - The New York Times","• “Moonlight” is best picture. In a bewildering end to the show, “La La Land” was first announced as the winner before its jubilant cast and crew were interrupted with a scarcely believable correction. • Emma Stone won best actress for “La La Land. ” Casey Affleck won best actor for “Manchester by the Sea. ” • “La La Land” won six Oscars, including best director, best original score and best song (denying   Miranda an EGOT in the process). The film had 14 nominations, tied for the most ever. • Jimmy Kimmel hosted the show. • Here’s a red carpet slide show and a fashion review. LOS ANGELES  —   In an epic flub that drew gasps of horror  —   and joy  —   at the Dolby Theater here, Faye Dunaway mistakenly named “La La Land” best picture at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday night, but in reality “Moonlight” won the top prize. The producers of “La La Land” were still thanking their families and fellow artists when the interjection came that “Moonlight” had in fact won, as everyone wondered if that was a joke. But it wasn’t, and the “La La Land” people quickly exited the stage as producers and stars of “Moonlight,” just as stunned as everyone else, walked on. Warren Beatty and Ms. Dunaway had presented the best picture award. When Mr. Beatty opened the envelope, he took an extended pause before showing the card to Ms. Dunaway, who then announced “La La Land” as the winner. “I want to tell you what happened,” Mr. Beatty said in the chaotic moments after “Moonlight” was announced as the winner. “I opened the envelope, and it said ‘Emma Stone, La La Land.’ That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny. This is ‘Moonlight,’ the best picture. ” “Moonlight,” the story of a young, gay, black man, won three statuettes in total, including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor. “Very clearly, even in my dreams this could not be true,” said Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight. ” “But to hell with dreams, I’m done with it, because this is true. Oh my goodness. ” Held up as an escapist,    antidote for the times, the   “La La Land” won six Oscars, including statuettes for Damien Chazelle’s directing and Ms. Stone’s acting, during a jaunty ceremony that swung between   and political acrimony  —   before its wild ending. “It threw me more than a bit,” Mahershala Ali, who won best supporting actor for “Moonlight,” said backstage. “I just didn’t want to go up there and take anything from somebody, you know?” PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that handles the Oscars balloting, took responsibility for the mixup. “We sincerely apologize to ‘Moonlight,’ ‘La La Land,’ Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Oscar viewers for the error,” the firm said in a statement. “The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened. ” ABC News tweeted out a photo that showed that the envelope in Mr. Beatty’s hand read “Actress in a Leading Role. ” After the show, Ms. Stone said on ABC that she had held onto the envelope with the card bearing her name after she won best actress. In a blog post published on Medium this month, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, explained the process of handling the envelopes for the Oscars. Mr. Cullinan wrote that he and Ms. Ruiz each had a full set of envelopes and stood on opposite sides of the stage, where they handed envelopes to presenters. “It doesn’t sound very complicated,” Mr. Cullinan said, “but you have to make sure you’re giving the presenter the right envelope. ” Here are other notable moments from the show: “Hacksaw Ridge,” the true story of a heroic World War II medic, won Oscars for sound mixing and film editing, a category that is often predictive of the best picture winner. Kenneth Lonergan won the best screenplay statuette for his “Manchester by the Sea,” the story of a grieving New England handyman. Casey Affleck, who played the lead role in Mr. Lonergan’s film, beat Denzel Washington (“Fences”) for best actor. “I’m just dumbfound I’m included,” Mr. Affleck said. The supporting acting prizes went to Viola Davis for her work in “Fences,” about a Pittsburgh family in the 1950s, and Mr. Ali for his portrayal of a sympathetic drug dealer in “Moonlight,” which also collected the adapted screenplay Oscar, for Mr. Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney. “All you people out there who feel like there’s no mirror for you, that your life is not reflected, the academy has your back, the A. C. L. U. has your back, we have your back  —   and for the next four years, we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you,” Mr. Jenkins said from the stage. Among the nominees leaving with nothing: “Lion,” an adoption   with six nominations, and the box office hit “Hidden Figures,” which had three nods. As expected, Ms. Davis won the best supporting actress Oscar  —   her first  —   for playing a   housewife in “Fences. ” (She won best actress at the 2010 Tony Awards for playing the same role onstage. She was the one who decided to drop to the supporting category for the Oscars.) An intense, nearly overcome Ms. Davis touched on her family, her industry “cheerleaders,” the film’s director (Mr. Washington) graveyards, dashed dreams and the playwright August Wilson, who adapted his “Fences” for the screen and whom Ms. Viola praised as someone who “exhumed and exalted the ordinary people. ” The night’s first award went to Mr. Ali, who tearfully thanked the cast and crew of “Moonlight” and his own family. “Peace and blessings,” he said, avoiding a repeat of the pointed comments he made at previous awards shows about the Trump administration’s travel ban. After two years when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was criticized as racist for overlooking black actors and films about   experiences, this year’s nominee list was remarkably diverse. Six black actors received nominations, a record. The foreign film and documentary races were notably relevant this year. Among foreign films, the German satire “Toni Erdmann” initially had the momentum. But Mr. Trump’s travel ban put the spotlight on Iran’s entry, “The Salesman,” whose director, Asghar Farhadi, said that he would boycott the ceremony in protest  —   a decision that may have ultimately helped his film win. Anousheh Ansari, an   businesswoman, accepted the award for “The Salesman” and read a message from Mr. Farhadi. The note said that he was not attending in solidarity with immigrants “who have been disrespected by the inhumane law,” referring to the Trump administration’s travel ban. Among nonfiction films, Ava DuVernay’s   look at mass incarceration, “13th,” was campaigned for aggressively by Netflix, and the civil   “I Am Not Your Negro” surged late in the season. But the nearly             “O. J.: Made in America” was named best documentary. In accepting the award, Ezra Edelman, the film’s director, dedicated the Oscar to Nicole Brown Simpson, Ronald Goldman and “the victims of police violence, police brutality, racially motivated violence and criminal injustice. ” Mr. Kimmel, an Everyman schtick carefully in place, opened his monologue by asking viewers, both conservative and liberal, to come together in a calm conversation. “If we could all do that we could make America great again, we really could,” he said, to applause. Mr. Kimmel, appearing confident and calm  —   and with the   audience, munching on Red Vines and Junior Mints, now firmly on his side  —   soon took sharper aim. In a reference to President Trump, Mr. Kimmel said, “Remember last year, when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” As the ceremony went on, organizers played up Hollywood glamour and paid homage to Academy Awards history. Music interludes were taken from the scores of “Top Gun” and “Tootsie. ” Shirley MacLaine appeared as a presenter, joking that the standing ovation was “the nicest reception I’ve had in 250, 000 years. ” At one point, Mr. Kimmel trotted out a tour bus full of unsuspecting tourists, to mixed results. But politics was a consistent topic. Gael García Bernal, presenting best animated film to “Zootopia,” said, “As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I am against any form of wall that wants to separate us. ” Left to bridge the gap between people watching from their sofas in Kansas City and the theater filled with coastal elites was Mr. Kimmel. In a moment that certainly checked the populist box, the busload of unsuspecting Hollywood tourists, selfie sticks aloft, found themselves ushered into the Dolby Theater, and shuffled before Hollywood   and the world. The bit, which went on at some length, drew a polarizing response on social media, with some viewers criticizing Mr. Kimmel for exploiting the tourists and mocking an Asian woman’s name. Later, Mr. Kimmel joked that President Trump had not tweeted about the show. So Mr. Kimmel typed out a tweet to the president on his phone: “Hey @realDonaldTrump u up?”",0
11680,California Today: Questions Persist After the Oakland Fire - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Ten days have passed since a fire ripped through an Oakland warehouse during an electronic music show and killed 36 people. The Times is chasing a number of questions that arose after the fire. The latest of what we know: • The victims: On Wednesday, firefighters ended their search of the   structure that had housed a rambling artists’ colony. The final toll made it the country’s deadliest structure fire since 2003, when 100 people died at a nightclub in West Warwick, R. I. The Oakland victims, many of them artists and musicians who ranged in age from 17 to 61, have been profiled in The Times, The Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and East Bay Times, among other publications. On Sunday, the first funerals were held for two of the victims  —   Jonathan Bernbaum, 34, and Draven McGill, 17  —   the Chronicle reported. • The cause: Investigators have not figured out how the fire erupted, but no evidence has suggested arson, they say. Scrutiny has centered on a possible electrical source. On Friday, officials ruled out an appliance that had seemed a likely culprit: a faulty refrigerator. Jake Jacobitz, who did electrical work at the warehouse, told East Bay Times that all of the structure’s power came from a single line threaded through a wall. Electrical breakers blew out frequently, he said. The authorities have warned we may never know for certain what caused the Dec. 2 blaze. Reporters from The Times’s graphics department illustrated how the mazelike layout of the warehouse complicated escape from the fire. • The owner: Chor Nar Siu Ng, the warehouse owner since 1988, has not been heard from. Examining city records, The Times’s Julie Turkewitz learned that Ms. Ng owns a number of properties in Oakland and has been fined in the past for “nuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious” conditions. Several people who have stayed at the Ghost Ship said Ms. Ng had visited the warehouse, which was not permitted for residents. But it was unclear if she knew what was going on inside. • The master tenants: Derick Ion Almena and his wife, Micah Allison, who ran the Ghost Ship, have also avoided the public eye. Friends, associates and former tenants speaking in the news media have variously depicted the couple as misunderstood or manipulative. In an anguished interview on “Today” last week, Mr. Almena was asked whether he should be held accountable. “Should I be held accountable?” he said. “I can barely stand here right now. ” • The aftermath: Artists dwelling in illegal structures across the Bay Area are worried that inspectors would target them after the fire. The crackdown has been nationwide. There have been reports of spaces scrutinized or shut down in Baltimore, Nashville, Philadelphia, Dallas, Austin, Indianapolis, New Haven and Dubuque. Libby Schaaf, the Oakland mayor, said the city was weighing new measures to address fire safety, among them stricter requirements for smoke alarms and emergency exits. A criminal investigation into the fire is continuing. As Times reporters investigate the Ghost Ship fire, we are doing something new: posting regular updates on our findings.

11681,We Are about to Witness the Biggest Supermoon Since 1948,"We Are about to Witness the Biggest Supermoon Since 1948 Nov 10, 2016 0 0 
We are to witness something amazing on the eve of November 14 . On that day, the distance between our planet and the moon will be the shortest in almost 70 years! The last time it happened was in January 1948. 
Earth’s natural satellite will appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter in comparison with an average full moon. It is estimated that the next supermoon of this size will take place on 25 November 2034 , so make sure you don’t miss this beautiful celestial event (if the weather conditions in your region are favorable for skywatching, of course)! 
As NASA reports: 
“The full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21 st century. The full moon won’t come this close to Earth again until 25 November 2034.” What Is a Supermoon 
Almost all celestial bodies have elliptical orbits; that’s why the distance between our planet and the moon is not always the same. The further side of the moon’s orbit is called apogee and the closer one is called perigee. In short, when a full moon occurs on the perigee, then we get a supermoon phenomenon , which causes our natural satellite to appear closer and brighter in the night sky. 
While supermoons are quite frequent (this year, we will have three of those), the full moon of November 14 will be within approximately 2 hours of perigee , which makes it a truly rare phenomenon. How to Watch a Supermoon 
A perfect location to enjoy the coming supermoon (as well as any other astronomical phenomenon) is somewhere away from the city so that the urban lights don’t interfere with skywatching. 
Don’t forget that the difference between a regular full moon and a supermoon is best seen to the human eye when the moon is close to the horizon. 
According to NASA, “ When the moon is near the horizon, it can look unnaturally large when viewed through trees, buildings, or other foreground objects.” 
The moon will be at the peak of its full phase and, therefore, will appear the biggest at 8:52am EST. For those of you living in Australia, the moon will reach its full phase at 12:52 a.m. AEST on November 15.

11682,China Denies South China Sea Construction Project Announced in Chinese State Media - Breitbart,"The Philippines has threatened to protest the launch of a building project on the Scarborough Shoal, a land formation within the Philippines’ sovereign territory that also falls within China’s “  line,” a territorial claim struck down by an international tribunal. [In a bizarre twist, however, the Chinese government denied any projects planned for the Scarborough Shoal and distanced itself from the   Hainan Daily newspaper report claiming otherwise.  That regional newspaper reported that Sansha City mayor Xiao Jie had announced new development projects in the Scarborough Shoal, including a new monitoring station. The Philippine Star notes that “Sansha” is a name typically used for a number of islands and shoals within Philippine and Vietnamese sovereign territory, including the Spratly Islands and the Scarborough Shoal. The newspaper adds that China has controlled the Scarborough Shoal since 2012 and not handed it over after the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague issued a ruling in the Philippines’ favor on the territorial dispute. While the Star identifies the Hainan Daily as a state newspaper, the Chinese government has denied the report. “We have checked with relevant authorities that the recent reports about building an environmental monitoring station on Huangyan Dao are false. There is no such a thing,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Wednesday. “China places great importance on its relationship with the Philippines and cherishes the sound momentum   relations are enjoying now. ” The loudest protests to the Hainan Daily report came from Philippine legal authorities. Justice Minister Vitaliano Aguirre said Tuesday that the government was planning to lodge a formal protest against China for any construction in the region, a case that Aguirre predicted would be “fairly strong. ” Aguirre added that his country was “strengthening the relationship with the United States” in response to China’s reported move. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio also weighed in, stating that, if the report is true, “the least the President should do” was file an official complaint. Carpio has previously threatened to impeach Duterte if he did not adequately defend the territorial integrity of the Philippines against China’s expansionist moves in the region. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella took a more conciliatory tone, merely stating that President Rodrigo Duterte “has repeatedly asserted that the Philippines is not giving up its claims and our entitlements over the area. ” Acting Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo told reporters that the Philippines was waiting for an official government statement before deciding how to respond. “We’ll be awaiting a reply from China before we consider what to do next  …     All we can really do is wait for China’s clarification,” he said. Manalo added that the Philippines was “maintaining a regular and close watch” over the area. President Duterte himself issued a statement on Thursday local time (Wednesday in the United States) acknowledging Hua’s denial. “I was informed that they are not going to do anything at Panatag [Scarborough Shoal] out of respect for our friendship,” he told reporters. “‘We will build nothing there’  —   that was the assurance given by the Chinese government. ” China, he added “has a word of honour. ” Duterte’s conciliatory attitude towards the report comes after a weekend in which the Philippine president announced his desire to work with the Trump administration in America, promising to “give all, whatever it is” to the United States except for a military alliance against China. A recent poll of Philippine nationals found that Duterte’s hesitance to confront China on the nation’s territorial integrity was wildly unpopular, as 84 percent of respondents said they wanted the government to “uphold its rights in the disputed waters” in the South China Sea.",0
11683,Weather Apps to Download and Store Up for Winter - The New York Times,"LIKE it or not, winter is coming. Apart from layering up, you can turn to your phone to help you brave the rain, wind or snow ahead. Weather apps are abundant in mobile app stores, and my new favorite is Fire + Rain. Unlike many other weather apps, it keeps weather data simple. Built on information from the Weather Network, the app’s display is streamlined and easy to understand. The screen’s color corresponds with the forecast, and the temperature is displayed in large type. Alongside this are a small icon and a simple phrase describing the weather, like “light rain” or “cloudy with showers. ” You get, at a glance, everything you need to know about the coming weather where you are. Swipe down the screen to see hourly and daily forecasts tap to swap between a   detailed forecast and a   forecast. If you see the words “heavy snow” in tomorrow morning’s forecast, you’ll know to make the necessary preparations tonight. Fire + Rain is free on iOS. For people who like detailed weather forecasts, there is RainAware. This app belongs to the new breed of weather apps that try to deliver extremely accurate weather data based on the time and your precise location. The app uses GPS to detect where you are, and then it pulls forecast data from its system, including detailed radar scans. Instead of the typical approximation other weather apps might offer, like “50 percent chance of storms,” RainAware has concrete alerts, like “It’s going to rain in 30 minutes. ” The app’s radar maps are also neat: They show how rain clouds are moving near you and predict where they will go next, so you can see how the weather is going to change. RainAware has a lot of features, including a weather clock showing the forecast in   increments, so it may take some getting used to. But it’s an excellent option. It costs $5 on iOS and $4 on Android. Another app, Storm Radar from Weather Underground, is a source that television weather forecasters consult before they step in front of the camera. This weather app has   radar maps and   algorithms to figure out if you are in the path of a nearby weather event. It even has lightning alerts for a   radius around your location. Data on variables like dew point and humidity can be viewed as colored patterns on a map, or as graphs or charts. You can also get highly localized weather alerts  —   for example, the app told me there were two “coastal event” alerts as high winds and high tides threatened the seafront zone near my home. If you prefer a   forecast, Storm Radar offers that too. There is a lot to discover in this app, and if you plan to use it you may need to spend some time on Google to get a full understanding of what all the data means. But it is free on iOS, and its interface is both attractive and easy to interact with. MeteoEarth, another scientific weather forecast app, shows animated maps that contain a wealth of forecasting information for your location. The maps can show data on rainfall, wind, temperature and pressure, and can even track tropical storms. The app also offers access to live weather webcams around the world that give a sense of the conditions in a particular location. MeteoEarth takes some figuring out, but its slick graphical interface is satisfying to use. It’s free on iOS and Android. Lastly, it may be worth keeping the free FEMA app (iOS, Android) on your phone in case your home is subjected to the worst of the winter weather. In addition to an alert system from the National Weather Service, the app offers guidance about what to do before, during and after a disaster. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has been making television programs about the wonders of life for 60 years, and now over 1, 000 clips from his body of work are available in a new app: Attenborough’s Story of Life (free on iOS, Android). Browse it with your children and enjoy learning about nature from the soothing voice of Sir David himself.",0
11685,It’s Children Against Federal Lawyers in Immigration Court - The New York Times,"TUCSON  —   After a long, scary trek through three countries to escape the gang violence in El Salvador, a    boy found himself scared again a few months back, this time in a federal immigration court here. There was an immigration judge in front of him and a federal prosecutor to his right. But there was no one helping him understand the charges against him. “I was afraid I was going to make a mistake,” the boy said in Spanish from his uncle’s living room, in a modest   house on the south side of this city. “When the judge asked me questions, I just shook my head yes and no. I didn’t want to say the wrong thing. ” Every week in immigration courts around the country, thousands of children act as their own lawyers, pleading for asylum or other type of relief in a legal system they do not understand. Suspected killers, kidnappers and others facing federal felony charges, no matter their ages, are entitled to   lawyers if they cannot afford them. But children accused of violating immigration laws, a civil offense, do not have the same right. In immigration court, people face charges from the government, but the government has no obligation to provide lawyers for poor children and adults, as it does in criminal cases, legal experts say. Having a lawyer makes a difference. Between October 2004 and June of this year, more than half the children who did not have lawyers were deported. Only one in 10 children who had legal representation were sent back, according to federal data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group connected to Syracuse University. “We have looked for any legal system in the United States where children are required to represent themselves against a government lawyer  —   child welfare proceedings, juvenile delinquency proceedings. We have not yet found one, and the government hasn’t found one either,” Stephen Kang, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Right Project, said in an interview. “What we have in immigration court is an    system,” Mr. Kang said. “Children face federal prosecutors at adversarial court hearings that can have    consequences for the children involved. ” A   lawsuit, filed by the A. C. L. U. and other civil rights organizations, is trying to change that. In a brief filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where the federal government is contesting the court’s authority to hear the case, Justice Department lawyers insisted that “aliens in civil administrative removal proceedings have the privilege of being represented by retained counsel, but do not possess either a constitutional or statutory right to appointed counsel at taxpayer expense. ” Yet the government has also spent millions of dollars paying for lawyers to represent unaccompanied children in immigration courts  —   from modest programs in Baltimore and Tennessee to a $55 million effort by the Department of Health and Human Services in cities throughout the United States. In remarks to the Hispanic National Bar Association in 2014,   General Eric H. Holder Jr. said, “Though these children may not have a constitutional right to a lawyer, we have policy reasons and a moral obligation to ensure the presence of counsel. ” Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, a part of the Justice Department that oversees the nation’s immigration courts, reiterated the position in an interview this month, saying in an email, “In general, legal representation enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of immigration proceedings. ” Most of the children appearing in immigration courts are from Central America, escapees of the poverty and street violence that make El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras some of the most dangerous countries in the world. Two summers ago, the children captured headlines when they surged across the United   border, surprising the authorities and overwhelming a system that was not prepared to absorb them. They were detained in a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Tex. and a warehouse in Nogales, Ariz. sleeping side by side behind   fences, on thin mattresses spread on the concrete floor. A crackdown by the Mexican authorities stemmed the flow, but the numbers are rising again, especially in the Big Bend region of Texas and around Yuma, Ariz. as smugglers have adjusted their routes to evade the authorities. The 37, 714 Central American children apprehended along the southern border between Oct. 1 and July 31, or the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, was 33 percent higher than the 28, 387 children caught during all of the 2015 fiscal year and not far from the 2014 record of 51, 705, according to Border Patrol statistics. The number of children in shelters changes daily, said Victoria Palmer, a spokeswoman for the Office of Refugee Resettlement. As of Aug. 1, 7, 900 unaccompanied children were under federal government supervision, with 2, 300 beds still available in the shelters, she said. The challenge has been helping these children once they go to court. “Our waiting list got to be so long, it wasn’t fair to put anyone else on a waiting list,” said Sara Van Hofwegen, a lawyer who represents unaccompanied children for Public Counsel, a   law firm in Los Angeles. “We tell the kids, ‘Sorry, call in six months, call some other time.’ It’s pretty common they’ll call five, six places and none of them is accepting new cases. ” In 2014, Matt Adams, legal director for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in Seattle, joined Public Counsel, the A. C. L. U. and other civil rights groups in suing the federal government on behalf of nine Central American children, ages 10 to 17, who were representing themselves in deportation hearings. Earlier this year, a judge gave one of the children, an indigenous boy from Guatemala, an ultimatum: Find a lawyer or come to his next hearing prepared to petition for asylum on his own. (The lawsuit gained   status in June.) The boy from El Salvador  —   whose family allowed him to be interviewed only if his name was not used, because they did not want to jeopardize his pending asylum case  —   tried to hire his own lawyer. His uncle and legal guardian said one lawyer had offered to take the case for $6, 000 the family decided against paying when the lawyer seemed hesitant about the boy’s chances of success. The uncle took the boy, his dark hair styled in a mohawk that droops along the nape of his neck, to his first immigration hearing in April, hoping to stand up and speak for him. But, the uncle said, the judge did not let him. So the boy plopped himself in the defendant’s chair, slipped on the headphones that piped in the    translation, and shook his head as much as he could until the judge told him he had to speak. On their way out, a lawyer from the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, which has been representing young people facing deportation for years, handed the uncle a business card. “Our overall goal is to represent every child that comes through immigration court,” said Lauren Dasse, the project’s executive director. The lawyers gave 7, 500    presentations to children in Arizona shelters last year, she said. Lawyers tell the children about the role immigration judges play and what happens in court. They also handed the children business cards, at the shelters and outside courtrooms, and encouraged them to call. The uncle said he was suspicious when the lawyer approached his nephew, and wondered why anyone would want to do this for free. Still, his nephew made an appointment. On Aug. 5, the judge gave the boy an extension so that his application for relief could be prepared and presented. He will be back to court in October. This time, with a lawyer.",0

11687,Reading Between the Lines for Gorsuch’s Views on Abortion - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Some of the current members of the Supreme Court had written books before they were nominated. Remember “Civil Procedure in Sweden,” by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Or “Regulation and Its Reform,” by Justice Stephen G. Breyer? Perhaps not. But a book by Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court, may make a more lasting impression. It is called “The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,” and it opens a window into Judge Gorsuch’s thinking not only on those topics, which are interesting enough, but also on the relationship between them and abortion. The book, published in 2006, is ambitious, learned, balanced and unusually lucid, at ease in philosophy, law and empirical research. It discusses the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence in detail, but Judge Gorsuch’s goal was not to critique those cases. He asked, rather, whether a constitutional right to abortion necessarily implies a right to assisted suicide and euthanasia. Sure, there are general statements about the value of human life, drawn from what Judge Gorsuch called “secular moral theory. ” “Human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable,” he wrote, adding that “the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong. ” This led him to support existing laws barring assisted suicide and euthanasia. But that broad statement does not answer the question of whether a fetus is a human life in the sense that Judge Gorsuch meant, or where he stands on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. Asked about the book at his 2006 confirmation hearing, after President George W. Bush nominated him to the federal appeals court in Denver, Judge Gorsuch first said that his personal views did not affect his judicial work. “My writings, just to clarify, have been largely in defense of existing law, that is, they are consistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions in this area and existing law in most places,” he added. “So, I do not think there is actually much tension between my writings and anything that might come before the court. ” That is about right. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that bans on assisted suicide and euthanasia should be retained, based partly on his understanding of the limits of the constitutional logic of the Supreme Court’s abortion decisions. His account of Roe v. Wade, for instance, is straightforward. “Under Roe’s express holding,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, “a fetus does not qualify as a person. ” In a footnote, he described a contrary view from a 1986 dissent. Notably, it came from a mentor, Justice Byron R. White, for whom Judge Gorsuch worked as a law clerk in 1993 and 1994. “The right to terminate a pregnancy differs from the right to use contraceptives because the former involves the death of a person while the latter does not,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, describing his old boss’s views. The important point for Judge Gorsuch was that the debate over assisted suicide was different from the one over abortion, as there was no doubt that there was a person involved when suicide was at issue. The task there, he said, was balancing “the interests of those persons who wish to control the timing of their deaths and those vulnerable individuals whose lives may be taken without their consent due to mistake, abuse or pressure in a regime where assisted suicide is legal. ” Judge Gorsuch also worked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy during his clerkship for Justice White, who had by then retired. As it happened, Judge Gorsuch arrived at the Supreme Court soon after another major abortion decision, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, issued in 1992. In a carefully hedged statement that avoided reliance on firsthand knowledge, though he doubtless had some, Judge Gorsuch described the atmosphere at the court in the wake of the Casey decision. “Rumors persist,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, “of considerable acrimony among court members during deliberations in Casey, arising perhaps in part because Justice Kennedy reportedly switched his vote after the court’s conference on the case, thereby altering the outcome in the case. ” The Casey decision is generally said to have reaffirmed Roe’s core holding. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that the decision should be read narrowly, in an apparent attempt to limit its implications for a right to assisted suicide or euthanasia. He acknowledged that the controlling opinion in Casey  —   from Justices Kennedy, Sandra Day O’Connor and David H. Souter  —   contained sweeping language, and he quoted what he called its “mystery of life” passage, which is generally attributed to Justice Kennedy. “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life,” the joint opinion said. But the opinion also relied on a second and narrower ground, saying that respect for precedent  —   stare decisis, in legal Latin  —   required the court to follow Roe. Judge Gorsuch argued that the flowery stuff was an aside. “Usually, though not always, only the narrowest rationale is said to control future courts,” he wrote. “Casey may come to be dominantly read as a stare decisis decision  —   a ruling, in essence, that we must respect the abortion right out of traditional deference to settled law  —   rather than creating any new,   right to ‘define one’s concept of existence,’” Judge Gorsuch wrote. At bottom, then, Judge Gorsuch saw no necessary constitutional connection between a right to abortion and one to assisted suicide or euthanasia. But Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year and whom Judge Gorsuch hopes to replace, said the questions were related, if only because the Constitution was silent about all of them. “We have now determined,” Justice Scalia said in a 2004 speech, “that liberties exist under the federal Constitution  —   the right to abortion, the right to homosexual sodomy  —   which were so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that they were criminal for 200 years. ” He added that his colleagues might be prepared to discover a right to assisted suicide in the Constitution. “We’re not ready to announce that right,” he said, sarcastically. “Check back with us. ”",0

Kirk, of course, has claimed to receive military honors he did not, in fact, receive. For him to attack Duckworth is not only the height of hypocrisy but mocking her ancestry is appalling. 
The Republican position, as restated here by Kirk, is that it’s okay to come from another country as long as you’re white. Neither Kirk nor his campaign has apologized. Kirk has said Trump should quit over his misogynist comments; apparently, it’s okay to make racist comments.

11689,Trump Makes Special Announcement After Homeless Lady Attacked By Liberals,"Share This After a homeless black Trump supporter was brutally set upon by an intolerant liberal mob, Donald Trump made an incredible announcement. 
A homeless black woman who has been guarding Donald Trump’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star from vandals was recently set upon by ruthless liberals, ripping up her signs and assaulting the helpless woman. However, as soon as Trump heard about what the leftist thugs had done, he immediately issued a special announcement that has us cheering. 
After privileged millionaire James Otis obliterated the Donald’s sidewalk star on Wednesday, an unnamed homeless woman boldly took it upon herself to act as guardian, making the cold slab her new temporary home. Utilizing her sleeping spot as her own political platform, the courageous vagrant created signs to peacefully showcase her support for Trump. Unfortunately, she underestimated just how savage and intolerant liberals are, especially when it comes to the minorities they claim to champion expressing a different opinion. 
Just one day after the homeless woman set up residence next to Trump’s star, a mob of vicious anti-Trump thugs attacked her, RT reports. After pushing her around and stealing her signs, some of the only property she owns, the animals knocked her and her cart down, continuing to hurl sickening insults and snatch things. 
Video captured the enraging assault, showing the woman lying on the ground, shaking, and holding back tears. Fortunately, the heart-breaking story quickly made its way to Trump, the only politician concerned with this transient’s well-being. Now, the Republican nominee has made an incredible announcement befitting of a U.S. president. 
The Gateway Pundit reports that Trump was so appalled by the mob’s treatment of this destitute woman that he has not only announced that he has a special “gift” for the victim but promises to seek justice for her barbaric abusers. The presidential candidate’s attorney, Michael Cohen, proclaimed on Friday that Trump promises the woman will have “the last laugh on these thugs.” . @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her… 
— Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 28, 2016 
At Trump’s behest, Cohen exploded on Twitter, repeatedly requesting followers to find the homeless woman. He explained that they have checked, but she is no longer staying on Trump’s star. However, the candidate wants to “change her life” when he finds her. 
Proving just how passionate Trump is about helping the woman, Cohen spent much of Friday responding to tweets, hoping to find some clue as to the woman’s current whereabouts. One user asserted that the woman is Marsha Lee , a resident of Santa Monica. However, it is unclear if this information is accurate. 
Cohen assured that the police are investigating the incident and he and Trump will do everything possible to see that the thugs responsible for the assault are brought to justice. It’s truly heart-warming to see such a powerful man going out of his way to do something significant for someone considered “the least of these.” 
Hopefully, this woman will receive the mystery gift Trump has waiting for her and the savages who bullied an innocent homeless person will be punished for their cowardly behavior. Of course, don’t expect Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama to say that her black life matters or even apologize for the thuggery of their own supporters. In fact, neither of them has come forward to help the unfortunate victim of their national policies that never helped her off the streets in the first place. 
This stomach-churning incident just goes to show how tolerant the left is when it comes to blacks, or anyone else for that matter, simply having an opinion with which they disagree.",0
11690,"Obama Admin Fines, “Forces Sheriff’s Dept. To Hire” Illegal Immigrants","
The lawlessness of the Obama Administration knows no bounds.
Not only has President Obama made every move he can through executive order to create and foster amnesty for illegal immigrants, but his Justice Department is now attempting to force people to hire undocumented workers.
Ironically, the agency on the other end of intimidation is the Denver County Sheriff’s Office.
Incredibly backwards…
via the Daily Caller :
Denver County’s sheriff office has been slapped with a fine by the Department of Justice (DOJ) because it refused to hire non-citizens as deputies. 
From the beginning of 2015 through last March, the Denver Sheriff Department went on a major hiring binge, adding more than 200 new deputies. But those jobs ended up only going to citizens, because the department made citizenship a stated requirement on the job application . The department admitted as much in a new settlement with the U.S. government, which requires it to pay a $10,000 fine. 
The department will also have to comb through all of its job applications from the past two years, identifying immigrants who were excluded from the hiring process and giving them due consideration. 
How can someone be hired to enforce the law, if they are living in violation and ignorance of it?
How can counties, state agencies, small businesses or individuals be forced to hire in violation of the law, in order to comply with non-discrimination?
Obviously the system has a logical loop failure, either that, or someone wants this country to eat itself.

11691,Help Wanted: Trump Betting Expert for Gambling Website - The New York Times,"Will President Trump seek to have his likeness added to Mount Rushmore? Will he announce the existence of alien life? Whimsical as these situations might sound, there is a growing market for betting on an already unpredictable Trump presidency. Paddy Power, the Irish gambling website known for its    marketing stunts, says wagers associated with Mr. Trump have been more popular than any other novelty bets it has offered in the last year, including bets associated with Britain’s referendum on whether to leave the European Union. Now, Paddy Power is hiring a “head of Trump betting” to oversee bets related to the American president and his administration. The company, which is part of Paddy Power Betfair, a bookmaking business based in Dublin, is advertising the   contracted position amid sustained interest in   bets. A Paddy Power spokesman insisted the job is a real one, despite the irreverent manner in which its advertisement is written. “With more than 100 special bets online, the successful candidate will monitor and manage existing Trump markets while devising new specials to launch,” the company said in its online advertisement. “They will also need to build a wall around the hub to ensure foreign bets don’t get in. ” The ad also said that “substantial experience with fake tan is preferable” and an “awareness of national security situation in Sweden” is beneficial, referring to the controversy after comments in February by Mr. Trump that implied something terrible had happened in Sweden the night before. On its website, Paddy Power offers customers a variety of potential bets tied to the Trump administration. They include which member of the Trump administration is likely to resign next  —   Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a    favorite  —   and whether the president will seek to have his likeness added to Mount Rushmore this year, at 100 to 1. The likelihood that Mr. Trump will announce that alien life exists: 20 to 1. Despite the popularity of bets involving Mr. Trump, Paddy Power Betfair said in January that the unexpected victory by Mr. Trump cost the company almost 5 million pounds, or about $6 million, in the fourth quarter. Before the election, Paddy Power said that it had paid out more than $1 million in late October to customers who bet on a victory by Hillary Clinton. The company had paid out $700, 000 two days ahead of President Barack Obama’s   in 2012. The company did not say how much customers had wagered on   bets. Paddy Power completed an   merger with its rival Betfair last year, creating an online gambling company that is now worth £7. 3 billion. The marketing for the Paddy Power brand includes a    blog, irreverent television advertisements and a variety of stunts. For example, the company sent a hearse to the stadium used by the British soccer team Leicester City after the team fired its manager, Claudio Ranieri, last month, less than a year after winning the English Premier League. The unexpected title run of Leicester City last year proved costly to gambling companies in Britain, costing Paddy Power alone more than £2 million. The club had a    chance of winning the league entering the   season. Other marketing stunts by Paddy Power have included the unveiling of a   balloon in the shape of a pair of lucky underpants at the Cheltenham Festival in 2013, and the display of a wax figure of the former Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, in a box labeled “In case of emergency break glass,” when the soccer club was struggling in 2014.",0
11692,Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper Steered Debate With Sharp Questions - The New York Times,"They dug for revelations, extracting news nuggets  —   a rarity on a debate night  —   like Donald J. Trump’s admission that he had used a nearly   loss to avoid paying federal income taxes for years. They pressed for specifics, interrupting the candidates to demand concrete strategies for handling conflict in Syria and reforming the nation’s health care system. And they posed blunt, provocative questions at a forum that typically feels more like public broadcasting than cable news: Had Mr. Trump ever sexually assaulted a woman? Did Hillary Clinton really believe that her use of a private email server was not “extremely careless”? The duo overseeing Sunday’s presidential debate, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News, seemed to cast off the   pressures on this year’s crop of moderators  —   Is   mandatory? Are interruptions O. K.?  —   and put themselves directly in the mix of a   encounter. The immediate response was praise from many journalists and some grumbling from partisans. One prominent critic, in fact, was sharing the debate stage: Mr. Trump, who did not hesitate to make his complaints known in real time. “Why aren’t you bringing up the emails?” he asked Mr. Cooper, after Mr. Trump believed he had been unfairly cut off. When Mr. Cooper replied, accurately, that the moderators had asked about Mrs. Clinton’s email server, Mr. Trump threw up his hands. “One on three,” he muttered, suggesting that the panel was siding with Mrs. Clinton against him. Later, Mr. Trump again questioned the umpires. “You know what’s funny? She went a minute over, and you don’t stop her,” he said to Ms. Raddatz, who had cut him off. “When I go one second over it’s like a big deal  —  ” “You had many answers,” Ms. Raddatz replied. Mr. Trump did face notably sharp questions about the recording that surfaced Friday in which he boasts about kissing and grabbing women. “You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women  —   do you understand that?” Mr. Cooper asked. When Mr. Trump dismissed the comments as “locker ” Mr. Cooper pressed several times  —   “Have you ever done those things?”  —   until Mr. Trump finally asserted that he had not. The moderators also pushed Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Raddatz, discussing the candidate’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks, asked, “Is it O. K. for politicians to be  ?” Mr. Cooper asked Mrs. Clinton how she could “unite a country” after dismissing half of Mr. Trump’s supporters as “deplorable. ” There were moments, too, where the moderators chastised the audience for cheering  —   and sternly cut off the candidates  —   as they tried to   the   atmosphere that seemed to quickly envelop the room. “The audience needs to calm down here,” Ms. Raddatz said, turning to the crowd. When Mr. Trump interrupted Mrs. Clinton at one point, Mr. Cooper rebuked him, saying, “She didn’t talk when you talked. ” Some conservatives were unimpressed. “I may not care for Trump, but he beat Hillary tonight fair and square even with Martha Raddatz trying to defeat him,” Erick Erickson, a   commentator, wrote on Twitter. One group that appeared shortchanged was the undecided voters sitting onstage, who, between the moderators’ tough questions and the candidates’ heated exchanges, received relatively little airtime. The moderators appeared willing to buck the debate’s format when they deemed a particular interaction newsworthy or illuminating. This tactic was from the one Elaine Quijano used in the   debate last week, who often cut off candidates’ answers so she could move to her next question. And the moderators eschewed the minimalist approach by Lester Holt of NBC in the first debate, who was less assertive and often remained silent for minutes at a time. If the first debate became something of a referendum on the role of the moderator  —   to   or not to  ?  —   the buildup to Sunday’s event was more focused on the raucous nature of the evening. Mr. Trump, a temperamental figure under the best of circumstances, walked onstage Sunday facing a growing revolt within his own party and even his own ticket: His running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, issued a statement declaring that Mr. Trump “has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night. ” Walking into this fray were Mr. Cooper and Ms. Raddatz, experienced moderators both, who were already preparing for unique challenges. The choice of Mr. Cooper, who is gay, prompted grumbling among some conservatives, who questioned his personal politics. Ms. Raddatz was the subject of a Breitbart News report on Sunday scrutinizing her coverage of President Obama. Although Ms. Raddatz moderated the   debate in 2012, that event was seen by 51 million viewers. At the high end, Sunday’s event was estimated to attract nearly twice that. Network executives were predicting a huge audience, in part because many Americans are home on Sunday evenings. But the extraordinary events of the last few days significantly raised those expectations. Last month’s debate between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton was seen by about 84 million Americans  —   a record for presidential debates, but shy of the 100 million or more viewers that typically tune in for the Super Bowl. Typically, the second debate sees a drop in viewers. Still, in 2008, the second matchup between Barack Obama and John McCain attracted nearly 11 million more viewers than their first in 1992, the second debate among Bill Clinton, George Bush and Ross Perot outscored the first by about seven million viewers.",0

11695,Badass Patriot Has MASSIVE Surprise For Thieves Who Stole His Trump Sign,"Badass Patriot Has MASSIVE Surprise For Thieves Who Stole His Trump Sign   Amanda Shea   Trump supporters 
It’s become a trend for Hillary Clinton-supporters with far too much time on their hands to steal any Donald Trump sign they can get their grubby hands on. There’s no returning the “favor” by taking a Hillary sign since they are practically non-existent in almost all neighborhoods. So, one proud patriot took retaliation to new heights ensuring liberals stay away from his sign. 
The unnamed owner of the Trump sign, who is believed to be in Arizona, is aware that his sign may not cost a lot but is worth much more than the plastic it’s printed on based on what it represents — a chance to take America back. Hillary-supporters are an odd group of people who seem to believe that the Constitutional right to free speech is only bestowed upon them, along with the power to take it from anyone who says something that they don’t like. 
Perhaps this the driving purpose behind the nationwide rash of Trump sign theft, paired with the fact that they think that they’re “helping” by removing these visual statements of support from public view. Either way, where there is a Trump sign, there’s a liberal nearby waiting for their chance to make a stupid statement of their own in stealing it. 
However, this sign owner beat them to the punch by putting it in a place that was not only impossible to reach but showed his support of the GOP candidate loud and proud. It sat up high in a tall tree, keeping it out of reach for thieving liberals. Taking Trump sign to new heights to prevent it from being stolen and make a bold message at the same time. 
If liberals really want to show their support for Hillary, they’ll have to climb this massive tree and tear it down, but chances are, they’re not as tough as they think they are and prefer to stick to easy to steal signs. We commend the hero for Trump who showed his bravery in putting the sign up so high, knowing that no liberal would dare to go there since it’s so far out of their safe space and more work than they are willing to perform.",0

11697,Migrant Crime and Violence Soars in German States - Breitbart,"Authorities in two German states have expressed concern over official figures showing a huge rise in migrant crime, with the number of violent attacks having almost doubled in 2016. [“Refugees really entered onto the crime scene last year,” said   State Criminal Police Office (LKA) president Ralf Michelfelder.  “We are very worried about the rise in violence by asylum seekers,” the police official added. The comments come following the release of figures which reveal a 95. 5 per cent spike in the number of physical attacks carried out by asylum seekers and migrants. Around 60 per cent of the assaults take place in asylum accommodation but the other 40 per cent are carried out among the general public. This group of migrants are also heavily represented among people caught for theft and drug offences, according to this year’s statistics. But “they can now be found as suspects of crimes in almost every field” according to the police official. Of a total of 251, 000 criminal suspects across the state in 2016, 107, 417 were foreign, with 25, 379 of these being asylum seekers and refugees. Syria was the most frequently seen country of origin in the latter category, followed by Gambia, and then Afghanistan. In Bavaria, the number of crimes committed by immigrants rose 57. 8 per cent from the previous year, a development which the state’s Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann described as “worrying”. “The increase in crime in Bavaria in 2016 is mainly due to foreign suspects, especially immigrants,” the minister said. There had been a 3. 3 per cent overall rise in the number of crimes statewide (the figure adjusted to remove offences like illegal immigration). The number of homicides in Bavaria increased by 15 per cent in 2016, while violent crimes carried out by asylum seekers rose by 93 per cent to 3, 495 cases. Of thefts which occurred across the German state, 42. 8 per cent of suspects were of foreign origin  —   an almost 1 per cent rise from the previous year. Earlier this year, the Berlin Senate launched a formal inquiry to find out why migrants are overrepresented in the city’s police crime reports compared to Germans. According to Germany’s Federal Police, the influx of newcomers from the third world since Europe’s migrant crisis directly led to an increase in crime within their jurisdiction.  ",0
11698,"Comment voter « Non » aux armes nucléaires, par Manlio Dinucci","« L’art de la guerre »
Comment voter « Non » aux armes nucléaires par Manlio Dinucci Les États-Unis viennent de faire rejeter —par leurs alliés au sein du Premier comité de l’Assemblée générale de l’Onu— une proposition visant à l’élimination totale des armes nucléaires. Cependant, il est possible pour les États abritant illégalement des bombes atomiques états-uniennes d’en exiger leur retrait de leur territoire en application de l’article 2 du Traité de non-prolifération.
Réseau Voltaire | Rome (Italie) | 2 novembre 2016 italiano « Merci, président Obama. L’Italie va continuer avec une grande détermination son engagement pour la sécurité nucléaire » : c’est ce qu’écrivait le Premier ministre Matteo Renzi dans un message tweeter historique. Six mois après, aux Nations Unies, Renzi a voté « Oui » aux armes nucléaires. Se mettant à la queue des USA, le gouvernement italien s’est rangé contre la Résolution, approuvée à grande majorité dans le premier comité de l’Assemblée générale, qui demande la convocation en 2017 d’une conférence des Nations Unies pour « négocier un outil légalement contraignant pour la prohibition des armes nucléaires, qui amène à leur élimination totale ».
Le gouvernement italien a ainsi mangé son chapeau sur ce qu’il avait promis à la Conférence de Vienne, il y a deux ans, aux mouvements antinucléaires « exigeants », en les assurant de sa volonté d’opérer pour le désarmement nucléaire en jouant un « rôle de médiation avec patience et diplomatie ». Ainsi tombe dans le vide l’appel « Exigeons le désarmement nucléaire total », dans lequel on demande au gouvernement « la poursuite cohérente de l’engagement et de la lutte pour la mise au ban des armes nucléaires », dans un parcours « humanitaire et juridique vers le désarmement nucléaire », dans lequel l’Italie pourrait jouer « un rôle plus qu’actif, possiblement de pointe ».
Par conséquence tombent dans le vide aussi les motions parlementaires de la même teneur. Les appels génériques au désarmement nucléaire sont facilement instrumentalisables : il suffit de penser que le président des USA, artisan d’un ré-armement nucléaire de 1 000 milliards de dollars, a été décoré du Prix Nobel de la Paix pour « sa vision d’un monde libéré des armes nucléaires ».
Le mode concret à travers lequel en Italie nous pouvons contribuer à l’objectif du désarmement nucléaire, énoncé dans la Résolution des Nations Unies, est celui de libérer notre pays des armes nucléaires états-uniennes. À cette fin il faut non pas en appeler au gouvernement, mais exiger qu’il respecte le Traité de non-prolifération (TNP), signé et ratifié par l’Italie, qui à l’article 2 stipule : « Chacun des États militairement non nucléaires, qui soit Partie au Traité, s’engage à ne pas recevoir de quiconque des armes nucléaires ou autres engins nucléaires explosifs, ni le contrôle sur de telles armes et engins explosifs, directement ou indirectement ». On doit exiger que l’Italie cesse de violer le TNP et demande aux États-Unis de retirer immédiatement toutes leurs armes nucléaires de notre territoire et de ne pas y installer les nouvelles bombes B61-12, fer de lance de l’escalade nucléaire USA/Otan contre la Russie, ni d’autres armes nucléaires. Il faut exiger que des pilotes italiens ne soient plus entraînés à l’utilisation d’armes nucléaires sous commandement états-unien.
C’est l’objectif de la campagne lancée par le Comité No Guerra, No Nato et d’autres sujet. La campagne a obtenu un premier résultat important : le 26 octobre, au Conseil Régional de la Toscane, a été approuvée à la majorité une motion du groupe Sì Toscana a Sinistra (Oui, Toscane à gauche) qui « engage la Junte à demander au Gouvernement de respecter le Traité de non-prolifération des armes nucléaires et faire que les État-Unis retirent immédiatement toute arme nucléaire du territoire italien et renoncent à y installer les nouvelles bombes B61-12 et autres armes nucléaires ». À travers ces initiatives et d’autres on peut créer un vaste front qui, avec une forte mobilisation, impose au gouvernement le respect du Traité de non-prolifération.
Il y a six mois nous demandions sur les pages du Manifesto s’il y avait quelqu’un au Parlement disposé à exiger, sur la base du TNP, le retrait immédiat de l’Italie des armes nucléaires états-uniennes. Nous sommes encore en attente de la réponse.

11702,Exclusive — White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on First 100 Days: President Trump ‘Going Big League on Trade’ - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Breitbart News exclusively that he believes that President Donald Trump has been “going big league” on trade policy in his first 100 days in office. [“I think the president is going big league on trade right now,” Priebus said in an exclusive interview on Thursday afternoon, just a couple days before the   mark. He went on to say:  He just signed an executive order on aluminum that ends us being taken advantage of on aluminum. Last week it was steel. He’s been talking about NAFTA, and making sure that we get a good deal —  and otherwise, if we don’t get a good deal, he’s willing to pull the trigger and start the process of getting out of NAFTA. One of the first things he did was get out of TPP, another campaign promise. I think the president is cooking with gas right now when it comes to trade. In the past week plus, Trump has gone hard after NAFTA —  first signaling he would be open to scrapping the   trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and Canada entirely, before agreeing to renegotiate the deal after phone calls with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto. Meanwhile, the president has cracked down on Canadian dairy and lumber industries —  which have had a negative effect on U. S. counterparts —  and zoned in on cracking down on unfair practices on the world stage with regards to the aluminum and steel industries. All of that comes after, in just his first couple weeks as president, he followed through on a campaign promise to rip up the Trans Pacific Partnership —  once and for all. Priebus’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News comes as the   mark looms, and it focused on the administration’s successes, setbacks, and lessons learned. Despite legacy, establishment media outlets claiming repeatedly that Trump has not delivered much in his first few months in office, the president has actually had a number of successes across government and in all facets of his agenda with more to come, Priebus pointed out: Well, look, I think that the president accomplished something that’s quite historical whether you look at deregulation or TPP —  28 pieces of legislation, he followed through on the ethics pledge to make sure that all of his staff are barred from ever lobbying for a foreign government and five years within that same department as a domestic lobbyist. He’s touched on HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] opioids, Keystone, I could just go on and on —  not to mention Gorsuch, who’s an incredible pick. Just look at the deregulation —  obviously, you’ve written about it but it’s remarkable. For every new regulation, two regulations have to be dismissed which means he put our country on a permanent glide path toward deregulation on a permanent basis. There’s more —  but one last thing: Look at how he’s realigned our position in the world. He’s got leverage with North Korea and China, realigning there, he’s forcing countries to pay up to NATO. We had the NATO meeting and I know some people were sort of perplexed that he was on stage with NATO but what was the first thing that came out of the Secretary General’s mouth? He said President Trump is 100 percent right that these countries have to start paying up. Look at Egypt: He was criticized for having a meeting with Egypt. What happened 10 days later? The prisoner was released, something that Barack Obama couldn’t get done. All I would tell you is I think if you look at everything President Trump could control, he’s done a remarkable job and I would say a historically good job. All of that is true: Trump has opened up the Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access pipeline instituted the aforementioned ethics pledge held events focused on and signed executive orders related to HBCUs and the opioid epidemic achieved that success with NATO at a meeting and joint press conference with the Secretary General secured the release of an American prisoner held by the Egyptian government and appointed and overseen the confirmation in the U. S. Senate of Neil Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court. Specifically on Gorsuch, Priebus told Breitbart News, the fact that Trump nominated him and the whole process that played out should be proof Trump is “a man of his word. ” Priebus told Breitbart News: For one thing, the entire process should be totally a complete validation that President Trump is a man of his word because he put out that list, he told the world that ‘I’m going to choose a judge from this list,’ some people questioned it, but he followed through in grand fashion. That’s number one. Number two, the process of interviewing, the process of vetting started back in November after the victory and the process was methodical and he spoke to all the right people and players and groups and had meetings in the White House if you remember with Republicans and Democrats. He talked to trade groups, he talked to citizens across the country, he talked to members of the Senate, he did everything that you would expect a professional, competent operation to do and he did it every day until ultimately he made the decision to choose Justice Gorsuch. Priebus added that the execution of the Gorsuch pick rollout, among many other things —  including    operations at the White House, where Trump has had an overpacked schedule nearly every day with multiple events, bill signings, executive order signings, meetings with foreign dignitaries, and more since his inauguration on Jan. 20 —  is a sign that the White House runs smoothly. No small feat. Priebus said: Even the mystery of who it would be up until the very time Justice Gorsuch walked out into the East Room was executed to a T, which sort of brings us to another point which is there’s a lot —  you look at the    here in the White House. One EO [executive order] signing, a bill signing, a meeting with a trade group, a bilateral meeting with a foreign dignitary, and you look at the amount of activity that goes on in this White House with this president —  it’s not like he’s doing one event a day, he’s doing one thing after the next and he’s doing it flawlessly. Just so you know, that doesn’t happen by accident. The team here, everything from the public liaison to the political operation to the intergovernmental agency process, I’m just telling you that though the Gorsuch thing is the big shiny object that was flawless, you look at all of these events that happen, you have to say there’s not a lot of things that go wrong on a regular basis on the    operation in the White House. Another point that has appeared in virtually no media roundups of Trump’s first 100 days, Priebus said, is the president’s first address to a joint session of Congress. That speech earned him universal praise, and one of the most powerful moments in modern presidential history —  his exchange with Carryn Owens, the widow of fallen U. S. Navy SEAL Ryan Owens —  rocked the world that night. Priebus continued: I think what you saw that night was everything that President Trump believed in —  whether it be from the 1980s, the 1990s, where we are today, the feeling that he has about this country, how much better we should be and how much stronger we should be and how much more respected we should be —  was captured that night,” Priebus told Breitbart News about the president’s speech that evening. “It was captured through a lot of issues. It was captured through talking about education, it was captured through talked about our position on the world stage, it was captured talking about what we need to do to repeal and replace Obamacare, but beside that it was captured in a moment of pride looking at a widow up in the balcony that lost a hero soldier and honored by a president that understood the incredible value of life and the value and respect that he has for the heroes of this country and also the respect for the United States of America at that moment where the president, the House and the Senate are getting together and talking about how great America ought to be all coming together in a stew of pride that was captured by looking at that great family up in the balcony. That’s what I was thinking about when that happened and I think that’s what a lot of people were thinking about.  Since Trump won the election, and especially since he has been in office, nearly every economic indicator has been on the upswing —  from the stock market to employment numbers to business development and more —  something Priebus attributes to an overall message of optimism emanating from the president. Priebus’s words: I think what’s important to know is that underlying all of the things that President Trump is doing is one real basic theme which is optimism,” Priebus said. “There’s an incredible optimism among manufacturers, business groups, people that are expecting a better future. All the polling aside —  I know everyone loves to talk about the polling —  but one of the things that gets lost, and you touched on it, is that people are optimistic for the future. People believe that President Trump is going to follow through on his promises and that those promises are going to result in a better future for everybody. When you look at the stock market, you look at business growth, the housing market, sales getting better, people being able to buy and sell their house, all those things matter —  and that sort of optimism underneath everything is I think a great foundation for President Trump’s legacy moving forward. On immigration, illegal border crossings are down, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly have increased efforts to enforce the law. President Trump recently, in a meeting with conservative media at the White House earlier this week, compared   —  the drug trafficking connected gang —  to terrorist group Al Qaeda, and the administration has created an office, VOICE, designed to represent families with victims of illegal immigrant crime. Trump, meanwhile, maintains plans to build a wall along the U. S.  border once and for all —  despite setbacks for now in funding from the congressional side of things. Priebus, in his exclusive interview with Breitbart News, sang the president’s praises on immigration: People understand across the borders that we have a president that’s not really interested in playing games on illegal immigration. We’ve had enough illegal immigration. It’s time to get serious about putting Americans first, and legal Americans first. I think we’re in agreement that there’s not anything good about illegal immigration, and a lot of it’s that really bad like drugs, human trafficking, violence —  there’s a lot of reasons for having and wanting to have a wall on the southern border. It’s not just a wall that’s a campaign promise. It’s a wall that’s there to protect Americans from something that shouldn’t be happening. So as far as this issue is concerned, the president has been very strong on illegal immigration and I think that people that have been attempting to come over the border on the mass trek across hundreds of miles maybe even through Central America and Mexico are thinking again about it saying ‘you know what? This may not be worth it because we’re going to get turned around and get returned back to where we came from.’ That may sound harsh, but it’s not. It’s about sovereignty and protecting the people of the United States. On rolling back regulations, which Trump has done via executive action, and empowering his cabinet officials to act and through the Congressional Review Act, Priebus said that Trump’s vision resembles his predecessor Ronald Reagan. Priebus said to Breitbart News, “Here’s what I think people should understand: One of the pillars of Reaganomics was deregulation. If you ask anyone about Reaganomics, you can’t have a conversation about how that economic transformation happened without talking about deregulation. If you look at the president’s earliest actions, it’s all about deregulation. It’s all about CRAs. It’s about deregulation. I think he’s at 12 CRAs now, and there’s only one that was done previous to President Trump. So when you take the executive order on deregulation two for one, you take the CRA activity, you look at what he’s doing on clean power —  and obviously that’s part of it —  but this unbelievable effort and focus on deregulation is part of what his vision is. The president will tell you —  and you saw in his tax plan, he’s all for lowering taxes for every American and it’s going to be the biggest tax cut for all Americans that’s ever been done —  but put that aside, he also understands a lot of these guys in small business who put people to work, they will tell you ‘listen the taxes are out of control, we shouldn’t be paying 35 percent, but I’ll tell you what, what’s worse is the regulations. I’m getting killed on regulations. I hate the taxes, but the regulations are worse.’ The president gets it. ”",0
11703,Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Lawyer Goes to Work for Soros-Funded Super PAC,"The lawyer who represented Hillary Clinton’s campaign and her doomed presidential election recount efforts has reportedly joined the board of a progressive super PAC financed by billionaire George Soros and focused in part on issues of voting rights. [CNN reported:  The super PAC Priorities USA has brought Democratic superlawyer Marc Elias onto its board and plans to focus on fighting   GOP efforts to restrict voting access in courts and legislatures. During the most recent presidential election, Priorities USA served as a   super PAC. Soros provided at least $8. 5 million to the group, including $6 million in December 2015 and another $2. 5 million in August 2016, public records show. The Hill reported in January 2016 after Soros’s first contribution: In the last 6 months, the   raised $25. 3 million, meaning that Soros’s contribution accounted for almost a quarter of its fundraising haul. Following the election, Priorities USA is seeking to “reposition itself as a hub of   Democratic activity,” Politico reported last month. Continued Politico on the Super PAC’s new efforts: One of its primary initiatives will also be a push branded as “The BluePrint Project,” which aims to study and engage both voters who backed President Barack Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016, and those who supported Obama before staying home this past November. That campaign has already begun: led by pollsters Geoff Garin and Jef Pollock, Priorities will next week convene focus groups in the     states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida, focusing on counties that saw the largest swings from Obama to Trump, and the biggest   in voting rates within African American communities. Elias served as the Clinton campaign’s general counsel. In November, he announced Clinton’s losing campaign would participate in Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s recount efforts. Elias is a senior lawyer at the Perkins Coie law firm, which has also represented Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The lawyer has previously been tied to Soros. In July, the New York Times reported Soros had pledged up to $5 million for a legal fight led by Elias against what the newspaper characterized as “restrictive voting laws enacted in recent years by   state governments. ” The Times further reported on Elias’   efforts: Elias, who specializes in   issues, was in contact with Mr. Soros in January 2014 when Mr. Elias was exploring a series of federal lawsuits before that year’s midterm election and in advance of the 2016 campaign, according to Mr. Soros’s political adviser, Michael Vachon. (Mr. Elias declined to comment on Friday about the funding of the lawsuits.) The goal is to try to influence voting rules in states where Republican governors and   legislatures have enacted election laws since 2010, and to be ready to intervene if additional measures are passed over the next 17 months. At the time, Soros helped pay for two lawsuits in Ohio and Wisconsin, and the billionaire activist contributed funds for suits that, according to the Times, “Mr. Elias and several other groups filed last year in North Carolina. ” In August, the Washington Post spotlighted the   legal work of Elias in a profile titled, “The crusade of a Democratic superlawyer with   backing. ” The newspaper described Elias as the “  lawyer for Democrats in recount fights and redistricting battles. ” The Post reported on Elias’s top benefactor: With a   commitment from liberal   George Soros, Elias is challenging laws that, he argues, diminish the impact of important Democratic Party constituencies of African Americans, Latinos and young people. “I don’t think people should think we’re done filing lawsuits for this election cycle,” Elias said in a taxicab interview after two flights and a   weather delay delivered him to Phoenix. The Post detailed the evolution of Soros’s financial backing: While Elias will not discuss the funding for his project, Soros’s spokesman Michael Vachon said Elias approached them with a set of proposals for challenging state restrictions that would be helpful “up and down the ballot. ” That was appealing to Soros, who began his political giving with voter mobilization efforts, Vachon said. And they agreed with Elias that there was work to be done beyond what the civil rights groups, to which Soros also contributes, were doing.   …     Soros has given $5 million to the trust that funds the litigation, Vachon said, and Elias said he has picked his shots with an eye toward “protecting the Obama coalition” of African Americans, Latinos and young people.

11705,"North Korea, Far From Crazy, Is All Too Rational - The New York Times","Is North Korea irrational? Or does it just pretend to be? North Korea has given the world ample reason to ask: threats of war, occasional attacks against South Korea, eccentric leaders and   propaganda. As its nuclear and missile programs have grown, this past week with a fifth nuclear test, that concern has grown more urgent. But political scientists have repeatedly investigated this question and, time and again, emerged with the same answer: North Korea’s behavior, far from crazy, is all too rational. Its belligerence, they conclude, appears calculated to maintain a weak, isolated government that would otherwise succumb to the forces of history. Its provocations introduce tremendous danger, but stave off what Pyongyang sees as the even greater threats of invasion or collapse. Denny Roy, a political scientist, wrote in a   1994 journal article that the country’s “reputation as a ‘crazy state’” and for “reckless violence” had “worked to North Korea’s advantage,” keeping more powerful enemies at bay. But this image, he concluded, was “largely a product of misunderstanding and propaganda. ” In some ways, this is more dangerous than irrationality. While the country does not want war, its calculus leads it to cultivate a permanent risk of one  —   and prepare to stave off defeat, should war happen, potentially with nuclear weapons. That is a subtler danger, but a grave one. When political scientists call a state rational, they are not saying its leaders always make the best or most moral choices, or that those leaders are paragons of mental fitness. Rather, they are saying the state behaves according to its perceived   first of which is  . When a state is rational, it will not always succeed in acting in its best interests, or in balancing   against   gains, but it will try. This lets the world shape a state’s incentives, steering it in the desired direction. States are irrational when they do not follow  . In the “strong” form of irrationality, leaders are so deranged that they are incapable of judging their own interests. In the “soft” version, domestic factors  —   like ideological zeal or internal power struggles  —   distort incentives, making states behave in ways that are counterproductive but at least predictable. North Korea’s actions, while abhorrent, appear well within its rational   according to a 2003 study by David C. Kang, a political scientist now at the University of Southern California. At home and abroad, he found, North Korean leaders shrewdly determined their interests and acted on them. (In an email, he said his conclusions still applied.) “All the evidence points to their ability to make sophisticated decisions and to manage palace, domestic and international politics with extreme precision,” Mr. Kang wrote. “It is not possible to argue these were irrational leaders, unable to make   calculations. ” Victor Cha, a Georgetown University professor who served as the Asian affairs director on George W. Bush’s National Security Council, has repeatedly argued that North Korea’s leadership is rational. Savage cruelty and cold calculation are not mutually exclusive, after all  —   and often go hand in hand. States are rarely irrational for the simple reason that irrational states can’t survive for long. The international system is too competitive and the drive for   too powerful. While the North Korean state really is unlike any other on earth, the behaviors that make it appear irrational are perhaps its most rational. North Korea’s seemingly unhinged behavior begins with the country’s attempt to solve two problems that it took on with the end of the Cold War and that it should have been unable to survive. One was military. The Korean Peninsula, still in a formal state of war, had gone from a   deadlock to an overwhelming tilt in the South’s favor. The North was exposed, protected only by a China that was more focused on improving ties with the West. The other problem was political. Both Koreas claimed to represent all Koreans, and for decades had enjoyed similar development levels. By the 1990s, the South was exponentially freer and more prosperous. The Pyongyang government had little reason to exist. The leadership solved both problems with something called the Songun, or “” policy. It put the country on a permanent war footing, justifying the state’s poverty as necessary to maintain its massive military, justifying its oppression as rooting out internal traitors and propping up its legitimacy with the     nationalism that often comes during wartime. Of course, there was no war. Foreign powers believed the government would, like other Soviet puppets, fall on its own, and barring that wanted peace. So North Korea created the appearance of permanently imminent war, issuing flamboyant threats, staging provocations and, sometimes, deadly attacks. Its nuclear and missile tests, though erratic and often failed, stirred up one crisis after another. This militarization kept the North Korean leadership internally stable. It also kept the country’s enemies at bay. North Korea may be weaker, but it is willing to tolerate far more risk. By keeping the peninsula on the edge of conflict, Pyongyang put the onus on South Korea and the United States to pull things back. From afar, North Korea’s actions look crazy. Its domestic propaganda describes a reality that does not exist, and it appears bent on almost provoking a war it would certainly lose. But from within North Korea, these actions make perfect sense. And over time, the government’s reputation for irrationality has become an asset as well. Scholars ascribe this behavior to the “madman theory”  —   a strategy, coined by no less a proponent than Richard M. Nixon, in which leaders cultivate an image of belligerence and unpredictability to force adversaries to tread more carefully. Dr. Roy, in an interview, said North Korea “intentionally employs a posture of seemingly   acceptance and willingness to go to war as a means of trying to intimidate its adversaries. ” But this strategy works only because, even if the belligerence is for show, the danger it creates is very real. In this way, it is North Korea’s rationality that makes it so dangerous. Because it believes it can survive only by keeping the Korean Peninsula near war, it creates a risk of sparking just that, perhaps through some accident or miscalculation. North Korea is aware of this risk but seems to believe it has no choice. For this reason, and perhaps because of the United   invasion of Iraq and the NATO intervention in Libya against Col. Muammar   it appears to earnestly fear an American invasion. And this is rational: Weak states that face more powerful enemies must either make peace  —   which North Korea cannot do without sacrificing its political legitimacy  —   or find a way to make any conflict survivable. North Korea’s nuclear program, some analysts believe, is designed to halt an American invasion by first striking nearby United States military bases and South Korean ports, then by threatening a missile launch against the American mainland. While North Korea does not yet have this ability, analysts believe it will within the next decade. This is the culmination of North Korea’s rationality, in something known as desperation theory. Under this theory, when states face two terrible choices, they will pick the least bad option  —   even if that choice would, under normal conditions, be too costly to consider. In North Korea’s case, that means creating the conditions for a war it would most likely lose. And it could mean preparing a   effort to survive that war by launching multiple nuclear strikes, chancing a nuclear retaliation for the slim chance to survive. North Korea’s leaders tolerate this danger because, in their calculus, they have no other choice. The rest of us share in that risk  —   vanishingly small, but nonzero  —   whether we want to or not.",0
11706,Andrew Walther: Obama Administration Allowed ISIS Dechristianization in Syria and Iraq,"Andrew Walther, vice president of communications for the Knights of Columbus  —   the world’s largest Catholic fraternal order  —   joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow for a special edition of Breitbart News Daily live from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to discuss his   calling for Christian refugees from the Islamic State (ISIS) to be given priority consideration. [“I’ve been over to Iraq twice in the last year, the last time with Congressman Chris Smith, taking a look at how Christians were being overlooked by the aid program of the U. S. government, getting basically no money from the U. S. or the UN,” Walther said.  LISTEN: “What we’ve discovered and been advocating against at this point is that these people are really being left out,” he said. “ISIS came in, killed a lot of them, drove them all from their homes in Nineveh and elsewhere. The upshot of that was the U. S. just sort of stood by, did not have a plan for helping communities. ”  “Now I think we have the opportunity to change things,” said Walther. “These people faced genocide once, then they faced the sort of overlooking by the U. S. and now I’m told that there are signs that things are starting to change  —   that there’s a new openness among government officials there in Iraq, U. S. government officials, to helping these communities that have been overlooked for so long. ”  “How this happened was simply a matter of an argument that we have to take care of everybody, so all the money goes to the big camps,” he explained. “Christians don’t go to the big camps because, of course, they get persecuted and targeted for violence at the big camps, and so, as a result, they get nothing because there’s no thought about prioritizing, or even helping, or making sure that you don’t leave out these little communities that could disappear. In the case of Christians, their numbers have declined in Iraq by almost 90 percent in the last decade. ” Walther said he found some of the reactions to President Trump’s executive order on immigration “very confusing. ” “The idea that we would prioritize people for religious persecution  —   people who had suffered, in the case of several of these countries, genocide  —   and it was religious minorities in general, let’s be clear: It wasn’t just Christians. Yazidis, Mandaeans, Shabak  —   I mean, there were a lot of people that were targeted like this. When you look at that, and you see this reaction, you have to wonder if these people have missed the history lesson on what the U. S. has done for the past hundred years,” he said.  “After World War I, we prioritized the Christian community in the Middle East because it was almost completely destroyed by the Ottoman genocide of 1915 and ’16 and again in ’22. It was the U. S. that stepped in,   partnerships, the State Department was involved, the whole bit,” Walther explained.  “Second, after World War II, the U. S. takes an enormous number of Jewish refugees from Europe. Why? Not because there weren’t as many or more refugees from the German, French, and Italian populations, but because everybody understood that they had faced genocide, and they needed a special kind of priority. That didn’t mean that other refugees didn’t get in. It just meant that the Jewish refugees  —   and you can see this in the numbers  —   got some priority,” he said.  “Even more recently, you’ve had Democratic sponsorship of things like the Lautenberg Amendment, which prioritizes religious minorities from Iran, which are Christians, Jews, and those of the Baha’i faith,” he noted. “Suddenly, we have an executive order that says we’re going to prioritize religious minorities, and it’s the end of the world. I really don’t understand why that is, and I don’t understand why people don’t understand that this has been the U. S. policy for a very long time. ” Marlow quoted from Walther’s   a passage in which he noted that only   of one percent of Syrian refugees admitted into the U. S. in 2016 were Christians, even though they make up ten percent of the Syrian population. “Certainly, it’s a de facto inequity, and I think you’ve seen a lot of the    —   I was looking at one this morning  —   that are making the case that refugees from other countries are getting in at a greater rate. Christians are getting in from Iran, Iraq, and these other places, so what the president said about Syria is wrong,” said Walther.  “No, what the president said about Syria is actually right. It has been very hard for Christians to get in,” he argued. “A lot of people are saying that it’s not really discrimination they don’t want to come in. I got an email two days ago from the Syriac Catholic patriarch, who I would imagine knows what’s going on with his people, who tells me they do want to get in. They’re applying for refugee status, and they never hear back from places like the U. S. and Canada. They’re ignored, or they’re rejected. So which is it? I’ve got to believe that he knows what he’s talking about. ”  “I was with the archbishop of Aleppo two years ago. He stood on our stage, and he said, ‘What’s happening, in terms of the refugee system, is unjust.’ I think these guys who are living in places like Aleppo know what’s going on,” he said. Walther was confident the CPAC audience understands “the importance of protecting religious minorities around the world, the importance of human rights” and that “threats to human rights can have a religious nature. ” “I think that people here also, you see there is support in the polling, and there is support in general, I think especially in groups like this, for making sure that we don’t overlook these minorities in the Middle East,” he added. Marlow asked if the Knights of Columbus have experienced any decline in membership or influence due to the “secularization of America. ” “No, we have found a consistent way to grow for   years,” Walther replied. “The fact of the matter is that I think people get excited about the kinds of things we do. They get excited about the work we do on the   issue. They get excited about the work that we do in communities around the country to help our neighbors. They get excited about issues like helping Christians in the Middle East. The persecution of Christians in the Middle East gets our guys fired up. ” “We’ve raised more than $12 million for these people on this issue,” he announced. “I think we have a very strong network in the U. S. and also internationally, of guys that are really committed to their faith and also to helping in a variety of ways. ” When Marlow asked how much of a setback the eight years of Obama were for the cause of helping persecuted Christians in the Middle East, Walther cited criticism from his friend the Archbishop of Erbil that “it was a mistake for your country to come here in 2003, and it was a bigger mistake for you to leave in 2011. ” “He’s the guy taking care of 100, 000 Christians in Erbil,” he noted. “You have a situation where once this happened in 2014, once ISIS rolled through, the U. S. basically did nothing for these minority communities. We let them die. We let the ISIS program of dechristianization and sort of radicalizing of the region just occur without any kind of input. We let the Yazidis go. We let the Mandeans go. All of these little groups that have been there for thousands of years were not prioritized, were not even paid attention to. This was a story that I heard over and over there. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. Listen to the full interview audio above.",0

11711,"FBI, IRS Raid Texas Democrat State Senator’s Law Office","Agents with the FBI and the IRS raided the private law practice of Texas State Senator Carlos Uresti (  Antonio) on Thursday morning. [The raid comes as part of an ongoing investigation into the senator’s practice by the FBI and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service. The two agencies would only confirm they were “lawfully conducting law enforcement activity at the office,” KSAT ABC12 reported.  The Democrat state senator represents Senate District 19 that covers part of San Antonio. Sen. Uresti responded to media inquiries with the following statement: Today, FBI agents are in my office, reviewing our documents as part of their broad investigation of the Four Winds matter. I have instructed my staff to fully cooperate with the federal investigators.  I will help them in whatever way I can.

Likewise, I continue to work diligently to solve problems on the Veterans Affairs and Border Security Committees. As always, I remain committed to serve my constituents. The Four Winds matter referred to by the senators is an ongoing investigation into FourWinds Logistics, a frac sand trading company, the San Antonio   reported. The company filed bankruptcy in 2015 and investigators have alleged they were defrauded. According to a previous report by the San Antonio paper, investors claimed their money was wasted by the CEO on personal expenses, expensive gifts, exotic car rentals, and a “wild lifestyle. ” Three of the company’s officials have been charged in the fraud scheme and pleaded guilty. They are currently awaiting sentencing. Senator Uresti was allegedly involved in recruiting investors into the company. Uresti allegedly received a $27, 000 commission for a $900, 000 investment he helped bring to FourWinds. The investor, Denise Cantu of Harlingen, Texas, was one of the senator’s legal clients. He reportedly helped the woman win a   lawsuit cased involving the death of two of her children. She is reported to have lost most of her money in the investment.

11712,Donald Trump’s Victory Is Met With Shock Across a Wide Political Divide - The New York Times,"The American political establishment reeled on Wednesday as leaders in both parties began coming to grips with four years of President Donald J. Trump in the White House, a   scenario that has now plunged the United States and its allies and adversaries into a period of deep uncertainty about the policies and impact of his administration. Democrats, who will be out of power in both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2006, were particularly crestfallen that Hillary Clinton had a slender lead in the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College, a fate similar to Al Gore’s in 2000. On campuses nationwide, students marched against Mr. Trump with signs bearing slogans like “Not my president,” and protesters in Oakland, Calif. smashed windows and set fire to garbage bins. On Wednesday night, thousands of people protested in several cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle and New York, where demonstrators converged in Midtown Manhattan in front of Trump Tower, the home of the  . With millions of other voters euphoric at the election of a true political outsider as president, the clear divide over Mr. Trump inspired pleas of unity from his two biggest opponents, President Obama and Mrs. Clinton. At separate news conferences, they urged Americans to come together for the sake of the republic, and for the good of Mr. Trump’s presidency. “We are all now rooting for his success,” said Mr. Obama, who planned to meet with Mr. Trump at the White House on Thursday. “The peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world. ” Mrs. Clinton, in her first remarks to supporters after the election, said Americans owed Mr. Trump “an open mind and a chance to lead. ” Choking back tears at times, she said she was “sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. ” “This is painful, and it will be for a long time,” Mrs. Clinton said, standing beside her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in a tableau that underscored the end of a nearly   era in which the Clintons dominated American politics. The clash between excitement and dread was especially palpable over the likelihood that Mr. Trump, at the head of a unified Republican government, would try to reverse Obama administration policies and appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, indicated on Wednesday that Republicans would try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Democrats privately began strategizing to thwart that agenda. Republicans also expanded their power in state capitals, and Democrats pledged resistance. Foreign leaders who have had tense relations with Mr. Obama were particularly welcoming to Mr. Trump. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called Mr. Trump “a true friend” of Israel, while President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said he hoped to have a “constructive dialogue” with him. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin had previously exchanged warm words, to the consternation of both Democratic and Republican leaders, but Trump advisers said on Wednesday that the two leaders had not spoken by phone yet. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose immigration policies Mr. Trump has dismissed as “insane,” offered her cooperation but emphasized the importance of human rights, while President François Hollande of France noted that some of Mr. Trump’s views might test “the values and the interests that we share with the United States. ” Mexican officials congratulated Mr. Trump but said they would not pay for his proposed border wall, as he has flatly insisted they will. Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers said on Wednesday that he had been fielding calls from politicians like Mr. Ryan and world leaders, while also assembling a cabinet and White House team and selecting a conservative nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy. They said Mr. Trump was inclined to roll out a few cabinet nominations at a time, rather than kicking them off with one   pick for a critical department like Treasury or State. Among the candidates for cabinet secretaries and advisers are members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, aides said, including Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a crucial adviser on policy issues Steven Mnuchin, a businessman who was Mr. Trump’s national finance chairman Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House. Advisers said Mr. Trump had also started thinking about ways to unite the country. Democratic leaders quickly embraced a policy priority that he highlighted in his victory speech: infrastructure spending. Still, more than a third of Americans said in exit polls on Tuesday that they would be frightened of a Trump presidency. Among those who voted for Mrs. Clinton, the feeling was almost unanimous: 92 percent said Mr. Trump scared them. Anxieties ran strong among Hispanics,   Muslims, immigrants, women and others who had felt disparaged or demonized by Mr. Trump, who used harsh and racially charged language in ways that upended mainstream politics. The fact that Mr. Trump had been endorsed by a Ku Klux Klan newspaper, even if he rejected it, symbolized the sense of shock that he would now lead a vibrantly diverse democracy. Alma Guel, 59, of El Paso, let out a long sigh as she started talking through the levels of emotional distress she had felt over the last 24 hours. She felt outrage, disbelief, then suspicion that the outcome was legitimate, then ashamed. She even started looking at property to buy in Mexico. Eventually, she just felt crushed. “I was just heartbroken,” said Ms. Guel, who works in the safety department of her local electric company. “And all day today, I’ve been in a daze. I’ve never, ever been this affected by any other election. ” Many conservatives felt just as strongly  —   but in the opposite direction. The conservative radio host Laura Ingraham was overcome with emotion on her show Wednesday. “You’re bringing tears to my eyes,” she told the Republican strategist Ed Rollins as she beamed over the meaning of Mr. Trump’s win. Jacob Stout, 20, who owns a small contracting business in Danville, Ky. said the result thrilled him because of the promise of bold action in Washington. “I’m excited, man. I’m not going to lie,” he said. “We’ve seen, especially the last eight years, talk but not drastic change that benefits the citizens. The idea that a citizen would be taking the presidency as opposed to a politician, I think that’s got people excited. ” His wife, Chloe Joslin, 24, was more tempered in her expectations, even though she also voted for Mr. Trump. “Oh, my goodness, you see people who are disowning friends over who they are voting for,” said Ms. Joslin, a communications instructor. “It’s been a very heated race. ” Politicians also joined business leaders, as well as the many Americans with retirement and savings accounts, in keeping a nervous eye on the world financial markets, fearing the sort of backlash that wounded Britain after its vote in June to leave the European Union. While some business leaders worried that the nation would slide into recession, others were hopeful that Mr. Trump’s proposals of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and relaxed regulations would be welcomed by the markets, which reversed sharp declines overnight. Political activity and reactions in both parties were in a surreal state of suspended animation as Republicans and Democrats began anticipating Mr. Trump’s moves. Mr. Ryan said at a news conference Wednesday that Mr. Trump had a “mandate” for his vision of government, but was sparing on the details of how they would work together. Mr. Ryan stopped campaigning for him last month after revelations that Mr. Trump had boasted about sexual assault. Mr. Ryan said that he had “spoken with Donald twice in the last 18 hours. ” “We talked about the work ahead of us, and the importance of bringing the nation together,” he said. “This needs to be a time of redemption, not a time of recrimination. ” Mr. Ryan could have been hinting at his own fate. There are more than a few restless conservatives in his conference in the House who were agitating for his ouster before the election because of his failure to fully embrace Mr. Trump. And whether that discontent will die down is far from clear. Other Republicans who made their reservations about Mr. Trump proudly known before the election tried to be gracious, though some sounded more skeptical than optimistic. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who became a public face of the   faction on Capitol Hill, said he and his family had asked God to steer Mr. Trump in the right direction. “We pray that he will lead wisely and faithfully keep his oath to a Constitution of limited government,” Mr. Sasse said in a statement. Then he promised to hold Mr. Trump to his word. “Starting today, I will do everything in my power to hold the president to his promises,” he said. Elsewhere, the transition of power seemed to be unfolding in an orderly fashion. Word came from the Pentagon on Wednesday morning that Mr. Trump would begin receiving the same classified intelligence briefings as the president. And the defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, said in a statement that he was committed to a smooth passing of power to the next commander in chief.",0

11714,How Trump’s Education Nominee Bent Detroit to Her Will on Charter Schools - The New York Times,"Few disagreed that schools in Detroit were a mess: a chaotic mix of charters and traditional public schools, the   in the nation. So city leaders across the political spectrum agreed on a fix, with legislation to provide oversight and set standards on how to open schools and close bad ones. But the bill died without even getting a final vote. And the person most influential in killing it is now   Donald J. Trump’s nominee to oversee the nation’s public schools, Betsy DeVos. Her resistance to the legislation last spring is a window into Ms. DeVos’s philosophy and what she might bring to the fierce and often partisan debate about public education across the country, and in particular, the roles of choice and charter schools. The bill’s proposals are common in many states and accepted by many supporters of school choice, like a provision to stop failing charter operators from creating new schools. But Ms. DeVos argued that this kind of oversight would create too much bureaucracy and limit choice. A believer in a freer market than even some free market economists would endorse, Ms. DeVos pushed back on any regulation as too much regulation. Charter schools should be allowed to operate as they wish parents would judge with their feet. Detroit Public Schools, she argued, should simply be shut down and the system turned over to charters, or the tax dollars given to parents in the form of vouchers to attend private schools. “She is committed to an ideological stance that is solely about the free market, at the expense of practicality and the basic needs of students in the most destabilized environment in the country,” said Tonya Allen, the president of the Skillman Foundation, a nonprofit that works with Detroit children, and a   of the coalition that produced the report that became the basis for the legislation last spring. “If she was showing herself present in places and learning from the practitioners, that’s a fine combination,” Ms. Allen said. “But Betsy never showed up in Detroit. She was very eager to impose experimentation on students that she has not spent time with and children that she does not have consequence for. ” Ms. DeVos has a long career as an education philanthropist and lobbyist, but not as an educator. She and her husband, Dick, an heir to the Amway fortune, are considered the most powerful Republicans in Michigan. In the debate over Detroit schools, Republican lawmakers say, Ms. DeVos withheld her financial support until they agreed to kill the bill. And they were rewarded well when they did: Ms. DeVos’s family began a flood of donations to Republicans that totaled $1. 45 million in seven weeks. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed. But her allies say her views have been misinterpreted. “She’s never said choice and choice alone is the panacea for public education,” said Gary Naeyaert, the lobbyist who leads the Great Lakes Education Project, which Ms. DeVos founded to advance charter schools in Michigan in 2001 after her family had spent nearly $5. 8 million on a losing initiative to establish statewide school vouchers. “It’s choice, quality and accountability. ” Hers was a different version of choice, quality and accountability, however, than that envisioned by those who drafted and supported the legislation: a broad coalition of charter school and teachers’ union leaders, the Detroit chamber of commerce and some of the city’s most prominent Republican philanthropists and politicians, its Democratic mayor and the state’s Republican governor. “The misinformation campaign was horrendous,” said Thomas Stallworth III, a former state legislator who lobbied on behalf of the coalition. And the sway of her contributions was too much to overcome. “There’s no way we could compete with that. We don’t have those kinds of resources. ” Ms. DeVos and her husband had lobbied hard for the state law that established charter schools in 1994. It allowed an unusually large number of organizations to start charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. But it created little oversight. Even charter school supporters now criticize Detroit as one of the most unregulated markets in the country. About 80 percent of the state’s charters are operated for profit, far higher than anywhere else. In 2011, the DeVoses and the Great Lakes project lobbied successfully to lift a cap on the number of charter schools, fighting off a provision that would have kept failing schools from expanding. In Detroit, which now has a greater proportion of charters than any city but New Orleans, one result was a glut of schools as more charters opened but the city’s population continued to decline. Yet while there are too many seats in schools downtown, there are not enough in the poorest, most remote neighborhoods, where most students live. Traditional and charter schools alike compete with televisions, laptops and bicycles for students  —   and the taxpayer dollars that follow them. More than 150 schools have opened or closed in the last seven years, and it is not unusual to find students who change schools every year, and teachers who do so more often than that. With more than a dozen organizations issuing charters, it is hard for parents to get the information they need to inform their choices. And, in a city of 140 square miles, the   schools usually remain out of reach to the poorest students, because most schools do not offer transportation, and the city bus service is unreliable. Most charters have failed to improve on the dismal performance of the traditional public schools.   national charter networks have stayed away because of the instability of the market. The Walton Family Foundation, which has committed $1 billion over the next five years to expanding charters and choice, similarly withdrew its money from Detroit earlier this year. The legislation proposed earlier this year by Goeff Hansen, a Republican state senator, would have paid off the debt of the city’s traditional public schools, which were on the brink of bankruptcy, and returned control of those schools from the state to a locally elected school board. But the provision that proved most controversial to the DeVoses would have established a Detroit Education Commission, appointed by the mayor. With three members from charter schools, three from the traditional public schools and one an expert in educational accountability, the commission was to come up with an    grading system for all schools, and evaluate which neighborhoods in the city most needed schools. School operators that earned below an A or B could not expand without the commission’s signing off on their location. Schools that earned an F three years in a row could be closed. Ms. DeVos and her husband wrote legislators urging them to reject any legislation that included the commission. Why, they argued, should residents have choice in where they shop for food and travel, but not in schools? She wrote a Detroit News    arguing to “retire” Detroit Public Schools and “liberate all students” to use tax dollars to attend public or charter schools of their choice. Leaders of 20 charter schools in Detroit, including some of the   made a   effort to urge the Legislature to adopt the commission. “We have to be looking at every possible way to expand the choices and the opportunities in the neighborhoods for families,” Clark Durant, a onetime Republican candidate for the United States Senate and the   of a network of schools, said at a news conference alongside Mayor Mike Duggan. “And I believe this is the beginning of that effort. ” The legislation passed the State Senate. But in the House of Representatives, support fell away, as leaders of the Republican caucus reminded the members of how much financial support the DeVoses could withhold. They warned that the DeVoses would finance primary challenges against Republicans who defied her, as they had done to one who voted against the bill to lift the cap on charter schools five years earlier. The DeVoses, said Representative Dave Pagel, a Republican who supported the commission, “made arguments that were strongly heard, and they prevailed. ” Another Republican, declining to comment for fear of alienating Ms. DeVos when she is poised to become a cabinet secretary, sent a link to an article detailing the DeVoses’ financial contributions to Republicans after the vote, saying it explained all there was to explain. The House passed a bill that never included the language establishing the commission. The bill paid off the debt of Detroit Public Schools and returned the city’s traditional public schools to local control. And it will allow the state to close the schools at the bottom of existing state rankings, which Mr. Naeyaert said was proof that Ms. DeVos supported measures to ensure quality. But that will mean shutting down mostly traditional public schools, which in Detroit serve the neediest students, and further desert students in neighborhoods where charters have largely declined to go. “My complaint around this is not that you disagree,” said Ms. Allen, at the Skillman Foundation, “but that you never could come up with another solution to deal with the practical issues of poor public policy that is not only eroding a traditional school system, but eroding all schools. ”",0

There are two things standing in their way: cash, and precious metals. The oligarchs are doing everything in their power to falsely discredit both of them in the eyes of the people. Cash and precious metals are physical manifestations of financial and human liberty. Liberty, which is indivisible, is the absolute last thing the oligarchs have in mind for us, as there is no profit in it for them. The oligarchs realize that the people are fast waking up to what is being done to them. While the Oligarchy remains an unimaginably dangerous enemy, it was wounded in the United States presidential election, is acting more erratically and illogically, and is starting to make serious mistakes. How we, the people, push forward from here will determine whether we remain free, or become slaves to the greatest Force of Evil ever known to mankind, the Deep State oligarchs. 
While the above themes are not new to Inferential Analytics, the accurate and reliable forecasting method we have developed and use, the intensity with which the Deep State is pursuing its “dual mandate” of expropriating private wealth and enslaving the people by deliberately impoverishing them is absolutely unprecedented. If the people lose the war that the Deep State has declared against them, their futures and those of their descendants will be destroyed. The people must not and need not lose this war. In fact, the people can defeat the Deep State by using simple tools and common sense. The problem is that the people do not realize they have the power to take down the Oligarchy, so we all must work to open their eyes and show them the force of nature they truly are. That is our mission in this article, and the ones to follow. 
The post-election orgy of precious metals price destruction is an open letter from the Deep State oligarchs that they couldn’t care less about the people’s desire for fundamental change, something the people shouted from the rooftops with their votes. The oligarchs have announced that there will be no change in policy or operating procedures; it is full steam ahead for them, because they know they can loot society of trillions more dollars if they can successfully implement their plans, which are well underway and inimical to the people in the extreme. 
Money that flows into physical precious metals means less money in banks for the Deep State oligarchs to loot. In 2011, as gold surged to $1900 and silver to $50 per ounce, the oligarchs saw the real potential of a buying stampede breaking out among the people, which would have resulted in even greater bank withdrawals. They were simply not going to allow that to happen. Plans to gain control of the people’s money were in the formative stages, and could not be activated at that time. Not having the means to restrict the flow of money into precious metals, they decided instead to crush prices by market manipulation, both to financially punish those who had bought into the gathering stampede, and to scare away prospective buyers. The Deep State is now on the threshold of being able to implement its asset control agenda, and is certainly not going to lose bank deposits to precious metals when they are so close to their objective. Therefore, they have ratcheted up their illegal price manipulation activities to record intensity. 
Post-election, the Deep State oligarchs have made it clear that they are going to continue to ram down the throats of the people the self-serving crony communist agenda they have been pursuing for the past twenty years, and particularly during the past eight, when they have had an energized communist organizer in place. If this means that they must hire phony activists on Craig’s List for $12.00 per hour and bus them around the country from one pre-arranged “demonstration” site to another, this is what they will do, as we can see. This is a small price to pay for the power and money prizes they have plotted to win. 
The most profitable financial instruments ever created by the oligarchy are derivatives. These synthetic devices, designed for hedging, risk management and speculation by market players, and structured to generate guaranteed profits for the oligarchs who invent, issue and control them, include futures, options, forwards and swaps, and are a Deep State money machine. 
Derivatives are layered on top of what are known as “underlying” assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, government debt, and securitized debt and mortgages. 
We believe that the oligarchs are creating a new class of financial derivatives that could produce the largest transfer of wealth in history, from the people to them. 
We call them “Human Derivatives,” or “HDs.” The “underlying” asset in HDs is humanity itself; specifically, the personal wealth and future wealth-creation potential of human beings, in addition to rich, deeply personal, tradeable and exploitable information about them. With HDs, the Oligarchy intends to monetize humanity. By positioning themselves as the “House,” and giving themselves proprietary fee-setting, settlement, arbitrage and inside trading powers over HDs and bank deposits, the oligarchs intend to create a monopolized toll booth through which most monetary assets must pass. This will enable them to siphon off trillions of dollars of existing and future financial wealth from “underlying” human beings. The oligarchs plan to turn humanity into a financial asset over which they have control. 
Human Derivatives will not just leverage people’s underlying financial assets, but much more important, deep personal insight into who they are, what they buy, how they behave, their medical well-being, their relationships and social networks, their susceptibility to messaging and advertising, and their overall economic “value.” This information will be codified, scored and quantified, and then converted into indexes made tradeable by HDs. The tradeable financial digitalization of the people will be worth a fortune to the Deep State “House.” 
The oligarchs face a critical prerequisite to the optimization of Human Derivatives: the elimination of cash. By removing cash from the system, the oligarchs will obtain full visibility into and control over the people’s monetary transactions, which is required to maximize HD profits. 
While numerous “motherhood” justifications for the elimination of cash are enunciated by the Deep State shills who are promoting it, such as fighting terrorism, crime and drug trafficking, these are misdirections and lies. The real purpose for the elimination of cash is simple: to give the Oligarchy full-spectrum control over monetary assets. The fact that Larry Summers is one of the main proselytizers for cash elimination is all that you need to know; he is a longstanding Establishment spokesperson and enabler. 
Influential, non-banker elitists are now joining the battle. For example, on October 27, 2016, while speaking to reporters, Apple Computer CEO Tim Cook triumphantly stated, “We are going to kill cash.” By “we,” he does not mean Apple, which has no means by which solely to murder cash, but the Deep State elite, of which he is a peripheral member. The elimination of cash will be a boon to Apple Pay, which collects a 0.15% commission on all transactions, an amount that is guaranteed to increase by multiples and passed on to consumers in the form of price inflation once digital payments are non-optional and monopolized. 
On November 8, 2016, the Indian government announced the most brazen cash reset and windfall tax generation scheme ever hatched. At 8 PM, after the banks had closed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise proclamation that as of 11:59 PM that same evening, all 500 and 1,000 rupees currency notes would be demonetized, stripped of “Legal Tender” status, and “extinguished.” In his words, “currency notes of rupees 500 and rupees 1,000 will be just paper with no value.” Rupees 500 and 1,000 notes are worth roughly $7.50 and $15.00, respectively, and they constitute 85% of India’s total currency supply. With no advance warning, Indian citizens were given 4 hours to spend 85% of India’s total money supply, or endure a massively time-consuming currency conversion ordeal. 
In the few hours remaining that night, the stores were flooded with citizens trying to dump their 500 and 1,000 rupees notes. Gold spiked to the equivalent of $2,300 per ounce, before completely selling out at dealer locations, as people were willing to spend pretty much anything to get a real asset like gold in exchange for “just paper with no value.” 
The government gave those unable to offload their 500 and 1,000 rupees notes during the four hour window the option of depositing them into their bank accounts (assuming they have them) until December 30, 2016. But to do that, the depositor must fill out an affidavit, explaining where the money came from. If the authorities determine that the depositor has not satisfactorily accounted for the funds, then an income tax and fines will be imposed on the depositor, or the currency will simply be seized. 
The government also gave the people the ability to physically exchange at banks their rupees 500 and 1,000 notes for new currency, but only until November 24, 2016 (a period of 14 days), and only at a rate of 4,000 rupees (roughly $60.00) per day. If a person is willing to stand in a bank line for hours a day, for 14 days straight, they will be able to exchange a grand total of 56,000 rupees, or roughly $840.00. 
Modi stated that the extraordinary action was taken to curb “counterfeiting,” “corruption,” “terrorism,” “black money,” and the “black economy,” the usual excuses for tyranny, but never explained how, which is typical of these Deep State gambits. While making his announcement, Modi stated: “Experience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation.” As we can see, the citizens’ willing acceptance of surprise currency resets is being positioned by the Deep State as a matter of patriotism and duty. 
India’s gun control laws are among the strictest in the world, and have been tightened even further by Modi since he came into office in 2014. The people are also trained from a young age to be compliant and polite. It is no wonder why India was chosen as the test site for Deep State’s first surprise, national currency reset. 
Almost exactly one year ago, it was the same Modi who announced an Indian “paper gold” scheme. The Indian people were asked to turn in to their bank their physical gold, in exchange for a paper “note” that would provide 2.25 – 2.75% interest per annum on the gold’s value at the time of submission. The “investor” would not be able to get their gold back for at least 5 years. By then, of course, it would be long gone. Indian inflation is consistently above the offered interest rate. The Deep State’s scheme, promoted by their puppet Modi, flopped because the people, who are never nearly as stupid as the elitists think, saw right through it. 
There are an estimated 20,000 tonnes of gold in the private hands of the Indian people, and the bullion banks wanted it for their own profit-making purposes, not the least of which was to cover their enormous naked short positions. 
We believe the Indian currency reset is a test, foisted upon a compliant, disarmed people to gauge their reaction. The real drama is yet to come, and will occur throughout the West. If the oligarchs cannot trick the people into accepting the elimination of cash, then they will do the next best thing: a for-profit currency reset that nets a windfall. Most likely, they will do both, in succession: a currency reset, netting a windfall, followed by the elimination of cash, netting a second, much larger windfall. 
Several prominent commentators have recommended holding cash as a financial defense mechanism. But none of them has warned of the possibility of a currency cancellation, such as the one that just occurred in India. This demonstrates how entropic, unpredictable and dangerous the current financial environment has become. We urge readers to stay highly informed via the Alternative Media, the only place where you can find the truth. Developments are happening fast, and you could get blindsided if you are inattentive and drop your guard. 
All of the above begs the question: how can we financially defend ourselves from the Establishment controllers who are coming for our money and our freedom? 
Even though precious metals prices are being deliberately crushed at this time, for the reasons outlined above, we view them as the best, and in certain cases, only defense against Deep State exploitation and expropriation. Gold and silver are financial Freedom Fighters, uniquely capable of protecting people from oppression. Throughout history, as people have fled persecution and sought liberty, gold has been their salvation. For millions over millennia, freedom has only been payable in gold. Precious metals provide the best escape from the Deep State’s coming financial command and control matrix, and are the only assets that cannot be canceled, demonetized or extinguished by government decree and whim. Even assets traditionally viewed as being safe, such as productive farm land, can be taxed into oblivion by a government gone rogue. It has happened in the past, and will certainly happen in the future. One cannot hide farm land, or stitch it into one’s coat. 
Some people express the concern that governments will prohibit the ownership of precious metals, particularly gold, when things unhinge. We would respond by saying that if it ever comes to that, you will know, for a fact, it is game over. By issuing such an order, the Deep State would make it absolutely categorical that they intend to impoverish and enslave you. While many people might surrender to that kind of totalitarianism, hundreds of millions to billions of people worldwide will not. 
Governments can create currency, but only God can create gold, and He is not in the Deep State’s back pocket. No government has the moral authority or practical ability to extinguish the value of the gold made by God. The gold and silver markets have been healthy, consensual and vibrant for more than 5,000 years, and that will never change as long as human beings still walk this earth and breathe the air. Government made currencies have catastrophically failed every single time they have been created. That, too, will never change. Soon, the exchange value of metals will be determined by people, trading one to one, and not by Deep State manipulators and criminals who now set phony prices in rigged markets that they control. You will only be able to enjoy gold and silver’s many virtues if you own them. As millions upon millions of people wake up, see monetary truth and buy, it will become harder to acquire metals at anywhere near current prices, in our view. This is not investment advice (we are not investment advisors and urge you to do your own research and make your own decisions), this is common sense. We believe your opportunities for action are diminishing, because you are battling deteriorating fiscal, economic and monetary circumstances, not to mention time.

11716,"Interview: Devyn Springer, Queer Black Muslim, On The Trauma Of Protest","For part two of Roqayah Chamseddine’s interview with Devyn Springer, he highlights his work as an activist and the toll it can take on his health as a queer black muslim.
Springer is a member of of Rise Up Georgia, a group that organizes mental health response units to take care of mental health emergencies so communities do not have to call police. The units include mental health professionals and focus on deescalation of conflicts.
In the same segment, Springer addresses the irony of hip hop being used to justify the dehumanization of black people. It should be a liberation art, especially as it’s built to humanize people, but it doesn’t always work that way.
Springer adds, “Protesting can feel like prayer, but it also feels like pain and trauma.” And, “There’s nothing glamorous about protest.”
Activists must practice self care. For Springer, that means going to prayer services regularly and sometimes sitting quietly with tea.
Roqayah’s “Islam In America” series is an ongoing project, which amplifies the stories of American Muslims and what they struggle with in their day-to-day lives beyond just Islamophobia. It promotes an alternative to the fear of Donald Trump’s presidential administration.

11717,Obama and Justice Dept. Busted In Rigging Plot After Hillary Memo Leaks,"Obama and Justice Dept. Busted In Rigging Plot After Hillary Memo Leaks Posted on November 1, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This 
Over the weekend, many of us were left cheering over the news that the FBI was reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server. Unfortunately, our celebrating might be short lived. Democrats are already scheming with how to get her off with no charges, including Barack Obama and other top officials who were paramount in her walking away scot-free. 
It seems that no matter how crooked Hillary is, Democrats will always swarm together to protect their evil queen bee. The whole checks-and-balances thing among our branches of government is completely thrown out the window whenever Hillary is involved, as she simply buys the silence of government officials, or if that doesn’t work, she kills them. It should come as no surprise that the very same people who helped her walk away from her Benghazi scandal, are now flocking once again to save her ass. 
We’ve all seen Obama’s “Justice” Department in action over the tenure of his presidency, and it’s anything but contrived of justice. Now, we’re seeing even more evidence of their twisted schemes in practice, proving again that everything in Washington, D.C. is completely rigged. 
In a letter to Congressional leaders, Obama’s DOJ stated that when it comes to the investigation of over 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner’s home computer that they will “work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible.” 
While that might sound great and wonderful on the surface, most people missed who signed that letter of compliance — Hillary’s partner in crime, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik. The crooked man not only testified during Benghazi as to Hillary’s “innocence,” but he is also really good friends with Hillary’s presidential campaign chair, John Podesta. Kadzik and Podesta hung out and dined to celebrate the day after Hillary’s Benghazi hearings before Congress, and Kadzik was mentioned a whopping 20 times in Podesta’s emails that were recently released by WikiLeaks. 
However, the conniving doesn’t end there. Rumors are already swirling that if Hillary does get into trouble with this new investigation, that Obama is planning to pardon her, even if it’s done retroactively after he leaves the White House. 
In a recent interview, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tx) said that win or lose, Barack Obama will simply pardon Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. “I think win or lose there’s a presidential pardon in her future. Historical precedent was set when Ford retroactively pardoned Nixon. I don’t think that’s good for our country, but I’m afraid that’s going to happen.” 
Even more infuriating, if Hillary is elected president, she could simply pardon herself. Presidential pardoning powers come from Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution that states that presidents “have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Basically, as long as she’s not being impeached, she could pardon herself and walk away completely free. 
Our Founding Fathers were so careful in how they worded our founding documents so that no one in government could ever become too powerful. But how do you plan for someone who encompasses the evil of Hillary Clinton, where she practically owns and controls every single person in Washington, D.C.? If this woman gets elected as the next president, we will soon have a lawless tyrant leading our country.",0

11719,Jared Kushner Named Senior White House Adviser to Donald Trump - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Jared Kushner will become a senior White House adviser to his    Donald J. Trump, cementing the New York real estate executive’s role as a powerful and at times decisive influence on the  . Mr. Kushner, 35, who married Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka in 2009, is closer to Mr. Trump than any other adviser, a steady and stabilizing presence inside an often chaotic transition team who has provided input on most of his   ’s most consequential hiring and firing decisions. Mr. Trump described Mr. Kushner as “a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition” in a statement issued early Monday evening announcing an appointment that perhaps more than any other defines the way the incoming president will govern. Mr. Kushner plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets, his lawyer said. Some ethics experts have questioned whether the appointment will be legal under federal   laws designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the United States government. Other presidents configured their White House hierarchies to mirror experiences in statehouses, on campaigns or at the heads of armies. Mr. Trump intends to adopt the management style of a New York real estate empire, with family at the pinnacle and staff members, however trusted or talented, somewhere below. Ms. Trump, who also participated in her father’s campaign decisions, has no immediate plans to enter the administration and will restructure her portfolio of holdings. But she plans to step down from the management of the Trump Organization and the Ivanka Trump fashion brand, said Jamie S. Gorelick, Mr. Kushner’s lawyer. Mr. Kushner’s plan is to sell assets to his brother and to a trust overseen by his mother, said Ms. Gorelick, who added that she had been consulting with federal ethics officials in an attempt to minimize opposition to Mr. Kushner’s appointment. Under the arrangement, Mr. Kushner will divest his holdings in his family real estate firm’s flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue sell his stake in the New York Observer newspaper divest his interest in his brother’s firm, Thrive Capital and restructure other investments. He will also divest of all foreign investments, said Ms. Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. He will have to recuse himself on matters that could relate to his wife’s businesses and his remaining holdings, she added. Mr. Kushner has been described by numerous transition staff members as the first among equals in Mr. Trump’s high command. His new title belies the sweeping influence he will have behind the scenes. The   Mr. Kushner has often been described as having a calming effect on Mr. Trump, who is notorious for yelling at staff members during moments of tension. Mr. Kushner became the de facto campaign manager in the spring, and his influence with Mr. Trump has expanded rapidly. He is expected to play the same role in the White House, while the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, provides the   with strategic, messaging and communications advice, and Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and the incoming chief of staff, runs    operations in the West Wing. Mr. Trump’s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, will have a direct line to the president on a range of issues. Despite his lack of   political experience before the 2016 campaign, Mr. Kushner earned the trust of his mercurial    during the campaign’s most turbulent moments, joining his wife and Mr. Trump’s adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. in ousting Corey Lewandowski, then the campaign manager, in the heat of the primary season. Mr. Kushner was among those who pushed, campaign officials said, for the removal of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the head of Mr. Trump’s transition team, and pressed for his    to appoint David M. Friedman, a Long Island lawyer, as ambassador to Israel. Mr. Kushner, an orthodox Jew, has also made an unlikely ally of Mr. Bannon, an icon of the   nationalist movement. When Mr. Bannon, a former Breitbart executive, came under attack from Democrats after he was appointed to a White House role, Mr. Kushner assured allies that he had complete faith in Mr. Bannon and described him as a man of character. Mr. Kushner will not take a salary and plans to work on issues involving the Middle East and Israel try to forge government partnerships with the private sector and collaborate with Mr. Trump’s choice for commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr. on matters involving free trade, Ms. Gorelick said. The scion of a prominent Democratic family active in New Jersey politics, Mr. Kushner showed few early signs that he would become a national political power player. A Harvard graduate, he is a lifelong Democrat, liberal on social issues. Like his ideologically limber    he has donated to Democratic candidates. Mr. Kushner’s appointment was greeted with relief by some liberals, including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who views him as moderating influence in a Trump West Wing dominated by   conservatives. “I respect him a lot,” Mr. de Blasio said when asked about Mr. Kushner on Monday. “I’ve known him for years and find him to be a very reasonable person. ” Still, it remains unclear if Mr. Kushner is inclined to prod the   to the left. By his own account, he underwent something of a personal political transformation during the campaign, embracing Mr. Trump’s fiery and conservative economic message after spending months crisscrossing red and   America. Mr. Kushner’s new role became public a day after the disclosure that he would resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family’s real estate firm, and divest himself of “substantial assets,” including 666 Fifth Avenue. Mr. Kushner will divest of his holdings in The Observer and has stepped down as its publisher his    the newspaper’s chairman, will assume that role. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday to discuss his plans for dealing with myriad conflicts of interest raised by his sprawling international development, hotel, branding and entertainment empire. Ms. Gorelick said she was confident Mr. Kushner’s appointment would survive any legal challenge, and said Mr. Trump would seek an advisory opinion from the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel. “I am not saying there’s no legal argument on the other side,” she added. “I’m just saying we have the better argument and will prevail. ” Mr. Trump made it clear since he was elected that he wanted Mr. Kushner in his White House. Since December, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Gorelick’s team have consulted with the Office of Government Ethics to create a plan that would satisfy the legal requirements needed for him to serve. Mr. Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who was once imprisoned for tax evasion, will take an increased role in the family company. Norman L. Eisen, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President Obama, said he thought Mr. Kushner’s decision to divest holdings raised pressure on Mr. Trump to follow suit. “What we are seeing now is, after the initial chaos of the Trump transition, that his nominees are now complying with the requirements of the law,” he said. “Rex Tillerson has retired from Exxon, and now Kushner is doing the same,” he added, referring to Mr. Trump’s nominee for secretary of state. “So it’s going to be hard for Trump to ignore 40 years of precedent and not do the same. ”",0
11720,Soros-Linked Voting Machines Cause Concern over Rigged Election,"Editor’s Note : If we weren’t already, as soon as our votes went virtual, we became disenfranchised. These machines are hacked every election.
With as corrupt as our system is at this point, it’d be shocking if that weren’t the case.

by Joseph Jankowski
A U.K. based company that has provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona, has direct ties with billionaire leftist and Clinton crusader George Soros. 
With recent WikiLeaks emails showing that Hillary Clinton received foreign policy directives and coordinated on domestic policy with Soros , along with receiving tens of millions of dollars in presidential campaign support from the billionaire, concerns are growing that these shadowy players may pull the strings behind the curtains of the upcoming presidential election.
As Lifezette reports , the fact that the man in control of voting machines in 16 states is tied directly to the man who has given millions of dollars to the Clinton campaign and various progressive and globalist causes will surely leave a bad taste in the mouth of many a voter.
The balloting equipment tied to Soros is coming from the U.K. based Smartmatic company, whose chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former UN official and sits on the board of Soros’ Open Society Foundation.
According to Lifezette , Malloch-Brown was part of the Soros Advisory Committee on Bosnia and also is a member of the executive committee of the International Crisis Group, an organization he co-founded in the 1990s and built with funds from George Soros’ personal fortune.
In 2007 Soros appointed Malloch-Brown vice-president of his Quantum Funds, vice-chairman of Soros Fund Management, and vice-chairman of the Open Society Institute (former name of OSF).
Browns ties also intertwine with the Clintons as he was a partner with Sawyer-Miller, the consulting firm where close Clinton associate Mandy Grunwald worked. Brown also was also a senior advisor to FTI Consulting, a firm at which Jackson Dunn, who spent 15 years working as an aide to the Clintons, is a senior managing director. When taking that into account, along with the poor track record Smartmatic has of providing free and fair elections, this all becomes quite terrifying.
An astonishing 2006 classified U.S. diplomatic cable obtained and released by WikiLeaks reveals the extent to which Smartmatic may have played a hand in rigging the 2004 Venezuelan recall election under a section titled “A Shadow of Fraud.” The memo stated that “Smartmatic Corporation is a riddle both in ownership and operation, complicated by the fact that its machines have overseen several landslide (and contested) victories by President Hugo Chavez and his supporters.”
“The Smartmatic machines used in Venezuela are widely suspected of, though never proven conclusively to be, susceptible to fraud,” the memo continued. “The Venezuelan opposition is convinced that the Smartmatic machines robbed them of victory in the August 2004 referendum. Since then, there have been at least eight statistical analyses performed on the referendum results.”
“One study obtained the data log from the CANTV network and supposedly proved that the Smartmatic machines were bi-directional and in fact showed irregularities in how they reported their results to the CNE central server during the referendum,” it read.
With such suspicion and a study which claims to prove that the U.K. firm’s equipment tampered with the 2004 Venezuelan recall election, should be enough for states to reject these machines if they desire a fair election.
Smartmatic is providing machines to Arizona, California, Colorado, Washington DC, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, which means these Soros and Clinton linked machines are going to take the votes of thousands of Americans.
While GOP nominee Donald Trump has been voicing his opinion that the elections are indeed rigged due to media bias, and the proof that mainstream polls are heavily weighted to favor Clinton , it is needless to say that if the results show Hillary as a winner in November, there is going to be a mess to shuffle through to find signs of honesty.

11721,"Donald Trump: Steve Scalise in ‘Trouble’ ‘He’s Going to Be Okay, We Hope’","President Donald Trump told reporters that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise’s condition had worsened since surgery after he was shot and wounded at a congressional baseball practice on Wednesday. [“It’s been much more difficult than people even thought at the time,” Trump said solemnly at the White House. “It’s been  —   he’s in some trouble. He’s a great fighter, and he’s going to be okay, we hope. ”  The president said he visited Scalise at the hospital and told the family that the entire country was praying for him. He commented that Scalise’s tragedy may have brought some unity to the partisan climate in the country. “Steve, in his own way, may have brought some unity to our   country,” Trump said. “I have a feeling that Steve has made a great sacrifice, but there could be some unity being brought to our great country. ” Trump made his comments before signing an executive order to spark more skill training for jobs and apprenticeships in the economy. He also praised the two Capitol Police officers who returned fire and were wounded after the shooter began shooting. “They ran right into the fire,” he said. “They ran right into those guns and the bullets, and they saved a lot of lives. ” As the event concluded, Trump shared a spirit of unity with the media. “[E]verybody in this room, including the reporters, God bless you,” he said as the people in the room laughed.  “God bless America,” he concluded.

11722,Russian grannies make deal with Lipton,"1 / 4 
Russian startup Cocco Bello, based in the village of Maliy Turish in the Sverdlovsk Region (760 miles from Moscow), will produce 15,000 candy spoons that will be included in large packages of Lipton Yellow Label tea in November. 
The deal came out of Cocco Bello’s participation in the Lipton Goodstarter project, a platform created to support young socially beneficial companies. As part of the initiative, Cocco Bello received a 300,000 rubles ($4,800) investment from Lipton. 
""Since we have won the Lipton contest, we decided to offer them the cooperation,"" said Guzel Sanzhapova, 28, the startup’s founder. Sanzhapova began the project as a family operation in 2013. “Today we have nine employees and most of them are seniors,” Sanzhapova said. The company’s main products are honey, herbal tea and candies. 
Sanzhapova is now making plans to build her own candy factory and hopes to attract investment through crowdfunding. She estimates the total cost of construction at about 6 million rubles ($95,500). She has already collected 938,000 rubles ($15,000). 
Lipton’s press service told RBTH that the Lipton program helps identify companies that have missions that fit well with the Lipton brand. According to the press service, a joint product between Lipton and Cocco Bello will go on sale as soon as official partner contract negotiations are concluded. “This is high speed for Unilever,” the press service said.

11723,"Three Days, 700 Deaths on Mediterranean as Migrant Crisis Flares - The New York Times","ROME  —   The migrant ships kept sinking. First came a battered,   vessel that flipped over on Wednesday as terrified migrants plunged into the Mediterranean Sea. The next day, a flimsy craft capsized with hundreds of people aboard. And on Friday, still another boat sank into the deceptively placid waters of the Mediterranean. Three days and three sunken ships are again confronting Europe with the horrors of its refugee crisis, as desperate people trying to reach the Continent keep dying at sea. At least 700 people from the three boats are believed to have drowned, the United Nations refugee agency announced on Sunday, in one of the deadliest weeks in the Mediterranean in recent memory. The latest drownings  —   which would push the death toll for the year to more than 2, 000 people  —   are a reminder of the cruel paradox of the Mediterranean calendar: As summer approaches with blue skies, warm weather and tranquil waters prized by tourists, human trafficking along the North African coastline traditionally kicks into a higher gear. Taking advantage of calm conditions, smugglers in Libya send out more and more migrants toward Italy, often on unseaworthy vessels. Drowning deaths are inevitable, even as Italian Coast Guard and Navy ships race to answer distress calls. Last year, more than 3, 700 migrants died in the Mediterranean, a figure that could be surpassed this year. In a statement on Sunday, the United Nations Children’s Fund said many of the migrants who drowned in the past week were believed to be unaccompanied adolescents. The grisly week also underscored the complex problem that the refugee crisis poses for Europe. The Continent’s leaders, facing an   backlash in many countries, have signed a controversial deal with Turkey that so far has sharply reduced the migrant flow into Greece last year, roughly one million people marched through the Balkans toward Germany. Yet closing the Greek route has shifted attention to the longer, more dangerous sea route from Libya to Italy. As of Wednesday, roughly 41, 000 migrants had been rescued at sea after leaving Libya, nearly the same number from the same period last year, according to the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration. The potential for a sudden increase in traffic is clear: An additional 4, 000 migrants were rescued on Thursday alone, the same day that as many as 550 people died on the second migrant boat that sank. “This was a very intense and exceptional week for the number of fatalities,” said Federico Fossi, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The deaths also point to the lack of solutions to the migrant crisis, which has been exacerbated by the violent chaos in Libya and fueled by the conflict in Syria. Officials with the refugee agency have been interviewing survivors of the three shipwrecks after they have been delivered to Italian ports. Those interviews were the primary basis for the estimate of 700 deaths, though some migration specialists cautioned that the number might turn out to be higher. The Italian authorities have also released grisly video footage taken by rescue ships approaching at least two of the sunken vessels. What was apparently the deadliest episode occurred on Thursday. A boat was towed away from the Libyan coastline by a larger smuggler ship. Survivors described being crammed onto a flimsy vessel filled with 670 people. Once the larger boat dropped the towline, the smaller one capsized. There were already 100 people missing from the ship that sank on Wednesday  —   a wooden fishing boat that flipped within sight of the Italian Navy (which later released a video that showed desperate people clinging to the deck or being tossed into the sea). On Friday, the navy rescued 135 migrants  —   and recovered 45 bodies  —   from a sinking smuggling boat on its way from Libya to Italy. “This week was a massacre,” said Giovanna Di Benedetto, a spokeswoman in Sicily with Save the Children, the nonprofit humanitarian group. Mr. Fossi, the United Nations spokesman, warned that the death toll could grow. “And surely many of those victims will be women and children, as usual,” he added. The vast majority of migrants trying to reach Italy are coming from   African nations like Eritrea, Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria. Last year, refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq poured into Europe, mostly traveling through Turkey into Greece. Now that the Greece route is largely shut down, the question is whether Syrians and Iraqis will try to reach Libya for the dangerous journey to Italy. That was the case in 2014, before smugglers began focusing on Greece. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy has tried for months to force the European Union to focus on Libya. He raised the issue again at the recent meeting of the Group of 7 nations and has proposed holding a Group of 7 meeting next year in Sicily, which has borne the brunt of Italy’s migrant crisis. Mr. Renzi also has proposed the creation of Euro bonds to help finance the response to the crisis  —   a move opposed by Germany so far. Much attention has been focused on Germany, as it absorbs nearly one million refugees who arrived last year. But Italy is also feeling the strain. With the summer migrant season soon to arrive, more than 115, 000 migrants are already in Italy, an enormous increase from only a few years ago. Italian news media regularly broadcasts videos and photographs of sinking boats, as well as men, women and children wrapped in thermal blankets. In one striking image, a rescue official held a    girl who had lost her pregnant mother. On Saturday at the Vatican, Pope Francis showed a gathering of children a life jacket used by a Syrian girl who died while trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos. “Migrants are not a danger  —   they are in danger,” Francis told his young audience.",0
11724,Can Cities Sue Banks Over Predatory Loans? Supreme Court Will Decide - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court on Tuesday weighed whether cities can sue banks under the Fair Housing Act for predatory lending, even if foreclosures that stem from such loans affect a city only indirectly. The case before the justices was brought by Miami after the 2008 financial crisis. The city said that discriminatory mortgage lending practices by Bank of America and Wells Fargo had led to a disproportionate number of defaults by minority home buyers and, in turn, to financial harm to the city. “We are aggrieved in every sense of the word by the discrimination that was propounded here,” said Robert S. Peck, a lawyer for the city. The justices appeared divided over whether Miami’s asserted injuries were enough to allow it to sue under the housing law. Justice Elena Kagan said the law was a “distinctive kind of   statute, which really is focusing on community harms. ” “Here the cities are standing up and saying, ‘Every time you do this redlining and this reverse redlining, essentially a community is becoming blighted.’ And who better than the city to recognize that interest and to assert it?” she asked. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. appeared to disagree, telling Mr. Peck that the harms Miami claimed to have suffered were secondhand. “Your injuries are derivative of the injury to the homeowners who had the subprime mortgages and who suffered the foreclosure and so on,” the chief justice told him. “I understand your argument that you’re down the line, but I don’t see how you can say that your loss of property taxes is a direct injury. ” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also appeared skeptical of aspects of the city’s arguments. “The statute doesn’t prohibit decreasing property tax values,” he said. Other justices worried that a ruling for Miami would allow all sorts of people and entities to sue for indirect harm from discriminatory practices. Justice Kagan asked about restaurants and dry cleaners, Justice Sonia Sotomayor about corner grocers and Justice Stephen G. Breyer about “a magazine that writes about successes in integration and wants to write about this community before it got wrecked or whatever. ” Curtis E. Gannon, a lawyer for the federal government arguing in support of the city, offered a limiting principle. He said people, businesses and local governments hurt by a decline in property values ought to be able to sue under the housing law. The law allows suits from “aggrieved persons. ” No one disputed that cities may sometimes count as persons in a legal sense, but Neal K. Katyal, a lawyer for the banks, said Miami was not aggrieved just because it asserted an indirect financial injury. He said the city had tried to piggyback on the borrowers’ interest in being free from discrimination and had “cut and paste” their grievances into its lawsuit. Miami’s asserted injuries were too remote, Mr. Katyal said, calling the city’s legal theory “  liability. ” “You have to have discriminatory loans,” he said. “Those discriminatory loans have to lead to defaults. The defaults have to lead to foreclosures. The foreclosures need to lead to increases in vacancies. The increase in vacancies needs to lead to reduction in property values. ” Mr. Peck, the city’s lawyer, said its harm was more direct. “The banks’ practice of providing minority borrowers with more expensive and riskier loans than they qualified for, or that nonminority borrowers received, actually frustrated and counteracted the city’s efforts on fair housing,” he said. The court heard a single hour of argument in two consolidated cases, Bank of America v. Miami, No.   and Wells Fargo v. Miami, No.  . A trial court dismissed the suits in 2014, saying the city had not demonstrated that its claims were covered by the housing law. The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, reversed those rulings last year, allowing the cases to proceed. The appeals court said it was enough for the city to contend that it had “suffered an economic injury resulting from a racially discriminatory housing policy. ” A   tie in the Supreme Court, which seemed a viable prospect on Tuesday, would leave the appeals court’s ruling in place, handing a victory to Miami but setting no national precedent.",0
11725,"CBS 60 Minutes Withheld Trump’s Appeal to ‘Stop Attacking Minorities,’ and Ignored Reports of Attacks on Trump Supporters","November 15, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment 
J.R. Smith 21st Century Wire 
The election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media’s campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. 
Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks’ Podesta email dump – nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. 
It’s now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears – and all the while pushing fictional ‘hate crime’ hoaxes. 
CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to “Stop it,” in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. 
When told about alleged reports of a ‘Trump supporter’ who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , “I am so saddened to hear that.” He then added, “And I say, ‘Stop it.’ If it helps, I will say this – and I will say right to the cameras: ‘Stop it.'” 
One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged “abuses” by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it’s obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses – Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf – without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was ‘drive-by’ media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. 
Now, it’s perfectly understandable that Trump’s victory over the establishment’s heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that ‘they’ lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America’s politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating “hate crime” incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow “causing many minorities fearful about the future”. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. 
In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged ‘hate crime’ incident – one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. 
Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : 
A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. 
The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. 
Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. 
“During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,” the statement reportedly read. 
NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described “journalists” who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America’s corrupt liberal mainstream media. 
That’s right – this was just another hoax: 
Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs 
What Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday’s election, nearly all of the so-called ‘violent hate crimes’ have been carried out against Trump supporters – by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. 
Here are just a few examples: @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8

Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a ‘Trump supporter.’ These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama – are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party’s online ‘community organizer’ network MoveOn.org – a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros . Watch this stunning clip: 
. Here is a video of clip of a white male in Chicago, 49 yr old David Wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of African-Americans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, “You voted for Donald Trump!” before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. 
From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it’s political intimidation done on the street – which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers – enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama? 
These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. 
Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party’s losing candidate Hillary Clinton – to help calm street thugs and violent ‘progressives’? It’s almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week’s media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. 
What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style ‘safe’ segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of ‘job for life’ government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it’s irredeemable . 
One of the corporate mainstream’s worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled “Reliable Sources.” Stelter is meant to be CNN’s media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as “senior media analyst.” After leading CNN’s own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump’s Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network’s horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it’s too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. 
Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN’s which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk – all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today’s toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses – they are all way past shameless at this stage. 
None of them can be trusted anymore – only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.

COSMETIC: CBS’s Stahl represents the shallow, bland irrelevance of the mainstream gatekeeping media. 
Joe Concha The Hill 
CBS News is under fire for holding a videotaped clip from a Friday interview with President-elect Donald Trump urging supporters not to attack minorities until a “60 Minutes” broadcast on Sunday night. 
“I am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it,” Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl when told of some attacks on minorities that have reportedly occurred since his election victory Tuesday. 
“I am so sorry to hear it, and I say stop it,” Trump said before looking directly into the camera. “And I say right to the camera, stop it.” 
“60 Minutes” did release quotes from the Friday interview in advance, but only a statement by Trump on the Affordable Care Act. 
“We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare,” a spokesperson for CBS told CNN Monday. 
Kai Ryssdal, host of “Marketplace,” called that reasoning “completely underwhelming.” CBS's underwhelming answer: ""We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare""

11726,HealthCare.gov Will Add ‘Simple Choice’ Plans in Effort to Improve Value - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace opens in two weeks, many consumers will have a new option for the law’s fourth   period: standardized health plans that cover basic services without a deductible. With many health plans on the marketplace coming with deductibles in the thousands of dollars, consumers have complained that they were getting little benefit beyond coverage for catastrophic problems. The new standardized options are meant to address that concern  —   to ensure that “enrollees receive some upfront value for their premium dollars,” as the Obama administration said. “Too many people, especially people on   plans, are still struggling to afford the care they need,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said, praising the new effort. But the new plans could still be costly. While the federal government specifies deductibles,   and other    costs for the standardized options, it does not limit premiums, which in most cases are still regulated by state insurance commissioners. The administration has said it does not expect the standardized options to have a significant effect on premiums in 2017. Federal officials say the new option will simplify shopping under the Affordable Care Act by reducing variation among plans, and consumer advocates like the idea. The standardized options will be identified on HealthCare. gov with the label “Simple Choice. ” Open enrollment begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. People without health insurance next year face possible tax penalties that could exceed $700 a person. “This is one more tool that will make it easier for consumers to select the right plan,” said Marjorie K. Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. Sandy H. Ahn, a researcher at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University, said the “standardized plans will allow consumers to make more of an    comparison. ” Administration officials did not say how many such plans will be available, in which states they will be offered or how much they will cost. The government encouraged but did not require insurers to offer standardized options. The standardized version of a midlevel silver plan has a $3, 500 deductible, but primary care and specialty care visits, outpatient mental health services and prescription drugs are generally exempt from the deductible. In other words, consumers may face   but they do not have to meet the deductible before the insurance company starts to pay for such services. On HealthCare. gov, the administration intends to introduce the idea of standardized options by describing Simple Choice as “the easiest way to shop for plans. ” “All Simple Choice plans in the same category (like Silver) have exactly the same core benefits, deductibles and ” states a message to be displayed on the federal website. “When viewing Simple Choice plans, you can focus on other important features that may be different: monthly premiums, additional services covered, doctor and hospital networks. ” The Obama administration is still struggling to keep the Affordable Care Act affordable for many consumers. State officials have approved rate increases of 25 percent or more for many plans in 2017, after finding that insurers lost tens of millions of dollars in the exchanges. Aetna, UnitedHealth and other insurers have pulled back from the public marketplace, leaving consumers in many states with fewer choices. Under the standardized version of a silver plan,   would be $30 for a visit to a primary care doctor, $65 for a visit to a specialist, $15 for a generic prescription drug, $50 for a preferred   drug and $100 for a nonpreferred   drug. Consumers may be responsible for up to 40 percent of the cost of specialty drugs, including certain   medicines for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. For the   families, the charges would be lower. Federal officials said they had studied several   exchanges  —   in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Vermont  —   that provide standardized options. Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the California exchange, said standardized options had contributed to the stability and success of the marketplace there. “Californians seeking coverage through the marketplace can easily compare health plans, knowing that every health plan has the same   levels and benefits,” Mr. Lee said. Insurers generally dislike efforts to standardize health plans. Standardized options “increase the complexity of the   process” by adding one more factor for consumers to consider, said America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. In a letter this month to the Obama administration, Anthem, one of the nation’s largest insurers, said, “Standardized benefit designs threaten to commoditize insurance and stifle innovation, while potentially misleading consumers. ” The administration said insurers still had discretion to vary many features that would not be standardized.",0
11727,Trump Proposal Would Deport More Immigrants Immediately - The New York Times,"PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   Federal authorities would be empowered to immediately deport vastly more undocumented immigrants as part of a broad crackdown being developed by the Trump administration that would significantly change the way federal agencies enforce immigration laws. Two draft memos signed on Friday by John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general who is now secretary of homeland security, outline an aggressive mission for the immigration authorities that would rescind policies put in place by President Barack Obama that focused mainly on removing serious criminals. The directives appear to spare many younger immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers. But some parents of children who enter unaccompanied could face prosecution under the guidelines. The approach laid out in the memos, which have not been finalized and are subject to change by the White House, reflects Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to harden the border and deport people who entered the United States illegally. He has returned to that theme in recent days: At a rally on Saturday in Melbourne, Fla. Mr. Trump highlighted a recent spate of deportations and characterized those being sent out of the country as dangerous criminals. “We will have strong borders again,” he told supporters, who cheered robustly. “You’ve seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he’s really doing the job. You’re seeing it. The gang members  —   bad, bad people. I said it Day 1. And they’re going out, or they’re being put in prison. But for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from. ” Among the most significant changes in the memos, which were obtained by McClatchy newspapers and The Washington Post, would be an expansion of   expedited removal proceedings to cover thousands more undocumented immigrants. Under expedited removals, agents from the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement can deport detained individuals immediately. Under Obama administration directives, expedited removal was used only within 100 miles of the border for people who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Mr. Kelly’s memos would expand that to those who have been in the country for up to two years anywhere in the nation. The memos also call for the possible prosecution of the parents of children who arrived as unaccompanied minors and are later reunited with the parents. Under Mr. Kelly’s directive, the parents could be charged with smuggling or trafficking. But the memos appear to exempt the Dreamers, the young immigrants protected under Mr. Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, called DACA. Mr. Trump has signaled that he is not eager to completely reverse that initiative, since those young immigrants were not responsible for their entering the country illegally. “The DACA situation is a very, very  —   it’s a very difficult thing for me, because, you know, I love these kids,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Thursday. “I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know the law is rough. ” The White House cautioned on Sunday that the details of the directives were still being reviewed but suggested final orders may be issued this week. “None of those are final and have not been signed off by the White House,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a deputy press secretary for Mr. Trump, told reporters in Florida, where the president was spending the weekend. The Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss the memos. The changes in immigration enforcement, outlined in executive orders signed by Mr. Trump last month, have drawn praise from agents in the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “For the first time in my 19 years, I feel like I can do the job I was hired to do, the job they tell you you’ll be doing when you leave the academy,” said Shawn Moran, a Border Patrol agent in San Diego and spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing 16, 000 of the agency’s 21, 000 agents. But immigration advocates called the policy changes dangerous and expressed disappointment in Mr. Kelly, who they had hoped would be a more moderate voice on immigration policy in the Trump administration because he had expressed sympathy for women and children arriving in the United States after fleeing violence in Central America. “That hope is now gone,” Tom Jawetz, the vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization, said on Twitter. “The border security memo mentions Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan kids coming without pretending to care why. ” Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he hoped the administration would rethink the approach. “All of these things are unfortunately not surprising but deeply worrisome, both for the people who are going to be directly affected and for the country as a whole,” Mr. Jadwat said. “This kind of inhumane approach and the disregard for fundamental due process values that’s embodied in these memos can do real damage to our country. ” Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said that while he supported the removal of unauthorized immigrants who are dangerous criminals, Mr. Trump’s policies seemed to lump all undocumented immigrants together. “Ultimately, anyone who is found in an undocumented status would ultimately be apprehended and deported, with due process totally eroded under the proposals that I’m hearing about,” he said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And that’s not only going to lead to massive deportations, they are going to affect every element of our society and our economic sector as well. ” Expanding the immigration authorities’ reach would require a considerable increase in resources. With an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, the government has long had to set narrower priorities, given the constraints on staffing and money. But Mr. Kelly’s memos envision hiring 10, 000 new immigration and customs agents, expanding detention facilities and creating an office to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump had some of those relatives address his rallies in the campaign, and several were present when he signed an executive order on immigration last month at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Kelly’s directives would also instruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, to begin reviving a program that recruits local police officers and sheriff’s deputies to help with deportation, effectively making them de facto immigration agents. The effort, called the 287g program, was scaled back during the Obama administration. The program faces resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities, which have refused to allow their law enforcement workers to help round up undocumented individuals. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott has said he will cut state funding for sanctuary cities and remove any elected official who promotes such policies. Mr. Abbott’s office canceled a $1. 5 million grant to Travis County because the newly elected Democratic sheriff, Sally Hernandez, said her department would not respond to requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to flag inmates for possible deportation. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, the secretary of state and a transition adviser to Mr. Trump, is promoting a bill that would require the Kansas Highway Patrol to seek agreement with the federal government to deputize state troopers to enforce immigration laws. The Highway Patrol says it was not consulted on the bill. The measure faces opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans.",0
11728,Notes on the U.S. Election: A Measure of America’s Fever - The New York Times,"When democracy is at its best, elections are the civilized version of warfare: clashes of wit, personality and ideas that seek to resolve a nation’s biggest arguments. But sometimes an election is just a dirty fight. When Donald J. Trump arrived in Albuquerque last week, stepping from his   jet into an aircraft hangar that was thronged with baying supporters, he held his arms aloft like a champion boxer. His speech opened with dutiful attacks on Obamacare, the Iran nuclear deal and immigration. But it was when he uttered a single word  —   “Hillary”  —   that the crowd truly erupted. “Lock her up!” The roar filled the hangar. Mr. Trump paused his speech, then smiled. Two days later and 1, 500 miles away, Hillary Clinton punched back. Slamming her rival’s “dark and divisive vision,” she alternated between mocking Mr. Trump and painting him as a threat to America and global stability. Would America’s nuclear codes be safe in his hands? she asked the crowd at her own rally in Orlando, Fla. What about black people? Latinos? A harsh,   quality crept into her voice. This was the biggest election of their lives, she told supporters. “Now,” she said, “go and vote. ” I will not be voting in this election I’m Irish, and I’ve never lived in the United States. But since July, I have traversed the country to report on its extraordinary, bewildering campaign from a foreigner’s perspective. After the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, I met voters at a coal mine in West Virginia, at ranches along the Mexican border, inside casinos in Las Vegas and outside the gleaming black edifice of Trump Tower in Manhattan. Here is a video with comments from a few of them. As Nov. 8 approached, I wanted to see the candidates up close. I went to 10 rallies in six states, traveling more than 6, 000 miles (that’s nine flights in four days). After all that, I didn’t get closer than 30 yards from either candidate. The view was often better on television. Yet as they galloped down the home straight of this bitterly contentious race, the trip revealed less a snapshot of America than a measure of its temperature. Rallies felt like injections to the vein, jolts of political energy driven by voters who stood for long hours in crowded halls, cheering leaders they could barely see for promises that may never be fulfilled. But venom, not hope, was a driving force. Fear and loathing course through both campaigns, driven on one side by Mr. Trump’s   populism and on the other by Mrs. Clinton’s apocalyptic warnings of the consequences if he wins. Lurid personal attacks, insinuations of   rampant conspiracy theories  —   I might have been in Pakistan, where I lived for nine years, or at my current base in Egypt. In this election, America’s shining city on the hill, it seems, has more in common with those countries where the electricity blinks on and off. Below, some snapshots and notes from my time on the trail, first with Mr. Trump, then with Mrs. Clinton. LAS VEGAS, Oct. 30, 11:10 a. m. To see Mr. Trump speak live is to understand his wild popularity with a section of the electorate. In three nationally televised debates, he often came across as a blustering, barracking bumbler. But in the gilded ballroom of the Venetian hotel and casino, he is in complete control. He channels the energy of the crowd, listening as he speaks. When he hears the right note of approval, Mr. Trump amplifies his message and bounces it back, usually with one of his trademark   catchphrases. “Drain the swamp!” the crowd yells on cue  —   a reference to the swamp upon which Washington, D. C. was built. Then: “Build the wall” on the Mexican border. And: “Lock her up!” 11:43 a. m. We’re standing at the ballroom side door, having been hustled out by campaign aides before Mr. Trump finished. The jaded campaign reporters who have heard this speech dozens of times say the closer in perfect sync: “Make America great again!” Then we are herded into a giant service elevator that deposits us in the bowels of the casino where, among the concrete pillars, a convoy of gleaming black vehicles and burly Secret Service agents is waiting. Mr. Trump follows within minutes. I press up against the window of the press bus. The candidate walks briskly, but his shoulders are drooped, as if deflated by the effort of the speech. He steps into a   drive, and the convoy sets off for the airport. This, it turns out, is the closest I will get to him. McCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, noon. The Trump press plane offers several advantages over commercial air travel: There’s no   and there are no luggage limit or irksome restrictions about seatbelts or cellphone use. Every seat is business class (my bill for two days topped $5, 000). The crew is obliging, and the alcohol and   are free. You can eat during takeoff. But you don’t get to see the star. In a break with campaign tradition, Mr. Trump has declined to share a plane with the traveling press. He flies in his private Boeing 757  —   fancifully nicknamed Trump Force One  —   with its   gold taps and retinue of advisers. GREELEY, Colo. 2 p. m. When a Trump crowd unleashes on Mrs. Clinton, it is hard not to think of Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984,” when the people were allowed to spend two minutes every day venting hatred for the party’s enemy. Yet individually, many Trump supporters are a far cry from the snarling caricatures. At the University of Northern Colorado, they are cheery and polite, an odd mix of the prim and the profane: schoolteachers and churchgoers in sensible shoes, paunchy   men in tattoos and biker leathers. They seem to exult in the solidarity of the crowd, defiant in their identity as “deplorables. ” To them, Mr. Trump can do no wrong the problem is politics. Les Potts, a retired preacher, tells me that he worries about the progressives’ gaining control of the Supreme Court and the spread of communism. Is America not the global center of capitalism? No, he insists. “People are fed up,” he says. “In Washington, we need some big changes. And I don’t think we’ll have that without a revolution. ” GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. Oct. 31, 2 a. m. Confusion at   means that I spend 15 minutes hunting for a   room that, it turns out, is on the sixth floor.   I collapse into bed. 10 a. m. It’s Halloween, so “Werewolves of London” has replaced Pavarotti as the   music at Deltaplex Arena. The Statue of Liberty is posing for pictures, along with Laurie Sanger, in an orange jumpsuit, a blond wig and handcuffs: a jailbird Hillary Clinton. Ms. Sanger, who is 33 and works at a furniture factory, explains: Mrs. Clinton is a corrupt criminal, “bought and paid for by special interests  —   she deserves jail. ” Ms. Sanger’s placard is sponsored by infowars. com, a conspiracy website that, thanks to Mr. Trump, has leapt to prominence. It’s also a sign of the times: Thanks to Mr. Trump, fringe ideas are now aired in the mainstream, prejudice masquerading as fact. Danny Popma, a local factory owner, tells me that the Muslim community in Detroit  —   the largest in America  —   was implicated in  . WARREN, Mich. 4 p. m. Winning is a big part of Mr. Trump’s sales pitch. But what he’s offering feels like a defensive victory, a retrieval of lost glory rather than anything new. At Macomb Community College, north of Detroit, he paints a dismal picture of American foreign policy, laying the chaos of the Middle East  —   Libya, Syria, Egypt and Iraq, and the death of four Americans in Benghazi in 2012  —   at Mrs. Clinton’s doorstep. To him, the entire world is a stage of American humiliation, with a declining military and abandoned veterans. It resonates with people in the crowd. To them, Mr. Trump offers to salve fallen pride, flex American muscle and renew bruised notions of American exceptionalism.   NORTH OF TAMPA, Fla. Nov. 1, 1:15 p. m. I’m in an Uber, having left the Trump bubble to meet up with the Clinton camp in Florida, the most famous of the famous swing states, where Al Gore lost it all by a sliver in 2000. Rush Limbaugh, the     king, is on the radio, pouring cold water on suggestions that Mr. Trump is losing and basking in the email scandal that has exploded over the Clinton campaign  —   again. Nobody knows what was in these latest emails, not even the F. B. I. director, who revealed their existence. But that’s not the point. Mrs. Clinton’s emails have acquired a talismanic power in this election, a digital dung heap that embodies the negatives she has struggled to shake off: defensiveness, reflexive secrecy, the whiff of shortcuts and sharp practice. The candidates are neck and neck here in Florida, bombarding each other with negative ads. It’s hard to avoid them on TV: images of a vampirelike Mrs. Clinton, or Mr. Trump slinging insults at women. “I can’t wait till this is all over,” my Uber driver says. DADE CITY, Fla. 3:23 p. m. Waiting for Mrs. Clinton, I log on to the press   network: The password is “stronger together,” the campaign slogan. Yesterday it was “Trump Train. ” Everything is an opportunity for messaging in a modern campaign. Before the candidate arrives, a few of her supporters wilt under the scorching sun and are carried out for first aid. What strikes me among the older supporters is the intensity of their animus toward Mr. Trump. He is, one man tells me, “pure evil. ” Nancy Perkins, 64, a retired nurse, says she has unfriended every Trump supporter on Facebook: “I don’t need people like that in my life. ” The   act is Alicia Machado, the onetime Miss Universe who became an election argument when it emerged that Mr. Trump had once called her “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping. ” Now the Clinton campaign has deployed her. Her voice quivers as she recounts how he called her ugly. “He’s the ugly one!” yells a man in a wheelchair at the back of the crowd. “Monster!” 4:34 p. m. A few hundred yards from the rally, a clutch of Trump supporters are yelling, “Lock her up!” As the press bus pulls away, the Trumpsters run around outside the window, laughing and making wild gestures. FORT   INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Nov. 2, 12:13 p. m. Wheels up: In the campaign’s final sprint, candidates often move east to west, exploiting the changing time zones to fit in more events. Much has changed since Timothy Crouse wrote “The Boys on the Bus,” his gritty account of covering the 1972 presidential campaign, and it’s not just Twitter’s replacing typewriters. Today, most of the   Clinton correspondents are women, so testosterone levels have fallen, too. Unlike Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton travels on the same plane as the press. But it’s a distinction without a difference: She is ensconced behind a curtain near the nose. That’s new only a few weeks ago, when the polls showed her with a comfortable lead, Mrs. Clinton sometimes strolled back to field questions. But then the F. B. I. email scandal hit. Polls tightened. Mrs. Clinton dispatched her aides to press the press. LAS VEGAS, 2 p. m. I’m back where I started with Mr. Trump. But instead of a fancy casino, Mrs. Clinton’s rally is in the rather prosaic headquarters of the city’s plumbers and pipe fitters union. Burly men walk around in “Carpenters for Hillary”   there are a lot of Hispanic supporters in the crowd. Here, Mrs. Clinton’s focus is Mr. Trump’s attitude toward immigration. She talks about what his “dark and divisive vision” would mean for blacks, Mexicans and Muslims. “Imagine what it would be like to have him in the most powerful office in the world on Jan. 20,” she says.  McCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, 5:27 p. m. For the short hop to Phoenix, I get switched into the chase plane  —   an executive jet, all walnut trim and bottled beer, for the reporters who do not fit on Mrs. Clinton’s plane. The press wrangler is Andrea, a consultant from Las Vegas who artfully dodges questions about whether she wants a job in a future Clinton administration. TEMPE, Ariz. 9:50 p. m. After a rally at Arizona State University with 15, 000 people  —   huge by Clinton standards  —   her convoy is at a standstill. The Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians are heading into extra innings in the final game of the World Series. Mrs. Clinton, who was born in the suburbs of Chicago, is watching on an iPad and cheering for the Cubs, who haven’t won the championship in 108 years. On the press bus, the Twitter messages and filing of stories have halted reporters crowd over the dim glow of a laptop where someone has managed to stream a live feed. The bus erupts in cheers when the Cubs clinch the title with a final out. Mrs. Clinton allows herself to celebrate, holding aloft the Cubs’ W flag  —   for “ win”  —   as she is no doubt hoping to do for herself in a few days.",0

11730,‘They’re Lies’: Melania Trump Rejects Women’s Claims That Husband Groped Them - The New York Times,"Melania Trump, who has been all but invisible as her husband confronts a campaign crisis over allegations that he sexually assaulted women, emerged on Monday to forcefully defend him and question the honesty of the women making the accusations. Ms. Trump, in an extensive interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, said the women who had accused Donald J. Trump of groping and kissing them were lying, and likened her husband to a teenage boy who engages in macho boasting. She echoed her husband’s complaint that he was the victim of a broad conspiracy between the news media and the Clinton campaign. “I believe my husband, I believe my husband  —   it was all organized from the opposition,” Ms. Trump said. “They can never check the background of these women. They don’t have any facts. ” Her appearance comes as Mr. Trump and his aides grapple with the worst stretch of the campaign so far, after the airing 10 days ago of an “Access Hollywood” recording from 2005 that captured Mr. Trump bragging to the host Billy Bush that he kisses women without invitation and that he can grab women’s genitals because he is a “star. ” Ms. Trump, 46, called the exchange between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush “boy talk,” and said Mr. Trump had been “egged on” by the host “to say dirty and bad stuff. ” But she stressed that she believed that Mr. Trump was simply being boastful and did not engage in the behavior he described. “Sometimes I say I have two boys at home: I have my young son, and I have my husband,” she said with a slight laugh. “But I know how some men talk, and that’s how I saw it, yes. ” Mr. Trump’s aides have been eager for his wife to make a public show of support for him, especially after the “Access Hollywood” recording dominated several media cycles and drove some Republican elected officials to abandon his candidacy. A week ago, Mr. Trump’s adult children, along with aides to his campaign, urged Ms. Trump to agree to a   interview with her husband, an echo of the “60 Minutes” interview that Bill and Hillary Clinton did in 1992 after sexual infidelity allegations arose against Mr. Clinton. That appearance helped stabilize Mr. Clinton’s presidential campaign. But Ms. Trump had little interest in it, and the idea died. Ms. Trump has never enjoyed the political stage, and was stung by media coverage in July, when it was revealed that her  anticipated Republican National Convention speech borrowed lines from Michelle Obama’s 2008 address to the Democratic National Convention. She has been absent from the campaign trail since, save for brief appearances at the first two general election debates, and has been spending time with the couple’s young son, Barron. She put out a written statement of support for her husband after the tape surfaced. But with Mr. Trump’s favorability among women perilously low, his advisers wanted Ms. Trump to do more. Seated in the family’s penthouse atop Trump Tower, Ms. Trump seemed occasionally ill at ease but determined to convey several points: that her husband is a gentleman, that the media is out to get him and that she is staying strong despite the ugliness. She showed an ability to remain on message that her husband sometimes lacks. “I watched TV hour after hour bashing him,” Ms. Trump said of the television coverage the weekend the    recording was first revealed. She said her husband was defending himself against the accusations because “they’re lies. ” She also said her husband was approached by many women who were sexually forward with him. “I see many, many women coming to him and giving the phone numbers and, you know, want to work for him or inappropriate stuff from women,” she said. “And they know he’s married. ” Ms. Trump steadily answered most of Mr. Cooper’s polite but probing questions, though she suggested that some information she would keep private, including the details of the conversation the couple had after the tape came out. She also taped an interview for “Fox and Friends” that will appear Tuesday morning. Mr. Trump has vehemently denied the claims of his accusers, calling them elements of a conspiracy led partly by news media outlets, particularly CNN and The New York Times. Yet despite Mr. Trump’s criticism of CNN and its reporting, and even as some of his supporters at a rally on Monday used an   chant, Ms. Trump still selected Mr. Cooper to interview her. Asked on Fox whether it was fair for her husband to bring up Mr. Clinton’s past, Ms. Trump said, “Well, if they bring up my past, why not?” She was alluding to a television ad run during the Republican Party’s nominating fight that featured a nude photo spread from Ms. Trump’s days as a model. Speaking to Mr. Cooper, Ms. Trump repeatedly denounced what she saw as the meanness and inaccuracy of media accounts about her, and she said she would like to work to protect children from the toxic dangers of negativity and anger on social media. She has withdrawn from her own social media accounts, Ms. Trump said, rarely posting during the campaign. “I see the negativity, and it’s not healthy,” she said. But when asked whether she has advised the same to her husband, a frequent Twitter user who often attacks others on his feed, she replied, “That’s his decision. He’s an adult. ” “I give him many advices, but sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn’t, and he will do what he wants to do at the end, and I will do what I want to do,” she said.",0
11731,Neighbor Shoots Knife-Wielding Man Trying to Drown Babies in Bathtub - Breitbart,"On Friday an Ada, Oklahoma, man shot and killed a   suspect who was trying to drown two babies in a bathtub in a nearby home. [The incident occurred around 12:30 p. m.  According to The Ada News, police said the suspect —     Leland Foster —  “forced his way into a home in the 1800 block of East 6th Street” and tried to killed his own    twins. Ada Public Information Director Lisa Bratcher said Central Dispatch received a 911 call from the mother of the twins wherein the mother said she and the babies were under attack by a suspect armed with a knife. Bratcher said “dispatchers could hear the woman screaming in the background amid sounds of a struggle. ” A neighbor, Cash Freeman, was alerted to the situation by a    who fled the home, frantically seeking help. Freeman grabbed his revolver and entered the home, where he found Foster allegedly holding the twins under water in the bathtub. Freeman shot Foster two times, killing him and saving the babies. The Daily Mail reports that Foster had “prior criminal charges for arson and domestic abuse by strangulation. ” The    twins were treated at a hospital Friday and released on Saturday.

11732,"Oh, What a Lovely War!","Written by Philip Giraldi Tuesday November 8, 2016 The American people don’t know very much about war even if Washington has been fighting on multiple fronts since 9/11. The continental United States has not experienced the presence a hostile military force for more than 100 years and war for the current generation of Americans consists largely of the insights provided by video games and movies. The Pentagon’s invention of embedded journalists, which limits any independent media insight into what is going on overseas, has contributed to the rendering of war as some kind of abstraction. Gone forever is anything like the press coverage of Vietnam, with nightly news and other media presentations showing prisoners being executed and young girls screaming while racing down the street in flames. Given all of that, it is perhaps no surprise that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, neither of whom has served in uniform, should regard violence inflicted on people overseas with a considerable level of detachment. Hillary is notorious for her assessment of the brutal killing of Libya’s Moammar Gaddafi, saying “We came, we saw, he died.” They both share to an extent the dominant New York-Washington policy consensus view that dealing with foreigners can sometimes get a bit bloody, but that is a price that someone in power has to be prepared to pay. One of Hillary’s top advisers, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, famously declared that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children due to US led sanctions were “worth it.” In the election campaign there has, in fact, been little discussion of the issue of war and peace or even of America’s place in the world, though Trump did at one point note correctly that implementation of Hillary’s suggested foreign policy could escalate into World War III. It has been my contention that the issue of war should be more front and center in the minds of Americans when they cast their ballots as the prospect of an armed conflict in which little is actually at stake escalating and going nuclear could conceivably end life on this planet as we know it. With that in mind, it is useful to consider what the two candidates have been promising. First, Hillary, who might reasonably be designated the Establishment’s war candidate though she carefully wraps it in humanitarian “liberal interventionism.” As Senator and Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has always viewed a foreign crisis as an opportunity to use aggressive measures to seek a resolution. She can always be relied upon to “do something,” a reflection of the neocon driven Washington foreign policy consensus. Hillary Clinton and her advisors, who believe strongly in Washington’s leadership role globally and embrace their own definition of American exceptionalism, have been explicit in terms of what they would do to employ our military power. She would be an extremely proactive president in foreign policy, with a particular animus directed against Russia. And, unfortunately, there would be little or no pushback against the exercise of her admittedly poor instincts regarding what to do, as was demonstrated regarding Libya and also with Benghazi. She would find little opposition in Congress and the media for an extremely risky foreign policy, and would benefit from the Washington groupthink that prevails over the alleged threats emanating from Russia, Iran, and China. Hillary has received support from foreign policy hawks, including a large number of formerly Republican neocons, to include Robert Kagan, Michael Chertoff, Michael Hayden, Eliot Cohen and Eric Edelman. James Stavridis, a retired admiral who was once vetted by Clinton as a possible vice president, recently warned of “the need to use deadly force against the Iranians. I think it’s coming. It’s going to be maritime confrontation and if it doesn’t happen immediately, I’ll bet you a dollar it’s going to be happening after the presidential election, whoever is elected.” Hillary believes that Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad is the root cause of the turmoil in that country and must be removed as the first priority. It is a foolish policy as al-Assad in no way threatens the United States while his enemy ISIS does and regime change would create a power vacuum that will benefit the latter. She has also called for a no-fly zone in Syria to protect the local population as well as the insurgent groups that the US supports, some of which had been labeled as terrorists before they were renamed by current Secretary of State John Kerry. Such a zone would dramatically raise the prospect of armed conflict with Russia and it puts Washington in an odd position vis-à-vis what is occurring in Syria. The US is not at war with the Syrian government, which, like it or not, is under international law sovereign within its own recognized borders. Damascus has invited the Russians in to help against the rebels and objects to any other foreign presence on Syrian territory. In spite of all that, Washington is asserting some kind of authority to intervene and to confront the Russians as both a humanitarian mission and as an “inherent right of self-defense.” Hillary has not recommended doing anything about Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, all of which have at one time or another for various reasons supported ISIS, but she is clearly no friend of Iran, which has been fighting ISIS. As a Senator, she threatened to “totally obliterate” Iran but she has more recently reluctantly supported the recent nuclear agreement with that country negotiated by President Barack Obama. But she has nevertheless warned that she will monitor the situation closely for possible violations and will otherwise pushback against activity by the Islamic Republic. As one of her key financial supporters is Israeli Haim Saban, who has said he is a one issue guy and that issue is Israel, she is likely to pursue aggressive policies in the Persian Gulf. She has also promised to move America’s relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a “new level” and has repeatedly declared that her support for Israel is unconditional. One of Hillary’s advisors, former CIA acting Director Michael Morell, has called for new sanctions on Tehran and has also recently recommended that the US begin intercepting Iranian ships presumed to be carrying arms to the Houthis in Yemen. Washington is not at war with either Iran or Yemen and the Houthis are not on the State Department terrorist list but our good friends the Saudis have been assiduously bombing them for reasons that seem obscure. Stopping ships in international waters without any legal pretext would be considered by many an act of piracy. Morell has also called for covertly assassinating Iranians and Russians to express our displeasure with the foreign policies of their respective governments. Hillary’s dislike for Russia’s Vladimir Putin is notorious. Syria aside, she has advocated arming Ukraine with game changing offensive weapons and also bringing Ukraine and Georgia into NATO, which would force a sharp Russian reaction. One suspects that she might be sympathetic to the views expressed recently by Carl Gershman in a Washington Post op-ed that received curiously little additional coverage in the media. Gershman is the head of the taxpayer funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which means that he is a powerful figure in Washington’s foreign-policy establishment. NED has plausibly been described as doing the sorts of things that the CIA used to do. After making a number of bumper-sticker claims about Russia and Putin that are either partially true, unproven or even ridiculous, Gershman concluded that “the United States has the power to contain and defeat this danger. The issue is whether we can summon the will to do so.” It is basically a call for the next administration to remove Putin from power—as foolish a suggestion as has ever been seen in a leading newspaper, as it implies that the risk of nuclear war is completely acceptable to bring about regime change in a country whose very popular, democratically elected leadership we disapprove of. But it is nevertheless symptomatic of the kind of thinking that goes on inside the beltway and is quite possibly a position that Hillary Clinton will embrace. She also benefits from having the perfect implementer of such a policy in Robert Kagan’s wife Victoria Nuland, her extremely dangerous protégé who is currently Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs and who might wind up as Secretary of State in a Clinton Administration. Shifting to East Asia, Hillary sees the admittedly genuine threat from North Korea but her response is focused more on China. She would increase US military presence in the South China Sea to deter any further attempts by Beijing to develop disputed islands and would also “ring China with defensive missiles,” ostensibly as “protection” against Pyongyang but also to convince China to pressure North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. One wonders what Beijing might think about being surrounded by made-in-America missiles. Trump’s foreign policy is admittedly quite sketchy and he has not always been consistent. He has been appropriately enough slammed for being simple minded in saying that he would “bomb the crap out of ISIS,” but he has also taken on the Republican establishment by specifically condemning the George W. Bush invasion of Iraq and has more than once indicated that he is not interested in either being the world’s policeman or in new wars in the Middle East. He has repeatedly stated that he supports NATO but it should not be construed as hostile to Russia. He would work with Putin to address concerns over Syria and Eastern Europe. He would demand that NATO countries spend more for their own defense and also help pay for the maintenance of US bases. Trump’s controversial call to stop all Muslim immigration has been rightly condemned but it contains a kernel of truth in that the current process for vetting new arrivals in this country is far from transparent and apparently not very effective. The Obama Administration has not been very forthcoming on what might be done to fix the entire immigration process but Trump is promising to shake things up, which is overdue, though what exactly a Trump Administration would try to accomplish is far from clear. Continuing on the negative side, Trump, who is largely ignorant of the world and its leaders, has relied on a mixed bag of advisors. Former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Michael Flynn appears to be the most prominent. Flynn is associated with arch neocon Michael Ledeen and both are rabid about Iran, with Flynn suggesting that nearly all the unrest in the Middle East should be laid at Tehran’s door. Ledeen is, of course, a prominent Israel-firster who has long had Iran in his sights. The advice of Ledeen and Flynn may have been instrumental in Trump’s vehement denunciation of the Iran nuclear agreement, which he has called a “disgrace,” which he has said he would “tear up.” It is vintage dumb-think. The agreement cannot be canceled because there are five other signatories to it and the denial of a nuclear weapons program to Tehran benefits everyone in the region, including Israel. It is far better to have the agreement than to scrap it, if that were even possible. Trump has said that he would be an even-handed negotiator between Israel and the Palestinians but he has also declared that he is strongly pro-Israel and would move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, which is a bad idea, not in America’s interest, even if Netanyahu would like it. It would produce serious blowback from the Arab world and would inspire a new wave of terrorism directed against the US Regarding the rest of the Middle East, Trump would prefer strong leaders, i.e. autocrats, who are friendly rather than chaotic reformers. He rejects arming rebels as in Syria because we know little about whom we are dealing with and find that we cannot control what develops. He is against foreign aid in principle, particularly to countries like Pakistan where the US is strongly disliked. In East Asia, Trump would encourage Japan and South Korea to develop their own nuclear arsenals to deter North Korea. It is a very bad idea, a proliferation nightmare. Like Hillary, he would prefer that China intervene in North Korea and make Kim Jong Un “step down.” He would put pressure on China to devalue its currency because it is “bilking us of billions of dollars” and would also increase US military presence in the region to limit Beijing’s expansion in the South China Sea. So there you have it as you enter the voting booth. President Obama is going around warning that “the fate of the world is teetering” over the electoral verdict, which he intends to be a ringing endorsement of Hillary even though the choice is not nearly that clear cut. Part of the problem with Trump is that he has some very bad ideas mixed in with a few good ones and no one knows what he would actually do if he were president. Unfortunately, it is all too clear what Hillary would do. Reprinted with permission from the Unz Review . Related",0
11733,Trey Gowdy Obliterates Critics Of FBI & Delivers Nasty Surprise For Hillary,"Share This 
After the FBI’s Friday announcement that they had reopened their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, many have been quick to attack director James Comey for the timing of his recent move. However, Trey Gowdy just obliterated the criticisms while also delivering a nasty surprise directly to Hillary herself. 
The Democrats have come unhinged as they watch their candidate sink, with the FBI’s reopened investigation delivering a devastating blow to an already disastrous campaign. In fact, what’s coming out of their mouths as they enter panic mode is almost laughable. Take for instance Howard Dean’s claim that Comey is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin or Harry Reid’s suggestion that director Comey broke the law. 
It’s rather ironic that he’s concerned about Comey following the law while, at the same time, basically suggesting Hillary should get a free pass. In fact, Reid is so concerned about the FBI director’s actions in investigating Hillary Clinton’s criminality that he had the nerve to write Comey, attempting to intimidate him. “I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,” Reid wrote. “Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.” 
Luckily for us, Trey Gowdy was ready to call Reid out for his crap, and of course, it’s all on video for us to enjoy. Watch: 
Gowdy wasn’t falling for the left’s excuses, and he said what we were all thinking. First, he laid into Huma Abedin’s excuse that she didn’t know how her emails could have ended up on a device she says belongs to her husband. As Gowdy points out, there aren’t that many ways it could happen, but it’s rather irrelevant since that’s not what the FBI is investigating. 
Next, Gowdy took out John Podesta for his “blame the cops” play, and then came the nasty surprise for Hillary. Gowdy reminded viewers that Comey isn’t responsible for a single one of the facts , saying, “ He didn’t tell her to use a private server, he didn’t tell Huma not to turn over all of her devices, and God knows, he didn’t tell Anthony Weiner to send sexually explicit texts to allegedly underage people. ” Gowdy continued to put Hillary on blast, saying “ The timing is a direct and natural consequence of decisions Hillary Clinton made ,” reminding everyone of where our focus and blame should be. But, he wasn’t done there. 
It was then Harry Reid’s turn to feel the Gowdy heat as the senator ripped into Reid’s asinine letter to Comey. “Thank God he’s leaving is my initial reaction,” Gowdy said about Reid before adding, “My second reaction is: I did not know Mormons used drugs, and anyone who is capable of sending out that press release has to be under the influence of something.” 
Then, Gowdy went right back to putting the attention and blame where it needs to be — on Hillary Clinton. “ The person responsible for this fact pattern is Secretary Clinton ,” Gowdy explained. “Jim Comey did not tell her to use her private server. He did not say to mislead the public about whether or not you turned over all of your work emails. And he certainly didn’t say, Secretary Clinton, why don’t you say you neither sent nor received classified information.” 
Trey Gowdy successfully obliterated any critics of the FBI and director James Comey while also delivering Hillary the nasty surprise she deserves. Although she’s used to skirting consequences, she has no one to blame for what’s happening besides herself, and it’s nice to see that there are those in Washington, D.C., who are more than willing to wrap up some personal accountability and drop it directly into the presidential candidate’s lap. Timing wouldn’t be an issue if her own actions didn’t lead our entire country down this path. Hillary Clinton has no one but herself to blame for what she’s facing. As for timing, now maybe Mrs. Clinton has a little idea what it’s like to be aborted just days before delivery.",0

Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 This woman is looking haggard af. Botta start calling her Merkel Haggard. New song for refugees refusing deportation: “I think I’ll just stay here and drink, riot, rape, sell drugs and commit acts of terrorism (allah akbar remix)” 
There comes a time in the life of every brutal totalitarian psychopath that they just have to lash out against everyone and everything, demand it all be shut down. 
RT : 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a broadside at internet media giants, accusing them of ânarrowing perspective,â and demanding they disclose their privately-developed algorithms. Merkel previously blamed social media for anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right. 
âThe algorithms must be made public, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like: what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others?” said Merkel during a media conference in Berlin on Tuesday. 
âThese algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information.â 
Google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a userâs liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a userâs own media interests. 
I don’t know about Facebook, but Google’s algorithm is worth billions and billions of dollars. The algorithm is why people use Google instead of Bing. If they released the algorithm, it would effectively make their main product – their search engine – valueless, beyond the value of its brand name. 
That’s why it’s not open-source in the first place. Because if they released it, everyone would use it, and their service would no longer have any unique value. 
Asking them to release this “because I said” is completely and totally insane – the demand of a madman who thinks the universe belongs to him. 
These algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website, and comprise some of the most highly-protected trade secrets in the world, potentially worth billions. No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. 
Merkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating âbubblesâ of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. 
“The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users,â warned Merkel. âThis is a development that we need to pay careful attention to.â 
The internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels. 
This is obviously absolutely true, and it’s absolutely why Merkel is throwing a fit. 
She wants media to be limited to approved sources. 
These approved sources still have an extreme amount of control, as we see with the Trump situation, but in order to maintain her multicultural utopia, Angela Merkel needs complete 1984-style control of all information the public has access to. “We’ve always been at war with Russia to protect ISIS, Winston.” 
And that’s control over international (read: American and Russian) media, because in Germany, they can just go arrest anyone who is saying things they don’t like on the internet. They arrest people for Facebook posts. 
This is not the first attack on social media by Merkel and her Grand Coalition government, and while the German politician advocates diversity of views, she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions that are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media. 
Last month, Merkel accused AfD, the recently-established anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party, which receives overwhelmingly negative coverage in most newspapers, of âspreading their liesâ through social media , as it achieves breakthroughs in regional elections around the country. 
A year ago, at the height of the refugee influx into the country, Merkel, who was first elected in 2005, was caught on a hot mic personally pressing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to clamp down on anti-migrant posts during a UN session in New York. 
A fortnight ago, the leader of Merkelâs parliamentary CDU faction, Volker Kauder, said that social media should be fined âŹ50,000 for failing to remove âhate speech,â saying that a âSword of Damoclesâ has to hang over social media. Kauder also called for warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites, to be given to those about to go on social media. 
Justice Minister Heiko Maas â who said that there had been a 77 percent increase in hate crimes following the arrival of 900,000 asylum seekers â has given internet media companies until February next year to comply with EU directives on xenophobia and racism, or face legal action. 
This looks to me like the first huff of the last gasp. 
Mama Merkel tried. 
But Merkel Haggard has lost control. 
Now, she’s about to see the fightin’ side of Germany.",0
11735,"Trump Taps Peter Navarro, Vocal Critic of China, for New Trade Post - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump on Wednesday named a strident China critic, Peter Navarro, to lead a new White House office overseeing American trade and industrial policy, in the latest sign that Mr. Trump is moving to reshape relations between the world’s two largest economies. Mr. Trump also said the billionaire investor Carl Icahn would serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues, another area of economic policy in which the   wants big changes. The appointments reflect Mr. Trump’s ambition to increase economic growth by hammering at what he regards as critical roadblocks. He has promised to expand American manufacturing by reducing federal regulation and by preventing what he has described as unfair competition from Chinese manufacturers. The choices of Mr. Navarro and Mr. Icahn also reflect Mr. Trump’s manifest preference for advisers who are loyal, and who do not have government experience. Mr. Navarro, 67, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who holds a doctorate from Harvard, is the only credentialed economist in Mr. Trump’s inner circle. He is the author of a series of jeremiads, including a 2012 documentary film, “Death by China,” in which an animation of a Chinese knife stabs a map of the United States and causes blood to run freely. Mr. Navarro has said that China is effectively waging an economic war by subsidizing exports to the United States and impeding imports from it. Mr. Trump, influenced by Mr. Navarro’s work, described this on the campaign trail as “the greatest theft in the history of the world. ” Mr. Trump has said he will persuade Beijing to change its policies by applying pressure, including designating China a currency manipulator enforcing existing trade laws more vigorously and, if necessary, imposing a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. In a statement, Mr. Trump described Mr. Navarro as “a visionary economist” and said he would “develop trade policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand our growth and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores. ” A wide range of economists have warned that curtailing trade with China would damage the American economy, forcing consumers to pay higher prices for goods and services. Experts on manufacturing also doubt that the government can significantly increase factory employment, noting that mechanization is the major reason fewer people are working in factories. Mr. Navarro’s appointment reinforces a basic division among Mr. Trump’s economic advisers. The people he has chosen to oversee trade policy, Mr. Navarro and Wilbur Ross, another billionaire investor, both favor increased trade restrictions. But Mr. Trump’s broader circle of advisers is dominated by proponents of free trade, including Mr. Icahn Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, who will lead the National Economic Council Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who was tapped for secretary of state and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, Mr. Trump’s choice for ambassador to China. Mr. Trump is also considering the appointment of Larry Kudlow, a strong proponent of trade, to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Trump has also promised to edit the federal rule book, removing what he has described as overly burdensome restrictions. He said last month that the government would eliminate two regulations for each new rule it put on the books. For Mr. Icahn, who will not draw a salary, the new role formalizes his relationship with Mr. Trump, whom he advised on economic issues throughout the campaign. Mr. Icahn, 80, has no experience in government like a growing number of Mr. Trump’s appointees, he was prized for his success as a businessman. Mr. Icahn, a brash New York billionaire who vocally supported Mr. Trump during the campaign, made his fortune as a “corporate raider,” buying stakes in corporations and demanding changes to reward shareholders. “Carl was with me from the beginning, and with his being one of the world’s great businessmen, that was something I truly appreciated,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “His help on the strangling regulations that our country is faced with will be invaluable. ” Mr. Icahn will also play a role in the selection of a new chairman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator that serves as the referee for his battles with corporations. Mr. Icahn, the child of two New York schoolteachers, was not known for political activism before the 2016 campaign, and he has insisted that he wants to help the country, not himself. But Mr. Trump’s choice of a major corporate investor to play a role in rewriting regulations that could affect those companies renewed concerns about conflicts of interest in the next administration. “The corrupt nature of this arrangement cannot be understated,” Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement about Mr. Icahn’s appointment. “Voters who wanted Trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud. ” Mr. Navarro has built a quiet career as an academic economist, publishing papers on subjects like why businesses give to charity, electricity deregulation and the economics of trash collection. He also mounted four unsuccessful political campaigns as a Democrat between 1992 and 2001, including candidacies for mayor of San Diego and a House seat in Congress. He has said that he started paying attention to China in the early 2000s because he noticed that graduates of the business school at California, Irvine, were starting to lose jobs as a result of globalization. In 2011, he wrote a letter to Mr. Trump about his book “Death by China,” which the movie was based on, and the men began to correspond. Over the past year, Mr. Navarro became an increasingly important campaign adviser on economic issues. But he and Mr. Trump had not met in person until September.",0
11736,"Trump Says Go Back, We Say Fight Back","2016 elections by Robin D.G. Kelley 
The author writes: “I am not suggesting that white racism alone explains Trump’s victory. Nor am I dismissing the white working class’s very real economic grievances. It is not a matter of disaffection versus racism or sexism versus fear. Rather, racism, class anxieties, and prevailing gender ideologies operate together, inseparably, or as Kimberlé Crenshaw would say, intersectionally.” Trump Says Go Back, We Say Fight Back by Robin D.G. Kelley 
This article previously appeared in Boston Review . 
“We need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama’s words, “rooting for [Trump’s] success.” 
“If we are to keep the enormity of the forces aligned against us from establishing a false hierarchy of oppression, we must school ourselves to recognize that any attack against Blacks, any attack against women, is an attack against all of us who recognize that our interests are not being served by the systems we support. Each one of us here is a link in the connection between antipoor legislation, gay shootings, the burning of synagogues, street harassment, attacks against women, and resurgent violence against Black people.” — Audre Lorde, “Learning from the 60s” 
Donald J. Trump’s election was a national trauma, an epic catastrophe that has left millions in the United States and around the world in a state of utter shock, uncertainty, deep depression, and genuine fear. The fear is palpable and justified, especially for those Trump and his acolytes targeted—the undocumented, Muslims, anyone who “looks” undocumented or Muslim, people of color, Jews, the LGBTQ community, the disabled, women, activists of all kinds (especially Black Lives Matter and allied movements resisting state-sanctioned violence), trade unions. . . . the list is long. And the attacks have begun; as I write these words, reports of hate crimes and racist violence are flooding my inbox. 
The common refrain is that no one expected this. (Of course, the truth is that many people did expect this, just not in the elite media.) At no point, this refrain goes, could “we” imagine Trump in the Oval office surrounded by a cabinet made up of some of the most idiotic, corrupt, and authoritarian characters in modern day politics—Rudolph Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, John Bolton, Ben Carson, Jeff Sessions, David “Blue Lives Matter” Clarke, Joe Arpaio, to name a few. Meanwhile, paid professional pundits are scrambling to peddle their analyses and to normalize the results—on the same broadcast media that helped deliver Trump’s victory by making him their ratings-boosting spectacle rather than attending to issues, ideas, and other candidates (e.g., Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein). They deliver the same old platitudes: disaffected voters, angry white men who have suffered economically and feel forgotten, Trump’s populist message represented the nation’s deep-seated distrust of Washington, ad infinitum. Some liberal pundits have begun to speak of President-Elect Trump as thoughtful and conciliatory, and some even suggest that his unpredictability may prove to be an asset. The protests are premature or misplaced. All of this from the same folks who predicted a Clinton victory. 
“Trump’s followers are attracted to his wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is ‘great’ again.” 
But the outcome should not have surprised us. This election was, among other things, a referendum on whether the United States will be a straight, white nation reminiscent of the mythic “old days” when armed white men ruled, owned their castle, boasted of unvanquished military power, and everyone else knew their place. Henry Giroux’s new book America at War With Itself made this point with clarity and foresight two months before the election. The easy claim that Trump appeals to legitimate working-class populism driven by class anger, Giroux argues, ignores both the historical link between whiteness, citizenship, and humanity, and the American dream of wealth accumulation built on private property. Trump’s followers are not trying to redistribute the wealth, nor are they all “working class”—their annual median income is about $72,000. On the contrary, they are attracted to Trump’s wealth as metonym of an American dream that they, too, can enjoy once America is “great” again—which is to say, once the country returns to being “a white MAN’s country.” What Giroux identifies as “civic illiteracy” keeps them convinced that the descendants of unfree labor or the colonized, or those who are currently unfree, are to blame for America’s decline and for blocking their path to Trump-style success. 
For the white people who voted overwhelmingly for Trump, their candidate embodied the anti-Obama backlash. Pundits who say race was not a factor point to rural, predominantly white counties that went for Obama in 2008 and 2012, but now went for Trump, and to the low black and Latinx voter turnout. However, turnout was down overall, not just among African Americans. Post-election analysis shows that as a percentage of total votes the black vote dropped only 1 percent compared with the 2012 election, even while the number of black ballots counted decreased by nearly 11 percent. (Why this happened is beyond the scope of this essay, but one might begin with Greg Palast’s findings about voter suppression and the use of “crosscheck” to invalidate ballots.) Moreover, claims that nearly a third of Latinxs went for Trump have been disputed by the website Latino Decision, whose careful research puts the figure at 18 percent. The turnout does not contradict the fact that Trump drew the clear majority of white votes. This is not startling news. 
“We cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy.” 
If history is our guide, “whitelash” usually follows periods of expanded racial justice and democratic rights. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, there were many instances in which southern white men switched from the biracial, abolitionist Republicans to the “redeemers,” whether it be the Democrats or, in states like Texas, the “White Man’s Party.” (No ambiguity there.) Or in the 1880s and ’90s, when white Populists betrayed their Black Populist allies in a united struggle to redistribute railroad land grants to farmers, reduce debt by inflating currency, abolish private national banks, nationalize railroads and telegraphs, and impose a graduated income tax to shift the burden onto the wealthy, among other things. Many of these one-time white “allies” joined the Ku Klux Klan, defeated the Lodge Force Bill of 1890 which would have authorized federal supervision of elections to protect black voting rights, and led the efforts to disfranchise black voters. Or the late 1960s, when vibrant struggles for black, brown, American Indian, Asian American, gay and lesbian, and women’s liberation, the anti-war movement, and student demands for a democratic revolution were followed by white backlash and the election of Richard Nixon—whose rhetoric of “law and order” and the “silent majority” Trump shamelessly plagiarized. 
Of course, Hilary Clinton did win the popular vote, and some are resorting to the easy lament that, were it not for the arcane Electoral College (itself a relic of slave power), we would not be here. One might add, too, that had it not been for the gutting of the Voting Rights Act opening the door for expanded strategies of voter suppression, or the permanent disfranchisement of some or all convicted felons in ten states, or the fact that virtually all people currently in cages cannot vote at all, or the persistence of misogyny in our culture, we may have had a different outcome. This is all true. But we cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of white men and a majority of white women, across class lines, voted for a platform and a message of white supremacy, Islamophobia, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-science, anti-Earth, militarism, torture, and policies that blatantly maintain income inequality. The vast majority of people of color voted against Trump, with black women registering the highest voting percentage for Clinton of any other demographic (93 percent). It is an astounding number when we consider that her husband’s administration oversaw the virtual destruction of the social safety net by turning welfare into workfare, cutting food stamps, preventing undocumented workers from receiving benefits, and denying former drug felons and users access to public housing; a dramatic expansion of the border patrol, immigrant detention centers, and the fence on Mexico’s border; a crime bill that escalated the war on drugs and accelerated mass incarceration; as well as NAFTA and legislation deregulating financial institutions. 
Still, had Trump received only a third of the votes he did and been defeated, we still would have had ample reason to worry about our future. 
“White privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can’t be named.” 
I am not suggesting that white racism alone explains Trump’s victory. Nor am I dismissing the white working class’s very real economic grievances. It is not a matter of disaffection versus racism or sexism versus fear. Rather, racism, class anxieties, and prevailing gender ideologies operate together, inseparably, or as Kimberlé Crenshaw would say, intersectionally. White working-class men understand their plight through a racial and gendered lens. For women and people of color to hold positions of privilege or power over them is simply unnatural and can only be explained by an act of unfairness—for example, affirmative action. White privilege is taken for granted to the point where it need not be named and can’t be named. So, as activist/scholar Bill Fletcher recently observed, even though Trump’s call to deport immigrants, close the borders, and reject free trade policies appealed to working-class whites’ discontent with the effects of globalization, Trump’s plans do not amount to a rejection of neoliberalism. Fletcher writes, “Trump focused on the symptoms inherent in neoliberal globalization, such as job loss, but his was not a critique of neoliberalism. He continues to advance deregulation, tax cuts, anti-unionism, etc. He was making no systemic critique at all, but the examples that he pointed to from wreckage resulting from economic and social dislocation, resonated for many whites who felt, for various reasons, that their world was collapsing.” Yet Fletcher is quick not to reduce white working-class support for Trump to class fears alone, adding, “This segment of the white population was looking in terror at the erosion of the American Dream, but they were looking at it through the prism of race.” 
A New York Times poll shows that Trump supporters identified immigration and terrorism, not the economy, as the two most important issues in the campaign. Immigration and terrorism are both about race—Mexicans and Muslims. That there are “illegal” immigrants from around the globe, including Canada, Israel, and all over Europe doesn’t matter: anti-immigrant movements target those who can be racially profiled. And while Trump’s America fears “terrorism,” it does not disavow homegrown terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, despite the fact that white nationalist movements are responsible for the majority of violent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. On the contrary, Trump was not only endorsed by white nationalists and U.S.-based fascists, but during the campaign he refused to renounce their support, and Trump’s leading candidate for attorney general, Rudy Giuliani, has openly called Black Lives Matter “terrorists.” 
So where do we go from here? If we really care about the world, our country, and our future, we have no choice but to resist. We need to reject a thoroughly bankrupt Democratic Party leadership that is calling for conciliation and, in Obama’s words, “rooting for [Trump’s] success.” Pay attention: Trump’s success means mass deportation; massive military spending; the continuation and escalation of global war; a conservative Supreme Court poised to roll back Roe v. Wade, marriage equality, and too many rights to name here; a justice department and FBI dedicated to growing the Bush/Obama-era surveillance state and waging COINTELPRO-style war on activists; fiscal policies that will accelerate income inequality; massive cuts in social spending; the weakening or elimination of the Affordable Care Act; and the partial dismantling and corporatization of government. 
What must resistance look like? There are at least five things we have to do right now: 
1. Build up the sanctuary movement. 
In the 1980s, when nearly one million refugees fled U.S.-backed dictatorships in Guatemala and El Salvador, churches offered shelter, sanctuary, and assistance to those seeking political asylum, and over thirty cities were subsequently designated “sanctuary cities” by their local governments. The Obama administration’s deportations of undocumented workers rebooted the sanctuary movement, along with a vibrant immigrant rights movement that pushed the president to use executive authority to launch the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). Trump has vowed to end both programs, leaving some five million immigrants vulnerable to deportation and identifiable through their applications, and he has promised to immediately cut all federal funding for sanctuary cities. To those who argue that millions of undocumented people are not “political refugees,” I counter that Trump’s war on immigrants is driven entirely by his quest to take power—they will become casualties of his political machinations. Some states have already outlawed the longstanding principle of sanctuary status, but this should not deter us from strengthening and expanding the sanctuary movement to other institutions. For example, many of us who work in the University of California system are working to turn our campuses into sanctuaries—preferably with legal and administrative backing. But even without the law behind us, we must act on moral principle. 
2. Defend all of our targeted communities. 
We must defend against hate crimes, Islamophobia, anti-black racism, attacks on queer and trans people, and the erosion of reproductive rights. There is no need to reinvent the wheel since there are already hundreds of organizations across the country dedicated to the fight, including INCITE: Women of Color Against Violence, Radical Women, the Immigrant Solidarity Network, the Praxis Project, the Praxis Center, CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), the African American Policy Forum, the Network Against Islamophobia, and Causa Justa, to name only a few. One of the main targets of attack, of course, is the Movement for Black Lives, along with the dozens of organizations upon which it was built—Black Lives Matter, the Dream Defenders, Million Hoodies, Black Youth Project 100, Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, We Charge Genocide, and Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity (BOLD), among others. We need to support these movements and institutions, financially and by doing the work. And we must defend the political and cultural spaces that enable us to plot, plan, build community and sustain social movements. Here in Los Angeles this means spaces such as the L.A. Black Workers Center, the Labor/Community Strategy Center and its new community space, Strategy and Soul, the L.A. Community Action Network, the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research, the Community Coalition, and Revolutionary Autonomous Communities, among many others. In New York we can point to Decolonize This Place; in Detroit, the Boggs Center; in St. Louis, Organization for Black Struggle, and so on. There are literally hundreds of centers around the country building for local power, and while none were immune to state surveillance in the past, we can expect heightened monitoring and outright attacks under this extreme right-wing regime. Now is not the time to retreat to our identity silos. We need solidarity more than ever, recognizing that all solidarities are imperfect, often fragile, temporary, and always forged in struggle and sustained through hard work. In our state of emergency, political disagreements, slights, misunderstandings, and microaggressions should not prohibit us from fighting for peoples rights, privileges, and lives. 
3. Stop referring to the South as a political backwater, a distinctive site of racist right-wing reaction. 
First, white supremacy, homophobia, and anti-union attitudes are national, not regional, problems. Second, black and multiracial groups in the South are at the forefront of resisting Trump’s authoritarian agenda and building power outside the mainstream Democratic Party. Among them are Project South, Southerners on New Ground (SONG), the Moral Mondays Movement, Kindred: Southern Healing Justice Collective, Jackson Rising in Mississippi, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) in Louisville, Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta, and the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. 
The frontline battles that preceded Trump’s election must not be abandoned. On the contrary, they need to be strengthened. We must redouble our fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline and support the Standing Rock Sioux Nation’s historic resistance. There is no question that Trump’s election has further empowered the corporation behind the pipeline—the Texas-based Fortune 500 company Energy Transfer Partners—to continue to build no matter what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Obama Justice Department says. We need to recognize Standing Rock as not only a struggle for environmental justice but an episode in Native people’s five-hundred-year resistance to colonialism. And speaking of colonialism, the crisis in Puerto Rico has not abated—not in the least. As I write, Puerto Ricans on the island and in the U.S. mainland are using every means at their disposal to resist PROMESA, the U.S. plan that empowers a seven-member, unelected board to impose austerity measures as a way of restructuring its debt—measures that include wage reductions, selling off public assets, altering retirement plans for public employees, and fast-tracking changes even if they violate existing laws. 
4. Support and deepen the anti-Klan and anti-fascist movement. 
We must especially support groups such as Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been on the frontlines of this movement for decades. Although the fight against white supremacist organizations has been continual since the 1860s, the federal government has never successfully outlawed the Klan and similar vigilante groups (although in the 1950s the state of Alabama succeeded in outlawing the NAACP). With Trump’s election we are likely to see a surge in white nationalist and other right-wing terrorism, including attacks on black churches, synagogues, mosques, abortion clinics; and against non-white, queer, and trans people and immigrants. Some on the left will argue that resisting the so-called “alt-right” is a secondary issue since these are fringe movements and building class unity across racial lines ought to be our priority. But with the memory of Colorado Springs and Charleston seared into our memory, this argument rings hollow. And while President Obama’s poignant rendition of “Amazing Grace” at Reverend Clementa Pinckney’s funeral moved much of the nation, the truth is that it is easier to pass laws criminalizing organizations that support the boycott of businesses and institutions complicit in Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestine than it is to outlaw the Ku Klux Klan. 
5. Rebuild the labor movement. 
As obvious as this may seem, the entire labor movement is under attack on a global scale. Today labor unions are portrayed as corrupt, bloated, a drain on the economy, and modern-day cartels that threaten workers’ “liberty.” Corporations and the CEOs who run them are portrayed as the most efficient and effective mode of organization. In our neoliberal age, emergency financial managers are sent in to replace elected government during real or imagined economic crises; charter schools organized along corporate lines are replacing public schools; universities are being restructured along corporate lines with presidents increasingly functioning like CEOs; and a businessman with a checkered record, a history of improprieties and legal violations and allegations of sexual assault, and no experience whatsoever in government is elected president. 
Today’s economic debates focus not on alternatives to capitalism but on what kind of capitalism—capitalism with a safety net for the poor or one driven by extreme free-market liberalization? A capitalism in which the state’s role is to bail out big banks and financial institutions, or one where the state imposes (or rather restores) greater regulation in order to avoid economic crises? In both of these scenarios, a weakened labor movement is a given. The once-powerful unions are doing little more than fighting to restore basic collective bargaining rights and deciding how much they are going to give back. Union leaders are struggling just to participate in crafting austerity measures. In the New Deal era, the state’s efforts to save capitalism centered on Keynesian strategies of massive state expenditures in infrastructure, job creation, a social safety net in the form of direct aid and social security, and certain protections for the right of unions to organize. All these measures were made possible by a strong labor movement. There was a level of militant organization that we did not see in our post-2008 collapse, in spite of Occupy Wall Street. While Occupy was massive, international, and built on preexisting social justice movements, it lacked the kind of institutional power base and political clout that organized labor had in the 1930s. Of course, labor unions have also been powerful engines of racial and gender exclusion, working with capital to impose glass ceilings and racially segmented wages, but the twenty-first-century labor movement has largely embraced principles of social justice, antiracism, immigrant rights, and cross-border strategies. 
“I am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness.” 
Obviously there is much missing here, like abolishing the Electoral College and continuing to wage a fight for local power in the legislative and electoral arenas as well as in the streets. Local campaigns to raise the minimum wage, for example, have not only produced key victories but served to mobilize people around issues of injustice and inequality. The sites of resistance will become clearer as the political situation becomes more concrete, especially after January 20. 
But I want to return to the white working class and how we might break the cycle of “whitelash.” First, we cannot change this country without winning over some portion of white working people, and I am not talking about gaining votes for the Democratic Party. I am talking about opening a path to freeing white people from the prison house of whiteness. True, with whiteness comes privilege, but many of the perceived privileges are inaccessible to most, which then generates resentment. Exposing whiteness for what it is—a foundational myth for the birth and consolidation of capitalism—is fundamental if we are to build a genuine social movement dedicated to dismantling the oppressive regimes of racism, heteropatriarchy, empire, and class exploitation that is at the root of inequality, precarity, materialism, and violence in many forms. I am not suggesting we ignore their grievances, but that we help white working people understand the source of their discontent—real and imagined. 
Is this possible? The struggle to recruit the white working class is an old story. Black movement leaders have been trying to free white working people from the paltry wages of whiteness since Reconstruction, at least, and it seems to always end badly. This history is not necessarily legible because we tend to conflate populism and fascism with what Henry Giroux astutely identifies as authoritarianism. Populism is the idea that ordinary people ought to have the power to control their government and their communities, especially along lines that benefit the collective. In the 1880s and ’90s, the black populist movement adopted a vision of a new society based on cooperative economics. The great writer and activist Timothy Thomas Fortune gave their unique vision eloquent voice and plans for action in his book Black and White: Land, Labor and Politics in the South (1884), which offered a path for the emancipation of the nation as a whole, not just black people. He attacked America’s betrayal of Reconstruction, identified monopoly and private ownership of land as the central source of inequality, and articulated a vision of a democratic, caring political economy based on equity and fairness. The National Colored Alliance members had advanced beyond printing more money or demanding free silver, adopting instead a more radical redistribution of wealth and power. They wanted more than a short-term alliance just to raise wages for picking cotton or reducing debt. But Fortune understood that a genuine cooperative commonwealth is not possible unless white workers and farmers join the movement. “The hour is approaching,” he wrote, “when the laboring classes of our country, North, East, West and South, will recognize that they have a common cause, a common humanity and a common enemy; and that, therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or of previous condition they must unite!” Whatever unity they managed to create proved ephemeral. As in so many other scenarios, most whites chose white supremacy over liberation. 
The lessons here are crucial. We cannot build a sustainable movement without a paradigm shift. Stopgap, utilitarian alliances to stop Trump aren’t enough. I concur with Giroux, who calls on all of us to wage “an anti-fascist struggle that is not simply about remaking economic structures, but also about refashioning identities, values, and social relations as part of a democratic project that reconfigures what it means to desire a better and more democratic future.” Robin Davis Gibran Kelley is the Gary B.

11738,"It’s Donald Trump’s Inauguration, But the Establishment Still Acts Like He’s the Party Crasher - Breitbart","Donald J. Trump gave the   sign upon making his way to the Western balcony of the Capitol on Friday. Some took it as a middle finger. [Barack Obama looked like he had just watched the end of The Sixth Sense for the first time when he saw his successor arrive. The woman he long expected to see, Hillary Clinton, displayed symptoms of really, really needing a Prozac. Bill Clinton’s smile came across as slightly more real than Chuck Schumer’s hair. Even George W. Bush appeared more amused than enthused.  The baton passed not so much from a Democrat to a Republican on Friday as from the establishment to the great unwashed. Just as Trump’s   followers imagined their champion as a   billionaire, as though such a thing existed, his   detractors regarded the   mogul and   star as an uncouth outsider. Even though the new First Lady makes all her predecessors look like that lady in American Gothic by comparison, Trump strangely represents the pitchfork people. Trump got into the role during his inaugural address, which put an end to eight long years in 17 short minutes. “For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,” the new president explained. “Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories, their triumphs have not been your triumphs. ” Certainly Trump’s triumph was not their triumph. It showed on the blank faces of the powerful and the blank spaces on the national mall. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow juxtaposed Barack Obama’s inauguration boasting people as far as the eye can see with Trump’s crowd failing to extend to the Washington Monument. She didn’t mention that Washington, D. C. favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump 91 percent to four percent on Election Day. Nor did she speak of the local welcome wagon, which on Inauguration Eve gored Trump supporters with flagpoles and read “Make America Great Again” on hats as “Please Throw a Battery at Me. ” Sometimes watching at home is the better part of valor. The cameras didn’t capture 44’s face when 45 lamented that “we’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own,” or 43’s face when 45 noted that the federal government “spent trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. ” One imagines they grimaced, at least on the inside. It’s not merely that the new president announced a break with their policies on the most public stage possible. The very fact of him taking the oath of office directly derived from their policies. The people who most despise President Trump bear the most responsibility for President Trump. From Melania Trump effortlessly scaling the Capitol steps in   heels to the clouds opening up when her husband enjoyed his grand moment to T. C. choppering the Obamas out of the spotlight, the first day of the Trump presidency offered a surreal quality, amplified for the bigwigs on the balcony long deluding themselves that the   owns inaugurations. As the new occupant of the Oval Office reminded, “January 20th, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. ” Some people liked the sound of that less than others.",0
11739,Pence: Trump ’Seriously Considering’ Moving Embassy to Jerusalem - Breitbart,"TEL AVIV  —   President Donald Trump is still “seriously considering” moving the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday. [Speaking at an event in Washington marking Israel’s Independence Day, Pence said “the president of the United States, as we speak, is giving serious consideration to moving the American embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem” according to White House transcripts.  He noted Trump’s unwavering support of the Jewish state, citing as evidence of this the appointment of David Friedman  —   who was in attendance at the event  —   as U. S. ambassador to Israel as well as Nikki Haley’s appointment as U. S. ambassador to the United Nations. Trump first made the embassy transfer pledge during his election campaign, heralding a break from decades of U. S. policy. Trump is slated to visit Israel at the end of May, coinciding with Jerusalem Day, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem in the 1967 defensive war. As Breitbart Jerusalem reported last month, the visit also comes ahead of the June 1 expiration of a congressional mandate to move the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which has been extended each year since 1995. A State Department spokesman declined to comment on whether Trump would renew the waiver come June. Trump refused to comment directly on whether he would use the visit to announce an embassy move, telling Reuters in a recent interview: “Ask me in a month on that. ” In his remarks on Tuesday, Pence called the founding of the Jewish state in 1948 “nothing short of a miracle. ” “The people of Israel have turned hope into a future of security and prosperity,” he said. Pence added that “under President Donald Trump, let me assure you this, if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this  —   America stands with Israel. Her cause is our cause. Her values are our values. Her fight is our fight. ”",0
11740,Back Channel to Trump: Loyal Aide in Trump Tower Acts as Gatekeeper - The New York Times,"“Hey Rhona!” Donald J. Trump screamed from behind his desk on the 26th floor of Trump Tower one day last summer, before he won the presidency. Moments later, Rhona Graff, Mr. Trump’s longtime executive assistant, popped in from her adjacent corner office. “How long have you worked for me, Rhona?” Mr. Trump asked. “A couple of dozen years  —   I was 10 years old at the time  —   I was a child prodigy,” Ms. Graff joked. “Mr. Trump discovered me. ” “Many of the people who are with me have been with me for a long time,” Mr. Trump explained. In business, as a candidate and now as president, Mr. Trump has valued loyalty as the defining attribute in family, aides or Republicans in Congress. He does not always get it, as the defection of the Freedom Caucus last week on the health bill he was trying to pass made abundantly clear. But Mr. Trump can always count on Ms. Graff’s allegiance, and that has made Ms. Graff, from her office in Trump Tower, a major figure in the operations of the White House for a simple reason: She is believed to have a direct line to the president. With her deep Queens accent and unerring deference to her boss (she has always referred to him as Mr. Trump or, usually, as Mr. T) Ms. Graff, 64, is a familiar voice to New York’s business leaders, the nation’s political reporters and now old associates hoping to circumvent the normal channels of communication to reach Mr. Trump. Ms. Graff is a senior vice president of the Trump Organization, and her unofficial role as a back channel to the president raises questions about whether Mr. Trump is skirting the Federal Records Act, which governs the preservation of schedules and correspondence from the president, something the White House denied in response to questions about her role from Politico. Reached on Sunday, Ms. Graff declined to comment. “I like staying behind the scenes,” she said in a conversation last year in which she rejected a reporter’s proposal to shadow her for a day because so much private campaign, business and personal information crossed her desk. “We’re so intertwined when he’s here,” she said. Or, as she once put it to Real Estate Weekly, “Everybody knows in order to get through to him they have to go through me. ” Ms. Graff, a Queens College graduate with a master’s degree in psychology, left a sports marketing job after college to spend more time at home with her ailing mother. Eventually in search of another job, she heard about an opening in Mr. Trump’s office, and in 1987 called cold. They hit it off. Since entering the Trump Organization’s secretarial pool, Ms. Graff has acted as Mr. Trump’s media liaison, scheduler, sometimes spokeswoman,   planner, “Apprentice”   and Miss Teen USA judge. And regardless of who is taking Mr. Trump’s calls in Washington, it is Ms. Graff who occupies a more central space in the Trump orbit. In 1991, during Mr. Trump’s brush with going broke, it was Ms. Graff, “my very loyal secretary,” as he put it in “The Art of the Comeback,” who came into his office to tell him that his estranged wife, Ivana, was on the phone with the message, as he put it in the book, “I vant my money now. ” In 1993, Mayor David N. Dinkins presided at the wedding of Ms. Graff to Lucius Joseph Riccio, the city’s transportation commissioner, and later nicknamed Professor Pothole by The New Yorker for pioneering the field of pothole analytics at Columbia University. For decades, Ms. Graff worked under the tutelage of Mr. Trump’s longtime personal assistant, Norma Infante Foerderer, who died in 2013 from a heart attack after a difficult eye surgery. “She’d still be here if she didn’t have that problem,” Ms. Graff lamented in Mr. Trump’s office last year. “A disaster,” Mr. Trump agreed. But by 2005, the year Ms. Foerderer retired, Ms. Graff was already ascendant in an office that loomed large among the nation’s secretaries. (A poll of secretaries by a staple company showed that Mr. Trump trailed only President George W. Bush when it came to the country’s imagined toughest bosses.) In 2004, Ms. Graff became a recurring character on “The Apprentice,” and in 2008, she was briefly listed as the secretary for a luxury golf course in Scotland before a Trump confidant, George Sorial, replaced her. In 2013, she attained boldfaced name status in Page Six of The New York Post as “Donald Trump’s right hand. ” Since Mr. Trump has technically stopped running the Trump Organization, Ms. Graff now forwards messages to Mr. Trump’s personal assistant in the White House, Madeleine Westerhout, whom Ms. Graff helped train. Sometimes she forwards messages to Katie Walsh, one of the deputy chiefs of staff a White House spokeswoman maintained that messages are routinely sent to an official point of contact, instead of directly to the president. Mr. Trump’s dedication to his secretary and hers to him is much like the relationship Fred C. Trump, his father, had with his secretary, Amy Luerssen, treating her like family. He once had workers carry her up 12 flights of stairs when her elevator stopped working, lent her nephew his wife’s pink Cadillac when his car was stolen and would see her off at the airport when she went on a trip. When Ms. Luerssen’s niece, Kathy Quigley, tried to bring her aging aunt down to Florida, she said Donald Trump and his brother, Robert, insisted that Ms. Luerssen stay until she was senile. “It was a little bit of a battle because I was thinking, ‘Gee, I’d really like her to be down here with me,’” Ms. Quigley said. “But she was very happy. ” When her aunt died in 2006, a death notice appeared in The New York Times that read, “The Trump family mourns the passing of our beloved Amy, a trusted and loyal friend and employee for over 65 years. ” Mr. Trump compared his father’s dedication to Ms. Luerssen to his own loyalty to Ms. Graff. “My father was very loyal to people,” he said last summer. “I think I am too. ” Ms. Graff was clearly touched. “Well thank you boss,” she said. “Well it works both ways obviously. I’d never leave him. ”",0

11743,A Trump Supporter Just Held Six Children At Gunpoint For Dumbest Reason Ever,"Comments 
From Hillary Clinton on the electric chair to African-American effigies hung from trees , Trump supporters are clearly very passionate about their lawn displays. Add to the list a 56 year-old Michigan Man who is now facing felony weapons charges after holding six children – ages 12 to 14 – at gunpoint and forcing them to the ground for allegedly knocking down his Trump yard sign. 
That’s right. The kids were terrorized at gun point over a Trump yard sign. 
Michael Kubek, 56, of Allen Park, MI, said that he was angry at the children because he believed they had ‘vandalized’ his Trump sign, although he hadn’t actually seen them do it. The children told the police that they were simply walking to a local park when an unhinged Kubek “pulled out a pistol and ordered them to sit down on a neighbor’s lawn.” In any case, it appears that the ‘vandalism’ consisted in the sign simply being knocked down – perhaps Kubek should take out his anger on the wind – and the children were reportedly “traumatized” by the experience. 
When police, who were called to the scene by Kubek’s mother, arrived, they found the children lying on the grass with Kubek “standing over them yelling and cursing.” The children said he had pointed a gun at them and a neighbor described Kubek using “very profane language.” According to local news channel Fox 2, “the kids said they tried to tell Kubek they did not damage his sign, but it only resulted with Kubek telling them to shut up and continue cursing at them.” 
Kubek claims he felt “threatened” because he was “outnumbered” by the adolescents and invoked his second amendment right. Luckily, he was arrested by local police and had his gun confiscated — although he has now been released on a $5,000 bail. 
Just another day in Trump’s America, folks. Hopefully, the nightmare will be over soon…",0
11744,"The American Way: Socialism for the Rich, Free Enterprise for the Rest","Donate The American Way: Socialism for the Rich, Free Enterprise for the Rest 'It is political decisions, not invisible hands, that dictate the functioning of the market.' (Photo: Fed Up/Steve McFarland Photography) By Jake Johnson / commondreams.org 
While it's not entirely clear who coined the phrase ""socialism for the rich, free enterprise for the rest,"" its ability to provoke — and, more importantly, to describe — is beyond question. 
There are numerous variations on the saying , but each articulates a reality of which we are all, in some way, aware: The bankers who wrecked the economy, for instance, understood that they would be subjected to a different set of rules than those they were scamming with subprime mortgages . While the former have enjoyed the fruits of a bailout and an uneven recovery , those deeply harmed by the crash have struggled to regain anything resembling stability. 
Matt Taibbi has termed this systemic disparity "" the divide ""— and as the divide between the rich and the poor, between the influential and the voiceless, expands, the economic order morphs to fit the resulting power dynamic. 
Thanks to Citizens United and other Supreme Court decisions that have vanquished the firewall that previously separated — however tenuously and ineffectively — corporations from the political process, the ""winners"" have been able to seamlessly convert their tremendous wealth into tremendous political influence. As recent scholarship has demonstrated, they usually get what they want. 
To call this socialism for the rich is to say that those at the top of the income distribution accrue all of the benefits and sympathies of the state, including, of course, a robust welfare apparatus . Their relationship with the state, furthermore, is effectively democratic; the views of the wealthiest are reflected in public policy. 
Those outside of this privileged class, meanwhile, are forced to endure the strictures of market discipline; when they face difficult circumstances, they are lectured , not assisted. Their views are not permitted to influence public policy; they suffer what they must. 
What does such a state of affairs mean for the prospects of those struggling for a more egalitarian future ? The title, as well as the substance, of economist Dean Baker's latest book does much to diagnose the severity of the problems progressive and radical movements face, even if it doesn't fully answer the question. 
In Rigged: How Globalization and the Rules of the Modern Economy Were Structured to Make the Rich Richer , as in his other work, Baker doesn't tiptoe, nor does he resort to jargon when plain language will do. He comes right out with it: The rich have rigged the economy, and we're all paying for it. 
In the age of Piketty — and, indeed, in the age of Bernie Sanders, whose presidential campaign brought the notion of a rigged economy to the national stage — this is not a particularly radical claim, but it has radical implications. It suggests, in short, what we already know: That far from advocating hands-off government, the rich simply want to have their own hands, and no one else's, on the rule-making apparatus. It appears that they have achieved this goal. 
George Orwell once observed that ""economic laws do not operate in the same way as the law of gravity""; that is, in effect, the central point of Baker's study. There is nothing natural about the upward redistribution of wealth we have seen over the last several decades, nor is such redistribution the result of any mystical forces beyond our comprehension or control. 
Rather, as Baker makes clear, the rules were written with this end in mind. 
""The gainers in the top 1 percent,"" he writes, ""have structured the market over the last four decades in ways that increase their share of income."" 
Systematically, Baker lays out the ways in which the wealthy are simultaneously shielded from the worst of globalization and lavished with the spoils. 
Much of the professional class, he observes, has not faced the competition that has so ravaged blue-collar workers in the United States: American doctors, for instance, have not been forced to compete with the doctors of India or Western Europe, who earn far less . The result is ""bloated"" incomes for American doctors — and the same is true of lawyers, dentists, and, indeed, the very pundits who ""earn comfortable six-figure salaries"" while ""remarking on the narrow-mindedness and sense of entitlement of manufacturing workers."" Meanwhile, wages remain stagnant for everyone else . 
That high-income professionals are protected from competition ""has nothing to do with the inherent dynamics of globalization: it is about the differences in the power of these groups."" 
""Bloated,"" also, is the pay of CEOs , which is determined not by ""market forces"" or by performance , but by a board of directors who, Baker notes, have ""little incentive to hold down pay."" 
""Directors are more closely tied to top management than to the shareholders they are supposed to represent,"" Baker adds, and they ""are almost never voted out by shareholders for their lack of attention to the job or for incompetence. The market discipline that holds down the pay of ordinary workers does not apply to CEOs, since their friends determine their pay."" 
Baker points also to the ""government-granted monopolies""— patents and copyright protections — that ""impose substantial costs on the public."" As recent scandals have made clear, this is particularly the case in the pharmaceutical industry. 
""In the case of prescription drugs alone the cost is in the neighborhood of $380 billion a year (equal to 2.0 percent of GDP),"" Baker observes. ""Washington is filled with politicians and organizations that hyperventilate about government debt and the burden it imposes on our children, but they ignore the burdens imposed by patent and copyright monopolies granted by the government."" 
In short, it is political decisions, not invisible hands, that dictate the functioning of the market. And from trade policy designed for the benefit of capital and rich nations to the rapid deregulation and growth of the financial sector, these political decisions have disproportionately rewarded economic elites at everyone else's expense. 
Baker's analysis provides much reason for pessimism: Wealth and political power are concentrated to such an extent that it will be difficult to force systemic change. It is unsurprising, then, that Baker qualifies his own proposals — from a move toward full employment to taxation of financial transactions — with the refrain, ""this is not likely to happen anytime soon,"" given the power of those who benefit from the maintenance of the status quo. 
But implicit is also reason for hope: That such concentration of economic and political power is not a natural state of affairs means that it can be radically altered. 
""Neither God nor nature hands us a worked-out set of rules determining the way property relations are defined, contracts are enforced, or macroeconomic policy is implemented,"" Baker writes. ""These matters are determined by policy choices. The elites have written these rules to redistribute income upward."" 
The rules, in short, can be rewritten in such a way that promotes the spread of wealth and resources — obscene inequality can be overcome. But Baker is an economist, not a polemicist: Thus it is unsurprising that the words ""class struggle"" do not make an appearance in his study. 
It is perfectly clear, however, that class struggle must be central to the fight for a fundamentally different set of rules: The rich have for decades waged unrelenting class war, and the consequences have been staggering. The mere extraction of concessions from above will not be enough to slacken the power the wealthiest have over the political process. 
""If we are going to change directions,"" notes sociologist Beverly Silver, ""it's going to have to come from a mass political movement, rather than something coming out of capital itself."" 
Thomas Ferguson , the Director of Research at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, largely agrees with this sentiment; systemic change will take an ""uprising on the scale of the New Deal at least,"" he told me in an email, ""combined with some fissures within business, as in that earlier period."" 
Baker's analysis clearly interprets the economic context in which we find ourselves, and it is a context dictated by economic elites. ""Well, of course it's an oligarchy,"" Ferguson told me when I asked him about the popular characterization of the United States as a representative democracy, despite the torrent of corporate money that has for decades flooded the coffers of both major political parties.""The democratic element is vanishingly small at this point."" 
But the point of economic analysis, to adopt Marx's famous saying , is not merely to interpret the world in which we live, but also to change it. To do so, the reasonable proposals offered by Baker must be accompanied by mass politics of the kind Sanders embraced and harnessed to great effect. It must be a politics devoid of the delusions fostered by what Matt Karp has called "" fortress liberalism "": The notion that change trickles down from benevolent leaders. 
It's easy to be dismissive of mass movements, given the strength of the opposition: Far from diminishing under the weight of their own self-produced crises, major corporations continue to expand in both size and influence, making democratic action difficult. 
""But let's not get too gloomy,"" Ferguson urged. ""If you told me two years ago that Bernie Sanders would get hundreds of thousands of votes in many states and win many caucuses against Hillary Clinton, I'd have said you were dreaming.""

It’s worth going to neighborhoods just a bit off the usual path. If you want to spend the day exploring, with a mix of stores and great food, these four neighborhoods will keep you satisfied. ________________________ Sometimes, when you get off the Bedford Avenue stop of the L train in Williamsburg and are bombarded with a crush of people, it seems like every traveler in the world has been told to get over to what’s been hyped as Brooklyn’s coolest neighborhood. But it’s worth heading that way and taking a walk north to Greenpoint, Williamsburg’s less gentrified, untouristy neighbor. You’ll find a   mix of millennials, young families and longtime residents, many of them Polish. There’s an almost tangible sense of community in the neighborhood, in both   businesses and   openings.

If Hillary Clinton wins the election in November, she's going to have a whole lot more to deal with than just typical Commander-in-Chief stuff. 
With the massive Wikileaks dump and the controversial contributions her foundation has benefited from, House Republicans are seriously considering an investigation. 
In fact, she could quickly find herself in the same boat as her husband, with elected officials calling for her impeachment. 
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told NBC News : 
""You're going to still have a clamor for a serious criminal investigation of Mrs. Clinton's conduct with respect to her emails and the [Clinton] Foundation]. There's been no systematic investigation of various issues. 
I know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something that's relevant. 
They see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they don't want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable."" 
Since the FBI recommended no indictment for Hillary Clinton, the call to reopen the case into her email server has been shut down by the Bureau. 
On the other hand, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump isn't satisfied with the outcome. He even wants to go as far to investigate the FBI's investigation if he takes the White House. 
Meanwhile, Judicial Watch has launched an investigation into Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe , whose political organization donated about $500,000 to the campaign coffers of Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of an FBI figurehead who helped provide oversight over the investigation into Clinton's private server.

11747,This is What Legal Weed Will Look Like in California,"This is What Legal Weed Will Look Like in California 
Amidst election madness, a proposition making marijuana legal just passed in California. Here are 10 things you need to know about what that will look like in the golden state. 
Although Californians will be able to possess and grow marijuana immediately if it passes, people will not have a place to legally buy non-medical marijuana until stores become licensed. The state has until January 1, 2018 to begin issuing retail licenses. State officials believe it will take almost a year to develop the regulations that will be applied to those who grow, transport, test, and sell cannabis. 

While some people are happy about this push to legalize marijuana, others worry about high taxation, and placement of the plant in the hands of wealthy corporations. 

Here is an outline of what legal pot will look like in California according to what is outlined in the ballot measure. 

You will have to be an adult to legally smoke weed. 

The Adult Use of Marijuana Act will allow people who are 21 and older to posses, transport, and buy up to 28.5 grams of marijuana for recreational use. 

This expands upon an existing law that allows cannabis to be used for medical purposes. 

The initiative will allow adults to grow and use up to 6 marijuana plants on their property. Medical marijuana patients will still be allowed to possess the amount needed to meet their medical needs, even in excess pf the 28.5 gram limit. 

You can’t smoke weed everywhere. 

You will not be allowed to light up a joint in public areas like sidewalks or in bars. The ballot measure does not allow marijuana to be smoked in public unless it is allowed be local ordinances. 

Marijuana can also not be smoke in areas where state law already prohibits tobacco smoking. 

Fines will be given to those caught smoking weed while driving a motor vehicle, boat, or aircraft. 

There will be fines. 

People who are busted smoking in public will be given a fine up to $100. Those caught smoke in a place where tobacco is also prohibited or near a school will be fined up to $250. 

21 and over. 

It will be prohibited to sell marijuana to non-medical users under the age of 21. Yet, medical marijuana can still be used by people who are under 21. Cannabis products cannot be designed to appeal to children or to easily be confused with commercially sold candy. 

Marijuana products will have to be packaged in child-resistant containers, and pot shops will be prohibited from allowing anyone under the age of 21 on their premises. 

There won’t be weed commercials on TV. 

The marketing of marijuana products to minors is prohibited which means ads will not be allowed to use symbols, language, music, or cartoon characters aimed at appealing to underage people. 

It will not be allowed for marijuana to be advertised on billboards located along an interstate highway or state highway that crosses the border of any other state. Ads will not be allowed within 1,000 feet of day-care centers, schools, playgrounds, or youth centers. 

Since federal law designated marijuana as an illegal drug, federally regulated television and radio will not advertise it. 

If federal law ever changes, Prop 64 includes provisions that require broadcast, cable, radio, print, and digital marketing only to be displayed where at least 71.6% of the audience is expected to be 21 and older. 

If you want to sell weed, tell the state. 

You will need a state license to open a pot shop and to grow weed for others. 

People who grow, process, transport, or sell marijuana must get a state license and pay a fee to cover the cost of the state processing and enforcing the license. 

Businesses will not be allowed to sell marijuana within 600 feet of a school, day care center, or youth center. 

Those running shops must undergo background checks to obtain a state license, and they can be denied if they have felony convictions involving violence, fraud, drug trafficking, or selling drugs to a minor. 

Selling pot? You must abide by these rules. 

The Bureau of Marijuana Control inside the state Department of Consumer Affairs will be given the job of creating, issuing, renewing, and revoking state licenses for the transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of marijuana. 

Marijuana growers will have to get a license from the state Department of Food and Agriculture. Those who want to form businesses to manufacture and test marijuana products will be licensed and overseen by the state Department of Public Health. 

Selling pot without a license will come with penalties and sometimes even jail time. 

Selling marijuana without a license can result in a misdemeanor charge with penalties of up to six months in jail and $500 in fines. 

Engaging in any commercial activity in regard to weed without a license will come with civil penalties of up to three times the amount of the license fee for each violation. 

Marijuana will be taxed. 

Prop 64 will allow the state to impose a 15% tax on the retail sale of marijuana. In addition, the state will be able to levy a cultivation tax on growers of $9.25 per ounce for flowers, and $2.75 per ounce for leaves. 

The measure will also allow cities and counties to impose their own taxes to cover costs of services, including enforcement. 

Medical marijuana patients will be exempt from paying state sales taxes.

11749,Life: 6 Apple-Picking No-No’s To Avoid If You Don’t Want To End Up In The Punishment Orchard,"Email It only takes one misstep to ruin an apple-picking trip for everyone. Why not brush up on these apple-picking rules so you don’t end up in the Punishment Orchard? 
1. Don’t climb the trees: Apple trees are for picking, not climbing! Fail to heed this rule and you might just find yourself stuck in the cruel autumn shadow of the Punishment Orchard. Swinging from a tree branch in the regular orchard won’t seem worth it once you’re lashed to a hayride and dumped in the middle of this sprawling, 100-acre wasteland where the fog never lifts and the apples are all way too hot to pick. 
2. Twist, don’t pull: Heads up: Pulling an apple can inadvertently knock down other fruit and risks damaging the tree. Better to carefully twist the apple upwards than be consigned to the Punishment Orchard’s sea of wet, beige trees with no end in sight. Keep this rule in mind and you will never get trapped in the pitch-black sap oozing out of all the trees, nor will you be driven mad by the winds that constantly whisper a summary of Dale Earnhardt’s death. 
3. Don’t waste fruit: The stench of bleach and pennies will be the surefire sign that your decision to just toss imperfect apples onto the ground of the normal orchard has landed you in the wicked, seething grove of the Punishment Orchard. A chorus of middle-aged men shrouded by crude scarecrow masks will taunt you with their vexing rhyme: “We are the men who have picked before / Your hands are bags, your days no more.” Looking down, condemned travelers will realize the infectious verse has replaced their hands with reusable grocery bags and they can no longer remember important birthdays. 
4. Don’t eat the apples until you’ve paid: You’ll want to pay up-front if you don’t want to wake up in the wicker prison at the base of the Tree of Despair, a beige monstrosity whose sprawling tendrils lie directly under the approach path of the regional airport. You must sit in your atonement basket while the depraved, orphaned children of the Punishment Orchard throw scalding apples at your head as part of one of their simple-minded religious rituals. 
5. Don’t pick outside the designated areas: Follow the clearly posted signs in sunny and cheerful normal orchard and you should be fine! Wanderers will have their names recorded on the Punishment Orchard’s Ledger of Bad Deeds, a shameful blight that nearly cost William Rehnquist his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1971. Then they will be given incorrect directions which will only send them deeper into the bowels of the Punishment Orchard, where the Cider Warden bathes himself in bleach and spare change. Even years after a stay in the Punishment Orchard, the smell of either of these items will send you into a vivid Vietnam flashback, regardless of whether or not you fought in Vietnam. 
6. No running: It’s natural to let the excitement of apple picking get the best of you. Just don’t be surprised if you draw the ire of the Punishment Picker. Setting aside his chisel and cigar, he will take an afternoon off from making sculptures of Mussolini having a great time in order to make a sculpture of you getting stung by a bee. Your cries of remorse will be drowned out by the children of the Punishment Orchard cheering “Gather your coins, friends! The Punishment Man of the forest has taken a day off of sculpting a happy Mussolini in order to immortalize a delinquent being humiliated by a bee!” 
Happy picking!",0
11750,"By One Measure, Health Care Law Is a Record Success - The New York Times","Included among the many uplifting economic numbers released by the Census Bureau on Tuesday was a remarkable one about health insurance in the United States: Only 9. 1 percent of Americans do not have coverage, the lowest level ever recorded by the agency. That figure is down from 13. 3 percent in 2013, before the major provisions of the health care law signed by President Obama went into effect. Another government study, released last week, looked at the first part of 2016 and found that the uninsured rate had fallen even further, to 8. 6 percent. So does that mean the Affordable Care Act is solving the puzzle of getting people covered, a major goal of the law? It certainly looks that way. About 18 million more people have coverage now than did in 2013. But the new numbers also highlight where the law is not working well  —   and how difficult it will be to drop the uninsured rate much lower. Many states have continued to resist the Obama administration’s entreaties to expand their Medicaid coverage, leaving millions of poor Americans with no affordable health insurance options. And the marketplaces created under the law, in which   people without insurance can buy policies, are struggling in states across the country. Some insurers are dropping out, and others are sharply raising prices. In New York City, for example, rates for a benchmark plan could go up by an average of 16 percent, according to one analysis. If the marketplaces do not stabilize, the drop in the uninsured rate could stall or even reverse. Adding to the uncertainty is the hazy future of the health care law. Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress have vowed to repeal it if they get the chance. And even if the Democrats are in control, there is an array of competing proposals on how to adjust the law. “The way I would frame it is, this isn’t just about whether the Affordable Care Act works,” said Dr. Benjamin D. Sommers, an assistant professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health and former researcher for the Health and Human Services Department, who has analyzed the remaining uninsured population. “It’s also about whether the effort to expand coverage has gone far enough. ” The Affordable Care Act was not intended to cover everyone, the way that   systems in many other countries do. Undocumented immigrants, for example, are largely shut out of the health insurance system. And because the system requires people to actively sign up for insurance and often pay a premium, there will always be some Americans too independent  —   or isolated  —   to seek insurance. But the law was certainly written to get insurance to far more people. The Medicaid expansion, for example, is meant to expand coverage to all Americans earning below a set income threshold  —   about $16, 000 for a single person. Adoption of the program has been substantial. But the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to that plan in 2012. The court determined that states could decide whether to expand, and 19 have still declined to do so. Those decisions leave more than three million people who are in poverty uninsured and without good options for obtaining health insurance. The law was written to give poor people coverage through Medicaid, not the private marketplace, so it does not provide financial assistance for buying coverage. The census report highlighted an increasing gap in the uninsured rates between states that expanded their programs and states that did not. There is another large group of   Americans  —   about nine million, according to recent calculations from the Urban Institute  —   who are eligible for Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program but have not signed up. The online marketplaces, which play a critical role under the law in reducing the number of people without coverage, also remain volatile. Fewer people than expected have signed up for plans through the marketplaces, and the enticements are not improving. Prices are set to rise substantially next year. And in many places, people who enroll will have fewer insurers to choose from. Millions of people qualify for subsidies to buy into the plans. But many   people who qualify for small subsidies have still found the plans to be unaffordable or a poor value. And people who make more and do not qualify for much or any government aid  —   especially those who are healthy  —   have been less likely to enroll. That has kept the mix of people in the pool sicker  —   and more expensive to insure  —   than expected. “These gains in coverage don’t negate the need to make the insurance marketplaces sustainable,” Larry Levitt, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks the insurance market, said in an email. “In fact, coverage needs to grow more, with additional healthy people signing up, to stabilize the individual insurance market. ” Insurers say it is imperative that the people who sign up are not just the sickest people. “We need to encourage younger and healthier people to enroll,” said Alissa Fox, a senior executive at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a trade group. Before the Affordable Care Act, most   Americans got insurance from their jobs, and that continues to be true. According to the Census Bureau, employer coverage has held steady since 2013. Many critics of the health law had predicted it would result in a huge   in employer coverage. That has not happened. In fact, the persistent strength of employer coverage has been one of the reasons enrollment in the state marketplaces has not been higher. On Wednesday, the Kaiser Family Foundation released its annual survey of employer health benefits. It found that the market remained stable, with no appreciable decline in the share of companies offering their employees coverage. While employees are typically paying a greater share of their medical bills, the cost of coverage went up modestly this year. The future trajectory of the uninsured numbers depends largely on the results of the next election. Though the health care law may have come to bear President Obama’s name, as Obamacare, its future will be shaped by the president who replaces him  —   and by the next Congress. Hillary Clinton has proposed an array of policies to expand outreach to the uninsured and increase financial assistance to   Americans buying health insurance, policies designed to bring more people into the health law’s programs. She has also proposed introducing public insurance programs for more Americans, including a Medicare   for   people. Mr. Trump, in contrast, has said he would repeal the health law and move to a more   system for health insurance sales, a proposal that is expected to result in a substantial increase in the number of Americans without health coverage. Republicans in the House have put out their own health proposal, also built on a total repeal of the president’s health law. “The stakes are huge,” said Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, who has suggested a series of policy changes to help expand coverage under the law. “You couldn’t be further apart in terms of the perspectives on what is needed here. ”",0
11751,"Private Equity Consultant Hamilton Lane Trots Out New Excuse, “Evil Populists,” for Already-Flagging Private Equity Performance","by Yves Smith 
Private equity shills are readying the Blame Cannon for the industry’s widely forecast fall in returns. 
Who are the allies of the private equity firms attempting to villianize as the cause of deteriorating performance? Not the 0.1% Masters of the Universe, who are always and every the sole cause of Good Things but never never to be found when Bad Things occur. No, it’s those evil “populists” interfering with the proper operation of the world according to private equity that is messing up returns. 
We’re not making this up. From the Wall Street Journal : 
The rise of “populist” politicians in western nations could challenge the ability of private-equity firms to do business and make money, according to a report from Hamilton Lane, one of the largest advisers to investors in the industry. 
The backlash against globalization may cause higher taxes on private-equity firms, create more regulation, drive more volatility and restrict economic growth, Hamilton Lane’s annual review said. 
This is utterly ludicrous if you’ve been paying attention. 
From the first half of 2015, the average EBITDA multiple for PE purchases was over 10X, higher than the peak of the last cycle, in 2007. Even limited partners who are leery of saying a bad word about private equity, like CIO Chris Ailman of CalSTRS, described PE acquisitions as “priced to perfection” . The trading prices of the private equity firms that are public shows that equity market investors believe that private equity firms will not earn any carry fees over the next couple of years. 
And as we’ve pointed out repeatedly, since the second half of 2015, senior officers of prominent private equity firms have increasingly been warning that private equity returns going forward will be lower than levels of the past. And none of them used Putin, um, Trump, um populism as the excuse for why returns were going to decline. 
Hamilton Lane has more reason than most to blame private equity’s declining fortunes on external forces rather than the obvious factors of too much money chasing too many deals, and if the Fed ever pulls it off, rising interest rates being particularly punitive to high risk strategies like private equity, which is fundamentally levered equity. As we’ve pointed out, private equity has doubled its share of global equity from 2005 to 2014. 
Hamilton Lane is not just a consultant to private equity; it is deeply conflicted by virtue of being a private equity fund of fund manager, which means it needs to play nice with the general partners in order to maintain access to funds. And the limited partners it has advised on private equity need excuses they can take to their boards and broader constituencies when private equity returns fizzle. So it’s easy to blame those nasty anti-capitalists rather than admit that private equity has always been a cyclical play and the end of a cycle is nigh. In fact, it should have occurred after the 2007 deal frenzy, but private equity was an accidental beneficiary of central banks’“rescue the financial system” emergency operations, and got a stay of execution. 
In a sign that the public is getting smarter about private equity, 80% of the comments on the Wall Street Journal story were not buying what Hamilton Lane was selling. The other 20% were general criticism of populism rather than votes of support for private equity. 
This skew should not be surprising given some of the strained claims Hamilton Lane made. Notice in the quote above that the first, and presumably therefore the most important problem for private equity was “higher taxes on private-equity firms,” which almost certainly refers to closing the carried interest loophole. But readers are supposed to believe that that would dent their ability to make money for investors, when those investors are almost without exception exempt from US taxes. 
Now some private equity industry members have stomped their feet and said they’d quit if they had to pay more taxes. It’s hard to take this hissy fit seriously since there are not other lines of work in which they’d earn remotely comparable pay even with a bigger tax bill. At the largest firms, the typical annual pay is eight figures, and for the top dogs at big and some medium-large funds, nine figures. 
And it’s not as if “talent” makes as much of a difference as the general partners would have you believe. Industry data shows that no one has a secret sauce. Top quartile funds are less likely to perform well in the next period then by chance. An investor in private equity should stop wasting time picking winners. They should try to avoid crooks and otherwise attempt to index. 
So who might leave the industry if anyone? The departures are more likely to take place at the smallest funds or ones with mediocre performance, since the difference in tax treatment would have a bigger impact on the ability of the principals to maintain what is perceived to be an adequate lifestyle. 
Ironically, thinning out the marginal players is if anything likely to be salutary for industry performance. With too much competition for deals, the winning bid is often made by someone who is desperate to win a deal (as in their investors perceive them to be too slow at putting money to work) or not well informed. 
But the Hamilton Lane whinge is a harbinger of the sort of excuses you can expect to hear from both general partners and limited partners over the coming years, the tired old “whocoulddanode?” in new garb. 0 0 0 0 1 0",0
11752,UK Police Continue Search For Missing Paul Pogba,"We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] UK Police Continue Search For Missing Paul Pogba October 26, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS , SPORT Share 0 Add Comment 
UK POLICE have renewed their appeal for any information as to the whereabouts of a French national who was reported missing in the Manchester area of the country in August, WWN can reveal. 
“Paul Pogba was last seen in Turin and believed to have boarded a plane to Manchester to start a new job, but his employers reported he failed to turn up to work in August. We are renewing our appeal for anyone with information to come forward,” Met officer John Goodwin shared as part of the appeal. 
Officers would not be drawn on the rumours that the man had robbed his employers of his salary and signing on bonus before disappearing. 
“Paul also answers to ‘Pog’ and in addition to being able to play in all variety of positions he would be easily identified by his haircut, which looks like it was done by a blind man with a great sense of humour,” officer Goodwin added. 
Police hope that with his employers Manchester United being back in the headlines recently following a mixed run of form, they can use the publicity surrounding it to find Paul safe and sound. 
“Just come home, Paul,” Pogba’s emotional manager Jose Mourinho urged as part of the renewed search appeal. 
One of the UK’s most intriguing missing persons inquiry ever, Mr. Pogba’s absence has sparked what experts have called mass hallucinations as members of the public claim to have seen him on television on multiple occasions. 
Police hopes were dashed last week when they rushed to London’s Chelsea area last Sunday after sightings of the man were reported but a search of the location proved otherwise.",0
11753,Iraq’s Skies Darken as Islamic State Torches Oil,"Iraq’s Skies Darken as Islamic State Torches Oil Posted on Oct 28, 2016 
By Kieran Cooke / Climate News Network Photo: Kuwait, 1991. Today, the Islamic State copies Saddam Hussein, threatening Iraq’s environment with oil blazes. (Lt. Steve Gozzo USN via Wikimedia Commons) 
LONDON—Even at the height of the day, the skies in many parts of northern Iraq are dark as ISIS torches oil wells and oil-filled defensive trenches in its retreat. Artillery fire and bombing raids by US aircraft and others battling Isis are also causing conflagrations at oil installations. Aid teams near the town of Qayyarah, about 80 kilometres south of the Isis stronghold of Mosul, talk of escaping civilians being covered in oil residues . “Everywhere is covered in a fine dusting of black soot and grime”, one aid worker from the Save the Children charity told the BBC. “And the children we met were covered in it—their hands were black, their feet were black and their hair was matted…they were coming out in rashes, developing problems with their lungs.” Deliberate pollution There are fears that as ISIS comes under ever greater pressure it will unleash “scorched earth” tactics, setting alight ever more oil wells and deliberately polluting the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, two of the region’s main rivers, which supply water and power to millions. Setting oil fields alight could also have wider climate-related consequences. During Saddam Hussein’s invasion and subsequent retreat from Kuwait in 1990/91, the Iraqis set alight nearly 800 Kuwaiti oil wells: at one stage—in March 1991 – it was calculated that up to six million barrels of oil were being burned each day . The result was daytime darkness and long plumes of black smoke across a wide area of the Gulf. Though the long-term impact of Kuwait’s oil fires on the climate is still being assessed, the release of vast amounts of climate-changing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is considered to have added to the problems of warming, on both a regional and a global scale. The Gulf region is one of the fastest-warming in the world, with many areas forecast to be uninhabitable in the not too distant future because of higher temperatures and chronic water shortages. Long-term damage Pollution from the Kuwait oil fires and ruptured oil pipelines are also believed to have caused serious long-term damage to the waters of the Gulf. There are fears that, with pressure on the group mounting, similar developments could unfold in northern Iraq as Isis torches oil installations 25 years later. In recent years Iraq has been trying to ramp up its oil production in order to raise more revenues—partly to fund the war against Isis. But much of the development of Iraq’s fossil fuel resources has been badly planned and mismanaged . The World Bank says that, globally, approximately 140 billion cubic metres of natural gas produced together with oil are burned or flared off each year— adding 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere . “From exploding fuel barrels to exposure to carcinogenic chemicals and inhalational toxins, these makeshift oil refineries will have a long-lasting health impact. ...” Iraq is now one of the world’s leading gas-flaring countries: a lack of pipelines and infrastructure means that its gas is mostly burned off. Meanwhile the country has been forced to import large amounts of gas from neighbouring Iran in order to meet its energy needs. Across northern Iraq and eastern Syria—the country’s main oil-producing region—Isis controls large numbers of oil wells and derives considerable income from selling fossil fuels on the black market . A lack of maintenance and expertise means that many of these installations are a hazard to the environment. Badly-run oil facilities also cause considerable human suffering. A recent report by Pax , a Netherlands-based church grouping, says that more than 5,700 makeshift oil refineries are operating in the ISIS-controlled Deir ez-Zor area of Syria. Thousands of civilians, many of them children, are forced to work at these crude, basically-run facilities. “From exploding fuel barrels to exposure to carcinogenic chemicals and inhalational toxins, these makeshift oil refineries will have a long-lasting health impact on communities and their environment”, says the report.

11754,Nordic Genius and the Central Heat Theorem,"Nordic Genius and the Central Heat Theorem Adventures in Genetics Email This Page to Someone Your Name   
Today I will explain how civilization happened, to the extent that there has been any civilization to happen, or that it can be explained, and where stuff comes from, and who done what, and why. Afterward there will be no more to say on the subject. You will hear doors slamming across the nation as university departments shut down. 
Now, history is littered knee-deep with literature, and art, and inventions, like gum on the underside of a theater seat. Inventions are pretty important for civilization. Where did these inventions come from? Well, there’s a group of people who clutter up the web and say that it was North Europeans. Yes. See, it’s genetic. These pale people invented everything. Nobody else did, especially Latins. It’s because northerners have creativity, and nobody else else can. The Chinese copy stuff pretty fair, and make little paper umbrellas for expensive drinks, but can’t invent. Latins can’t either. Only North Europeans. 
This seemed a bit smug since, curiously, most who believed this seemed to be North Europeans. A coincidence, doubtless. Anyway, being as I am a self-appointed defender of things Latin and tired of unending nonsense on the matter, I set out to investigate. Has anybody else, I asked, ever contributed to the dim world of the mind? Even, perish forbid, Latins? 
No. 
After many months of arduous research, I had to concede: Damn! It was true! North Europeans really did own intellectual history. Nobody had ever approached their creativity. It was undeniable. The pattern went back a long, long way. To wit: 
In the mid-Fourth Millennium BC, North Europeans in Sumeria–widely believed to be Finns, but the evidence is inconclusive–invented writing. Yes. It was later invented independently by other North Europeans, notably the Chinese and Mesoamerican Indians. 
Latin peoples in particular have no creativity. The evidence supports this: Four thousand years after the Finns in Sumeria, the Latin peoples of Denmark finally succeeded, sort of 750 AD, in writing down Beowulf (real name: Beowulf Gonzalez) though in crude language and using a script stolen from North European Phoenicians. Such are Latins. 
Northern Europeans of the Fifth Century BC in Athens produced Archimedes Jones and Aristotle Schwartz. This Nordic flowering continued. North Europeans of the Roman Empire invented engineering, or at least greatly improved on what the Finns of Sumeria had done. After this, Northern European Italians produced the Renaissance. Latin peoples could not have done it, because they lack creativity. 
There is no need here to recapitulate the intellectual achievements of Michelangelo Hofstedter, Da Vinci Frankfurter, or Benvenuto Cellini Thor. 
Perseus, by Cellini Thor, a Florentine North European born 1500 and apparent misogynist. The Nordic genius is evident in the…in the…the derivation is left as an exercise for the reader. 
Now we ask, why did North Europe produce Teutonic geniuses like Galileo Schwartz? What makes one civilization flourish while another remains covered in snow? After profound thought I concluded that to have a civilization one chiefly needs heat and moisture. This is true also of the more interesting tropical plants, such as orchids. 
Consider: The Sumerians got a head start on everybody because they lived in a tremendously hot climate with two big two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. They didn’t have to spend all their time looking for firewood and shoveling snow. Compare this with, say, Norway. While the North Europeans of sweltering, rainy India were writing the Gita, the Norwegians huddled around fires and shivered. 
It can be shown that as you go north in Europe, the rise of intellectual achievement closely tracks the spread of central heating. This is the Central Heat Theorem. (Not to be confused with the Central Limit Theorem, which I thought says that if you throw enough coins enough times, the bar graph converges to a Gaussian. But it may say something else.) 
An article of faith among the North European claque is that peoples in colder climes are smarter than sun dwellers because. See, they had to evolve enough intelligence to remember that it got cold in the winter and they should put food somewhere. (I suspect that a cocker spaniel could do this, but never mind.) Anyway, the dumb ones froze because they couldn’t remember to come in where the fire was and it was warm. The rest bred hard because there was nothing else to do and evolved to be smart. 
Another way of looking at the question: anyone witless enough to live where it snows would start with a large IQ deficit to evolve against. 
In reality we see that human advance follows the Central Heat Theorem. The Esquimaux, good Asians all, have water, when they can melt it, but not heat, so they never contrived a civilization. Amerindians in places like Montana had water and some heat in the summers, but they froze in winter which discouraged them–it would me. Indians of the southern deserts had heat, heaven knows, but no water. No civilization to speak of. 
But the Indians of Mesoamerica, both warm and moist, built elaborate civilizations, invented writing, and number systems. See? It’s like orchid botany. 
After the Nordic Renaissance in Italy, civilization of the European variety moved to France. (You can tell that France is a Northern European culture, not an inferior Latin one, because the French speak German.) 
At this point the North Europe of today, for practical purposes meaning Germany and England, kicked in. These two counties and the United States finally did produce a tremendous amount of civilization, including most math and literature and the singing commercial, though they can’t dance, and pretty much run the show today. Better late than never. Much is owed to such northern mathematicians as Fibonacci, Galois, Laplace, Lagrange, and Fermat. 
I know that if I suggested that Latins had contributed anything to the arts and sciences, I would be called wrong-headed, racist, or a reverse-racist, or didn’t understand genetics, or something. Perish forbid. (From the Merriam-Fredster Dictionary: “racist”: observant, truthful, characterized by reason.) Yet, even though the evidence is against me–such monumental Germanic writers as Virgil, Dante, Machiavelli, Juvenal, and Cellini Thor himself cannot be denied–I stubbornly insist that Latins must have contributed something to civilization. The ablative absolute maybe, or tomato paste.

11755,Colonial agenda of erasure: The United States has still not acknowledged it committed genocide against indigenous peoples | Galactic Connection,"© Photo: AJ Schroetlin Indigenous Americans protest the Columbus Day celebration in Denver, Colorado, on October 9, 2007. 
What myths have most of us been taught about Native Americans? In a new book, All the Real Indians Died Off And 20 Other Myths About Native Americans , Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Dina Gilio-Whitaker show how generations of people in the United States have been misinformed about Indigenous Americans as part of a colonial agenda of erasure. 
The following is the Truthout interview with Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Dina Gilio-Whitaker. 
Mark Karlin: I was profoundly enlightened when I interviewed you about your last book The Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States . Your new book, written with Dina Gilio-Whitaker debunks 21 myths about Native Americans. Before we get to the book, I want to start and ask you a truly global question, how is the Indigenous rights movement becoming increasingly transnational? 
Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: The international Indigenous movement is becoming increasingly visible, but it has been developing since the early 1920s, when the Haudenosaunee (six Nations of the Iroquois federation) sent a representative, Cayuga leader Deskaheh, to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1923 to address the League of Nations. From the 1930s onwards, Muskogee Creek, Cherokee and Hopi representatives built ties with Indigenous Peoples in Central Mexico, where their peoples had originated. 
In 1940, The Interamerican Indian Convention was signed by the governments of the hemisphere, and the Interamerican Indian Institute was founded, which still exists today. In the 1950s, the newly established National Congress of American Indians in the United States and other Native activists actively sought ties with Indigenous Peoples in other parts of the world. But it was in 1974, with the founding of the International Indian Treaty Council by the militant American Indian Movement, and of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples, that formal relations with the United Nations began. 
The United Nations Sub-Commission on Racism and Racial Discrimination had taken up a study of Indigenous Peoples globally in 1972 and in 1977, the first international Indigenous Peoples conference was held at the United Nations – the delegates of Indigenous representatives organized by the International Indian Treaty Council. After four years of arduous Indigenous lobbying, a UN Working Group on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was established and met for the first time in 1982, and thereafter annually for 25 years, resulting in massive documentation and testimonies, as well as official reports, and in the 2007 UN General Assembly resolution, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . 
Early in the new millennium, a UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues were established, the latter meeting for two weeks annually at UN headquarters in New York, bringing together thousands of Indigenous Peoples’ representatives. In addition to the institutional transnational relationships are the daily exchange of communications among Indigenous Peoples on local, regional and continental issues and emergencies, particularly effective during the past 20 years of increasing Internet capacity. 
What are the roles of erasure and disappearance in creating settler colonialist myth about Native Americans that then justify suppression and theft of land? 
Dina Gilio-Whitaker: Disappearance of the Indigenous population was necessary for the settler project to inherit the land that they believed was rightfully theirs, by divine providence. Very early on, for example, when the Mayflower immigrants of the Plymouth colony were starving and trying to figure out how to feed themselves, we know from primary documents that some of them found villages that had been emptied out due to a disease epidemic a year or two earlier, or in some cases, were still inhabited. They raided food stores and even graves, and saw it as an expression of God’s favor on them, having gotten rid of the Indians so that they could now inhabit the land. 
By the 1840s this belief crystalized into the concept of manifest destiny. Then we begin to see the emergence of anthropology and what we now call scientific racism – a science-based ideology that all non-white people are inferior to white Europeans . This Social Darwinism finds its way into Supreme Court decisions about Native lands and nations, which then become the basis for laws and policies that systematically justify extermination, forced assimilation and endless other depredations – that all have at their root the goal of transferring Native lands into white ownership. This is why we say that settler colonialism is a structure that eliminates Natives so that settlers can replace them. And it is this structure that still frames the body of federal Indian law that governs what happens to Native nations and individuals today, all guided by the impulse to eliminate. 
You have a chapter on the myth that the US did not engage in a policy of genocide toward Native Americans. Given that’s a loaded term that denialists love to split hairs about, wouldn’t it just be easier to say the European conquerors maintained a policy of trying to make Native Americans vanish? 
Dunbar-Ortiz: The importance of the term “genocide” for many Indigenous Peoples is that it is more than a term or an accusation; it is a word created in the wake of the Shoah in Europe to describe what happens when a people are targeted by a government for extermination, as were the Jews of Europe, and which is the term used in the most important international law related to concerned Indigenous Peoples, as the only international human rights law that pertains specifically to collectivities of people rather than individuals. 
We have researched and studied only US policies and actions related to Indigenous peoples in North America, but think that the analysis of the US applies to several of the republics of the Americas, as well as Australia and New Zealand, that imposed settler-colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples, seeking to displace and disappear Indigenous communities and nations to replace them with European settlers. 
As the late Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe wrote, “The question of genocide is never far from discussions of settler colonialism.” The history of the United States is a history of settler colonialism. The objective of US authorities was to terminate their existence as peoples – not as random individuals. This is the very definition of modern genocide. The term “genocide” is often incorrectly assumed to mean extreme examples of mass murder associated with war, with the death of millions of individuals, as, for instance in Cambodia. Although clearly the Holocaust was the most extreme of all genocides, the bar set by the Nazis is not the bar required to be considered genocide. Most importantly, genocide does not have to be complete to be considered genocide. Cases of genocide carried out as policy may be found in historical documents as well as in the oral histories of Indigenous communities. An example from 1873 is typical, with General William T. Sherman writing, 
“We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children … during an assault, the soldiers cannot pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.” 
We talked about this in our last interview. Many historical accounts tried to make it appear that presidents and Congress viewed themselves as white saviors to Native Americans. Was that any different than the attitude of European colonialism that decimated vast populations in Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, for example? 
Dunbar-Ortiz: I think there’s a great deal of similarity in this respect among various European and Euroamerican colonialisms, with attempts to justify the capitalist plunder that drove and drives the past 500 years of European and United States imperialism. One of the myths we include in the present book is on the presumed benevolence of US presidents towards Native Americans (Myth 9). 
What is different is the goal of elimination of the Native in the four sites of Anglo settler-colonialism in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Whether it was an expression of the “laws of nature,” that is, the survival of the fittest as explicitly expressed by Andrew Jackson and the embrace of eugenics by Theodore Roosevelt during their presidencies, or in popular culture by Walt Whitman and other writers, or the disappearance through forced assimilation, such as the Indian boarding schools’ goal to “kill the Indian and save the man,” the stamping out and total disappearance of the Native was predominant. In the present, the way benevolence is expressed is in conceptualizing the Native as a historical relic; US people have to be constantly reminded that there are still existent Indigenous peoples and communities in North America, but whether left or right, recent immigrant or descendants of settlers, even descendants of enslaved Africans, the Native presence is not a consideration in the day to day life of individuals and municipal, state and national governments. 
Since we are coming close to this holiday, can you expand on dispelling the myth that Thanksgiving proves the Indians welcomed the pilgrims? 
Gilio-Whitaker: The story, as it is commonly conveyed, is a feel-good tale of a deep friendship between Pilgrims and Indians, signified by a formal, ostensibly prearranged engagement where they all sit down together to give thanks for a bountiful harvest. 
There is not enough evidence to surmise anything of the sort; what there is suggests that it was a random, rather accidental occurrence in which the Wampanoag were investigating the sound of gunfire coming from the English settlement, and then were invited to stay for dinner. The actual relationship between the Wampanoag and the pilgrims can best be described as a political alliance based on desperation and the mutual need for survival. Both were extremely vulnerable. 
The pilgrims needed the Indians to teach them how to live on the land, and extreme population decline due to disease had weakened the Wampanoag militarily. A treaty had been negotiated in an atmosphere of mistrust and tension. Within two years, it had completely broken down but then, after about 40 years of relative peace, by 1675 full-scale war had broken out between them, becoming what we know now as King Philip’s War, what’s been called the bloodiest war ever fought on American soil. 
This is too recent for your book, but I think your opinion on the activism surrounding the Dakota Access pipeline and the expanding support for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe should be explored. Do you think it is a threshold point for a new stage of defiant, stalwart activism on behalf of reclaiming sovereignty over Indigenous lands and water? 
Gilio-Whitaker: It remains to be seen, but at the moment it does seem that way. What we have to compare it to in this country is the Alcatraz occupation from 1969-1971, the Trail of Broken Treaties in 1972 and Wounded Knee in 1973. 
Those movements, like this one, were youth-led (although women are much more out front these days). Those were also the days that gave birth to the ethnic studies disciplines, and growing numbers of Indians becoming lawyers. So what we have now is new generations of Natives with sophisticated educations, and savvy political and organizing skills. They understand their history, they understand they’re living with intergenerational trauma, but they still have enough of their cultures and traditions that have the power to heal them. And that makes them strong and relentless, like their ancestors before them. What’s different now is that there are greater levels of support coming from non-Natives, because it’s recognized now that Native struggles to protect land and water are everyone’s struggles. And let’s remember that this standoff at Standing Rock comes on the heels of years of climate justice activism, which is widely acknowledged to be led by Indigenous peoples. Standing Rock is only the most recent manifestation of that.

SOTT Comment: Read more from Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: The colonization of America was genocidal by plan: Yes, Native Americans were the victims of genocide 
US history, as well as inherited Indigenous trauma, cannot be understood without dealing with the genocide that the United States committed against Indigenous peoples. From the colonial period through the founding of the United States and continuing in the twentieth century, this has entailed torture, terror, sexual abuse, massacres, systematic military occupations, removals of Indigenous peoples from their ancestral territories, forced removal of Native American children to military-like boarding schools, allotment, and a policy of termination. 
Within the logic of settler-colonialism, genocide was the inherent overall policy of the United States from its founding, but there are also specific documented policies of genocide on the part of US administrations that can be identified in at least four distinct periods: the Jacksonian era of forced removal; the California gold rush in Northern California; during the Civil War and in the post Civil War era of the so-called Indian Wars in the Southwest and the Great Plains; and the 1950s termination period; additionally, there is the overlapping period of compulsory boarding schools, 1870s to 1960s. The Carlisle boarding school, founded by US Army officer Richard Henry Pratt in 1879, became a model for others established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Pratt said in a speech in 1892, 
“A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one. In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him and save the man.” Share: ",0
11756,"Polls are tightening, but is the US presidential election rigged?","Interviews US Democratic presidential nominee former Hillary Clinton boards her campaign plane at Westchester County Airport on October 27, 2016 in White Plains, New York. (Photo by AFP) 
One of the most important questions is will US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton rig the election to win the White House like she did in the primaries against Bernie Sanders, asks Myles Hoenig, an American political analyst and activist. 
Recent polls show that Clinton’s national lead over Trump is shrinking as the Election Day is approaching. 
The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has 3 percent support among likely voters, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein has 2 percent support. 
“In every election the race tightens towards the end,” Hoenig told Press TV on Thursday. 
“It’s really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other. With Obama and Romney, or even Gore and Bush, many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president, regardless of who was pulling whose strings,” he said. 
“This election is more polarized than ever. With the Podesta leaks showing Clinton’s overt racism (calling Donna Brazille a buffalo) as well as proving that President Obama lied to the public about when he learned of Clinton’s inappropriate use of her emails, and with the news of Trump’s ACCESS Hollywood tape receding into America’s short term memory span, it’s no wonder the polls are tightening,” the analyst stated. 
“The question of the day is will Clinton rig the election like she did the primary, being the only way she could have won,” he asked. 
“We’re also seeing both Johnson’s and Stein’s numbers dropping but so many are not polled that those numbers are harder to verify,” the commentator noted. 
“This is the biggest crap shoot of an election in years!” he said in his concluding remarks. Loading ...",0
11757,США и их союзники в поисках новых мер давления на КНДР | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: КНДР Пока обсуждение в ООН сирийских проблем тормозит принятие очередной резолюции на северокорейско-ядерную тему, США и их союзники предпринимают целый комплекс мер для давления на КНДР. И хотя широко анонсированного разведками США и РК шестого ядерного испытания на день основания ТПК 10 августа не случилось, наращивать мощь, делать резкие заявления и готовить санкции это не мешает. Начнем с подготовки санкций, которые могут быть более жёсткими, чем прежние. Об этом 12 октября заявил в ходе встречи с журналистами помощник госсекретаря США Дэниел Рассел. И хотя, отвечая на вопрос о позиции Китая по санкциям, он заявил, что важно непременно достичь прогресса в этом вопросе (что на взгляд автора говорит о том, что прогресса нет), Рассел выразил уверенность, что новый проект санкционной резолюции СБ ООН позволит значительно продвинуться в деле ужесточения давления на Север: важно, чтобы все члены ООН отдельно принимали дополнительные меры для защиты своих интересов от северокорейской угрозы. Таким образом, не надеясь на СБ ООН, Америка делает ставку на односторонние меры. В рамках таковых Палата Представителей Конгресса США инициировала законопроект, направленный на полное перекрытие Пхеньяну доступа к международной финансовой системе. Предполагается вносить в список объектов санкций лица, имеющие отношение к предоставлению Северу средств межбанковского взаимодействия для осуществления различных платежей. Одним из подобных средств, к примеру, является международная система межбанковской передачи информации и совершения платежей SWIFT, которой пользуются около 10 тыс. банков из более чем двухсот стран. Ежедневно через SWIFT проходят более миллиона транзакций. Если Север будет из нее исключён, то это позволит блокировать получение Пхеньяном любых денежных средств, будь то расходы на разработку ядерной программы, оплата за уголь, идущий на экспорт, или перевод денег, заработанных северокорейскими рабочими за рубежом. США работают и над ограничением северокорейского экспорта угля и железной руды. Ежегодный доход Севера от продажи угля составляет 1 млрд долларов, что составляет треть общей суммы северокорейского экспорта. Бóльшая часть угля уходит в Китай, на который Америка пытается давить, заявляя, что ужесточение давления на Север в сотрудничестве с США отвечает интересам Китая (имеется в виду, что северокорейская угроза подогревает интерес РК и Японии к созданию собственного ядерного щита, что не желательно для Пекина). К экономическим санкциям добавляется дипломатическое давление. 21 сентября 2016 г. министры иностранных дел сорока стран-участниц Договора о всеобъемлющем запрещении ядерных испытаний (ДВЗЯИ) призвали Пхеньян свернуть ядерную программу и выполнять международные обязательства в рамках совместного заявления участников шестисторонних переговоров от 2005 года. Как отмечается в заявлении по итогам встречи министров, Север является единственной страной, которая провела в XXI веке ядерные испытания. Впрочем, на той же встрече участники призвали подписать и ратифицировать Договор о всеобъемлющем запрещении ядерных испытаний восемь стран, чьё одобрение необходимо для его вступления в силу. Это КНДР, Китай, Египет, Индия, Иран, Израиль, Пакистан и США. Почти одновременно с этим, 28 сентября, все тот же Рассел заявил, что США призвали страны мира понизить уровень дипломатического и экономического сотрудничества с Пхеньяном, либо отменить намеченные контакты, стремясь добиться максимальной изоляции КНДР от мирового сообщества. По словам Рассела, благодаря усилиям США 75 стран осудили северокорейские ядерные испытания, а некоторые страны отменили запланированные встречи с официальными лицами из КНДР. Пак Кын Хе в своих выступлениях идет дальше – по ее словам, в настоящее время вести диалог с Пхеньяном вообще не имеет смысла. В прошлом, когда шёл диалог, Пхеньян использовал это время для тайной разработки атомного оружия, и потому не стоит повторять ошибки. Сравним подобное с позицией России — 23 сентября в ходе выступления на 71-й сессии Генеральной Ассамблеи ООН министр иностранных дел РФ Сергей Лавров заявил, что Север должен прекратить ядерные испытания и призвал Пхеньян вернуться к режиму денуклеаризации. Однако в то же время Лавров указал на недопустимость использования этой ситуации в качестве предлога для массированной милитаризации Северо-Восточной Азии, развертывания там очередного позиционного района глобальной ПРО США, и отметил, что все заинтересованные стороны должны воздержаться от дальнейшей эскалации напряженности, встать на путь политико-дипломатического урегулирования ядерной проблемы Корейского полуострова через возобновление шестисторонних переговоров. Никуда не девается и бряцание оружием. 26 сентября вооружённые силы РК и США провели учения в Восточном море. Стороны отрабатывали нанесение ударов по наземным объектам КНДР, используя компьютерное моделирование. В манёврах приняли участие три южнокорейских корабля водоизмещением 7600 тонн, подлодка водоизмещением 1200 тонн, противолодочный вертолёт Lynx, патрульный самолёт P-3. С американской стороны участвовали эсминец Spruance водоизмещением 9,5 тыс. тонн и самолёт Р-3. Стороны отрабатывали нанесение ракетных ударов с кораблей, действия по нанесению высокоточных ударов, обнаружению и отслеживанию северокорейских подлодок. С 3 по 21 октября РК, США, Новая Зеландия и НATO проведут на американской авиабазе Эйлсон в штате Аляска совместные военно-воздушные учения Red Flag. В ходе учений будут отрабатываться совместные удары южнокорейских и американских ВВС по ядерным и другим ключевым военным объектам Севера с использованием управляемых авиационных бомб. Южнокорейская сторона направила для участия в учениях шесть истребителей F-15K и два транспортных самолёта C-130 Hercules. ВВС двух стран также отработают оказание огневой поддержки наземным силам и ведение воздушного боя. С 10 октября РК и США начали совместные военно-морские учения Invincible Spirit 2016 с привлечением 10 военных кораблей, включая оснащённые системой раннего обнаружения «Иджис» и атомный авианосец «Рональд Рейган». Крупномасштабные южнокорейско-американские манёвры продолжатся по 15 октября как в Желтом, так и в Японском морях и будут посвящены отработке точечных ударов по важным военным объектам и командным пунктам и уничтожению войск специального назначения противника. Аналогичные учения проводились в июле и ноябре 2010 года после обстрела северокорейской артиллерией острова Ёнпхёндо и потопления сторожевого корабля «Чхонан», и в них принимал участие авианосец «Джордж Вашингтон», но нынешние — еще более масштабны. С Invincible Spirit не стоит путать Invincible Shield. Эти совместные военные маневры ВВС Республики Корея, Великобритании и США впервые проведут с 4 по 10 ноября, и они также будут направлены на отработку авиаударов по ключевым военным объектам Северной Кореи, уничтожение резиденций руководства, а также перехват самолетов противника. Новостью тут является участие Великобритании, которая планирует направить в РК четыре самолета Eurofighter Typhoon, заправщик Voyager и транспортник C-17 Globemaster. Из Германии в РК отправили несколько десятков крылатых ракет «воздух-земля» TAURUS. Эти ракеты предназначены для нанесения высокоточных ударов по защищённым объектам противника. Они способны определять, отслеживать и поражать цели, пробивать 6-метровые бетонные стены бункеров. Об этом 15 октября сообщил представитель оборонного ведомства РК. К 2017 году Германия поэтапно передаст РК 170 ракет. Помимо этого, в связи с недавними северокорейскими ядерными испытаниями и продолжающимися пусками баллистических ракет, было принято решение о приобретении еще дополнительно 90 ракет TAURUS. Между тем расходы на приобретение и установку одной такой ракеты на южнокорейский истребитель обойдется в 2 млрд вон или примерно 1,7 млн долларов. Какова реакция на подобную политику? В случае американских провокаций Пхеньян готов к новым атакам, о чем заявил министр иностранных дел КНДР Ли Ён Хо, выступая перед участниками саммита Движения неприсоединения в Венесуэле. Также Ли Ён Хо сказал, что пятое ядерное испытание было «справедливой мерой для защиты страны от провокаций со стороны США». А что до уламывания Китая, то этому процессу мы посвятим отдельный материал.

11758,"Mexico Welcomes Possible U.S. Shift on Nafta, but Mistrust of Trump Persists - The New York Times","MEXICO CITY  —   For months, President Trump warned Mexicans that the Nafta they had enjoyed for decades would soon be a thing of the past. He cowed manufacturers into shifting their investments from Mexico to the United States. He told Mexican leaders that he would cancel the trade agreement and levy punishing tariffs unless they capitulated to his demands in overhauling it. So, when a draft letter suggesting a softening of his views began circulating among members of Congress this week, Mexicans expressed a range of reactions, from welcome relief to cool, wonky reason to dark mistrust. The draft letter, signed by the acting United States Trade Representative, Stephen Vaughn, seemed to propose keeping much of the agreement in place. The language was bureaucratic and technical, devoid of the emotion and invective that has characterized many of Mr. Trump’s comments about Nafta, which he has described as “the worst trade deal” ever signed by the United States. Some Mexicans welcomed the shift in tone and viewed the document, however provisional, as a constructive step in the right direction. “The tone has changed and that should calm us all,” Fernando Ruiz, head of the Mexican Council for Foreign Trade, Investment and Technology, said Friday. The generic nature of the document “helps cool the waters, it gives us more tranquillity rather than uncertainty. ” But some also warned that the draft was by nature bureaucratic, not political. They cautioned that with months to go before negotiations could begin, and with the mercurial Mr. Trump at the helm, anything could happen. “I don’t think anyone really has a clue what’s really going to happen,” said Agustín Barrios Gómez, a former Mexican congressman and the president of the Mexico Image Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting Mexico’s reputation abroad. “There’s this entire optimism that the wolf isn’t going to blow the house down, but it could be toppled over in one tweet. ” Trump administration officials seemed to encourage this caution, perhaps as a negotiating ploy, emphasizing that the draft was just a draft. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, even went so far as to seemingly disavow the document as a reflection of the administration’s objectives in the negotiation. “That is not a statement of administration policy,” he told reporters on Thursday. “That is not an accurate statement of where we are at this time. ” Mr. Spicer’s comments only replenished Mexico’s deep reservoir of wariness and resentment toward Mr. Trump, sentiments that took root with force starting with the debut of his presidential campaign, when he took shots at Mexican immigrants. His vow to build a border wall  —   and make Mexico pay for it  —   became a rhetorical motif of his candidacy, firing up his supporters and inflaming   sentiment. And he has long accused Mexico of “taking advantage” of the United States under Nafta, or the North American Free Trade Agreement. This history has given some officials and business leaders pause when considering the draft letter this week. “We don’t want to let our guard down,” said Moisés Kalach, who is in charge of trade issues for Mexico’s main business alliance, the Business Coordinating Council. The Mexican business community, he added, was preparing for all negotiating proposals. The administration of Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, did not comment publicly on the letter. The Mexican government has said it is committed to preserving Nafta and protecting the $1. 4 billion in bilateral trade that crosses the border every day, though it has said it is open to modifications. The Peña Nieto administration has argued that any renegotiation of the deal be accompanied by talks over a range of bilateral issues, including border security and immigration. Mexican officials and business leaders have also said that if negotiations go downhill, they are prepared to walk away from Nafta. In the meantime  —   mindful of Mr. Trump’s   threats  —   Mexico has been exploring new trade deals with other countries and updating old ones. Several seasoned trade specialists in Mexico, among them former government officials, said the document circulating this week was encouraging. “I think it’s good news for Mexico,” said Beatriz Leycegui, a partner at the consultancy SAI and a former undersecretary for foreign trade in Mexico who participated in the Nafta negotiations. “I think this is a responsible letter, something that is indicating a willingness to cooperate, to work together in the competitiveness of the region, and this is extremely important for Mexico at a time when Mexico needs to have clarity and make progress on this front. ” Others, however, said there were items in the draft letter that could be particularly difficult for Mexico and could provoke a strong response here. Antonio   a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group, an international consulting firm, and a former head of economic affairs at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said he had concerns about several items in the letter, including a proposal for new tariffs if a surge of imports from one country threatens a domestic industry in another  —   which could be imposed if, say, one country’s goods flooded the other’s markets. “It could lead to    protectionism,” Mr.   said. “That particular issue would keep me up at night. ” Luz María de la Mora, professor of international studies at CIDE, a Mexico City university, and head of a consultancy focused on international commerce, said she found nothing in the letter that was “out of context, aberrant or particularly worrying. ” But she was troubled by Mr. Spicer’s comments. “Because when are we really going to know what the stance of the White House is?” she asked. “That is where all the uncertainty lies, more so than in the substance of this draft. ”",0
11759,Mark Cuban: Trump Is ’Political Chemotherapy’ for the System - Breitbart,"Friday on CNN’s “New Day,” billionaire businessman and “Shark Tank” star Mark Cuban said President Donald Trump was “political chemotherapy” for what the system.  Cuban said, “You have to ask why do they support him and I think we’re coming to a greater understanding now. I call it political chemotherapy. One of my friends, who I always thought was really smart, I’m not saying he’s dumb,  but had a different viewpoint on why he voted for Trump. I didn’t expect him to vote for him. He said ‘Mark, I’ve voted for politicians my entire life.’ He’s in his 50s. ‘Do you know what the definition of insanity is? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. So I voted for Donald Trump. Is he poisonous in a lot of respects? Yeah, this is out chemotherapy. We hope he’s going to change the political system.’ And if that’s the way you’re evaluating Donald Trump, he’s doing a phenomenal job. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
11760,Cotton: GOP Health Care Plan Is ’Not Going to Work to Bring Down Premiums’ - Breitbart,"Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while discussing the current Republican House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) said, “I simply think that it’s not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country. ”  Partial transcript as follows: TAPPER: Turning to Obamacare, you’ve been very critical of the bill supported by our previous guest Dr. Price, President Trump, House Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. You’ve warned that this bill could put the House Republican majority at risk. One major concern about the plan is the way it might impact lower income Americans. You come fromArkansass which is one of the poorest states in the country. If you were designing the plan on your own, would you get rid of theMedicaidd expansion that brought coverage to 250, 000 people in your state? COTTON: Jake, first, let me say I served with Tom Price in the House of Representatives and consider him a good friend. He had legislation as a congress congressman that I think is a lot better than the house bill currently under consideration. TheMedicaidd expansion I think needs to be part of Medicaid transformation and that’s what the house bill moved forward. It can be improved to some degree, but it’s about a 70% or 80% solution, Jake. the bigger problem with this legislation is on the private insurance market. I simply think that it’s not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country.

11761,Dr. Jane Orient: ‘Universal Coverage Means Less Care’ - Breitbart,"The executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) observes that any Obamacare health care replacement plan that attempts to implement “universal coverage” will suffer the same outcome as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) since the more “coverage” that is mandated, the less actual “health care” will be available. [Orient emphasizes what has ultimately been the demise of Obamacare. Its supporters say millions more have “coverage,” i. e. insurance cards, though many can’t afford its high premiums and deductibles.  “The reported success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA or ObamaCare) is based on enrollment numbers,” Orient explains. “Millions more have ‘coverage.’ Similarly, the predicted disasters from repeal have to do with loss of coverage. ” The physician continues that plans to provide universal coverage will result in “tens of thousands of deaths. ” In the fervor to keep Obamacare’s   conditions provision and the push further for universal coverage, Orient asks where the data are on the ACA’s actual impact: Where are the statistics about the number of heart operations done on babies born with birth defects, the latest poster children? How about the number of babies saved by this surgery, and the number allowed to die without an attempt at surgery —  before and after ACA? I haven’t seen them. Note that an insurance plan doesn’t do the operation. A doctor does. The insurer can, however, try to block it. Also missing are figures on the number of courses of cancer chemotherapy given, or not given, or the time from diagnosis to death in cancer patients before and after ACA.   survival of cancer patients in the U. S. is generally better than in countries that have universal coverage, or the type of plan progressives want to import. Again, the insurance plan isn’t medicine. You can get medicine without insurance, and if you have insurance it might refuse to pay. Orient observes that, between 2014 and 2015, U. S. mortality rates increased for the first time in decades. “This primarily affected   whites,” she notes. “Is Obamacare the cause? There are many factors involved, drug abuse probably being the most important. But I suspect that if repeal had happened in 2012 or 2013, it would have been blamed. ” “Medicaid expansion may have alleviated fears of medical bankruptcy, but we don’t know that more patients got treatment,” Orient continues. “In   Canada, there is no fear of a medical bill. But there might not be any treatment either. ” In October of last year, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admitted the ACA was working just as it was designed  —   jacking up premiums and deductibles, and limiting choices for its customers. “The main goal of Obamacare was ” Gruber, an MIT economics professor, said on CNN, continuing: One was to cover the uninsured, of which we’ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare. “Jonathan Gruber exposed himself as not credible and simply a propaganda minister of Obamacare when he was exposed explaining the grand deception perpetrated on the American public,” Dr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in   and skull base surgery, told Breitbart News. “To claim that Obamacare is working is almost too ridiculous to comment upon, unless the purpose of Obamacare was to drive up insurance premiums, while providing less options for health care and destroying the best medical care system in the world. ” Orient agrees, observing that experts beating the universal healthcare drum “know very well that resources are limited, and that spending (‘costs’) must be contained. ” She adds: They also understand that the burgeoning bureaucracy and its minions and retainers must be well paid. So the answer is to cut services. Some plans “incentivize” doctors to make more money by skimping on care. Others call for a “global budget” —  the deliberate creation of scarcity. When the money is gone, treatment is canceled. There will be fewer beds, fewer CT scanners, fewer drugs, and fewer doctors. But all will be fair. No rationing by price, just by waiting lines, political pull  —   and death. There will be no medical bills to pay after a service, if you get any service. Only taxes in advance, service or no service. Dr. Kristin Held, a   ophthalmologist and surgeon, explains how Obamacare obliterated   medical care and that even many Republicans still refuse to embrace the free market when it comes to health care, a situation that will keep healthcare costs high: In a normal free market, people can look for a less expensive car or a different dealer. But ObamaCare outlawed the insurance products that millions of people had and were satisfied with. No more “bare bones” policies for instance. The leather seats and   entertainment “option” are no longer optional. And no heading to the dealer across the street —  or the state line —  who’ll make you a better deal. The government has fixed the prices, the products, and the dealers. You may be shocked to hear that “ ” Republicans didn’t fix that. They’ll let you do without the car, but you can’t get a cheaper one. After all, the Obama car features are immensely popular. They are certainly popular with certain groups: Held explains that if Republicans retain the “’guaranteed   rating’ features that always and everywhere send premiums into the stratosphere,” insurers can’t price their products by level of risk, and premiums will still go higher. She urges Republicans to address “the entrenched flaws that keep the costs up” in health care. “We must continuously remind ourselves that the goal is survival of our patients, not the survival of big insurance corporations, political careers, and   parasites,” she asserts. “We need an ambulance not a Monster truck, and most importantly we must drain the swamp. ”",0
11762,Teacher Receives Pushback After She Compared a ’Build the Wall’ Shirt to a Swastika - Breitbart,"A Washington state middle school teacher received a lot of heat for her decision to pull aside a student wearing a “Build the Wall”  . [The Chinook Middle School language arts teacher, after pulling the student aside, compared the shirt’s message to wearing a swastika, the   Herald reported.  “She asked, ‘How would you feel if someone wore a   with a swastika on it?’ ” the student’s mother, Michelle Fischer, told the   Herald. “He said, ‘You can’t compare my shirt to wearing a swastika. They aren’t the same thing.’ ” Fischer said the teacher asked her son Jack to stay in her class during lunch to talk about the shirt and told him that it wasn’t appropriate to wear clothing with a political message. Jack responded to the teacher that he saw a math teacher wearing a shirt with Barack Obama on it. Fischer posted her outrage over the teacher’s handling of the situation on Facebook and it went viral, especially after conservative talk show host Sean Hannity shared it to his 2. 8 million followers. Fischer is hoping that her son’s experience makes it easier for other children to speak up about political bullying. “It does happen,” said Michelle Fischer. “I think (politics) should be taught in our schools, but only in a   positive way. ” Jack told her that the teacher had appeared opposed to Donald Trump since the beginning of the school year because of how she handled class discussions of the presidential election and the candidates. Fischer spoke with Chinook’s principal, Kevin Pierce, who said there was nothing wrong with the shirt. School district officials said appropriate action was taken against the teacher, but could not release details on personnel matters. The district said students are allowed to express their opinions so long as it doesn’t disrupt the education of others. “I think most parents would agree with me,” Fischer said. “If this was the other way around, I guarantee there would be some parents that were pretty upset. ” Students at other high schools around the country have also been harassed by school officials for wearing clothing in support of Trump. A student at a high school in South Portland, Oregon was harassed by school officials because he wore a hat with Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” in April 2016.",0
11763,"Israel’s Right, Cheering Donald Trump’s Win, Renews Calls to Abandon 2-State Solution - The New York Times","JERUSALEM  —   Emboldened by the Republican sweep of last week’s American elections,   members of the Israeli government have called anew for the abandonment of a   solution to the conflict with the Palestinians. “The combination of changes in the United States, in Europe and in the region provide Israel with a unique opportunity to reset and rethink everything,” Naftali Bennett, Israel’s education minister and the leader of the   Jewish Home party, told a gathering of the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem on Monday. Mr. Bennett, who advocates annexing 60 percent of the occupied West Bank to Israel, exulted on the morning after Donald J. Trump’s victory: “The era of a Palestinian state is over. ” That sentiment was only amplified when Jason Greenblatt, a lawyer and   of the Trump campaign’s Israel Advisory Committee, told Israel’s Army Radio that Mr. Trump did not consider West Bank settlements to be an obstacle to peace, in a stark reversal of longstanding American policy. Members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and other rightist politicians jumped to make hay of the change. Yoav Kish, a Likud member of Parliament, called for the expansion of Israeli sovereignty into the West Bank Meir Turgeman, the chairman of Jerusalem’s municipal planning committee, said he would now bring   plans for thousands of Jewish homes in the fiercely contested eastern part of the city up for approval. Aryeh Deri, the interior minister, who is   hailed Mr. Trump’s victory as a miracle, asserting it would lessen the influence of liberal,   streams of Judaism popular in America. He added, “We must truly be in Messianic times when everything will turn out favorably for the people of Israel. ” Mr. Netanyahu, whose previous three terms in office all coincided with Democratic administrations in the United States, has been more cautious. Adding to his troubles, Israel’s Supreme Court on Monday rejected a government request for a   delay of the demolition of an illegal West Bank outpost built on privately owned Palestinian land. The   demolition is slated for Dec. 25, and the government had argued for the delay in part to temper a potentially violent settler response. On Sunday, a ministerial committee of rightists within the Likud party and the governing coalition approved a contentious bill to retroactively legalize illegal settlement on privately owned Palestinian land. Prompted by the effort to salvage the Amona outpost, it may be a precursor of things to come. Although the   camp was promoting the bill long before Mr. Trump’s victory, the decision was taken, unusually, over Mr. Netanyahu’s vehement objections and despite his exhortations for it to be postponed. Tzipi Livni, a centrist former foreign minister and justice minister who now sits in the Parliamentary opposition, denounced the settlement bill, writing on Twitter that it constitutes “major damage to the rule of law at home, damage to Israel abroad, and primarily conveys a message that might makes right, when faced with a weak prime minister. ” Mr. Netanyahu warmly welcomed Mr. Trump’s victory, calling him “a true friend” of Israel. But Mr. Netanyahu has also since instructed his ministers and legislators to be discreet, saying the incoming administration should be allowed “to formulate  —   together with us  —   its policy    Israel and the region through accepted and quiet channels, and not via interviews and statements. ” Mr. Netanyahu endorsed the principle of a Palestinian state in 2009, under American pressure and with caveats. Since then, he has tried to balance between world opinion and his   constituency by declaring support for a solution based on two states for two peoples without going out of his way to advance it. Israeli analysts point out that the Trump campaign has spread contradictory messages. While many here assume that he will have more pressing priorities than the     conflict, Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that he would like to seal an   peace agreement, calling it the “ultimate deal. ” Mr. Netanyahu’s critics on the right, however, assume a Trump administration will at least give Israel a freer hand in areas like settlement construction. They say Mr. Netanyahu will have to decide which side he is on. Acknowledging that Mr. Trump’s positions are not entirely clear, Mr. Bennett, the leader of Jewish Home, said, “We have to say what we want first. ” Amit Segal, a political commentator for Israel’s popular Channel 2 News, said that during the tenures of Presidents Clinton and Obama, Mr. Netanyahu could “disguise his worldview. ” The Obama administration’s sharp condemnation of all settlement activity gave Mr. Netanyahu “the ultimate excuse” for not building with abandon in the West Bank, Mr. Segal said in an interview, adding, “I am not sure that the right wing, with its appetite, will be prepared to suffer another few years of that. ” Asked what Mr. Netanyahu would probably be rooting for, Israelis who generally reflect the prime minister’s thinking said he was unlikely to forswear the   solution. “Israel has its own interest in reaching a negotiated solution with its neighbors,” said Dore Gold, a longtime Netanyahu adviser who recently resigned from his position as director general of Israel’s foreign ministry. “This is not a function of pressure or  . Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it clear that this is his goal. ” But Mr. Gold suggested that a Trump administration was likely to roll back the demand that Israel withdraw to the 1967 lines and support borders that are more accommodating to Israel. “Trump’s policy paper spoke about Israel having defensible borders, which are clearly different from the 1967 lines,” he said. Michael B. Oren, a deputy minister in the prime minister’s office and a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, told Israel Radio: “We have to ask ourselves what is in Israel’s interests. The interest of the Israelis and, in my view, of the government, is indeed to achieve peace with the Palestinians through direct negotiations, without preconditions, at any time, in order to get to a solution of two states for two peoples. ” Gilead Sher, an Israeli former peace negotiator under the   governments of Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin, noted that although most of the Israeli governments over the past four decades had been   “never has one of them annexed one square inch of the West Bank. ” Mr. Sher, now a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, is also   of Blue White Future, an Israeli group advocating a   solution, by unilateral means if necessary. Of the rejoicing on the Israeli right, he said, “Most joyful moments are provisional and temporary. ”",0
11764,Instagram Beauty Used to Cry Looking in the Mirror. Now She’s Taking Off Her Makeup to Show What ‘Perfect’ People Can Hide,"Share on Twitter 
The seeming perfection we see in online photos can be disheartening when compared to the flaws we see in our own appearance. 
One popular blogger recently shared an honest selfie in an attempt to make a statement about happiness and beauty. A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Oct 26, 2016 at 3:42am PDT 
As Today reports, the Instagram feed for Beck Lomas, an Australian fitness and beauty blogger, usually contains the kinds of images that provoke envy: A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Sep 16, 2016 at 3:28pm PDT 
So when Lomas shared a decidedly unglamorous photo of herself without makeup, it stood out to her many fans: A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Sep 26, 2016 at 5:39am PDT 
Lomas writes that despite appearances, even she struggles with acne and skin problems that leave her feeling insecure: 
“THIS is my current situation. A pimply, bleeding, sore face. It doesn't look THAT bad, but it feels pre y bad. My skin will always be a journey in itself, I don't think I will ever be one of those girls who feels completely okay without makeup, but that's fine. Even when my skin is at its best, which does happen sometimes, when I don't have any big angry pimples and everything looks quite smooth, I'm still a little self conscious.” 
In a separate Instagram post , Lomas reveals just how much her bad skin used to affect her. A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Oct 17, 2016 at 6:39pm PDT 
At times, she was afraid to go out because she knew that makeup couldn't hide it completely: 
“I would feel self conscious and ugly around my boyfriend, my family, my friends, everyone. Some nights I would take my makeup off before the gym and look in the mirror and just bawl my eyes out, and I wouldn't even end up working out because I was so worried about how I looked.” 
Lomas goes on to explain that while she lacks confidence in her skin, she doesn't lack confidence in herself. Learning the difference, she says, was the key to feeling better about her flaws: 
“I've come a long way from the girl who used to cry every single night about the way her skin looked. These days my skin is just a minor downer for me sometimes. This post is just to show you all that you should be confident despite your little flaws.” 
By sharing her flaws with her fans, Lomas hopes that she can inspire them to be more forgiving of themselves. A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Sep 14, 2016 at 4:23pm PDT 
She also wants to make a point about beauty. Beauty, she says, isn't bound up in your skin or your physical flaws, but in your outlook: 
“Happy people are the most beautiful people, and I know it's hard to feel happy when you're focusing on your imperfections— but I just want to let you all know that you are beautiful EVEN if you have acne, or bacne, or cellulite, or your thighs touch or you've got stretch marks. You are beautiful and unique and amazing as you are, and being confident and happy and that will shine through and make you even more beautiful!” 
Lomas concludes the post by urging her followers not to let their imperfections destroy their confidence in who they are. A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Aug 18, 2016 at 7:42pm PDT 
Her honesty was appreciated by those who saw the photo, many of whom thanked her or spoke about how much they could relate to Lomas' struggle with her flaws. One commenter writes: 
“You're a beautiful girl inside and out. I'm sure you know this but I just wanted to tell you to be certain. Thanks for your authenticity. In a world full of fake, it's very refreshing.” 
Beck Lomas wants to remind her fans of an important lesson: 
“To anyone else who is struggling with skin issues— you aren't alone and things will get better, so just hang in there!” ",0
11765,Why Flu Shots Are the Greatest Medical Fraud in History,"Humans Are Free As one of the very few independent voices willing to stand up against the scientific dogma of our modern medical regime, I’ve long felt a need to communicate the dangers of flu shots to the public so that people can have better information to prevent vaccine injuries and save lives.
This doesn’t mean I’m opposed to the theory of vaccination, by the way. In fact, I’m the author of A Blueprint for Safer Vaccines , an audio guide to saving lives and preventing vaccine injuries and deaths. 
To my knowledge, I’m the only independent journalist in the world who is scientifically trained to run an atomic mass spectrometry laboratory, which I’ve been running for nearly a year now and testing the heavy metals content of organic superfoods like cacao , common vaccines as well as the ability of water filers to remove toxic heavy metals . 
I’m the creator of the Low Heavy Metals Verified standard and I’m the inventor of patent-pending nutritional formulas for capturing heavy metals during digestion and binding with the radioactive isotopes of cesium (such as Cesium-137) to eliminate them from the digestive tract. 
Both of these patents are on file with the U.S. patent office awaiting a decision. 
My independent atomic elemental analysis of flu vaccines, published in the summer of 2014, proved that flu vaccines contain over 50 ppm mercury, an extremely toxic heavy metal linked to kidney failure, birth defects, spontaneous abortions and neurological damage. 
This finding has never been refuted by anyone. 
In fact, it was affirmed by vaccine proponents who insisted that it is perfectly safe to inject pregnant women, young children and senior citizens with mercury even though the flu vaccine insert itself readily admits there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in such groups. 
Believe it or not, there are still millions of people, doctors, pharmacists and even journalists who do not yet realize there is a very high concentration of mercury in influenza vaccines given to pregnant women, children and senior citizens. 
Most people, you see, have been lied to by the media which has stated over and over again that mercury was removed from all vaccines. 
That’s simply not true. 
It’s still there. And toxic mercury is present in influenza vaccines at a level that’s literally 25,000 times higher than the EPA limit of mercury in drinking water. [7] It’s 100 times higher than the highest level of mercury contamination I’ve ever tested in ocean fish. 
See the evidence for yourself 
To prove the presence of mercury in influenza vaccines, I’m going to show you four irrefutable pieces of evidence: 
1) Photographs of a 2013 / 2014 influenza vaccine box admitting, in very small print, to the addition of mercury to the vaccine as a preservative. 
2) Photographs of the influenza vaccine insert once again repeating the admission that the vaccine contains mercury. 
3) A screen shot from the Centers for Disease Control website which admits that vaccines still contain the following ingredients: Aluminum, Antibiotics, Egg Protein, Formaldehyde, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) and Thimerosal, a mercury-containing chemical compound. 
4) Lab results from the Natural News Forensic Food Lab which confirmed almost precisely the same level of mercury claimed by the manufacturer (GlaxoSmithKline). 
Before I show you the irrefutable evidence, there is some good news in all this testing. 
As part of this Natural News investigation, I tested several different vaccines, including an HPV vaccine. 
Mercury levels were extremely low in these other vaccines. Only the flu shot contained extremely high mercury levels. 
Influenza vaccine box admits safety never established for pregnant women As you can see below, the box for this Flulaval Influenza Virus Vaccine readily admits the use of thimerosal which contains mercury. 
(Of course, you have to use a magnifying glass to see this.) 
In microscopic text on the package insert, it says straight out, “Register women who receive Flulaval while pregnant in the pregnancy registry by calling 1-888-452-9622.” 
Yet, at the same time, the insert also admits that “safety and efficacy have not been established in pregnant women.” 
In other words, this vaccine containing mercury is being promoted for use in pregnant women even when no safety in pregnant women has ever been established. 
It’s also important to note that when people are being given flu shots, they are never handed the package or the insert, so they have no opportunity to read any of this information unless they specifically ask for it. 
It’s not like a food item with a “Nutrition Facts” label. Vaccines are sold in “stealth” mode where patients have no idea what’s in them and no opportunity to read possible warnings. 
As further proof of this point, consider the fact that this flu vaccine comes with only one insert, yet it’s a 10-dose vial intended to be injected into 10 different people. 
Clearly, if there’s only one insert but 10 people, then 9 out of 10 people can’t possibly be handed the insert. 
Unethical medicine administered without informed consent (a violation of medical ethics) 
In fact, from a legal perspective, vaccines are routinely injected into people without informed consent. 
Virtually no one administering vaccines ever explains the risks vs. benefits of vaccines as is required under medical ethics and state medical law. 
In nearly all cases, patients are simply hoodwinked and told there are no risks at all. 
The second piece of evidence to reveal here is the package insert for the influenza vaccine, a document printed in microscopic text that’s almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. 
Of course, the intention is that no one ever read this document, because it contains shocking admissions of the total quackery and marketing deception behind flu shots. 
As you can see from this snapshot, the package insert readily admits that each vaccine dose “contains 50 mcg thimerosal (<25 mcg=”” mercury=”” p=””><25 br=”” mcg=”” mercury=””> In case you’re wondering, “mcg” means micrograms. A microgram is 1/1000th of a milligram. 
Mercury is toxic at any dose when injected into the body, even in micrograms. There is no such thing as a “safe” form of mercury when injected. 
In fact, the ethyl form of mercury used in vaccines is many times more toxic than methyl form once it enters human cells. 
Click here for a fascinating interview with mercury toxicity expert Dr. Chris Shade who explains this extremely important concept. 
The same paragraph shown above also admits the vaccine contains formaldehyde, a potent neurotoxic chemical. 
Vaccine insert admits safety and effectiveness have never been established<25 br=”” mcg=”” mercury=””> What’s even more astonishing about this insert is that it openly admits the flu shot is a complete medical hoax, backed by nothing but voodoo woo woo faith-based dogma (and clever marketing). 
Here are actual words from the insert (which is much more lengthy than the snapshot shown above): 
“There have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Flulaval.” 
“Safety and effectiveness of Flulaval have not been established in pregnant women, nursing mothers or children.” 
“Safety and effectiveness of Flulaval in pediatric patients have not been established.” 
“Flulaval has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.” 
“Do not administer Flulaval to anyone… following previous administration of any influenza vaccine.” 
CDC admits use of mercury, MSG, formaldehyde 
For those “mercury denialists” who still can’t believe flu shots given to pregnant women contain high concentrations of toxic mercury, even the CDC reluctantly admits this fact on its own website. 
Here’s a screen shot from the CDC’s vaccine additives page , which miraculously hasn’t yet been removed from their site: 
<25 br=”” mcg=”” mercury=””> Laboratory results from the Natural News Forensic Food Lab 
The final piece of irrefutable evidence on all this comes from my own scientific laboratory , where I run ICP-MS instrumentation to test foods, beverages, dietary supplements and other items for heavy metals contamination. 
I was the first food researcher to document high levels of tungsten in brown rice protein , and I’ve exposed alarming levels of lead in pet treats . I’ve also exposed high lead in ginkgo biloba herbal supplements imported from China . 
When I finally got around to testing vaccines, I was shocked to find over 51,000 ppb mercury in the Influenza Virus Vaccine. 
Why was I shocked? Because I don’t recall ever seeing anything run through my ICP-MS instrument with that high a concentration of mercury. 
The mercury in this flu vaccine was the HIGHEST concentration of mercury I’ve ever seen in anything, period! 
And this is a product that’s injected directly into the bodies of pregnant women, where mercury goes right into the developing fetus. 
What’s even more interesting is that this finding once again confirms the accuracy of my lab instrumentation because it’s almost in perfect agreement with the level of mercury detailed on the vaccine package insert. 
Let’s do the math: 
* Each dose of an influenza vaccine is 0.5 mL in volume * My lab found just over 50 ppm of mercury in the vaccine liquid. * 50 ppm (concentration) x 0.5 mL (volume) equals 25 mcg of mercury. 
Guess what the package insert says? (Up to) 25 mcg of mercury per dose. Near-perfect agreement, in other words. 
My finding of 51 ppm rather than 50 ppm either means my own tests were off by about 2% (which is still considered very accurate for ICP-MS testing) or that GSK put 2% extra mercury into the vaccine. 
And just so you know I actually did the tests, here’s what else we found with other analytes: 
Aluminum: 0.4 ppm Cadmium: zero Lead: zero 
So, I can confidently say that the flu vaccine won’t poison you with lead, cadmium or arsenic because it contains none of those things. 
Even the aluminum level is quite low and not a concern at this very low level. The real problem is just the mercury, at least as far as elements go. 
Why won’t vaccine makers remove the mercury? 
Good question. Everybody knows mercury is toxic to inject into the human body. That’s not debated except by irrational anti-science denialists who refuse to acknowledge the Table of Elements. 
You have to wonder: why choose mercury as a preservative? And why do both the CDC and FDA continue to look the other way as an entire branch of modern medicine poisons our women and children with a neurotoxic heavy metal? 
And if vaccine promoters, propagandists and patent holders want the world to accept all their vaccines, why don’t they just remove the mercury and be done with it? 
If they take out all the toxic elements, resistance to vaccines would all but evaporate. 
Why vaccines are the “anti-science” medical voodoo of the modern world Ever wonder why they don’t conduct legitimate clinical trials on flu vaccine efficacy? 
Probably because they know the results would have to be faked to show any efficacy at all. 
That’s what Merck did with its mumps vaccines, according to two former virologists who worked there. 
They spiked human blood samples with animal antibodies to fabricate positive results. 
Yep, vaccines work so poorly that even the manufacturers have to fake their own results to show any efficacy. 
Vaccines are the one medicine where no scientific evidence of safety or efficacy is required by anyone: not the FDA, not the CDC and not the media. 
Congress even passed a law protecting the vaccine industry with absolute legal immunity, even when they manufacture and sell defective products that injure and kill people . 
How’s that for medicine we can all trust? 
Think about it: this is a product that contains multiple neurotoxins in very high concentrations; a product backed by no safety trials or efficacy data; a product linked to numerous serious adverse reactions; and yet a product that enjoys absolute legal immunity thanks to the U.S. government. 
If that’s not outright medical quackery, I don’t know what is. 
For the record, I’m not an opponent of all vaccines. But I do believe — as do a rapidly increasing number of other clear-thinking people — that medicine should not poison our women and children . 
It’s time for mercury to be removed from all vaccines, once and for all. Anything less is medical negligence. 
New video interview about flu shot failures 
Ultimately, We the People will be victorious in the removal of mercury from all vaccines — an idea that’s already well accepted across much of Europe. 
And when that day comes, it will be yet another victory for the Natural News fan base, an amazing community of millions of remarkable people working together for the protection of our children, our health and our world.

11768,London Bridges Are Lighting Up - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   London’s bridges will slowly fill with light as the tide rises. Luminous colors will wash across their surfaces. Beams will shoot out from each bridge, pierce the sky and then drop, connecting with a beam on a neighboring bridge to trace the path of the Thames. The bridges’s underbellies will glow gently the banks will offer floating stages for performances waterfalls will create a screen for projections a weave of projected light planes will hover over the surface of the Thames, creating a ghostly river of light. These are some of the ideas put forward for what is being called the   permanent public art project that any city has yet undertaken. “Illuminated River” is a hugely ambitious, £20 million ($24. 8 million) plan to light the span of the Thames River from the Albert Bridge in the west to Tower Bridge in the east. (The money will come from private and philanthropic sources, with $12. 6 million already contributed by the Rothschild and the Arcadia foundations.) It aims to transform this part of the Thames into a glowing river of light and spectacle, and is part of the city’s ambition to match other international metropoles with a vibrant nighttime economy. The light project will also draw tourists to the bridges and banks of the Thames, which traces a loose S shape through central London, and has 17 bridges along its trajectory. The river is now “a black snake” through the city at night, Hannah Rothschild, the chairwoman of the Illuminated River Foundation, said at a preview on Monday of a   exhibition of the final proposals. With this project, she added, the transformation will be dramatic: “Light, energy, beauty, commerce, at the flick of a switch,” she said, adding that it was also a meeting point for art, design and technology. The six finalists were chosen from 105 entries, including   architects, designers, engineers and artists of all stripes from all over the world. The winning team will be announced on Dec. 8, and the organizers hope that the project will be started by 2018. Here is a flavor of what they propose for the Thames. The   architect David Adjaye, whose National Museum of African American History and Culture recently opened in Washington, has assembled a   list of international artists for the proposal: Doug Aitken, Jeremy Deller, Cai   Glenn Ligon, Chris Ofili and Philippe Parreno among them. Each was assigned a bridge, resulting in a cornucopia of spectacular light designs that treats each bridge as an individual artwork. The city’s bridges “have always been conceived of purely as infrastructure between north and south, but they actually encapsulate history and ideas about trade, labor, gender and race,” Mr. Adjaye said. “We really tried to match the narrative of each bridge with each artist’s practice. I decided not to try for a unified vision one of the great things about London is that it’s a medieval mosaic city. These are different artistic and architectural languages that come together to create a whole. ” Amanda Levete’s London architecture firm, AL_A, has collaborated with the filmmaker Asif Kapadia and the writer Simon Stephens as well as a team of engineers and sound designers to come up with a subtle project that ties the lighting of the bridges to the natural rhythms of the tides. “The idea that you can have an impact on the perception of the city without constructing anything was fascinating to me,” Ms. Levete said. “For us, the essence of the project is to tell a story about the river and how central it is to people’s lives. In the end, it’s a very simple narrative: the tides are a physical manifestation of the shape of the earth and the landmass of the U. K. and we want to reveal this through light. “The tidal range of the Thames is around 9 meters, the height of a   building, which is very unusual for a river in a city,” she continued. “We want to illuminate the shoreline as the tide goes out, inviting the public to appropriate that space at low tide. At high tide, the lighting shifts to illuminate the elevation of the bridges and show their structure. “In the space of two hours, you see the tidal change we want to remind people that their lives play out not in minutes and hours, but in the context of centuries, and the forces of nature,” she said. Light beams play tag in the design by these New   architects, who count the city’s elevated High Line and the Broad Museum in Los Angeles among their projects. Collaborating with the lighting designer Jennifer Tipton, they have created a proposal that includes curtains of falling water as screens for projections, and floating platforms along the riverbanks for performance. “We came up with the idea of concentrating on the performance of the lighting,” said Elizabeth Diller, a founding partner. “It starts when the sun goes down as it sets, the bridges start to fill with light, from the embankments towards the center. The moment that a particular degree of darkness arrives, it triggers the ‘night kiss,’ a vertical light pointed at the sky. This happens in tiny increments because the rotation of the earth means the moment of darkness is about 20 seconds apart from bridge to bridge. There is a pause, then soft white light comes up on each bridge, like a blossom. ” “We’re imagining the moment of the beams going up a bit like the chiming of Big Ben a moment of urban consciousness,” she said. “It’s an opportunity to pay attention to the transition between day and night, and to evoke a collectivity that is missing in our urban lifestyle. ” This   lighting firm, working with the artist Federico Pietrella, proposes subtle washes of light over the bridges and along their underbellies, with lights triggered by sunset and sunrise. Different styles of lampposts from around the world would be partly submerged in the water, symbolizing London as a place for international exchange. “When you walk along the river, you can see that every borough has its own aesthetic, which is very different to a more homogeneously designed city like Paris,” said Joseph Frey, one of the partners of the firm. “Our first intention is to clean up the light pollution along the Thames path buildings are lit very differently depending on where you are, and we would try to persuade the stakeholders that it’s a question of contrast there is no point spending a lot of energy and money to light the river if it’s not visually readable. “There is approximately a minute of light difference, when the sun rises or sets, between the outermost bridges we wanted to show the natural rhythms of the day, which of course are totally different in winter or summer,” he said. Sam Jacob, a   architect, and Simon Heijdens, a Dutch artist, have a poetic proposal that embodies the title of “Illuminated River”: a shimmering river of light hovering just above the surface of the Thames, created from light planes that are generated by data readings of the river’s depth, flow and surface tension. “It was hard to think what you could possibly do on that scale that would respect the variety and detail of the London riverscape and withstand the scale of the city,” Mr. Jacobs said. “London is a strange city, it has never been planned and doesn’t have an urban principle, but the river is the one unifying factor. ” Mr. Heijdens added: “It’s such a narrative surface: where you are, what time it is, what the weather is like. But most of that is lost at night when the Thames becomes a black hole. So we created a dimensional weave of light from flows of data from the river that are measured by a small unit on each bridge, and powered by the tides. ” The New York light artist Leo Villareal, who created the “Bay Lights” installation on San Francisco’s Bay Bridge, has worked with a team of London architects on a straightforward proposal that transforms the river bridges into light sculptures, washed by soft colors that one writer described as turning the Thames into “a giant linear lava lamp. ” “We wanted to create something cohesive to unify the bridges and create a ribbon of light,” Mr. Villareal said. “We also wanted to create a better atmosphere around the Thames, where there is a lot of commercial lighting, so we have proposals for tuning that light. We would replace much of the current bridge lighting with LED light, which makes it more energy efficient and adds dynamism through light and color. “I sometimes make monochromatic pieces, but here it felt appropriate to use color,” he continued. “An important element of the project is that it references the light and atmosphere of paintings of the bridges by artists like Turner and Monet. ” He added: “Lighting the undersides of the bridges is also important working with structure and finding a way to augment what exists is at the heart of this. These kinds of public art gestures are a gift and can be transformative they have the power to bring people together. ”",0
11769,Number of Swedish Children Wanting to Change Gender Doubling Each Year - Breitbart,"Sweden’s health minister has promised more support for gender identity clinics as it emerged that the number of children claiming to be in the wrong body has risen 100 per cent each year. [Louise Frisén, child psychiatrist at the Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital, told Aftonbladet that in 2016, the gender investigation team saw 197 children who were interested in ‘transitioning’ to becoming the opposite sex.  “There’s a 100 per cent increase in numbers each year, and the people we’re seeing are younger and younger and more and more children are coming at very young ages,” she said, adding that “the increase is identical on the adult side of things, too,” she said. Chief of Karolinska University Hospital’s gender identity team, Cecilia Dhejne, said the rise in children unhappy with having been born male or female reflects “greater openness” in Swedish society, but warned that resources are overstretched. “The problem in Sweden is that there’s a long wait for young people, both for initiating an investigation into their gender identity and then also for the different parts of treatment across the country after that. ” “It is worrying” said the   sexologist, cautioning that “having to wait in a queue can worsen the mental health of transgender people”. “It’s sad on an individual level when people feel bad about themselves, and on a wider level it’s much better that young people are able to get started with their lives so they can contribute to society,” said Ms. Dhejne. Sweden’s Public Health Minister Gabriel Wikström said: “It is totally unacceptable that there are deficiencies in care for transgender people at every stage of treatment. ” He told Aftonbladet the government had appointed a commission to investigate waiting times and gaps in care across the country, the results of which will be ready by October. “I believe [municipalities in Sweden] do the best they can with the resources they have, but unfortunately I think society has failed to do enough to listen to transgender people. As a result, we were not aware of the problems now being faced by that group. ” In recent years, left wing activists along with global media enterprises like National Geographic have worked hard to promote the concept of ‘transgender children’ but there is increasing evidence that gender ideology puts minors’ mental health at risk. There is also mounting evidence that children are too young to choose their gender. In June, the American College of Pediatricians released an open letter asserting that   trans children are psychologically confused. “Conditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse,” it read.",0
11770,Free Cash in Finland. Must Be Jobless. - The New York Times,"OULU, Finland  —   No one would confuse this frigid corner of northern Finland with Silicon Valley. Notched in low pine forests just 100 miles below the Arctic Circle, Oulu seems more likely to achieve dominance at herding reindeer than at nurturing technology  . But this city has roots as a hub for wireless communications, and keen aspirations in innovation. It also has thousands of skilled engineers in need of work. Many were laid off by Nokia, the Finnish company once synonymous with mobile telephones and more recently at risk of fading into oblivion. While entrepreneurs are eager to put these people to work, the rules of Finland’s generous social safety net effectively discourage this. Jobless people generally cannot earn additional income while collecting unemployment benefits or they risk losing that assistance. For   workers from Nokia, simply collecting a guaranteed unemployment check often presents a better financial proposition than taking a leap with a   in Finland, where a shaky technology industry is trying to find its footing again. Now, the Finnish government is exploring how to change that calculus, initiating an experiment in a form of social welfare: universal basic income. Early next year, the government plans to randomly select roughly 2, 000 unemployed people  —   from   coders to   construction workers. It will give them benefits automatically, absent bureaucratic hassle and minus penalties for amassing extra income. The government is eager to see what happens next. Will more people pursue jobs or start businesses? How many will stop working and squander their money on vodka? Will those liberated from the   entanglements of the unemployment system use their freedom to gain education, setting themselves up for promising new careers? These areas of inquiry extend beyond economic policy, into the realm of human nature. The answers  —   to be determined over a   trial  —   could shape social welfare policy far beyond Nordic terrain. In communities around the world, officials are exploring basic income as a way to lessen the vulnerabilities of working people exposed to the vagaries of global trade and automation. While basic income is still an emerging idea, one far from being deployed on a large scale, the growing experimentation underscores the deep need to find effective means to alleviate the perils of globalization. The search has gained an extraordinary sense of urgency as a wave of reactionary populism sweeps the globe, casting the elite establishment as the main beneficiary of economic forces that have hurt the working masses. Americans’ election of Donald J. Trump, who has vowed to radically constrain trade, and the stunning vote in Britain to abandon the European Union, have resounded as emergency sirens for global leaders. They must either update capitalism to share the spoils more equitably, or risk watching angry mobs dismantle the institutions that have underpinned economic policy since the end of World War II. Universal basic income is a catchall phrase that describes a range of proposals, but they generally share one feature: All people in society get a regular check from the government  —   regardless of their income or whether they work. These funds are supposed to guarantee food and shelter, enabling people to pursue their own betterment while contributing to society. A Silicon Valley   incubator, Y Combinator, is preparing a pilot project in Oakland, Calif. in which 100 families will receive unconditional cash grants ranging from $1, 000 to $2, 000 a month. Voters in Switzerland recently rejected a   scheme, but the French Senate approved a trial. Experiments are being readied in Canada and the Netherlands. The Indian government has been studying basic income as a means of alleviating poverty. “The last two years, there’s been an explosion of interest in basic income,” says Guy Standing, a research associate with the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, and a   of the Basic Income Earth Network, an institution created to promote the idea. “The elites realize that the inequalities are becoming politically dangerous. ” For generations, policy makers have sought the magic formula for   full employment, with nearly everyone who wants a job able to find one. Traditional unemployment insurance schemes were devised in an age when the cyclical nature of factory life was dominant. Workers who were idled in lean times could pay their bills using unemployment benefits while awaiting the inevitable return of flush ones. Universal basic income is gaining consideration in part as an acknowledgment that the labor market has changed so fundamentally that full employment may amount to a fantasy. Factories have been refashioned into   office spaces. Robots are replacing workers, while the gig economy turns   jobs into contract positions. Basic income is intended to be permanent, built for an age in which demand for labor may be perpetually slack. Whatever happens  —   say everyone becomes a   Uber driver, or Uber drivers are replaced by   cars  —   everyone can count on sustenance. Strikingly, basic income is being championed across the ideological spectrum. Utopian dreamers envision it as an emancipation from the meaninglessness of   work. People stuck in   jobs at   restaurants could abandon laboring over the fryolator in favor of growing organic vegetables and reading to their children. Labor advocates embrace basic income as a means of increasing bargaining power, enabling workers to eschew   wages while holding out for better. Libertarians see it as a means of shrinking government by consolidating social service programs. Liberals envision it as a way to remove the stigma of public assistance: Instead of standing in line at the grocery store bearing food stamps while suffering the judgment of other shoppers  —   Shouldn’t she be buying spinach instead of frozen pizza?  —   poor people would get the same check as everyone else. The technology world has seized on basic income as the response to automation and its threat of joblessness. If everyone’s needs are being met, then society can embrace robots and liberation from drudge work. Yet the expensive price tag attached to anything that is truly universal makes it a political nonstarter in many countries  —   especially in the United States, where Mr. Trump just appointed a labor secretary who is critical of simply raising the minimum wage. If every American were to receive just $10, 000 a year, the tab would be roughly $3 trillion a year, roughly eight times what the United States now spends on social service programs. The government might just as well commit to handing out unicorns. Beyond arithmetic, basic income confronts fundamental disagreements about human reality. If people are released from fears that  —   absent work  —   they risk finding themselves sleeping outdoors, will they devolve into freeloaders? “Some people think basic income will solve every problem under the sun, and some people think it’s from the hand of Satan and will destroy our work ethic,” says Olli Kangas, who oversees research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers many social welfare programs. “I’m hoping we can create some knowledge on this issue. ” Half a millennium ago, Thomas More’s seminal novel, “Utopia,” included the suggestion that public assistance might be a better way to deter thieves than a death sentence. More than two centuries later, the American revolutionary agitator Thomas Paine proposed creating a national pool of money distributed to every adult. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. promoted basic income. The libertarian economist Milton Friedman embraced a variant: negative income taxes that would put cash in the pockets of the poor. Yet with the exception of a few experiments, basic income has been confined to the margins of policy conversations. Until now. Finland’s concerns are pragmatic. The government has no interest in freeing wage earners to write poetry. It is eager to generate more jobs. The global financial crisis and its aftermath played out against a wrenching economic refashioning here. The growth of tablets and smartphones assailed a major industry, commercial paper manufacturing. A crisis in neighboring Russia diminished trade. Over the last decade, Finland’s economy has grown not at all. For workers, the shock has been cushioned by a comprehensive social welfare system. In the five years after suffering a job loss, a Finnish family of four that is eligible for housing assistance receives average benefits equal to 73 percent of previous wages, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That is nearly triple the level in the United States. But the social safety net also appears to be impeding the reinvigoration of the economy by discouraging unemployed people from working part time. “It always should be worth taking the job rather than staying home and taking the benefits,” says Finland’s minister for social affairs and health, Pirkko Mattila. “We have to take the risk to do this experiment. ” Oulu, a city of nearly 200, 000 people on the Nordic Sea, stands as a potentially fertile testing ground. In centuries past, inhabitants occupied themselves shipping salmon and tar upriver to Russia while trying not to freeze to death. More recently, the city has evolved into a center for wireless communications. Three years ago, Microsoft purchased Nokia’s handset business, raising local hopes of a revival. But last year, Microsoft went on to shutter the operation. Local Nokia jobs have been halved, falling to 2, 500 from 5, 000. Oulu’s unemployment rate now sits above 16 percent, more than double the national average. City leaders portray this as an opportunity to start over, describing a future centered on companies like Asmo Solutions. With its office in a     the company checks the boxes for requisite elements of a modern  . Coders stare into laptops while leaning against beanbag chairs arrayed across red shag carpeting. The founder, Asmo Saloranta, 35, wears a silver hoop earring, his blond hair pulled back into a ponytail. He used to be chief executive now he is chief visionary. He has designed a phone charger that draws power only when a phone is connected. Oulu is an ideal place to start a technology business, he says: “There are highly talented tech people. ” But hiring them is maddeningly complicated. Mr. Saloranta has his eyes on a former Nokia employee who is masterly at developing prototypes. He only needs him part time. He could pay 2, 000 euros a month (about $2, 090). Yet this potential hire is bringing home more than that via his unemployment benefits. “It’s more profitable for him to just wait at home for some ideal job,” Mr. Saloranta complains. Basic income would fix this, he says: “It would activate many more unemployed people. ” This is a part of the debate that often gets missed. Monthly checks for everyone may look like socialism, but proponents advance it as a way to invigorate capitalism. From Italy to India, companies that would like to leave behind unprofitable enterprises in favor of fresh pursuits hold back because of the expense and reputational damage of firing people. Basic income could be the tool that makes restructuring palatable. With basic income in place, companies might be more inclined to take a risk on hiring more aggressively  —   adding vigor to the local economy  —   knowing they have the freedom to be ruthless in cutting loose those workers who prove disappointing. “It does make it easier to have labor flexibility,” says Karl Widerquist, a philosopher at Georgetown University in Qatar, and a leading advocate for basic income. “I know that if I have to close down this operation, everyone is going to be O. K. ” People who lose jobs would do well to gain training in modern trades. On this point, economists universally concur. Yet in many countries, social welfare systems are so laden with rules that jobless people tend to acquire just one skill: They gain savvy in navigating the bureaucracy. This dependency is a key justification for basic income. If people receive money without having to endure appointments with government bureaucrats, they will have time for more productive exploits. “Basic income is kind of a symbol that we believe in your capacity and we think that you are actually able to do things which are beneficial to you, and also for your community,” says Heikki Hiilamo, a professor of social policy at Helsinki University. “It’s built on a kind of a positive view of human beings. People want to be autonomous. They want to improve their  . ” Jaana Matila has three degrees in computing and an obsessive interest in software, and intense aspirations to forge a career in the Oulu technology scene. What she does not have  —   has never had  —   is a   job. At 29, she has completed three unpaid internships. Her last stint ended when her employer folded. She teaches adults to swim. She catches freelance jobs, recently designing a website for a hair salon. Mostly, she lives on unemployment benefits  —   700 euros a month (about $732). Ms. Matila would like to do more freelance work, but she lives in fear of derailing her unemployment benefits. She is supposed to fill out forms that account for every bit of income while providing pay stubs, bank documents and work contracts. Earlier this year, she failed to secure a receipt for the swim lessons. While she tracked one down, she lost her benefits for a month. “I had to ask my boyfriend, ‘Can you give me some monthly money so I can buy some food? ’” she says. “It’s really frustrating. ” She thinks about starting a website. Mostly, though, she goes for walks through the forest with her dog. She frets that she is falling behind in skills as technology advances. “People in a disadvantaged position, they use a major part of their cognitive ability worrying about their lives, worrying about where they will get their next meal,” says Mikko Annala, a researcher at Demos Helsinki, a think tank. “What if we have this potential there that is continuously worrying about life, about making it? What if we can get that into use by giving them something? That is a hypothesis that we should absolutely test. ” The most compelling argument against basic income is the most obvious: If everyone gets money without a requirement to do anything, humans may become morally depraved slackers. Jari Viljala finds this notion ridiculous. An electrician by trade, Mr. Viljala is accustomed to braving Arctic blasts of wind in    temperatures while threading wires into the spines of new housing complexes. He has left his wife and two daughters behind for as long as eight months at a time to venture north for construction projects. His gaze intense, his arms covered in tattoos, he takes pride in his reputation as the guy who will do anything. “The dirtiest, trickiest job that no one else wanted to do,” he says, “I have always volunteered. ” But since the summer, Mr. Viljala has been out of work. His 3, 300 euros in monthly wages (about $3, 450) have given way to 650 euros (about $680) in monthly unemployment benefits. He needs money for new brakes on his    Ford sedan, which failed inspection. Without a car, he cannot get to what work he may secure. He also needs money to get current on the rent, having fallen more than two months behind. At 36, he is wiry and strong. He could earn additional cash on the side. But the unemployment rules say otherwise. So he stays home and does what he can  —   making dinner for his girls, doing the laundry. He rides the bus through the gray dawn to the unemployment office. He waits and he worries. He wonders how it makes any sense that an   man with every compulsion to work must stay idle to ensure that he can support his family.",0
11771,George Soros Funds Anti-Trump Riots Similarly to How He Funded the Ferguson Riots,"DOES SOMEONE BEHIND THE SCENES WANT TO SEE CIVIL WAR IN THE UNITED STATES? 
The answer is almost certainly yes. 
And it isn’t likely to settle down anytime in the next few days. (If you aren’t prepped for this, go here to learn how to stay safe .) 
Just a little background: this has been going on since the midst of the campaign when actors were hired on Craigslist and trained to disrupt rallies. 
For example, one Craigslist ad was answered by Paul Horner, who admitted he was paid $3,500 to cause a scene at a Trump event in Fountain Hills, Arizona. 
“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to…” ( source ) 
The same report goes on to say: 
When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally. 
“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back” 
You can also read this article , in which a quote caught on video from Project Veritas shows how the Clinton campaign caused disruptions via “bird-dogging.” THERE’S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT SOMEONE IS FUNDING THESE PROTESTS. 
An eyewitness in Austin, Texas spotted protesters being transported by chartered coach buses. 
Then there was this Craigslist ad. 

There are many more tweets along these lines, but suffice it to say, suspicion is high that these, just like the Clinton campaign, are rigged to manipulate the American people. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO CAUSE ALL THIS TROUBLE? 
That’s where the web gets tangled. It certainly seems counterproductive to set fire to America. After all, what these people are doing is likely to end up with more tyranny – like martial law, for example. 
Exactly. 
That’s precisely the plan. 
Back in August, hackers from a group called DC Leaks got into the private documents of the Open Society, an organization founded by George Soros. Soros, whom DC Leaks referred to as “the architect and sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years” is a pro-globalist billionaire who has been trying to take over the world via shadow government for decades. 
Zero Hedge reported on the findings in the Soros leak: 
The documents are from multiple departments of Soros’ organizations. Soros’ the Open Society Foundations seems to be the group with the most documents in the leak. Files come from sections representing almost all geographical regions in the world, from the USA, to Europe, Eurasia, Asia, Latin, America, Africa, the World Bank “the President’s Office”, as well as an unknown entity named SOUK. As the Daily Caller notes , there are documents dating from at least 2008 to 2016. Documents in the leak range from research papers such as “ EUROPEAN CRISIS: Key Developments of the Past 48 Hours ” focusing on the impact of the refugee crisis, to a document titled “ The Ukraine debate in Germany “, to an update specific financials of grants. They reveal work plans, strategies, priorities and other activities by Soros, and include reports on European elections, migration and asylum in Europe. An email leaked by WikiLeaks earlier this week showed Soros had advised Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State on how to handle unrest in Albania – advice she acted on. 
As well, it’s important to note that Soros provided a whopping $33 million to activists in Ferguson, Missouri, escalating a protest to a siege. The Washington Times reported: 
…liberal billionaire George Soros , who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts American politics and policy, not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org. 
Mr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The Washington Times. 
In all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson , according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations… EVERYDAY CARRY GEAR – 11 ITEMS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE ON YOU (AD) 
This is business as usual for the OSF (Open Society Foundation), as explained by director Kenneth Zimmerman : 
Mr. Zimmerman said OSF has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early ’90s, and that, although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of Mr. Soros’ grants, they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of Open Society . 
“The incidents, whether in Staten Island, Cleveland or Ferguson , were spontaneous protests — we don’t have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say,” Mr. Zimmerman said. “But these circumstances focused people’s attention — and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like Ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation.” 
Soros -sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in Ferguson , building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign. 
Other Soros -funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep, and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive. 
The plethora of organizations involved not only shared Mr. Soros ‘ funding, but they also fed off each other, using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on another’s website, referencing each other’s news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of Facebook “likes” and Twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds. 
Soros was busted for paying protesters to go into Ferguson and stir things up. This is not theory. It’s FACT. The Daily Mail reported that Soros spent $33 million to bankroll the protests. The Washington Times reported that it was totally cool, though, because humanitarian that he is, Soros just wanted to help the civil rights movement . What a guy. Of course, this seems to be a thing with the kabillionaires. The Ford Foundation and Rockefeller foundation also fund “social activism.” Which is kabillionaire code for “mess stuff up and wreak havoc.” 
Keep in mind that the organization Black Lives Matter was born through the Ferguson riots. DOES THIS LOOK FAMILIAR? 
If the Modus Operandi in these protests looks familiar, that’s because MoveOn.org is organizing a lot of them, and MoveOn is funded by …you guessed it: George Soros. The organization was originally founded to combat the impeachment of Bill Clinton…are you seeing a link here? Another proud instigator is the Answer Coalition which also – are you sitting down? Has links to Soros . 
There are a lot of people who are out there because they genuinely oppose a Trump presidency. The unfortunate thing is, their opposition comes from propaganda that they passionately believe. They are acting based on misinformation and they’re being professionally manipulated. 
The next step here is martial law, which nobody wants. 
Well, nobody except George Soros and friends. 
Someone who wants to see America ripped apart is causing this division. Last summer, it was leaked that Soros attempted to destabilize Russia and depose Putin in 2012. Putin responded by banning Soros and all of his organizations from Russia. In 2014, Putin issued an international arrest warrant for Soros. 
We could certainly improve both international relationships and our current situation by extraditing Soros immediately.

11772,"After a Breakup, an App to Help Breathe, Then Run - The New York Times","“When was the last time you breathed properly?” the therapist asked me. His name was Allan. Thirty minutes into my first visit, I was still waiting for him to reach the part where he would help me get over the end of my relationship. “I’m not sure what you mean,” I said. “Easy, open breathing. Big lungfuls of air. ” “I don’t know,” I said. “I breathe all the time. ” I tried steering the conversation myself. “I just think I need to work out what happened  —   —   ” “I’m not interested in what happened,” he said. “I’m interested in the last time you breathed normally. You’re a young, healthy woman. But your paperwork tells me you’re struggling at work, haven’t eaten a full meal in weeks and can’t sleep. You need to fix that. ” I thought therapy would help convince me that the loss of the person I had been devoted to for years was a good thing. Instead, something in Allan’s blunt insistence on the symptoms and not the cause had put me on my heels. He peered over his notepad. “You’re all hunched up,” he said. “You look miserable. Your homework for next week is to do the exercises I’ll email you. You’ve got six sessions, and I want you breathing and sleeping properly by the end of it. ” Cycling home afterward, I had already dismissed Allan’s words and returned to my regular programming: raking through the seven years since I had met my ex, mining memories for details of where it went wrong. We had started with two years of silent longing (me) and dating other people (him) before finally feeling our way into a life and home together in London. Until one painful, protracted summer, he left. I had always prided myself on being strong, on being able to bounce back, but here I was, months later, wrestling with questions without answers at night and awakening to a frightening bleakness. Lying awake that evening, I wondered if I was making a mistake in outsourcing my problems. Allan’s focus on breathing sounded suspiciously like mindfulness to me. I had another long night ahead, though, so I groped around the bedsheets for my phone, and that’s when I saw his promised email. “Download the app in the link below,” it read. “When you use it, imagine a place you feel happy and safe. Hold that image in your mind. Then focus on your breathing. Use the app each night before you go to sleep. Exercise. ” My mind cast around for the prescribed happy place, settling on a pebble beach on the south coast of England where I had spent childhood summers. I tried to remember its hard, smooth stones, the sounds of my brother yelling from the sea. The app, Positivity with Andrew Johnson, started. In a Scottish burr, a man counted down from 10. With a twinge of curiosity, I tried breathing in. Allan had a point: My chest was tight with tension. I attempted to push the air down, and my tummy distended like a child’s. As I tried to synchronize my breathing, the vision of the beach kept escaping and then reappearing, interrupted by jags of thought. Still, I kept trying every night. Learning how to breathe was at least something different, a quick break from analyzing my own   love story with exhausting precision. When I visited Allan a few weeks later, our conversation turned to intuition. “What does your gut tell you about what you should be doing?” he asked. “My gut?” I felt embarrassed. “I don’t feel anything in there. ” I looked down hopefully at my stomach. Privately, I had always wondered what people meant by intuition. “You mentioned that you were nervous, that you often experienced anxiety from the start of the year,” he said. “Why do you think that was?” I have always relied on the flush of adrenaline to get stuff done. Yet a deeper, more frantic energy than usual had seeped in during the months before my boyfriend left. This tension pushed the vacuum cleaner faster round the living room and infused the meals I had started to make from cookbooks. Our apartment had never looked so tidy. On rainy Sundays, I urged him to make plans for a trip to Paris, which he wasn’t keen on. “I find it hard to believe that my body knew something was up before my brain did,” I said, petulance creeping into my voice. “Intuition is a sense developed from your past experiences, books you’ve read, sounds on the street, conversations, facial expressions,” Allan said. “All valuable information. It can help you to distinguish between what is real and what is fake, to notice something dangerous. Perhaps you trust your thoughts more, though. ” “Thoughts are all I have, surely,” I said. “That’s where all that information ends up getting used. ” “There’s plenty of research that would disagree with you. Why not try listening to your body instead of your head? That’s where all your feelings have been coming from. ” Feelings. We hadn’t talked about feelings at all. But as the weeks passed, I found that painful emotions, long ossified and remote, began overtaking me in humiliating ways. Tears streamed down my face in supermarkets my shoulders heaved silently on family car trips. My feelings were like the drunk who shows up too late to the party, misjudging the mood. Yet it was a strange relief to find I was capable of them. The tears were new, and they felt animal. Salt burned a rash around my eyelids in a way that I suspected wasn’t entirely about the end of a relationship. The breakup had done something else: It had caused a crack, and the breathing only seemed to be making it wider. Earlier,   secrets and disasters found the fissure and out they came, noisily, messily. They had been quiet for years, but now they wanted water and air. In Allan’s company, I seemed to spend increasing amounts of time feeling like an idiot. “I’m not trying to be difficult  —   —   ” He suddenly sounded kind. “I don’t think you are,” he said. “But deep down, people often know when something is coming. When something has to change. ” The last time I spoke to Allan was on the phone I had work I couldn’t get out of. He was as unrepentantly to the point as ever. “It’s fine,” he said as I apologized. “You’ll be fine. But I wanted to say, if your   comes back, think seriously. Good luck. And don’t forget to fill in the feedback form. ” Later that day, from across my office desk, my phone pinged. It was a message from my ex: “Do you want to meet up? I’d like to speak to you. ” How had Allan foreseen that? The old love drew me back in, even when reduced to digital form. “When?” I replied. “Where do you want to meet up?” A few days later, after an evening of stilted small talk in a pub, we stood together on a London street streaming with people. It was a sharp, clear November night. I felt blindsided. Ten minutes earlier he had stared cryptically into my face and said: “I think we should try again. I miss you. ” Words I had been willing him to say. “I understand this is a surprise,” he said. “I’ll wait for you to decide. ” “I don’t know what to say,” I mumbled. But then there was the beach. I had found that the more time I spent imagining that beach, the better I felt, the more I noticed things. That afternoon, for example, I had enjoyed how the cold air smelled of bonfires. Even now, flooded with fear, I had briefly thought how cheerful the city’s scarlet buses looked as they slid past in the dark. I could see him waiting for a response, but I stood dumb. The traffic roared and I could feel my feet vibrating with the pavement. Cold wind brushed past, goading me. It was all in league with a new, internal voice, one that spoke quietly and unexpectedly. “Leave him,” it said. “Take what you have and run. ” So with hardly a word, I turned and ran for the bus. That was a couple of years ago. Allan gave me no cure for heartbreak, but he did teach me some things. To look after my body, to pay it respect. To question my mind, which doesn’t understand half as much as it thinks it does. To understand that the time spent in the gap between the endless stories we tell ourselves is the present. These days, I care more about being peaceful and happy than about being in love. I’m not sure love is love if it consumes you, if it dominates your thoughts. Perhaps that’s something else: obsession, limerence. While it’s a trip to get lost in a relationship, finding yourself again can prove   and costly. But breathing freely, feeling alert to the world and being in touch with your emotions? Just $2. 99 at the app store. And a lot of work. Next I’d like to try having love and happiness at the same time, though. I’ve heard it’s possible.",0
11773,Marvel Comics Cancels Black Lives Matter-Themed ’Black Panther’ Due to Poor Sales,"Marvel Comics has canceled its Black Lives   comic book Black Panther  The Crew due to poor sales, according to reports. [The comic book  —   written by activist author   Coates  —   was canceled after only two issues but is expected to finish out the remainder of its   run, The Verge reported.  The comic features a group of   superheroes including Black Panther, Misty Knight, Luke Cage and Storm  —   the only white person in the “crew” is Kung Fu hero Iron Fist  —   and their investigation into the case of a black civil rights activist who died in police custody in New York City’s famed Harlem neighborhood. The story is set in a New York City patrolled by robot police officers instead of human officials, but much of the plot appears to derive thematically from the Black Lives Matter playbook, with cops beating up minorities for little to no reason and groups of local citizens on the verge of riots over it all. Coates assured fans that with its last few issues, the comic’s storyline would be wrapped up and the mystery of who killed the civil rights activist would be solved. Naturally, the liberal comics community is upset that Marvel has canceled the Black Lives   title. Gawker site Gizmodo complained that Marvel spent no resources advertising or pushing the comic on fans. The site also proclaimed the cancellation “keenly disappointing. ” The cancellation of Black Panther  The Crew comes shortly after a Marvel executive noted during an industry event that comics focused specifically on featuring diverse characters are not selling well. Speaking at a Marvel retailer summit at the end of March, David Gabriel, Marvel’s vice president of sales, said the company had heard that customers “didn’t want” any more diverse characters. “I don’t know that that’s really true, but that’s what we saw in sales,” Gabriel said. “Any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up. ” The executive made his comments based on recent sales figures but later tried to roll it back after a backlash in the liberal comic book community slammed him as racist. Gabriel later noted that Marvel is still “proud and excited to keep introducing unique characters that reflect new voices and new experiences into the Marvel universe and pair them with our iconic heroes. ” The cancellation also comes ahead of Marvel’s next   adaptation of the Black Panther character. Actor Chadwick Boseman will play the character in Marvel’s Black Panther, due out in February 2018.

11774,"A Traveler’s Guide to Customs: When to Shake Hands, Hug or Kiss - The New York Times","You’ve just landed in Beijing, Rio de Janeiro or Christchurch, New Zealand, and you’re greeted at the airport by a clutch of adoring locals. What is the polite way to greet them? Do you bow, or proffer your hand, or prepare to envelop the assembled strangers in an   embrace? More important: To kiss or not to kiss? The world may be increasingly globalized, but when it comes to greeting practices, local customs still prevail  —   and things can get awkward when, say, a   American businessman meets his Japanese counterpart for the first time. (Best just to bow.) If you find yourself facing a group of native Maoris in New Zealand, you’ll want to steel yourself for a traditional nose greeting, which involves touching snouts and foreheads. In Rio, local convention dictates three cheek kisses. But a few hours’ drive to the south in São Paulo, the single peck prevails. In Beijing, the locals prefer a nod and a smile. In the interests of international fellowship and peace, here is an incomplete guide to world greetings. In much of Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, air kissing between strangers is common, but each nation, and in some cases each region within a country, may have its own habits. Argentine men will   one another, but only if they are friends of friends. In most of the Arab world, a double air kiss is obligatory, though only between people of the same sex. Things can get complicated in France, as this map suggests: Expect anywhere from four kisses (in Nantes) down to two (in Toulouse) or just a single peck (in Brest). The general rule is that lips should never touch cheek, though a faint smooching sound is expected. In most of Northern Europe, a firm handshake will usually suffice between strangers, and a single kiss for friends. “Firm” doesn’t begin to describe the obligatory handshake between two unacquainted men in Russia, which can feel like a test of strength with near   results. And there’s a taboo about shaking hands across the threshold of a home: Wait until you are both on the same side of the door. When kisses are called for, where do you aim? In Portugal, the kissing usually progresses from left to right, but in Strasbourg, France, it’s right to left. Kissing or touching strangers is frowned upon in Asia. The customary greeting in Thailand involves a bow with the palms pressed together, as if in prayer similar gestures are common from Cambodia to Indonesia. In India, a limp handshake between men is fine, but don’t try it with a member of the opposite sex. The traditional way to greet an Indian elder is to bend down and touch his feet. Tibetans have one of the most unusual traditional gestures for greeting others: They stick out their tongues  —   though always from a safe distance.",0
11775,How Trump Can Improve the Messy U.S.-Chinese Economic Relationship - The New York Times,"The United States and China are locked in a mutually dependent, frequently dysfunctional economic partnership. The world’s biggest and   economies are like a married couple that complain about each other constantly yet can’t even contemplate a divorce. The marriage enters a new phase Thursday, as President Xi Jinping of China visits for two days of meetings at the Florida estate of a president who made China a punching bag on the campaign trail. The question is whether President Trump can turn his bellicose language into concrete gains for American companies and workers. A look at the economics of the relationship between the nations, and conversations with former officials with battle scars from past negotiations, show a path for getting a better deal. That path to success may not include the kind of flashy,   announcements that the Trump administration has tended to celebrate. In February, Mr. Trump called China the “grand champions at manipulation of currency. ” During the campaign, too, he frequently assailed China for artificially reducing the value of the renminbi to favor its companies versus American and other competitors. It is a view that is outdated. For years, China did intervene in financial markets to depress the value of its currency. But now it is intervening to keep the yuan from falling  —   actually doing the opposite of what Mr. Trump alleged. Economists generally think that the Chinese currency is close to the levels that would be set by purely market forces. That doesn’t mean currencies shouldn’t come up at   . This moment of relative peace between the countries on currency policy could be the ideal time to develop an understanding for the future. “I think currency is still an issue, but it doesn’t make sense to discuss it under the rubric of manipulation,” said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “China is managing its currency it’s just that it’s managing it right now in a way that is relatively advantageous to the United States. That understanding of how China intends to manage its currency in the future remains a   issue. ” In other words, Mr. Trump could use this moment not to beat China over the head about what happened in the past, or where things stand today, but to develop an agreement on what it will do in the future, if a day comes when market forces start pushing the yuan upward. Mr. Trump has similarly assailed the United States trade deficit with China and other countries, often characterizing it as a scorecard, evidence that China is winning at trade and the United States losing, to the tune of $310 billion a year. The reality is more nuanced. The persistent trade deficit is indeed problematic, but that’s because of the factors that drive it and the imbalances they cause to build. Simply targeting a lower trade deficit could well leave both American and Chinese workers worse off, if carried out the wrong way. For example, a trade war that significantly reduces American imports from China while also reducing American exports to China would reduce the trade deficit but would mean lower incomes and fewer jobs in both countries. The U. S.  trade imbalance is indeed driven in part by trade barriers that China enacts against American companies, including a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles and various quotas and restrictions that reduce agricultural imports. If Mr. Trump can persuade China to loosen those restrictions, it might close the trade deficit by increasing American exports  —   the healthy kind of trade rebalancing. But the trade gap isn’t driven just by the details of trade arrangements. It is also driven by the flow of capital between countries. To oversimplify, when a company sells more abroad than it buys, it has to do something with that money. The flip side of a current account deficit, as an economist might put it, is a capital account surplus. China’s trade imbalances are a function not only of its trade practices, but also of its very high levels of savings, which are in turn invested around the world. For China to change that, it would have to change the very structure of its economy: away from savings and   infrastructure investments, and toward consumer demand  —   including for products made both domestically and abroad. If the Trump administration really wants the trade deficit with China to come down over time, it’s not enough to look at only one side of the international economic ledger  —   flows of goods  —   while ignoring the flow of capital. In practice, this would mean making demands on some issues that might seem like purely domestic concerns only tangentially related to trade. That might include pushing China to allow more troubled   enterprises to fail, so that their accumulated profits might be spread through the Chinese economy instead of funneled toward the purchase of foreign assets. A more generous pension system might spur demand among older Chinese citizens. If China allowed global financial companies more access to its market, it could both encourage more domestic spending and give a major American industry an opportunity it has long sought. President Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker, and his negotiating style is to lay out extreme requests in order to work back to agreement. But resetting economic relations with China will prove trickier than any real estate deal. One of the fundamental realities of the relationship is that while neither side is wholly comfortable with how it works, these are big, powerful countries that can’t be easily swayed by what a country on the other side of the Pacific Ocean wants to happen. The leverage that each side has to deploy is limited  —   at least so long as neither country is willing to shoot itself in the foot. So, for example, in trying to get more favorable Chinese treatment of American goods and services, the standard menu of carrots Mr. Trump has to offer for compliance is relatively modest. China wants things like United States membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank that it started, and support for its “One Belt, One Road” program to build better transportation infrastructure stretching from Southeast Asia to Europe. Bigger Chinese goals, like achieving “market economy” status in the World Trade Organization, are likely to be nonstarters unless the country makes major progress on allowing international companies better access to its market. The United States could conceivably have more negotiating leverage by threatening punitive tariffs or other aggressive measures, as Mr. Trump did during his campaign, but those actions are just as likely to produce a painful blowback from China that damages the United States. Then there are noneconomic issues, which invariably could shape the contours of economic relationships. “In the Obama administration, China was a good citizen cooperating with us on Iran sanctions and on climate change, which I think made it hard for the U. S. to contemplate anything that harsh in the trade arena,” said David Dollar, a former Treasury Department official in Beijing and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “You could have something similar if the Trump administration wants China to cooperate more on North Korea. That could be hard to turn around and be harsh on them in the economic realm. ” Mr. Trump likes to announce big splashy deals, and given that the Chinese are looking for places to invest their capital in the United States, it would be easy enough to find something along those lines to announce. But in the context of the two giant economies, that kind of thing is small bore. This flawed economic relationship has been building for a long time, and the fixes are unlikely to come overnight. “Mr. Trump ought to pick the right fights rather than focus on issues that resonate with his political base but which are unlikely to help U. S. economic interest in either the short term or long run,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell and author of “Gaining Currency,” a book about China’s role in global finance. It’s unlikely that the first meeting between the new president and the Chinese leader will resolve issues that have been building for years or even decades. Rather, those who have worked in diplomacy advise looking beyond the current headlines to make progress on lowering Chinese trade barriers, increasing its domestic savings and committing not to return to the days of manipulating its currency lower. When you’re talking about commerce between two superpowers, things don’t change overnight.",0
11776,California Today: Defying Trump With Sanctuary Bill - The New York Times," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. Another day, another example of California’s continued fight with the Trump administration. The State Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation Monday that essentially turns California into a   “sanctuary state” for undocumented immigrants. The bill expands protections for immigrants at a time when the Trump administration has expanded who is considered a priority for deportation. The legislation prohibits any state or local law enforcement agency from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations. Under the legislation, county jails would not be able to allow officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to work inside the jails or notify them when a prisoner is being released. After the bill came under fierce criticism from the California State Sheriffs’ Association, it was amended to allow local law enforcement officials to notify ICE of the release date of serious and violent felons. It also enables local law enforcement officers to alert federal officials if they come across someone who has a violent felony record and has been previously deported. Language in the bill was also changed to explicitly allow local agencies to participate in task forces even if they include immigration enforcement in investigations. The amendments did little to mollify the opposition. One Republican senator warned that the Legislature would be “kicking the president right in the groin,” with the law and warned that “he will strike back. ” After the vote, Kevin de León, the leader of the state Senate and sponsor of the bill, said, “Our communities will become more, not less, dangerous if local police are enlisted to enforce federal immigration laws. ” He called the passage of the bill a “rejection of President Trump’s false and cynical portrayal of undocumented immigrants as a lawless community. ” Just before the Senate passed the sanctuary state bill, lawmakers approved legislation to start a fund that would pay for lawyers for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Several Republicans spoke out against the legislation, saying it was an unfair use of taxpayer money and also contradicted the idea that the state wants to stay out of immigration enforcement. Both bills will now move to the Assembly. Gov. Jerry Brown has not indicated whether he would sign either one.

[The New York Times] Some visitors to Big Sur go bird watching or relax with a novel at a seaside resort. Others suspend themselves high above the Pacific’s crashing waves on a narrow strip of nylon known as a slackline. Billy Rudiger, a reader in Carmel, shared a photo he captured of a slackliner traversing a cove just south of Monterey last November. Rope walking has existed for centuries. But the origins of the modern slackline, flat webbing strung loose enough to bounce like a trampoline, usually between two trees, is traced to Yosemite rock climbers in the early 1980s. It quickly grew into a   sport. In the last five or so years, social media has helped to propel its popularity. The pinnacle of the sport is a variation known as highlining, meaning the line is affixed at height. Highliners wear tethers, though a small number of elite practitioners sometimes go without. Injuries can happen, but they are usually of the sprained ankle variety and involve lines a few feet off the ground, said Sonya Iverson, president of Slackline U. S. a group that promotes the sport. “We aren’t daredevils or ” she said. Slackliners talk about the practice as a metaphor for the art of living  —   “balancing everything on the line to demonstrate life’s possibilities,” as the famed climber and highliner Dean Potter put it. For Ryan Robinson, 34, the highliner in Mr. Rudiger’s photo, the blue ocean juxtaposed against the jagged rocks represented a cathedral of sorts. “It’s such a beautiful place,” he said. “It’s nice to pay respect in a very unique way. ” California Today goes live at 6 a. m.

11777,A Disobedient Woman - The New York Times,"As the judicial secretary in a court devoted to   cases in Nicaragua, I transcribe everything said in our hearings. So I remember the day this one couple came in. They arrived at the courthouse well dressed. The husband was large and stocky, and the wife was in slacks and a blouse, thin and   with curly hair and a delicate face. She looked frightened. I typed as the prosecutor laid out the details of the case. They were each  . They owned a farm outside town. The wife had gone to church without her husband’s permission. When the husband found out, he went to the church and dragged her out by the hair. He took her home, forced her onto their bed, hit her and began to squeeze her neck. Luckily one of their children showed up at the house just then and interrupted him. He might have choked her to death. Then it was time for the wife to speak. “It was my fault, your honor,” she said. “I didn’t ask his permission to go to church. ” That’s when I said to myself: This poor woman is exactly how I used to be. When I was in high school, I met and fell in love with a schoolmate. He was religious and hardworking. He didn’t drink, and he belonged to a good family. Even though my mother didn’t approve  —   she scolded me for going out to see him  —   I left school and moved in with him. We married and had three children very quickly. Then, when I was 21, after my youngest was born, I wanted to go back to high school. I didn’t want to keep washing dishes and doing housework forever. Married women were allowed to go only to night classes, but I wanted to study during the day with the regular students. O. K. the teacher said, but you have to wear the uniform. It’s a pleated blue skirt with a white shirt tucked in, the blue and white for the flag of Nicaragua, with these long white socks up to the knee. My youngest was only 3 months old, and I was still nursing. Sometimes my breasts filled up and leaked through my uniform. I didn’t care. But my husband did. He didn’t want me to go back to school. He said that married women were supposed to stay home, taking care of the children and doing house chores, and that the ones who wanted to study were sluts  —   what they do is look for men. He was no longer the person I met now he cursed and went out drinking. He began to treat me badly. But I couldn’t leave. By then my mother was barely getting by, and there was no one else  —   no friends or family members  —   to help support me or my kids. Too bad, I told myself. I’ll just have to endure it. My husband tried to stop me from studying any way he could. One day he showed up at school to spy on me. Other times he got my uniform dirty or tore up my notebooks. I would buy new ones and copy my assignments all over again. He would tear them up again, and I’d copy them again. He got bored of it before I did. Finally I finished high school, and I wanted to go to university. My husband refused to give me the money, even for a notebook. I heard that the courthouse was looking for someone to mop the floors and clean the shutters. I wasn’t even an official employee. The judges paid me 300 córdobas a month (about $20 at the time) out of their own salaries. My husband was furious about it. In calmer moments, he would try to reason with me: “Why do you need to work when I provide everything you need? The rice, the beans, everything?” “But I don’t want to be a housewife,” I told him. “I want to be something. ” With the money I earned cleaning, I got my bachelor’s degree in social studies. Then I began to clean a second courthouse, so that was 600 córdobas a month. When the two courts eventually merged, they hired me as the custodian officially. Some time later, my boss, a woman, encouraged me to study law. It was only after I became a lawyer several years ago that I started earning enough money to support myself and my kids on my own. Finally I didn’t have to put up with this man anymore. So I divorced him. Now, in the hearing, I looked at this wife. The judge, who was a woman, said to her: “You have to ask permission to go to church?” “Yes,” the wife said. “No, ma’am,” the judge said. “We don’t have to ask for permission. We’re not the property of anybody. ” But I knew how hard it would be for the woman to learn what, after so long, I finally understood.",0
11778,How Gretchen Carlson Took On the Chief of Fox News - The New York Times,"On June 21, Gretchen Carlson devoted the closing minutes of her afternoon Fox News show, “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson,” to discussion of a milestone: She turned 50 that day. “I know, normally folks on TV wouldn’t readily admit their age, but since there’s nothing you can do about it, you might as well own it and be happy,” she said with a laugh. “And, boy, do I have so much to be grateful for. ” Two days later, she was summoned to a postshow meeting with a Fox News executive and told that, after 11 years at the network, her contract was not being renewed. The meeting took less than a minute, according to her lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith. On Wednesday, Ms. Carlson sent shock waves through the media world when she filed a lawsuit against the powerful Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, accusing him, among other things, of sexual harassment and sexism. The news channel’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, said that it was conducting an internal review of the matter. Mr. Ailes denied the charges, and said that the “disappointingly low ratings” for Ms. Carlson’s show was the reason she was let go. “When Fox News did not commence any negotiations to renew her contract, Ms. Carlson became aware that her career with the network was likely over and conveniently began to pursue a lawsuit,” he said in a statement. Though a prominent personality at Fox for many years, Ms. Carlson does not have the star power at the network of Megyn Kelly or Bill O’Reilly. But within minutes of the lawsuit going public, Ms. Carlson became a person of enormous interest in the world of television news. Ms. Carlson grew up in Anoka, Minn. where the future Congresswoman Michele Bachmann was one of her childhood nannies. She attended Stanford University, studying organizational behavior, though she did spend a year abroad at Oxford University focusing on the work of Virginia Woolf, Ms. Smith said. Before her senior year, she became a contestant in the Miss America beauty pageant, which she won in 1988. A trained violinist, Ms. Carlson was proud of her achievement, saying her victory proved the pageant was as interested in a contestant’s intelligence as her looks. “It shows that I’m not a bimbo, that I do have intelligence and that I do represent what every woman wants to be in this society, which is a career woman, and be respected for her intelligence,” she said in January 1989. After graduating from Stanford, she worked for several local TV stations before becoming the host of the Saturday edition of CBS’s   morning show, “The Early Show,” in 2002. “She was very, very serious and competent and ambitious about doing journalism the way CBS News was known for,” Victor Neufeld, an executive producer of “The Early Show,” said on Wednesday. She joined Fox News’ morning show “Fox and Friends,” in 2006,   it for eight years. In 2009, Jon Stewart devoted a segment of “The Daily Show” to Ms. Carlson, showing clips of her saying she had to Google words like czar and ignoramus to learn their definitions. Mr. Stewart then detailed her stellar educational background, accused her of playing dumb for Fox’s audience and said, “You don’t have to stash your I. Q. in an offshore account. ” Ms. Carlson is married to Casey Close, a sports agent known for his tough negotiating style, and a roster of clients that includes Derek Jeter. The couple have two children. She has been upfront in discussing matters of sexism in the workplace. In September 2013, shortly after she was removed from “Fox and Friends,” she appeared on the Fox News Radio show of her former   Brian Kilmeade and noted that she was dressed casually. The morning show, she said, had a strict rule: She could not wear pants on air. The year before, Ms. Carlson walked off the set of “Fox and Friends” in apparent protest when Mr. Kilmeade made a disparaging comment about women. (She later said she was joking.) And last year Ms. Carlson wrote about sexual harassment for The Huffington Post. “Most professional women I know have experienced sexual harassment,” she wrote. “So have I  —   a few times  —   and I never talked about it until now. If that seems surprising, it shouldn’t be. I’ve always considered myself a strong woman, not afraid to stand up for myself, but in the face of sexual harassment I was silent. “As the issue takes a prominent place in the headlines today, I sometimes feel guilty about my trepidation,” Ms. Carlson continued. “Perhaps I could have moved the conversation forward if I had come forth. ”",0
11779,Jesse Eisenberg on the Surprising Success of ‘The Spoils’ in London - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Importing Jesse Eisenberg’s “The Spoils” to this city was not exactly a  . Written by and starring Mr. Eisenberg, this lacerating comedy of humiliation  —   about a whiny, rich,   and terminally narcissistic young New Yorker who impulsively sabotages his own life and that of his Nepalese roommate  —   appeared destined to be lost in translation. Yet since opening in June at Trafalgar Studios, “The Spoils,” staged in New York by the New Group last year, has become the   production in that theater’s history. Scott Elliott, the show’s director and the New Group’s artistic director, now plans to help bring over more productions, starting with “Buried Child” with Ed Harris, seen earlier this year in New York. Part of the   success of “The Spoils” is a matter of star appeal: Mr. Eisenberg, an Oscar nominee for “The Social Network,” is in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and portrays Woody Allen’s   in “Café Society. ” But celebrity doesn’t explain the hard laughter and, more surprising, the tears that “The Spoils” elicits. As the run neared its Aug. 13 end, Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Elliott sat down in the theater’s lobby to discuss why their production has grown, changed and flourished on British soil. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. SCOTT ELLIOTT They told me early on, “We don’t want you to get your hopes up about audience reactions. ” The sarcasm and the humor in the show is so American. So I was worried thinking, “Oh, maybe they’re not going to get it. ” Shockingly, the response was completely opposite, from the first preview. I came to the conclusion that people just listen better here. There is an English tradition of   characters in comedy. JESSE EISENBERG That was my feeling. In terms of modern English entertainment, I really liked Ricky Gervais’s character in [the original British version of] “The Office,” and when Americans remade that show [with Steve Carrell] it was a lot lighter, and so I just assumed that my play would be O. K. here. Did you have to translate some of the cultural references for the new British cast members? ELLIOTT There’s a lot of bragging in the play. So it was interesting to teach them about that, and it took a while. EISENBERG I as a writer assume it’s totally   that when people brag, they do it with this kind of facade of humility to subtly apologize for what they’re saying. And Scott picked up right away that’s not how it’s done here. People don’t freely talk about their problems here, don’t freely brag. Maybe it’s like a tall poppy syndrome. Jesse, you do create unusually   characters, including the writer in your earlier work “The Revisionist” [in which he starred with Vanessa Redgrave in 2013]. EISENBERG I wish I could say he’s more   than I am. The way I see the world  —   this is probably so pretentious and    —   I don’t see why people aren’t reacting the way my character reacts to bad news. Which is he falls apart, he weeps and shouts, he screams at strangers. That’s how I think the world should always be, but of course it’s inappropriate to do that when you get a coffee and don’t have the right change. ELLIOTT I’ve come to the conclusion that our job is to make people feel something. I think what you do, especially in this environment, is to let people feel through you. EISENBERG Yes, I was being glib. I think that’s the real thing. I feel like out of every kind of performance I’m involved in, theater is still the best way to communicate a story to a group of people. I think there is so much value in putting myself through the very difficult experiences of the character eight times a week because I think it communicates  —   on a   the human condition, and on a     malaise,   the fear of immigrants usurping positions of power from hegemonic cultures like mine. Boy, did that turn out to be relevant this summer. EISENBERG Yes,   nationalist, nativist sentiment has been so present, and the play culminates with my character screaming at an immigrant to get the hell back home. But I think it’s important that we’re humanizing the bigot, that you realize that Ben is someone who’s   who’s struggling through his inaction, struggling though his own feeling that the world is passing him by. And if we can understand that that’s where it comes from, that it doesn’t come from some kind of   assessment of the damage that immigrants are doing to the country, then you realize that it’s something that can be overcome. Unlike most actors who write parts for themselves, you don’t seem to feel the need to make the audience like you. EISENBERG The way I think about it is, if I’m writing the part and I’m playing the part, I can make the part as distasteful on the page as possible, and then every other ounce of me will try to humanize it. If I wasn’t playing the part, I’d worry more about the character being likable. Do the laughs come in different places than they did in New York? EISENBERG Yeah, there’s two jokes that never get a laugh here. I make fun of Jews. And Michael Moore, who’s a friend of mine, saw the play last week, and he was like, “You realize everyone in the audience is cringing when you make that Jewish joke,” and I was like, “Oh, is that what they’re doing, because they’re certainly not laughing. ” And I realized two things: One is that there is a history of   that’s closer to the surface in Europe than it is in America  —   people are uncomfortable with hearing that stuff  —   and I think they don’t have Jewish stereotypes here to make fun of. The play is much more affecting here than it was New York, especially its ending. Was that song  —   Billy Joel’s “Summer Highland Falls,” played in the background  —   there before? ELLIOTT No, I changed the tone. I knew that in New York people were struggling with the ending. It was: “Am I supposed to cry? Am I supposed to hate him?” For me, there’s always this fear that redemption is going to be sentimental. But then I said to Jesse, “Look, you have written a redemptive ending, and we resisted going there in New York. But that’s what you wrote, and we have to embrace it. ” EISENBERG It’s not a play about this guy who’s mean and gets his comeuppance. It’s about this broken person, and if you’re not tracking that throughout the show, you’re not watching the show.",0
11780,Mike Pence Disavows Donald Trump’s Earlier Proposal Barring Muslims - The New York Times,"The Trump campaign appeared to disavow one of its most provocative policy proposals on Thursday, as Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana said explicitly that Donald J. Trump no longer wanted to impose a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. In a round of television interviews in which he was asked to clarify once and for all where the campaign stands on the proposal, Mr. Pence, who opposed the ban before becoming Mr. Trump’s running mate, declared the idea dead. The reversal is a significant one for the Trump campaign, which was accused of promoting a policy that was discriminatory and probably unconstitutional when Mr. Trump unveiled it in the name of national security last year. Asked on CNN about why he will not condemn the Muslim ban now, Mr. Pence said, “Because that’s not Donald Trump’s position now. ” In recent months, Mr. Trump has changed how he has talked about the ban, saying that “extreme vetting” of immigrants should be focused on people coming from countries that have been compromised by terrorists. But that idea led to more confusion, because it was not clear if it was an expansion of the Muslim ban or a shift away from it. Mr. Pence appeared to imply in August that he would be open to broadening the ban to other religions, but the emphasis was placed on geography. “That’s what Donald Trump and I are calling for now, is to have a temporary suspension of immigration from countries or territories compromised by terrorism, and I believe that’s an appropriate action given the horrendous, horrendous violence that we see,” Mr. Pence told Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin talk radio host, at the time. Historians have compared Mr. Trump’s Muslim ban to some of the darkest moments in American history, likening it to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the use of internment camps for   during World War II. The timing of Mr. Pence’s latest remarks may not be a coincidence. Polls have shown a majority of Americans oppose the concept of barring Muslims, while Republicans remain divided about it. The retreat on Thursday was the latest example of the Trump campaign changing a position as the election approaches. Mr. Trump recently softened his position on immigration, forgoing his calls for mass deportation in favor of a focus on “criminal aliens. ” Mr. Pence was also one of the first members of the campaign to publicly acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, paving the way for Mr. Trump to finally end his false conspiracy theory about Mr. Obama’s birthplace last month. During the   debate this week, Mr. Pence brushed off many of Mr. Trump’s startling comments from the campaign, disregarding some as reflecting a lack of political polish and denying that others were ever said. But critics of Mr. Trump are not letting his campaign off the hook for the Muslim ban so easily. “Governor Pence’s flagrant attempts to mislead voters on his running mate’s positions aren’t fooling anyone,” said Zara Rahim, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign. “Not only has Trump proposed an unconstitutional immigration ban on an entire religion, but he’s suggested creating a database that tracks Muslims in this country. ” She added, “Pence has not disavowed anything, he’s just lied to the American people once again. ” Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on   Relations, said that Mr. Trump could not simply turn the page on the Muslim ban. “Whatever the Trump campaign claims is the current version of its Muslim ban, the original absolutist language of a ‘total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States’  —   along with other bigoted statements  —   reflect a systematic and toxic use of Islamophobia that has had a tremendously harmful impact on the lives of ordinary American Muslims and on the unity of our nation,” Mr. Awad said. Despite efforts to quietly backtrack on the proposal, the Trump campaign has continued to face questions about the ban because the news release from last December announcing the proposal has not been removed from Mr. Trump’s website. “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on,” the release said. But in a separate interview on MSNBC on Thursday, Mr. Pence made clear that the Muslim ban was no longer on the table. Such a proposal, he seemed to suggest, would be absurd. “So not a ban on all Muslims?” Joe Scarborough, the host of “Morning Joe,” asked Mr. Pence. “Of course not,” Mr. Pence replied.",0
11781,Re: 22 Reasons Why Starting World War 3 In The Middle East Is A Really Bad Idea,"Archives Michael On Television 22 Reasons Why Starting World War 3 In The Middle East Is A Really Bad Idea By Michael Snyder, on August 27th, 2013 
While most of the country is obsessing over Miley Cyrus , the Obama administration is preparing a military attack against Syria which has the potential of starting World War 3. In fact, it is being reported that cruise missile strikes could begin “ as early as Thursday “. The Obama administration is pledging that the strikes will be “limited”, but what happens when the Syrians fight back? What happens if they sink a U.S. naval vessel or they have agents start hitting targets inside the United States? Then we would have a full-blown war on our hands. And what happens if the Syrians decide to retaliate by hitting Israel? If Syrian missiles start raining down on Tel Aviv, Israel will be extremely tempted to absolutely flatten Damascus, and they are more than capable of doing precisely that. And of course Hezbollah and Iran are not likely to just sit idly by as their close ally Syria is battered into oblivion. We are looking at a scenario where the entire Middle East could be set aflame, and that might only be just the beginning. Russia and China are sternly warning the U.S. government not to get involved in Syria, and by starting a war with Syria we will do an extraordinary amount of damage to our relationships with those two global superpowers. Could this be the beginning of a chain of events that could eventually lead to a massive global conflict with Russia and China on one side and the United States on the other? Of course it will not happen immediately, but I fear that what is happening now is setting the stage for some really bad things. The following are 22 reasons why starting World War 3 in the Middle East is a really bad idea… 
#1 The American people are overwhelmingly against going to war with Syria… 
Americans strongly oppose U.S. intervention in Syria’s civil war and believe Washington should stay out of the conflict even if reports that Syria’s government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are confirmed, a Reuters/Ipsos poll says. 
About 60 percent of Americans surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria’s civil war, while just 9 percent thought President Barack Obama should act. 
#2 At this point, a war in Syria is even more unpopular with the American people than Congress is . 
#3 The Obama administration has not gotten approval to go to war with Syria from Congress as the U.S. Constitution requires . 
#4 The United States does not have the approval of the United Nations to attack Syria and it is not going to be getting it. 
#5 Syria has said that it will use “ all means available ” to defend itself if the United States attacks. Would that include terror attacks in the United States itself? 
#6 Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem made the following statement on Tuesday … 
“We have two options: either to surrender, or to defend ourselves with the means at our disposal. The second choice is the best: we will defend ourselves” 
#7 Russia has just sent their most advanced anti-ship missiles to Syria. What do you think would happen if images of sinking U.S. naval vessels were to come flashing across our television screens? 
#8 When the United States attacks Syria, there is a very good chance that Syria will attack Israel. Just check out what one Syrian official said recently … 
A member of the Syrian Ba’ath national council Halef al-Muftah, until recently the Syrian propaganda minister’s aide, said on Monday that Damascus views Israel as “behind the aggression and therefore it will come under fire” should Syria be attacked by the United States. 
In an interview for the American radio station Sawa in Arabic, President Bashar Assad’s fellow party member said: “We have strategic weapons and we can retaliate. Essentially, the strategic weapons are aimed at Israel.” 
Al-Muftah stressed that the US’s threats will not influence the Syrain regime and added that “If the US or Israel err through aggression and exploit the chemical issue, the region will go up in endless flames, affecting not only the area’s security, but the world’s.” 
#9 If Syria attacks Israel, the consequences could be absolutely catastrophic. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising that any attack will be responded to “ forcefully “… 
“We are not a party to this civil war in Syria but if we identify any attempt to attack us we will respond and we will respond forcefully” 
#10 Hezbollah will likely do whatever it can to fight for the survival of the Assad regime. That could include striking targets inside both the United States and Israel. 
#11 Iran’s closest ally is Syria. Will Iran sit idly by as their closest ally is removed from the chessboard? 
#12 Starting a war with Syria will cause significant damage to our relationship with Russia. On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said that the West is acting like a “ monkey with a hand grenade “. 
#13 Starting a war with Syria will cause significant damage to our relationship with China. And what will happen if the Chinese decide to start dumping the massive amount of U.S. debt that it is holding? Interest rates would absolutely skyrocket and we would rapidly be facing a nightmare scenario . 
#14 Dr. Jerome Corsi and Walid Shoebat have compiled some startling evidence that it was actually the Syrian rebels that the U.S. is supporting that were responsible for the chemical weapons attack that is being used as justification to go to war with Syria… 
With the assistance of former PLO member and native Arabic-speaker Walid Shoebat, WND has assembled evidence from various Middle Eastern sources that cast doubt on Obama administration claims the Assad government is responsible for last week’s attack. 
You can examine the evidence for yourself right here . 
#15 As Pat Buchanan recently noted, it would have made absolutely no sense for the Assad regime to use chemical weapons on defenseless women and children. The only people who would benefit from such an attack would be the rebels… 
The basic question that needs to be asked about this horrific attack on civilians, which appears to be gas related, is: Cui bono? 
To whose benefit would the use of nerve gas on Syrian women and children redound? Certainly not Assad’s, as we can see from the furor and threats against him that the use of gas has produced. 
The sole beneficiary of this apparent use of poison gas against civilians in rebel-held territory appears to be the rebels, who have long sought to have us come in and fight their war. 
#16 If the Saudis really want to topple the Assad regime , they should do it themselves. They should not expect the United States to do their dirty work for them. 
#17 A former commander of U.S. Central Command has said that a U.S. attack on Syria would result in “ a full-throated, very, very serious war “. 
#18 A war in the Middle East will be bad for the financial markets. The Dow was down about 170 points today and concern about war with Syria was the primary reason. 
#19 A war in the Middle East will cause the price of oil to go up. On Tuesday, the price of U.S. oil rose to about $109 a barrel. 
#20 There is no way in the world that the U.S. government should be backing the Syrian rebels. As I discussed a few days ago , the rebels have pledged loyalty to al-Qaeda , they have beheaded numerous Christians and they have massacred entire Christian villages . If the U.S. government helps these lunatics take power in Syria it will be a complete and utter disaster. 
#21 A lot of innocent civilians inside Syria will end up getting killed. Already, a lot of Syrians are expressing concern about what “foreign intervention” will mean for them and their families… 
“I’ve always been a supporter of foreign intervention, but now that it seems like a reality, I’ve been worrying that my family could be hurt or killed,” said one woman, Zaina, who opposes Assad. “I’m afraid of a military strike now.” 
“The big fear is that they’ll make the same mistakes they made in Libya and Iraq,” said Ziyad, a man in his 50s. “They’ll hit civilian targets, and then they’ll cry that it was by mistake, but we’ll get killed in the thousands.” 
#22 If the U.S. government insists on going to war with Syria without the approval of the American people, the U.S. Congress or the United Nations, we are going to lose a lot of friends and a lot of credibility around the globe. It truly is a sad day when Russia looks like “the good guys” and we look like “the bad guys”. 
What good could possibly come out of getting involved in Syria? As I wrote about the other day , the “rebels” that Obama is backing are rabidly anti-Christian, rabidly anti-Israel and rabidly anti-western. If they take control of Syria, that nation will be far more unstable and far more of a hotbed for terrorism than it is now. 
And the downside of getting involved in Syria is absolutely enormous. Syria, Iran and Hezbollah all have agents inside this country, and if they decide to start blowing stuff up that will wake up the American people to the horror of war really quick. And by attacking Syria, the United States could cause a major regional war to erupt in the Middle East which could eventually lead to World War 3. 
I don’t know about you, but I think that starting World War 3 in the Middle East is a really bad idea. 
Let us hope that cooler heads prevail before things spin totally out of control. It Is Illegal To Feed The Homeless In Cities All Over The United States » Boo-urns 
There is no need for a *world* war. Just let them all kill each other; the sooner the world is free from the idiocy that abounds throughout the entire middle east — including Israel — the better off the rest of us will be. 2Gary2 
Does anyone out there see this ending well? 
Michael Rodster 
The US and it’s Allies don’t care what happens in the Middle East. In fact it’s my view that they would prefer absolute chaos and a full blown out war. 
As the mantra in 1992 Elections…”It’s all about the economy stupid”. And the same applies here as well. This is all desperation as the US knows what’s coming economically. If they can ramp up their Military Industrial Complex it could help boost the economy. That is the primary business the US is in. It’s all about war and spying. 
I do hate constantly repeating the man but it’s needed here as well. This all played out during the Great Depression except this time all the fiat based currency nations are in the same boat as the US and this time they have nukes 
“Trade wars, Currency wars, World wars”– Gerald Celente Adrian 
On the contrary, a few may benefit…the CEOS and huge shareholders of Halliburton, Ratheon, etc…but the economy would be hurt by threats to oil, decreased stability in the ME, and so on. They don’t care about the economy, if they did they would have implemented stark programs to bring millions back to work. Instead, it’s been business as usual with downsizing, QE 2,3, 4, and shipping jobs overseas. davidmpark

Americans needs to be more prepared and ready than Syrians it seems …It could be a distraction to cause chaos in America. 
They know no one wants war in America and even lame stream is publishing that story and 99% of comments on main stream news sites like CNN is against war…. 
I believe America is their next target not Syria even though they are making it look like its Syria and Iran….

@Richard, I couldn’t agree more. I think this October we will have our eyes opened. This train is in full speed. I have been stocking up for the last 2 years on food, ammo and sanitation. The biggest problem I have run into is income and cost of ammo. The ammo price has come down and some sites are catching up (midland and foxtrotgear seem to be the best prices). The ammo shortage hurt the last year, but my income seems like it has dwindled over the last 2 years. Josh

Over amount of years U.S. prospered with the highest public debt. Without wars on it’s territory and so on.. Economy collapse is inevitable. To hold it over, U.S. needs to seed unstability and war in other countries. To keep ourselves stable country, to keep dollar high value (but without gold – dollar is just a paper). We intentonally made that “Arabic spring”, changed management of all those countries. Who didn’t agree – was murdered (like Kaddafi), who did like Egypt – was changed by our man. Now we expect another wave of economical collapse. We NEED to seed fear and distable east. And it’s not Obama! He’s just a puppet.. We made hugest and well trained army with the top weapons on other countries money 😀 But It won’t last forever… churchill

If you are worried about gas attacks, you can make a filter for an air conditioning unit. 
First, get all of the supplies you can: a lot of baking soda and wood charcoal (not briquettes), piece of wood, a scale (any kind), a large pot, 2 pillow cases, a plastic or metal box, and duct tape. 
Pour the baking soda into a pot and weigh it. After recording the weight, place on heat source and cook it for a few minutes. Remove and re-weigh, then repeat. When the scale no longer shows change in weight, pour the powder into a pillowcase and make more if necessary to fill to pillowcase about half way or more. This process converts the sodium bicarbonate into sodium carbonate (soda ash, or activated carbon). 
Now pour the charcoal onto the pot and use a piece of wood to crush the charcoal into smaller pieces, about the size of wheat grains. Pour into pillow case and make more if necessary to fill to pillowcase about half way or more. Some dust will fall out – let it. 
Now, drill or cut two holes big enough to snuggly fit the air intake hose of your A/C unit into the plastic or metal box on the shorter sides. Place the bag of soda ash on one side, the bag of charcoal on the other side. Seal with duct tape generously. Now attach the air intake hoses of your A/C unit on the unit with the air entering the charcoal first, and the soda ash second. Duct tape generously on both ends. 
We built this last year when the ash and smoke from local wildfires were choking the air around us. We were supremely comfortable with filtered air. Will it work for chemical weapons? The soda ash is the same ingredient used in gas masks, but I really don’t know. Works great for smoke and ash, and chili cook-off’s, but I have no real data that it will work for WMD’s. Can some experts chime in? Truther

All people have the government they deserve. Syrin 
Here’s how this could play out. We invade Syria. It’s a leaping point to go to war with Iran who has already threatened war with Israel if we invade. Obama will sign the UN Small Arms Treaty, and Russian troops have already been training on US soil for over a year to disarm Americans. I believe they will stage some false flag event in FEMA region 3 which has been urgently stockpiling by “no later than October 1″ according to all their requests for supplies. (do a search, they are stockpiling a A ton in FEMA region 3) Martial law will be declared enforced by our militarized polive, some Iranian patsy will be blamed, and they will jump from Syria to Iran. Obama had a behind the scenes meeting with the highest level financial people in the US last week. The last time this happened, they took out gold. I think they will use the war and false flag events to perform a simultaneous engineered collapse of the economy because they know we cannot recover from our debt burden hoping the no information GARY voters will blame the evil Syrians for our economic problems. Just like Nazzzi Germany, we become a dictatorship overnight. davidmpark 
Okay, I looked it up about the stockpiling for region 3. That makes good sense to concentrate around there for the sake of the powers in DC. They’d want to make sure they don’t have any disruptions in their cocktail parties and lasciviousness. 
They stockpiled around the furherbunker during the battle for Berlin. Makes sense to do that sort of thing when they make unpopular and more blatant illegal actions against their own people. K 
Excellent comment. The idea behind Russian troops was, it would be easier to get them to fire on civilians. I wonder if the puppet masters every gave any thought to the fact, that would cut both ways. K

Ever since they passed that war on terror resolution in 2001. It seems no President feels they need clearance from anyone. Can this end well? Only if a backdoor agreement has been made with Russia and China. A certain number of missiles fired at certain agreed on targets. In exchange they stick to just stern words. If such an agreement does not exist. Then the first salvo, could easily cause everyone in the area, to bring out their new toys. And that will not end well. A D

11782,21st Century Fox Reaches Preliminary Deal to Buy Sky - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   The media and entertainment mogul Rupert Murdoch was on the verge of taking full control of the British satellite television giant Sky five years ago when his takeover bid was derailed by a   scandal in his company’s publishing arm. On Friday, Sky said that Mr. Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox had reached a preliminary deal to acquire the 61 percent stake in Sky it did not already own. The new takeover offer would value Sky at about $23 billion. The two companies are still in talks over the final terms of a deal, Sky said. The takeover approach came more than five years after 21st Century Fox’s predecessor company, News Corporation, withdrew a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky  —   then known as BSkyB  —   as a firestorm erupted over   by the media in Britain. In 2011, it emerged that reporters at News of the World, a Sunday tabloid newspaper then owned by a subsidiary of News Corporation, had hacked the mobile phone of a young murder victim in Britain and listened to her voice mail messages, inciting outrage in Britain. The scandal led to the newspaper being closed and soon engulfed News Corporation’s publishing business in Britain. News Corporation split into two companies in 2013. Its entertainment assets were housed in the newly christened 21st Century Fox, while the new News Corporation consisted of its publishing business, including The Wall Street Journal and The Times of London. The scandal also forced James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch and chief executive of 21st Century Fox, to step down as chairman of Sky. The younger Mr. Murdoch served as chairman of Sky from 2007 to 2012 and retained a seat on its board after resigning as chairman. At the time of the phone hacking scandal, James Murdoch oversaw News Corporation’s businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. He was never found to have any direct knowledge of the hacking, but a Parliament committee investigating the scandal accused him of “willful ignorance. ” James Murdoch acknowledged at the time that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims. Despite the scandal, the younger Mr. Murdoch has remained well respected in European media circles and returned to serve as Sky’s chairman this year, spurring speculation that another takeover bid by 21st Century Fox was in the works. On Friday, Sky said that 21st Century Fox had offered to pay 10. 75 pounds a share in cash ($13. 58) less the value of any dividends subsequently paid by Sky. The new offer represents a 40 percent premium to the Sky’s closing price on Tuesday, the last day before the initial Fox approach. Shares of Sky closed up nearly 27 percent in trading in London on Friday after the announcement but ended the day below the offer price. In the United States, shares of 21st Century Fox closed down 2 percent. “There can be no certainty that an offer will be made by 21st Century Fox, nor as to the terms of any such offer,” Sky said in a news release. Sky said that its independent directors had indicated to 21st Century Fox that they were willing to recommend the proposal to shareholders, subject to reaching an agreement on the other outstanding terms. The independent directors were advised by Barclays, Morgan Stanley and PJT Partners, Sky said. The company also said that it had formed an independent committee of its directors that it considers free of any conflicts of interest to consider the terms of the Fox proposal. A potential bid for the rest of Sky by 21st Century Fox was widely anticipated by analysts, particularly after ATT agreed to acquire Time Warner for $84. 5 billion in October. “We think the likelihood of a Fox bid for Sky now rises, which would create a stronger vertically integrated business in Europe,” Tim Nollen, senior media analyst at Macquarie Bank, wrote in a report in October after the Time Warner deal. The   Warner deal was the latest in a series of transactions by media companies in recent years to gain scale, control more content and distribute that content directly to customers. On Friday, 21st Century Fox said that its 39 percent stake in Sky was “not a natural end position. ” “A proposed transaction between 21st Century Fox and Sky would bring together 21st Century Fox’s global content business with Sky’s      capabilities, which have made it the number one premium   provider in all its markets,” 21st Century Fox said in a news release. “It would also enhance Sky’s leading position in entertainment and sport, and reinforce the U. K.’s standing as a top global hub for content generation and technological innovation,” the company added. Gaining full control of Sky would be consistent with efforts by James Murdoch since he took over as chief executive to simplify  —   and gain greater control over  —   21st Century Fox’s ventures. Last year, 21st Century Fox announced a deal valued at $725 million to create a   joint venture with the National Geographic Society that encompassed the National Geographic Channels cable television group along with National Geographic’s other properties.   Century Fox owns a 73 percent stake in the venture, National Geographic Partners. The deal came after an   partnership between Fox and the nonprofit group for National Geographic Channels. The company has also looked for more ways to take its content directly to consumers, including signing a deal in November to provide live streaming of its television channels through a new service being introduced next year by Hulu, which 21st Century Fox partly owns. Sky has reshaped itself into a   satellite provider in recent years, buying Sky Italia and a controlling stake in Sky Deutschland for more than $9 billion from 21st Century Fox in 2014. Sky, which offers television, broadband and telephone phone services, has nearly 22 million customers in Austria, Britain, Germany, Ireland and Italy. It reported revenue of nearly £12 billion ($15. 1 billion) in its 2016 fiscal year, which ended June 30. Sky exclusively licenses a variety of television shows from AMC Networks, HBO and Showtime in Europe, including “Game of Thrones,” “The Walking Dead” and “The Affair. ” It also broadcasts the top soccer leagues in Britain, Germany and Italy. Fox is being advised in the discussions by Centerview Partners and Deutsche Bank.",0
11783,New Moon In Scorpio: Making A Calculated Effort,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter We are having a New Moon in Scorpio on October 30th in most places around the world, and during the early hours of October 31st in Australia and New Zealand. It will occur at 5:38pm Universal Time ( click here for your time zone). advertisement - learn more New Moons bring in a new wave of energy for the upcoming month. It is the beginning of the first half of the lunar cycle, which is when the Moon is waxing (gaining light), while the Full Moon is the transition into the second half, when the Moon is waning (losing light). Therefore, the energy of the New Moon serves as more of a guidepost for those first 10-14 days of the cycle. Scorpio: Powerful, Deep, Intense, and Passionate Scorpio is a primal and passionate sign about desires, fears, and intensity. As a ‘fixed sign’ ruled by Mars and Pluto, it holds a high concentration of power that can be used to control or to transform. It likes and seeks what is real and refrains from anything that is lacking substance. The deep merging of two individuals or parties, whether it be sexually, financially, or resourcefully, is Scorpio territory. This sign seeks loyalty, yet it must be earned after a period of being under scrutiny. It wants to know what is hidden beneath the surface to decide on how much trust is to be earned. Scorpio is about willing to look at and even embrace the deepest, darkest, and scariest aspects of others, oneself, and the world around us. It is the sign of death and rebirth, love and hate, as it is the sign of extremes. An example of all of this is how we have Halloween followed by ‘All Saints Day’, and then followed by ‘All Souls Day’ back to back during Scorpio season. The shadow side of Scorpio is that it can be manipulative and controlling in a very calculated way. While the scrutinizing of others is to gain trust, it can also be about getting some sort of advantage to have more control over a person or situation. Although Scorpio seeks hidden aspects of others, it can be very guarded about one’s own secrets. advertisement - learn more New Moon Conjunct Mercury and Trine Neptune Mercury is also in Scorpio moving away from a conjunction with the Sun that was exact 3 days before on October 27th. In the days leading up to this New Moon, many people could have experienced important communications, ideas, deep thoughts, or some sort of mental efforts towards joint resources/efforts, money, sexuality, and/or some sort of strategy. Whatever it is, think of it as something that has been ‘gathered’ or ‘set-up’ to be implemented or expanded on in this moon cycle and in the coming months. The New Moon (with Mercury separating) is also in a trine with Neptune, which could assist us with our imagination, creativity, intuition, dreams, visions, and spiritual connection. Due to the nodes also being involved, there may also be a connection with how our past can help our future. For some lovers, it can be a time of feeling like soulmates. This energy is strong until November 2nd. Venus Conjunct Saturn, Mars In Capricorn Square Uranus The day before the New Moon, Venus made a conjunction with Saturn, which initiated a new 14 month cycle between the two. Venus is about fun, love, relationships, beauty, and pleasure while Saturn is serious and more concerned with responsibilities, structure, discipline, and commitments. Therefore, many of us will experience some sort of merging of these themes both in either favourable or unfavourable ways. Occurring in Sagittarius, it can be related to our beliefs, visions, travel, education, publishing, or marketing. Mars, a ruler of Scorpio, has been in the ambitious sign of Capricorn since September 27th. This has been an excellent time to really make things happen in terms of reaching our goals, and it will last until November 8th/9th. During this New Moon, Mars is separating from a square with Uranus which was stronger in the 2 days prior. At worst, their could have been sudden change, separation, instability, and the need to take some sort of action as a result. For some people, it could have of been rebellion or wanting to break free from a controlling situation. In other cases it could of positively brought innovation towards our ambitions. These are just some examples of how it could be manifested, but whatever it is for each of us, it has created the landscape for some new beginnings. Mercury and Sun Sextile Pluto, Venus Trine Uranus During the first week of the Moon cycle, Mercury (followed by the Sun) will be in a harmonious aspect with Pluto in Capricorn. Pluto, being the modern ruler of Scorpio, indicates that this is an excellent time to expand on what was initiated during the previous week when Mercury was conjunct the Sun. Powerful thoughts, communication, or deep research to assist us in our careers, managing or earning resources/money, or implementing some sort of structure or strategy to help gain some of sort of success and fulfill a goal. Venus is trine Uranus and will be strongest on November 4th-5th. This can be a fun and exciting time, and luckily it will fall on the weekend. This is a great time to connect with people, attend social events, especially since Venus is in Sagittarius, it is a good time to explore and try new things that can bring you enjoyment. This can be a great time for lovers as well with potential breakthroughs. Things To Consider And Making Intentions For This New Moon Look at everything that has played out for you in the last week prior to this New Moon. The next 10 days following it is a significant time to make a great effort to expand on what has been initiated, and take steps to move beyond anything challenging that has occurred. Your intentions for this Lunar Month should be related to improving on and/or facilitating the positive qualities of Scorpio energy into your life. This includes (but not limited to) improving your ability to earn or manage money/resources, tapping into and harnessing your inner power and sexual energy better, facing your fears, trying to understand complex things, seeing beyond fakeness or deceit, and becoming more in touch with what is real. The best time to make your intentions for the Moon cycle is during the first 24 hours following the New Moon but it could even be done within the first 3 days. The closer to the New Moon, the better.

11784,Russian Spies and Americas Reality TV Election       : Information," Russian Spies and Americas Reality TV Election By Finian Cunningham
November 14, "" Sputnik "" - After months of mudslinging and vitriol, US President-elect Donald Trump was greeted this week by a chummy President Obama with a cozy fireside seat at the White House.
Some media outlets sniped at Trumps surprise election calling him the first reality TV star to become president. In truth, the whole US political system seems to be a reality TV show.
In the weeks up to polling day on November 8, Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and large sections of the US media were denouncing Trump as a Russian stooge. Trumps alleged friendliness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin was said to be proof that the Republican candidate was a Kremlin agent. The Kremlin rejected the accusations as fatuous, pointing out that there was not a scintilla of evidence.
The claims, however, were not merely electioneering rhetoric to smear Trump. The Obama administration officially weighed in to accuse Russia of state-sponsored hacking of computer systems and interfering in the US election to get Trump elected. The White House based its provocative allegations on an assessment made by the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security. In other words, US accusations of Russian subversion could not have been leveled in a more serious way.
That means, if you follow this logic, that Trump is now heading to occupy the White House thanks to Russian espionage and propaganda influencing the vote in his favor. So, what then was outgoing President Obama doing holding photo ops with Comrade Trump in the Oval Office, smiling and exchanging pleasantries? At one point, the incumbent Commander-in-Chief said he was rooting for Trumps presidency to succeed because if it does then America will succeed. Hold on a moment. Only days before this avuncular tete-a-tete marking the peaceful transition of power, Obamas administration and the mainstream media were labelling Trump as a Russian fifth columnist. Obama had also mocked Trump as being uniquely unqualified to be president with access to the nuclear keys.
It is notable how US media claims of Russian spying and interference suddenly ceased the day after Trump was elected. Granted, there have since been lame attempts to make something sinister out of the news that Russian diplomats were admittedly in touch with Trump and Clinton campaign aides before the election. Apart from that damp-squib story that the New York Times and Washington Post tried to enliven, for the most part the Russian hacker hue and cry before the election has strangely disappeared from the public arena. In the light of Trumps cordial reception at the White House and the general acceptance by the Washington establishment including President Obama, defeated candidate Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media, that is stunning evidence that the whole anti-Russia bashing prior to the election was completely concocted and disingenuous. Think about it. How could Trump be painted one day as a beneficiary of Russian espionage, and then the next day literally, he is being feted as the 45th president of the USA  whom, as Obama says, we are rooting for? This demonstrates how degraded US statecraft has become. The government, its intelligence services and the countrys supposed quality news media are all prepared to fabricate and propagate lies against a foreign state  Russia. Obviously, because how could serious concerns one day be so easily jettisoned the next?
Evidently, the demonization of Russia as a hostile, interfering foreign power trying to upend US internal politics is a gross falsehood. Otherwise why would Trump be officially accepted? And why have all the grave media claims just vanished? But a much more serious aspect to this official US propaganda is that it illustrates how Russia is being set up more generally as an enemy state. Recall that US intelligence agencies were reportedly preparing to launch cyber attacks on Russian infrastructure all on the back of claims that Russia was hacking into the American presidential elections. If somehow US cyber attacks were carried out to cripple Russian industries and public utilities that would have constituted an act of war. Russia would have been obliged to respond, and the whole dangerous dynamic could have escalated to an all-out war.
If US government and its intelligence agencies, as well as supposedly independent news media, are seen to be so disingenuous, then that destroys their credibility on other matters. Can you believe anything they say about Russia with regard to allegedly threatening European security or committing war crimes in Syria? For his part, Donald Trump also plays a starring role in the US democracy charade. During their fireside meeting in the White House, the billionaire property tycoon called Obama a very good man and said that he would seek his counsel in the future. This is the same very good man whom Trump had earlier accused of being the creator of the ISIS [Daesh] terror group. Along with Clinton, Trump had rallied his supporters to view Obama as a treasonous criminal for waging illegal wars in the Middle East.
Well, thats a spectacular U-turn by the fiery, big-mouth anti-politician Trump. If he can so quickly accommodate himself to such apparently hated political enemies and effectively drop all charges then one wonders what else Trump will renege on? Will he really drain the swamp of Washingtons oligarchic establishment? Will he deliver on making America great again by investing in the forgotten people who elected him? Will he really de-escalate American overseas militarism and NATO aggression towards Russia? It was surely a good thing that Hillary Clinton was not elected as president. Her warmongering record as former Secretary of State speaks for itself, as does her overt Russophobia.
But we should not be under illusions that a Trump presidency represents a new contrite and cooperative America. An American president is only ever a figurehead for a system and structure of power. That system relies on militarism and war to project US hegemony in the world. Without hegemonic relationships and imperialist conduct, US capitalism as we know it would collapse. And Trump is a raw-toothed capitalist. His early selections show a preference for further neoliberal deregulation of capital, as well as surrounding himself with his family and business cronies. Trump may be a pragmatic businessman inclined to form relations free from ideology. Potentially, that is a good thing for improving US relations with Russia and other foreign powers. Nevertheless, it would be naive to expect one individual to radically change a political system. It is not hard to imagine that when Trump enters the White House formally in 1o weeks that the military-intelligence-corporate apparatus of American capitalism will impress on him how the system works. And he will oblige. Trumps polite deference to Obama this week, and vice versa, shows in an unintended way what Obama meant when he said we are all on one team. That team is the American oligarchy. It is not the American nation. Disenfranchised working-class Americans may simply have gotten Trump into the team  against their genuine aspirations for radical democratic change. The rapid disappearance of Russian hacker allegations as well as Trumps anti-establishment bombast suggest that American democracy is all just one giant reality TV show.",0
11785,Trump’s F.C.C. Pick Quickly Targets Net Neutrality Rules - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In his first days as President Trump’s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai’s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration’s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. “With these   tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes,” said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. “The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people,” he added. “Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. ” Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ’s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency’s legal authority. “These   actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,” Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. “Accordingly, they are being revoked. ” The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   ATT and Verizon.   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers, particularly   households. “The speed of the ruling and the chairman’s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. “I think it’s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. ” Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency’s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. “The agency has strayed from its core mission,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a   student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. “The key here is that it’s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. “Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. ” Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai’s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers. None of the providers currently serve   consumers, but Mr. Pai’s comments could foreshadow a   of the Lifeline   subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. “Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,” Ms. Clyburn said.",0
11786,Man Charged With Murder in Death of Emergency Worker in the Bronx - The New York Times,"They lived on the same Bronx block, but on opposite ends of the city’s system for treating the sick and emotionally disturbed. He was an occasional patient, a    Bloods member whose family said he showed symptoms of schizophrenia and depression and received psychiatric treatment after   with the police. She was a caregiver who had worked for 14 years as an emergency medical technician with the New York Fire Department and had two sons who hoped to follow her into the profession. Around sunset on Thursday, four miles from their block, they met at the back of an ambulance. The man, Jose Gonzalez, who appeared heavily intoxicated in cellphone videos recorded a short while before, had hopped on the back bumper of an ambulance for a joy ride, riding three blocks before someone flagged down Yadira Arroyo, the emergency medical technician, who was driving, the police said. Ms. Arroyo, 44, was working overtime and on her way to help a pregnant woman. She stopped the ambulance and got out to figure out what was happening. Mr. Gonzalez had just thrown a teenage boy against a fence and stolen his backpack, a criminal complaint said, pretending to be a police officer and telling the boy he was arresting him. Now, Mr. Gonzalez was saying that he had hurt his hand and needed help. Ms. Arroyo, who was familiar with the strange and sometimes scary encounters that emergency medical workers endure, told him to return the backpack. Instead, Mr. Gonzalez took a few steps, then spun around and ran into the open driver’s side door, Deputy Chief Jason Wilcox, commanding officer of Bronx detectives, said. Ms. Arroyo tried to pull him out. From the passenger seat, her partner fought him, but Mr. Gonzalez put the ambulance into reverse, trapping Ms. Arroyo underneath and eventually dragging her into an intersection. Her death plunged the city’s medical workers into mourning and sent ripples beyond the city. The specter of an intoxicated, mentally ill man turning an ambulance into a weapon was a stark reminder of the random dangers of a profession whose practitioners often get second billing to their firefighter colleagues. And Mr. Gonzalez’s case  —   the second in recent months in which a man with a history of crime and mental illness killed a public safety worker in New York City  —   renewed concerns about the shortcomings of the systems that treat violent and vulnerable people. The episode was all the more chilling for how the lives of Mr. Gonzalez and Ms. Arroyo had brushed up against each other in recent years. Several people knew both of them from their block, on Creston Avenue, a few blocks south of Fordham Road and just east of the Grand Concourse. At the supportive shelter for homeless people where Mr. Gonzalez lived, he had a reputation for lashing out when he was not taking his medication, sometimes over laundry money. A few doors down, at the apartment building where Ms. Arroyo was raised, she was known to work extra hours to provide for her five children, ages 7 to 24, and to spread the gospel of emergency medical work. “She told her children, ‘You’ll see things and be scared, but you must have a good head on your shoulders and serve and protect your community,’” said Monica Salazar, the fiancée of Ms. Arroyo’s half brother. “And that’s what she died doing: protecting her partner. ” The partner, Monique Williams, who was injured, was treated at Jacobi Medical Center and released. More than 500 emergency medical workers lined the ramp of the hospital early on Friday and watched as Ms. Arroyo’s body was driven away in an ambulance to the city Medical Examiner’s Office for an autopsy. Mr. Gonzalez had stopped taking his medication several months ago, his brother, Andrew Mendez, 17, said. In the hours before he hopped onto Ms. Arroyo’s ambulance, he posted cellphone video online of himself with lipstick smeared around his gaptoothed grin, his tongue wagging from his mouth and his left hand dripping with blood. Behind him was a cracked windowpane. He rapped along to the words of the   artist Chinx, referred to his mother’s death when he was young and, in one video, shouted, “Blood up,” interjecting an expletive, a reference to his   membership in the Bounty Hunter set of the Bloods gang. He had a cut next to his left eye. Around the same time, Mr. Gonzalez called Mr. Mendez and told him he had just been jumped by members of the Crips gang. He talked about wanting revenge. “I’m always telling him, ‘Just wear the flag on our block,’” Mr. Mendez said of his brother, referring to the red Bloods colors. “But he goes to a Crip block wearing the Blood flag, so of course he’ll get jumped. ” Worried, Mr. Mendez interrupted a subway ride to Brooklyn to try to find his brother, but Mr. Gonzalez had stopped responding to calls. Mr. Gonzalez’s uncle, Reynaldo Gonzalez, 54, said his nephew grew depressed when his mother died. Mr. Mendez said he had started forgetting things and talking to himself after a bad car accident two or three years ago. “His head ain’t the same,” Mr. Mendez said. Mr. Mendez said his brother had been hospitalized 10 to 15 times as a result of his mental illness, most recently after an arrest in February. Mr. Gonzalez’s father, also Jose Gonzalez, said that he was unhappy about how the authorities had handled his son. “The police and how they handle people with mental health issues are wrong,” he said. “Something tragic happened, and I am very sorry. ” Just three weeks ago, Mr. Gonzalez was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and attempted assault, both misdemeanors, after the police said he swung at an officer, and then kicked out the window of a police van. The Bronx district attorney’s office said its prosecutors asked a judge to have Mr. Gonzalez held on a $5, 000 bail, but the judge ordered him released. A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office said that prosecutors also requested bail on a case last June in which Mr. Gonzalez was accused of punching someone, but that a judge had ordered him released then, too. Mr. Gonzalez, charged with murder, was ordered jailed by Judge Kim Wilson on Friday afternoon in a courtroom packed with dozens of Fire Department employees. Prosecutors said he drove over Ms. Arroyo twice, despite knowing she was there. His lawyer, Alice Fontier of the Bronx Defenders, requested a medical evaluation. In all, the police said, he had 31 previous arrests, several of them for possession or sale of marijuana. Mr. Gonzalez had probably passed Ms. Arroyo on the street outside their homes, where some neighbors were upset by the construction of the supportive housing shelter. Ms. Arroyo, though, focused on her work and her family. She taught a half brother, Joel Rosado, 30, how to deliver oxygen when he was training to become an emergency medical technician. When he graduated from the training academy, he said, “she was ecstatic. ” “I did it because I wanted to be like her,” Mr. Rosado said. So did two of her sons, Edgar, who is in his 20s, and Kenny, 19. Edgar failed a first test to become an emergency medical technician but plans to retake the class Kenny said he was taking the course now. About six years ago Ms. Arroyo met her boyfriend on the job, a paramedic in the Bronx. They often meditated and did yoga together, and occasionally crossed paths on the job. Ms. Arroyo was the eighth emergency medical worker to be killed in the line of duty since 1994 the last was in 2005, when a lieutenant died after surgery to treat a hernia suffered on the job. In 2002, an emergency medical technician died after his ambulance was rammed by a drunken driver. Robert Ungar, a spokesman for the Uniformed EMTs, Paramedics  Fire Inspectors F. D. N. Y. union, said that more than 100 members a year were assaulted on the job. The union’s president, Israel Miranda, said, “Anytime you wear a uniform and it shows some sort of authority in New York City, your life is always in danger. ”",0
11787,"At Carnegie Hall, a New Leader With a Son Named Hendrix - The New York Times","Robert F. Smith, the private equity titan who was named the richest   man by Forbes last year after making a fortune in software, also has a quirky musical side. He owns one of Elton John’s old pianos. He hired John Legend and Seal  —   and a youth orchestra  —   to perform at his wedding last summer on the Amalfi Coast. His youngest sons, Hendrix and Legend, are named after Jimi Hendrix and Mr. Legend. And he bought and refurbished a retreat in the Rocky Mountains that was beloved by jazz musicians, including Duke Ellington. On Thursday, Mr. Smith’s intersecting worlds of money, philanthropy and music came together when he was named the chairman of Carnegie Hall, the nation’s most prestigious concert stage. He became the first   to hold the post at a time when diversity at leading cultural organizations lags  —   a recent survey of New York’s cultural institutions found that nearly 78 percent of their board members were white. “Carnegie Hall is perfectly placed to champion not only artistic excellence, but also access and exposure to the best music in the world,” Mr. Smith said in a statement. The election of Mr. Smith, 53, who played an old upright piano while growing up in Denver and was told that with enough practice he might make it to Carnegie one day, brings to an end a low moment at the hall. The billionaire Ronald O. Perelman served as its chairman for less than a year before stepping down last fall after he alienated the board by clashing with the hall’s executive and artistic director, Clive Gillinson. After shunning the spotlight for years, Mr. Smith, who is based in Austin, Tex. where the private equity firm he founded, Vista Equity Partners, has its headquarters, has recently taken a more public role  —   starting a foundation, the Fund II Foundation giving commencement addresses and donating money. His alma mater, Cornell University, renamed its School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering for him earlier this year after he announced a $50 million gift. Unlike Carnegie’s most recent chairmen, Mr. Perelman and Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, Mr. Smith does not come from the world of New York finance, and he has not been a major fixture on the city’s social scene  —   he is more known for flying in to attend events in the city and then flying out. But his work outside the city with investors and tech firms could provide entree to new potential donors in the coming years. Mr. Smith said his newfound willingness to exert his influence came from a sense of obligation to help those less fortunate. “When I look at the folks that inspired me growing up, people like Frederick Douglass, they had to stand up and take positions in public in order to make a difference,” he said in an interview. “Part of the responsibility I have, because of the opportunities I’ve been granted, is to take leadership positions and help expand access for others. ” His path to Carnegie began at Petrossian, the restaurant a block north of the hall, where he had lunch a few years ago with Mr. Gillinson. A mutual friend introduced them, since Mr. Smith was interested in music education, a major focus for Carnegie. Mr. Smith joined the board in 2013. Since then he has donated money to expand Carnegie’s Link Up program, which develops music curriculums for more than 90 orchestras around the country, and become a founding patron of the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America, created by Carnegie’s Weill Music Institute. He also had an idea for a new program. “His suggestion was that we should also be reaching out to kids in the areas where we’re supporting the orchestras, offering lessons to kids who otherwise wouldn’t have the opportunity to have lessons, and instruments if they need them as well,” Mr. Gillinson said in an interview. “We added that dimension. ” Last month, Mr. Smith attended an   gala concert commemorating Carnegie’s 125th anniversary and got a round of applause at the dinner afterward at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel when Mercedes T. Bass, who served as acting chairwoman after Mr. Perelman’s departure, acknowledged him from the stage. “One person I’d particularly like to point out is our board member, Robert Smith, who gave us a   check,” she said. Joshua Nash, the chairman of the board’s succession committee, said in a statement that his group unanimously recommended Mr. Smith. Until recently, Mr. Smith was little known outside the sleepy world of enterprise software. But in the years since the financial crisis, his firm, Vista, has outperformed titans of the industry such as K. K. R. and T. P. G. Vista, which Mr. Smith founded in 2000 after leaving Goldman Sachs in 1999, buys and sells   software companies such as Solera, Tibco and Misys. Under Mr. Smith’s management, Vista established a remarkable track record by never losing money on a leveraged buyout, and regularly returning investors 30 percent or more on an annualized basis. Last year, Forbes pegged his personal fortune at $2. 5 billion. His wedding to Hope Dworaczyk, a former Playboy model, last year at a   ceremony on the Amalfi Coast made headlines in gossip columns. Growing up in Denver, Mr. Smith was exposed to music from an early age. His father attended the University of Denver on a band scholarship, playing percussion and piano, and Mr. Smith learned to play the piano from both his father and grandmother. By age 7, he was practicing conducting while listing to the radio, and soon became a fan of the pianist André Watts. His family vacationed at Lincoln Hills, a retreat in the Rockies that was popular with jazz musicians, including Count Basie. Mr. Smith later bought it, and now uses it to host underprivileged schoolchildren and musicians including Maceo Parker and Angie Stone. He counts Prince and Michael Jackson among his favorite pop artists, but also has a passion for classical music, especially Brahms and Debussy. His Fund II Foundation donates money to a variety of causes, including preserving   history and culture, human rights, the environment, sustaining American values and music education. Mr. Smith is also the chairman of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Human Rights, serves on the board of overseers of Columbia Business School, is a member of the Cornell Engineering College Council, and is a trustee of the Boys and Girls Clubs of San Francisco. He has supported musical groups including the Sphinx Organization, which promotes diversity in classical music helped bring the Yehudi Menuhin International Violin Competition to the United States and supports Ensemble ACJW, a collaboration between Carnegie Hall, the Juilliard School, the Weill Music Institute and the New York City Education Department. Mr. Smith’s other charitable efforts reflect his commitment to preserving black history. When he was an infant, his mother carried him at the March on Washington, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. Seven years later, his uncle was the victim of a racially motivated killing. In recent years, Mr. Smith has made substantial gifts to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which is set to open in September donated millions to restore   monuments in national parks and supported the Louis Armstrong House Museum in New York. What awaits him at the Carnegie board, however, could test not only his managerial skills, but also his diplomacy and   prowess. When Mr. Perelman abruptly stepped down last year, hopes of landing a   donation from him quickly evaporated as the hall worked to raise money for its education efforts. Now it must press forward with that, while continuing to grapple with questions of how to make classical music relevant and accessible, and over what the proper musical mix of its presentations should be. But Mr. Smith is known as a  . After talking himself into an internship at Bell Labs for college students when he was still in high school, he was once charged with diagnosing a faulty semiconductor. He was in over his head, but the experience, he recounted last year, helped shape his worldview. “I learned not to fear complex problems,” he said, “but to embrace them. ”",0
11788,Veterans Forced to Repay Signing Bonuses…While Billions in Aid Continues Flowing to Israel,"Vladimir Putin: The United States continues to sleep with al-Nusra ‹ › Richard Edmondson is an author, novelist, poet, and journalist whose writings often focus on Middle East issues, the Zionist lobby, and religion. His latest novel is The Memoirs of Saint John: When the Sandstone Crumbles , a story about an archaeological team doing a dig in Syria and set amidst the current conflict in the country. In 2014 Richard attended an International Conference on Combating Terrorism and Religious Extremism, held in Damascus. The book is part two in the Memoirs of Saint John series.

Richard is cognizant of the words of the early Christian writer Tertullian, who in the second century-basically prognosticating the fall of the Roman Empire-wrote: ""We have made merry amid the ludicrous cruelties of the noonday exhibition."" Veterans Forced to Repay Signing Bonuses…While Billions in Aid Continues Flowing to Israel By Richard Edmondson on October 27, 2016 Petition Launched to Stop Veterans from Having to Repay Bonuses 
Let’s say you recruit somebody to do a job for you. Because it’s a particularly dirty job, you’re having trouble finding people to fill the position… so… to sweeten the pot, you offer a $20,000 “signing bonus.” That’s in addition, of course, to the monthly salary you plan to pay them. The added incentive helps. People start signing their names on the dotted line to go to work for you. 
Then nine or ten years pass by. Suddenly one day you think to yourself, “Hell, what did I offer all those bonuses for? That was dumb. I think I’ll demand my money back!” Of course some of the people you paid the money to are no longer alive, and others sustained catastrophic injuries while working for you, but hey! All’s fair in love…and especially in war!!! 
Well, that’s the predicament that a number of US veterans now find themselves in. Back in the days when the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were ramping up big time, military recruiters took to offering sizeable bonuses to get people to join or reenlist. Recently it was reported that the government has begun demanding this money back. Supposedly the bonuses never should have been paid out in the first place, and the decision to do so was a result of oversight, fraud, and mismanagement. 
So…long story short, veterans have begun paying back their bonuses, in some cases at the rate of hundreds of dollars per month, while others, those in financial binds who could not afford to meet the additional expenses, are said to be facing wage garnishment. There are reports that veterans are even being charged interest on their outstanding debt. 
As you may expect, the story of this shabby treatment of American vets has prompted public outrage, and the latest news, posted Wednesday at NPR , is that the Pentagon is now “suspending” the debt collection program. 
Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is calling for “the fair and equitable treatment of our service members and the rapid resolution of these cases,” although the article seems deliberately vague and ambiguous as to whether the bonuses will have to be repaid or whether the debts will be cancelled. The only thing stated clearly is that Carter intends to establish “a streamlined, centralized process that ensures the fair and equitable treatment of our service members and the rapid resolution of these cases.” The “resolution” (whatever that means) of “these cases” is to be completed by no later than July 1, 2017, the Defense Secretary has announced. 
“Ultimately, we will provide for a process that puts as little burden as possible on any soldier who received an improper payment through no fault of his or her own,” Carter said. “At the same time, it will respect our important obligation to the taxpayer.” 
Right now the focal point of the scandal is California, because that’s where most of the illegal bonuses were paid, although it seems veterans in other states may be facing similar demands. Carter’s statement on the matter addresses only the problem in California. 
A petition has been launched demanding Congress take action to rescind the obligation for veterans to repay the bonuses: 
In 2006, at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the California National Guard offered bonuses for troops enlisting and re-enlisting. It was part of an aggressive recruitment effort to retain troops during the height of both of those wars. 
Now, ten years later, the Pentagon is demanding many of those who received bonuses – almost ten thousand service members – pay them back because they were offered in violation of Federal law. 
Right now, veterans are receiving letters from debt collectors, they’re being threatened with tax liens, tax return withholdings and other penalties if they do not repay those bonuses. 
These troops, many of them whom went on to serve overseas, were offered these bonuses in good faith and should not be penalized for what amounts to a bureaucratic failure in oversight. 
Congress, or the Pentagon need to make this right, and they need to do it immediately. 
Sign our petition calling for immediate Congressional action, or action from the Defense Department, to use its authority to waive repayment of enlistment or re-enlisted bonuses they accepted in good faith ten years ago. 
The stories are heartbreaking: 
“It’s gut-wrenching because you have to figure out what you’re going to do and how you’re going to survive. We were paying upward $1,300 a month back to that recoupment. We weren’t able to afford everything — food for the kids, a day care.” – Christopher Van Meter, Iraq War Veteran and Purple Heart recipient 
Congress, or the Department of Defense, must take action immediately to make things right for Christopher, and thousands of veterans like him, who are being forced into an impossible situation because of mistakes they did not make. 
We’re hopeful that there will be resolution on this issue, quickly, and we know that outcome is more likely if we all make our voices heard today. 
Sign our petition calling for immediate Congressional action, or action from the Defense Department, to use its authority to waive repayment of enlistment or re-enlisted bonuses they accepted in good faith ten years ago. 
I have worked in financial management at the base level and at the Pentagon. In my view, there is no more important task an agency has than to alleviate any issues related to the undue financial burden placed on these veterans and their families. 
Thank you for making your voice heard.

The US has been giving money to Israel since 1951, and of course nobody is presently demanding that any of that be repaid. The year 1979 was an especially watershed year–with $3 billion in US tax dollars being paid out. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, a “second special package” was approved in 1985 due to a “severe economic crisis in Israel,” this consisting of two disbursements, totaling $1.5 billion, handed out in 1985 and ’86. (1) 
Economic aid, however, has gradually been phased out over the past 2o years and replaced by increases in military aid. In 2007, the Bush administration approved a 10-year, $30 billion package for military expenses, and most recently the Obama administration approved a $38 billion package that will start in 2019 and cover Israel through 2029. The present rate of flow of US tax dollars to Israel is approximately $10.2 million per day. (2) 
Aid to the Jewish state is of course vigorously pushed by the pro-Israel lobby in Washington. And the lobby, as many of us are aware, doesn’t just clamor for aid; it also promotes wars. 
It’s interesting that many military veterans now being called upon to repay their signing bonuses are veterans of the Iraq war. In the following video, dating from 2002, you’ll see none other than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making a case for military action against Iraq, urging the US to wage “preemptive war”–he actually uses that term, not once but repeatedly–and in the process claiming, falsely, that Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons and was on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. Basically, he plays Congress like a violin. As you watch his performance, a performance that seems almost choreographed, consider what we now know about 9/11, the overwhelming evidence of controlled demolition, and of how the fall of Saddam Hussein led to the rise of ISIS. 
It’s interesting to note what was going on in 2002 when Netanyahu made that appearance before Congress. This was two years after the start of the second Intifada, and Saddam Hussein had begun paying out sums of money, in some cases $25,000 , to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. That’s a fact of history, though not a well-known one. And while Saddam Hussein posed no threat to the US, quite obviously Israel had plenty of reason for wanting him overthrown. And so Netanyahu made his pitch before Congress. And neocon pundits in the media began fanning the flames of war. Weapons of mass destruction! Mushroom clouds! Smoking guns! Yellowcake uranium from Niger! And off we went to war!! 
A war essentially for Israel. 
By 2005 we were caught in a quagmire with no end in sight, and the Pentagon, having trouble meeting enlistment quotas, began sweetening the pot with signing bonuses. Between 2000 and 2008, the money spent on enlistment bonuses rose from $891 million to $1.4 billion. The following is an article from CBS News published back in 2007. You might find it interesting. 
Twenty-nine-year-old Joan Marte thinks now is the right time to join the army. 
“I get to travel, basic training sounds like fun,” he says. 
Yemin Ko, 24, who describes himself as a patriot, is also signing up. 
“I wanted to do something important,” he says. 
The Army needs them both to meet its enlistment goals for this year. 
It surpassed its July recruitment targets by more than 200 new soldiers, CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller reports, by adding recruiters — and with an unprecedented incentive: $20,000 signing bonus given to soldiers willing to ship out to basic training within a month . 
“The intent of the bonus is to get folks to ship quickly so they can attend basic training and we can meet the end strength the army is required to have,” says Lt. Col. Joseph Feliciano. 
In New York, recruitment commanders say they’re already seeing better numbers this month since the signing bonuses were put on the table. And the army hopes to pump up those numbers by September 30th, the end of the fiscal year. 
“Is this what we really want? To bribe people to get them to go and fight an unpopular war?” says Larry Korb, who served as assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan Administration. Korb, who is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, says the new policy will be bad for the army. 
“They’ve already lowered the standards. Last year, when they did meet their recruiting goals, they had lowered the educational and aptitude standards,” says Korb. 
Under the new deal, recruits could be serving in a combat zone within four months. 
“That’s a risk I’m willing to take, and I’m proud of it,” says Ko. 
Yemin Ko says he’ll be ready to serve, and at a time when every body counts, the Army is banking on the same thing. (3) 
That was in 2007. Now here we are nine years later, and veterans are being told to repay the money they were paid. One such veteran is Susan Haley, who got sent to Afghanistan in 2008 and is now trying to repay the bonus she received. She presently sends the Pentagon $650 per month–a quarter of her family’s income. 
“I feel totally betrayed,” Haley told the L.A. Times . “They’ll get their money, but I want those years back.” 
Haley, 47, spent 26 years in the Army along with her husband and oldest son, a medic who lost his leg in Afghanistan. 
There is a lot of outrage felt in America now toward our own government, and certainly a lot of it is justified. But maybe Americans, particularly those whose passions have been aroused over the treatment of veterans, should start considering the enormous influence exerted by the Israeli lobby in Washington, along with the possibility that the anger they’re now reserving for their own government is, at least in part, misdirected.

11789,What Donald Trump’s Victory Means For Men,"The celebrations have ended and we’ve all come to absorb the fact that Donald Trump is our next President, an outcome that many of us have aggressively worked for in the past several months. Now that we’ve gotten what we wanted, it’s time to describe exactly how a Trump presidency will improve our standing.
If the President can say it then you can say it 
The biggest effect we’ll see is the death of political correctness. We now have a shitlord for President who has insulted ugly women as “fat pigs,” and whose private macho talk, which all masculine men have done, was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth. This means that when you talk like Trump, the first thought your listener will have is, “He sounds like the President of the United States.”
What excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it? Either Trump was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didn’t care enough that he made them. Whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the American people has stated that you can exercise your free speech, your opinions, and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities. You can begin removing your politically correct filter.
I’m in a state of exuberance that we now have a President who rates women on a 1-10 scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude. We may have to institute a new feature called “Would Trump bang?” to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity. Simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer, and not the “beauty at every size” sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes . The President of the United States does not see the value in fat women who don’t take care of themselves, and neither should you.
Liberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didn’t have to before 
There are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before. What are they going to do, fire everyone who supports Trump? Accuse every man who voted for him of rape? The way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure, but now we have natural allies in all men who back Trump, even if they don’t subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity .
Liberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before. They will not have easy victories by using labels like “racist” or “sexist.” They will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals, knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly. It may be as simple as whipping out your MAGA hat, as if it’s a bat signal, and having fellow Trump supporters come to your aid. I know that if I see a Trump supporter in trouble, I will help him, regardless of his race or station. Liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate, instead of trying to exile them like in the past.
It will be easier to find a fellow traveler 
Men who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we can’t go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted. If you’re like me, you first “test” a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds, such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how you’ve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy. We’ve even had to devise a special “pet shop” code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on ROK or the forum . We now have a easier shortcut in Trump.
If a man tells you that he voted for Trump, it’s safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders, nationalism , masculinity, and beautiful women. On a basic level, you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond. It also works the other way around where you bring up Trump to screen out those who are offended by him. It’s fine if someone is politically indifferent, but if a man opposes Trump then I have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future. I will distance myself from him for my own well-being.
The cultural decline will halt 
We now have a President who will not encourage anti-male propaganda, rape culture, and female victimhood. While I do have minor concerns on the influence of his feminist-minded daughter, Ivanka, Trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of Obama. Because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense long-term manipulation, it is more than enough for Trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order. Stop feeding the rot and it will die off, allowing biology to naturally reassert itself.
We’ve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we haven’t had a chance to understand what’s going on and adapt. Instead, we’ve been reacting from one blow to the next, whether it’s the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration. Trump’s victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harm’s way.
Conclusion Paradoxically, the benefits of a Trump presidency will not involve specific actions from Trump. His presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist. While we may still get heat for them, it will be less severe and we’ll be less likely to sustain serious damage. Liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left. Victories will be far easier to achieve under Trump than Obama.
This is our moment. The door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men, and the best part of it is that we don’t need to wait for Trump to do anything. His victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bull’s horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors. It would be icing on the cake if Trump rolled back anti-masculine laws and policies, but it’s not required, because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands. Return Of Kings opened in 2012, and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled.

11790,Russia Unveils Update of Advanced Nuclear Weapon,"Russia Unveils Update of Advanced Nuclear Weapon 10/26/2016 
EPOCH TIMES 
Russia has unveiled a new nuclear missile that “is capable of wiping out parts of the earth the size of Texas or France.” 
Reports say that the RS-28 missile, dubbed the “Satan 2,” was unveiled this week, with the first image of the weapon being released to the public by designers at the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau . It’s also known as “Sarmat” in Russian. 
The report comes as Moscow has been flexing its military muscle amid tensions with the United States over the war in Syria and lingering fallout from the invasion of Crimea in Ukraine. NATO, meanwhile, has been shoring up its defenses in countries near Russia’s border amid concerns about its military direction. 
“The prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfill objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia’s strategic forces,” according to a statement from V. Degtar and Y. Kaverin, listed as the bomb’s chief designer and leading designer, respectively, reported RT , a Russian government-funded news site. 
Earlier this year, the Kremlin-aligned Sputnik News website said the missile could “wipe out” portions of the earth the “size of Texas or France.” 
The RS-28 will replace the R-36, which was called the “SS-18 Satan” by NATO when it was introduced in the 1970s. 
Robert Kelley, a former nuclear weapons expert at the U.S. Department of Energy, told NBC News that the new missile most likely had an upgrade in the device’s electronics, rather than an increase in its explosive payload or range. 
“The range of the missiles will be about the same, the explosive destructive power will be about the same [but] the reliability, flexibility and confidence [in the warheads’ ability to hit their targets] will go way up,” said Kelley. 
He noted: “Your iPhone can do thousands of more things today than in the 1970s when these systems were first deployed. Many of the clunky electronic circuits of that era no longer exist and no one knows how to make them anymore.” 
The RS-28 weighs about 100 tons, and it features a large, 10-ton nuclear payload capacity. The missile is expected to enter service in 2018.",0
11791,‘Is This the Spokesperson in Chief You Want?’ - The New York Times,"When Donald J. Trump made provocative remarks on Wednesday about Russian intelligence services and Hillary Clinton’s email, readers of The New York Times responded with a record number of comments. More than 9, 220 comments on the article were approved by moderators, who review nearly every one before they are published on The Times’s digital platforms. Thousands more comments were posted on The Times’s Facebook page. The article became the   on in The Times’s history. At his news conference, Mr. Trump said he hoped Russian intelligence services had hacked Mrs. Clinton’s email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they might have stolen, essentially urging them to commit cyberespionage. Here are excerpts from the comments, some of which have been lightly edited for clarity. Some readers said Mr. Trump’s comments showed he lacked   and signaled that he could not be trusted to keep the nation’s secrets safe. “Trump doesn’t seem to have a grasp on what comes out of his mouth. In his attempts to look strong, and always be talking over others, he seems to be totally unable to control his outbursts and totally ridiculous statements. ”  —   Julius in New York. “The man’s lack of impulse control regarding what comes out of his mouth is the most worrisome aspect of his potential presidency. Regardless of what you believe about Hillary, is this the spokesperson in chief you want for our nation?”  —   GMS in Chicago. “Just imagine, for even a brief second, what he might say when he is president. Who he might talk to on the ‘red phone.’ Remember, when he talks he says what HE thinks is right, not what the world believes. ”  —   D. C. Researcher in Washington. Some readers said Mr. Trump was committing an act of patriotism by seeking to expose Mrs. Clinton’s email and were skeptical that he intended harm with his remarks. “I hate to say it, but if it was Russia, thank goodness that someone had the urge to expose another crooked and rigged system. If you will recall, Trump has said all along that the DNC and Clinton rigged the primaries   …     and he was right. ”  —   Florida Len in Florida. “If you listen to the whole quote it was obviously   cheek, not   . He was making a joke about Hillary deleting all of those emails. ”  —   Gary Taustine in New York. “I was astounded when commentators took Trump’s statement at literal face value. Let’s hope no one ever tells one of these people to go jump off a bridge. ”  —   Jim in New York. “Maybe the American people deserve to see them. She had them open for the [taking]. ”  —   Gary James Richards of Oak Ridge, N. J. on The Times’s Facebook page. Several commenters accused Mr. Trump of sedition or treason and demanded that he be punished.  “That Donald Trump would encourage a tyrant like Vladimir Putin and his surrogates to meddle in our affairs is treason of the highest order. The fact that he would encourage our adversary for his own political gain shows he would stop at nothing to get what he wants. He doesn’t care about anyone or anything other than himself. I wouldn’t ever count on a turncoat traitor like Donald Trump to have my back under any circumstances. ”  —   JG in Old North Bridge, Mass. “To call on a foreign government to engage in espionage against your political opponent that is a former member of the government is sedition and the stuff of banana republics. ”  —   Erik in Boise, Idaho. Some readers suggested Mr. Trump was angling for the spotlight during  the Democratic National Convention.  “Trump just can’t stomach the fact that he is not front and center in the media this week, so he has to come up with something to divert the media’s attention to him. Pitiful excuse for a human, let alone a presidential candidate. ”  —   Lib in Utah. “This is just Trump’s latest stunt to take the news cycle away from the D. N. C. Stop wasting time parsing the meaning of this nonsense!”  —   Doctor Jay in New York. Some readers compared Mrs. Clinton’s  fitness to lead the country in the wake of her  email scandal with Mr. Trump’s  request for Russia to produce the emails. Other readers said that equivalence was false.  “If President Trump saw his approval ratings fall, he might well conspire with Putin to do something nefarious to raise his ratings, even if it meant selling the secrets or the principles of his country. Yes, Hillary is sometimes not completely trustworthy, but Trump has taken untrustworthiness to a new level. ”  —   John in Chevy Chase. Md. “The chief complaint about Hillary Clinton is that she seems inauthentic because she is overly cautious and measures her responses. Well, here’s a perfect example of the opposite of that. Is this who we want in charge? This should be taken very seriously. ”  —   MDNewell in Midlothian, Va.",0

11793,"U.S. Set to Open a Climactic Battle Against ISIS in Mosul, Iraq - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   As Iraqi and American troops prepare to try to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State, the Obama administration is describing the battle as the last major hurdle before declaring victory against the extremist Sunni militancy  —   in Iraq, at least. But some former officials and humanitarian aid groups are worried that President Obama will run into the same problem that haunted his predecessor, George W. Bush: beginning a ground campaign without a comprehensive plan for what happens afterward. “There’s an effort to proclaim mission accomplished, and obviously, getting back Mosul would be a momentous and symbolic defeat for ISIS,” said Vali Nasr, a former State Department official in the Obama administration, using another name for the Islamic State. But, he said, victory in Mosul without a detailed arrangement for how the city and the surrounding province will be governed “does nothing to prevent extremists from resurfacing again. ” Still, Obama administration officials are loath to further delay the operation, which they first envisioned two years ago, in order to sort out in advance the   political arrangements in and around Mosul, Iraq’s   city. The administration is taking the calculated risk that the future of a region populated by a welter of ethnic and religious groups can be worked out peacefully as the battle unfolds or even after the militants are defeated, with American officials serving as brokers when needed but not imposing a plan. By all indications, the battle for Mosul will happen in stages. As in the recapture of Ramadi in December, Iraqi forces will first surround and cordon off the city, then gradually tighten the circle in a process that could take months. In a similar situation, American forces would maneuver into the heart of the city, much as they did in their assault on Baghdad in 2003. But Iraqi forces  —   who do not have the same kind of battlefield support, particularly   medical care  —   have been far more   and deliberate in their operations. A dozen Iraqi Army brigades, each of which includes anywhere from 800 to 1, 600 troops, have been gathering at Qaiyara Airfield West, an Iraqi base 40 miles south of Mosul. Kurdish pesh merga fighters, who are positioned to the north and east, will also help isolate the city. The eventual assault into Mosul will be carried out by Iraq’s counterterrorism service, whose commandos have been trained by American Special Forces and are the country’s most reliable and proficient fighting force. Iraq’s federal police and some Army units will also join the push into the city. The United States military is poised to influence the battle in potentially decisive ways. Apache attack helicopters equipped with Hellfire missiles have been striking targets in northern Iraq, and American and French artillery can be positioned to provide support. American Special Operations commandos have also been active in northern Iraq. American intelligence analysts estimate that 3, 000 to 4, 500 fighters remain in Mosul, a mixture of Iraqi militants and foreign recruits who have been steadily dropping under a barrage of coalition airstrikes over the past several months. One notable loss for the Islamic State was Omar   a Chechen and one of the group’s top field commanders, who was killed in an airstrike in March in a town south of Mosul. “Their backs are against the wall,” Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, who recently stepped down as the overall commander for the United States’ operations in Iraq and Syria, said in a telephone interview. He added that the militants were having trouble drawing new recruits to Syria and Iraq because of tougher border checks by Turkey. “They’re not the ISIS that drove there a couple of years ago,” he said. Even so, the Pentagon and its allies in the   coalition are bracing for a tough fight against an enemy that has burrowed a network of tunnels throughout Mosul, dug trenches and filled them with oil, and planted improvised explosives so densely they resemble minefields. Mr. Obama’s aides say he would like to be able to hand the Islamic State issue to the next president with the Iraq portion at least on the right trajectory, if not solved. The president’s supporters say he does not want to pass to his successor a terrorism threat as bad as or worse than the menace Mr. Obama faced from Al Qaeda when he became commander in chief. “He talks about being a relay swimmer, about the idea that he’s got this moment where he has to turn things over,” said Derek Chollet, a former assistant defense secretary in the Obama administration. But Iraq has a way of confounding even the   plans, and the president’s critics see it differently. “Suppose there are a million refugees from Mosul. What are they going to do?” said Eliot A. Cohen, who was a State Department counselor in the Bush administration. “I’d like to see Mosul retaken, but one thing we all learned from Iraq is that things never simply break your way. ” American military officials acknowledge that retaking Mosul will not defeat the Islamic State, because Raqqa, Syria, the group’s de facto capital, is the heart of its   caliphate. “It is not the end of the caliphate if Mosul falls,” General MacFarland said. But “if Raqqa falls, the caliphate as we know it really begins to unfold. ” For all its complexity, however, Mosul presents an opportunity for the White House that may not be readily at hand in Syria. After nearly eight years in Iraq during the Bush and Obama administrations, the American military knows the terrain well and has a network of large and   Iraqi bases it can use to assist in the fight. It also has a sizable proxy force: the thousands of Iraqi and Kurdish troops the Americans have trained. Some officials expect the militants to pull back from the eastern side of Mosul, which is divided by the Tigris River, and instead defend the west bank, where the government center is. The west bank has many narrow streets, making it difficult for tanks and artillery to operate. A key question is who will secure the city once the Islamic State is driven out.   Shiite militias, which are a politically powerful movement in Iraq, have been accused of detaining and killing hundreds of men who fled the fighting in and around Falluja this year. To guard against human rights abuses, Prime Minister Haider   is expected to give those militias a role well outside the city. The Kurds have already said they will not send their forces into Mosul once it has been secured. Nor does the United States want Iraq to keep its largely Shiite army inside the city any longer than it needs to. As a result, security will have to be provided by thousands of local police officers, including many who have yet to be trained, as well as former officers who joined the Iraqi Army after the Islamic State attacked and now need to be recalled to their police units. More than 20, 000 tribal fighters, whom the Iraqis and Kurds are vetting, will also help with security. This plan has the virtue of giving the lead to local security forces, but it also means that one of the most delicate phases of the operation is being entrusted to fighters who are lightly equipped and whom the United States will not be directly advising. A main concern for critics is that there is no plan in Iraq for how to govern Mosul and the surrounding Nineveh Province. This has prompted fear that retaking the city could aggravate the tensions between the predominantly Sunni population of Mosul and the   government in Baghdad that fueled the rise of the Islamic State in the first place. “There is no agreement about anything after the liberation,” said Atheel   who was the governor of Nineveh Province when the militants charged into Mosul in 2014. “It is very dangerous. ” Mr. Nujaifi is promoting a plan to give the region around Mosul far greater autonomy. But there are no indications that the Iraqi government will go along with that degree of decentralization. While some Pentagon aides are worried, others in the Obama administration say that help from the United States will enable the Iraqis, Kurds and various other groups in Nineveh to figure out a political plan, in part by connecting the disparate factions, including Mr. Nujaifi’s successor as governor, Nofal Agoob. But carving up the political spoils is not the only challenge. Of the two million people who resided in Mosul before it was seized by the Islamic State, aid organizations estimate that about 1. 2 million remain. Humanitarian assistance groups are already stretched thin from dealing with operations to recapture towns outside Mosul. Though residents are being urged to stay in their homes, civilians fleeing the fighting could number in the hundreds of thousands. Some aid groups estimate that as many as a million people could be displaced by fighting to recapture the city, creating a daunting humanitarian task that the United Nations and other organizations say they are not yet ready to deal with.",0

11796,4 STEPS TO ENSURE YOUR AMMO STORES (VIRTUALLY) FOREVER,"Home › GUNS › 4 STEPS TO ENSURE YOUR AMMO STORES (VIRTUALLY) FOREVER 4 STEPS TO ENSURE YOUR AMMO STORES (VIRTUALLY) FOREVER 0 SHARES 
[10/27/16] It’s a fact that without ammunition, your guns will be little more than metal and plastic clubs. But it’s also a fact that if your ammunition has been stored in poor conditions, it not only won’t last as long as it should, but it also could potentially become dangerous to shoot if it is corroded or deteriorated. 
This is why you need to store your ammo the same way you store your firearms. After all, you store your firearms in a secure and environmentally safe location, so why wouldn’t you do the same with your ammunition in which you may have invested even more money? 
All ammo has a definitive shelf life. Eventually, it will go bad. But if you use proper storage techniques, you can make your ammo last on the shelf for year and years. Ammunition that has been taken care of properly and stored in the right conditions should last for 12 to 15 years before you begin to notice signs of discoloration or corrosion. 
Let’s learn about some basic and yet effective storage tips you can use to ensure that you get the most out of your ammo: 
1. Store in metal ammo cans. 
Regardless of whether you like to keep your ammo in the boxes it came in or store it loosely, you will need to place it in metal ammo cans for storage purposes. Green metal ammo cans can be found at virtually any sporting goods store, in the $10-$20 dollar range, depending on the size of the can. 
The reason why you should store your ammo in these metal cans is not just for ease of organization, but also because the cans are airtight and waterproof. They are sealed around the edges, which means you could even dunk them underwater and they would keep the water out. 
2. Store in a dry place. 
Humidity and moisture in general will be the biggest contributor to corrosion and discoloration. Since corroded ammo is not safe to fire, it’s imperative that you select a storage location where the moisture is kept to a minimum. 
Yes, storing your ammunition in the green metal ammo cans will do a lot to resist moisture, but it never hurts to be extra careful. Keep in mind that ammunition is not cheap, so you want to take extra good care of your investment. Store it in a dry place with low moisture levels, and you can sleep knowing your ammo should remain in good condition several years down the road. Post navigation",0
11797,Nikki Haley’s Path: From Daughter of Immigrants to Trump’s Pick for U.N. - The New York Times,"ATLANTA  —   Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina is the daughter of immigrants, favors free markets and global trade, and earned international attention for speaking out against the Confederate battle flag in the aftermath of the 2015 massacre at a black church in Charleston. During Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, she sharply criticized his demeanor and warned what it might mean for American diplomacy  —   even suggesting that his tendency to lash out at critics could cause a world war. But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump named Ms. Haley as his choice for ambassador to the United Nations, a move that will probably serve to both assuage and confound the  ’s critics, raising questions about the tone and direction of his foreign policy. As an   woman, she would also add ethnic and gender diversity to the appointments, so far predominantly of white men, he has made to other top posts in the administration. In a statement, Ms. Haley said she had accepted Mr. Trump’s offer because she felt good about South Carolina’s economic standing. She added that this month’s elections had brought “exciting changes to America. ” “When the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nation’s standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed,” the statement said. Little is known about how Ms. Haley views America’s role in the world. But an equally important mystery is what her clout might be in the Trump administration. Has Mr. Trump placed her in a post he considers marginal? Or will Ms. Haley  —   along with a     secretary of state  —   be able to temper the more radical views of Mr. Trump’s other aides? Despite the unknowns, many diplomats, scholars and rights advocates who have been anxiously awaiting Mr. Trump’s choices were relieved at the announcement. They saw in Ms. Haley, a daughter of Indian immigrants, someone unafraid to express her beliefs even if they differ from Mr. Trump’s. “If confirmed, we hope she will raise that voice on behalf of the world’s most vulnerable people who suffer from hunger, violence and injustice around the world,” the advocacy group Oxfam said in a statement. Many diplomats said they saw Ms. Haley as something of an enigma, whose views on the world have not yet been publicized. But her stance is public on a few issues  —   including the   conflict, refugees, and reproductive rights  —   and they offer a window into how she may carry out her role. She signed state legislation to thwart a   disinvestment campaign against Israel, known as Boycott, Divest, and Sanction, or B. D. S.  —   which made Israel one of the first to welcome her nomination for the post. Ms. Haley has expressed concern about the security checks in place for Syrian refugees resettled in her state, but she is not among those Republican governors who have sued the Obama administration to block resettlement. She describes herself as “ ” and has supported legislation in her state to restrict abortion rights. That position raises questions about whether the United States would reimpose a funding ban on groups that promote family planning overseas, and to what extent the United States would undermine a key United Nations goal to advance sexual and reproductive rights. The reaction from Republicans in South Carolina’s congressional delegation on Wednesday demonstrated the broad appeal Ms. Haley has earned among conservatives statewide and in Washington. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Mr. Trump’s harshest critics in the past, praised the nomination, writing on Twitter that Ms. Haley would be a “strong voice for UN reform and stand for American interests throughout the world. ” But others tempered their admiration for Ms. Haley with concern about whether her public service credentials, which are limited to South Carolina government, would translate to the world stage. “My very practical reaction is that she’d be the least experienced U. N. ambassador in the history of the country,” said Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and a Democrat who befriended Ms. Haley when they served together in the State House of Representatives. “You go from Samantha Power”  —   the current United Nations ambassador  —   “who was very well versed in foreign policy and our geopolitical relationships, to Nikki Haley, who hasn’t been in that depth ever. ” Ms. Haley’s admirers note that she repeatedly traveled abroad as governor to promote the state as a desirable place for investment. Her   trip, perhaps, was a 2014 visit to India, the birthplace of her parents. Her husband, Michael, has served in Afghanistan as an officer in the South Carolina National Guard. More generally, Ms. Haley has overcome concerns that she would be a   insurgent outsider, similar to worries that dog Mr. Trump. Her 2010 campaign was given a major lift by an endorsement from former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the polarizing darling of the Tea Party movement. But Ms. Haley has forged a middle path that embraces the conciliatory racial attitudes favored by the left and the   ethos of the right. This balancing act faced perhaps its greatest test in June 2015, after nine   were shot and killed at the historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The white supremacist charged in the massacre, Dylann S. Roof, had posed with the Confederate battle flag in pictures. And for years, blacks and liberals in South Carolina had pleaded with the conservatives who dominate the state government to take the flag down from a prominent spot it occupied in front of the State Capitol. Ms. Haley, the first ethnic minority and first woman to be elected as the state’s governor, had previously sided with fellow Republicans, who argued that the flag was not a racist symbol. But the Charleston massacre hit home personally. She had been a friend of State Senator Clementa C. Pinckney, a Democrat and pastor of the church, who was one of the dead. Ms. Haley had a change of heart. “I couldn’t look my son or daughter in the face and justify that flag flying anymore,” Ms. Haley told The New York Times in June 2015. At her urging, and after much passionate debate, the State Legislature agreed to remove the flag. Ms. Haley was born in the small city of Bamberg, S. C. to immigrants from Punjab State in India. She has said the locals in South Carolina were often unsure of her place in what is often a Southern binary of black versus white. When Ms. Haley was about 5, she and her sister entered a Little Miss Bamberg pageant where, traditionally, a black queen and a white queen were crowned. The judges decided the sisters fit neither category, so they were disqualified. From a young age, Ms. Haley worked for her family’s clothing business, and she eventually received an accounting degree from Clemson University. She was elected to the State House in 2004. In 2009, she declared she was running for governor and prevailed despite lingering biases. A Republican state senator at the time called her a “raghead” on a radio show. A Democratic state representative said that voters did not consider her a minority, but more of a “nice conservative with a tan. ” Ms. Haley, a nimble campaigner who is equally at home among C. E. O.s and   bikers, easily won   in 2014, arguing that her maintenance of South Carolina’s     atmosphere had been the key to an economic comeback. Under her leadership, the state continued looking beyond its boundaries, very often abroad, to attract new industries to replace a fading textile industry. It is a record that might seem at odds with Mr. Trump’s skepticism of global trade deals and his promise to subject imports from Mexico and China to steep tariffs. But there are other areas of agreement. In 2014, Ms. Haley criticized federal plans that would force power plants to cut carbon emissions. Also like Mr. Trump, Ms. Haley has weathered accusations of sexual impropriety without suffering at the polls. In her first run for governor, two Republican operatives made separate and unproven accusations that they had sexual encounters with her. She strongly denied the assertions. A few years later, Ms. Haley was among those rumored as a potential running mate for Mitt Romney, then a Republican presidential candidate. She said she could not do it because there was too much to be done at home in South Carolina. But she acknowledged that opportunities sometimes arose. “I’ve never been a planner,” she said. “I don’t know what’s next, and I love not thinking about it because the doors open at a certain time. ”",0
11798,"In the New Hollywood, Sumner Redstone Is a Man Out of Time - The New York Times","This is a town built on stories, the more salacious the better. So it comes as not much of a surprise that the twilight of Sumner M. Redstone’s epic career has become the stuff of   conversation, especially among those who knew the man when he was perhaps the most powerful figure in Hollywood. Peter Bart, a former producer and film executive who served as the editor of Variety from 1989 to 2009, was dining recently with friends at Off Vine, a quiet Hollywood restaurant housed in a     bungalow, when the inevitable came up. Others at the table included an   actress who knew Mr. Redstone well. “And they wondered, ‘How could Sumner get himself into this situation? ’” Mr. Bart said. “It is very sad. ” Details about the    tycoon’s private life surfaced during a   lawsuit, which fizzled in court last week. The story that emerged fell somewhere between film noir at its sleazy best and “King Lear. ” Mr. Bart said the billionaire’s plight was coming up a lot lately among   people. “In some cases, there were expressions of empathy,” he said. “But there is impatience with Sumner, too, that he couldn’t keep his private life private. ” The legal proceedings revealed an aging lion who craved sex and steak, although he was too ill to leave his Beverly Park mansion and took his meals through a feeding tube. Court papers described him as “a living ghost” and told of female escorts making visits to his bedside while a nurse sometimes looked on. As Mr. Redstone’s former lover and onetime   caretaker, Manuela Herzer, 51, battled his daughter, Shari Redstone, 62, for control of his daily care  —   not to mention what she saw as her rightful place in his will  —   this   melodrama had it all: wild shopping sprees,   excursions, whispers of a sex tape and, in a bit part, an angry   who seemed like a character out of a Coen brothers movie. Hollywood dynasties have long run into complications in the final reel. In the 1950s, a philandering Jack L. Warner undercut his brother Harry for control of the family’s Warner Bros. studio, and the two never spoke again. In the early 1970s, Darryl F. Zanuck was ousted from 20th Century Fox in a coup, which his wife orchestrated to avenge her husband’s treatment of their son. While those spectacles drew their share of press attention and loose talk, today’s corporate, almost bloodless entertainment industry seems less tolerant of executives who depart from the script. Sure, the stereotype of the hardhearted,   executive persists. But Mr. Redstone’s eccentricities  —   he once boasted that he shaved poolside in the nude  —   and the recent disclosure of his sexual exploits seem out of step with the airbrushed culture of   Los Angeles. “Sumner is caught in a time warp,” Mr. Bart said. The legal fracas has changed Mr. Redstone’s public image from a firebrand whose business acumen and ruthlessness won him control of Viacom, Paramount Pictures and CBS, a $40 billion empire, into something quite different. In the local parlance, he lost the plot. The hubris that precedes a fall was evident in 2009, when he told Larry King, “I have no intention of ever retiring or of dying,” and once again in 2014, when Mr. Redstone told The Hollywood Reporter, “I’m not going to die. ” Recent press attention has deflated such boasts. And secrets Mr. Redstone might have taken to the grave he reserved for himself in Massachusetts, where he was born in 1923, became the stuff of Internet chatter when Ms. Herzer  —   whom he banished from his Beverly Park home last year  —   filed suit. “This is all very Shakespearean, with the family, all the people taking over the kingdom,” said Michael Medavoy, a producer who knows Mr. Redstone. “It’s a tragedy. But my question is, is it a tragic comedy or is it a tragic drama?” After Judge David J. Cowan of Los Angeles County Superior Court tossed the case last Monday, Ms. Herzer filed a new lawsuit against Ms. Redstone. There is talk that Mr. Redstone’s lawyers may pursue a suit, too, meaning the situation could drag on. Mr. Redstone has long been known for his volatility. Across the decades, he has collected enemies the way residents in nearby Malibu pick up sea glass along Carbon Beach. The executives he has crossed include Tom Freston, David Geffen, Mel Karmazin and Barry Diller. In 2006, he split with Tom Cruise over the actor’s erratic behavior and stumping for Scientology, ending Mr. Cruise’s production deal at Paramount. (The star got some measure of revenge with his caustic,    portrayal of a character said to be based on Mr. Redstone in the Hollywood satire “Tropic Thunder. ”) “He was a   man,” Mr. Medavoy said. “But those guys can be difficult. You have to look at it all in context. The great scions of industry, the guys who made a zillion dollars, are tough guys. Those folks don’t make a lot of friends. ” On a recent evening, Christine Peters was nursing a Moscow mule in the Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, Calif. Ms. Peters, a movie producer, dated Mr. Redstone in the late 1990s and remained friends after he moved to the Beverly Park mansion in 2003. She said she had not seen the   tycoon in two years. Despite his position, Mr. Redstone was not a creature of the scene, she said. He avoided galas and opening nights, preferring intimate dinners at Dan Tana’s, the dimly lit,   Italian place on Santa Monica Boulevard with   booths, waiters in black bow ties and bartenders in red   jackets. If she arrived late for a meal, Ms. Peters said, she would find him alone and impatient, drumming his fingers on the table. Mr. Redstone, who was badly burned in a 1979 hotel fire in Boston, did not like to show weakness, Ms. Peters said, and his closest personal relationships seemed transactional, rooted in business. But his devotion to his empire seems to not have given him much protection against hits taken in the recent imbroglio. “He would rather be broke than humiliated and publicly embarrassed, his dignity lost,” Ms. Peters said. “Calling him a ‘living ghost’ is the most hurtful, saying he could not make lucid decisions. That’s where the knife hits hardest for him. ” She added that he regarded as his only worthy rival Rupert Murdoch, the    media king who recently married the former supermodel Jerry Hall. A small crowd gathered at the Vibrato Grill Jazz club here in the Bel Air neighborhood at 6 p. m. for Mr. Redstone’s 92nd birthday celebration a year ago. It was one of his last public appearances. The guests included top executives in his employ, including Leslie Moonves of CBS, Philippe Dauman of Viacom, as well as Brad Grey of Paramount. Tony Bennett serenaded him with his 1962 hit, “I Left My Heart in San Francisco. ” A figurine on the birthday cake was particularly telling. It depicted Mr. Redstone as a corporate titan in a suit and red tie, phone in one hand, television remote in the other. Next to the miniature Mr. Redstone on top of the cake was a tiny stock ticker that showed the prices of six major media companies, including Viacom and CBS. Mr. Redstone sat flanked by his caretaker at the time, Ms. Herzer, and his lover, Sydney Holland, who lived at his estate and has figured into his recent convoluted legal troubles. Mr. Redstone reportedly gave Ms. Holland some $70 million in cash and gifts before kicking her out of his house in the days before he turned on Ms. Herzer. At the party, both women wore evening dresses. The details of the tycoon’s private life probably would not have come to light if Mr. Redstone’s two paramours had not participated in a Vanity Fair profile of him in the June 2015 issue. Ms. Herzer was photographed for the article in a shimmering,   gown. Ms. Holland’s glamour shot showed her on a chaise lounge in Pasadena, Calif. Both gushed about the riches their benefactor had bestowed upon them, which did not sit well with Shari Redstone and a former convict named George Pilgrim, who was dating Ms. Holland at the time. Mr. Redstone’s hostile manner of conducting business and his tendency to go it alone may have also contributed to his   predicament. In a town where business relationships and genuine friendships are often one and the same, his story has become a cautionary tale. “More than one person has said to me, ‘I don’t want to end up alone, at home and angry,’” said Janice Min, who oversees content for Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s almost a    approach. Now, executives drive their kids to school. ” On May 6, an   videotaped deposition of Mr. Redstone’s testimony, shot a day earlier, was played in the courtroom so that the judge could make a determination on whether the media tycoon was mentally fit. Despite his speech difficulties, the nonagenarian used foul language to express his contempt for Ms. Herzer. “I hate her,” he said, adding, “I want Manuela out of my life. ” For many who read the transcript, it was classic Sumner. “He was no more likable a person in old age,” Ms. Min said. “He hasn’t softened into a grandfatherly figure. ” Further, she added: “He doesn’t want a quiet goodbye. He is a ruthless negotiator to the end. ” At the Urth Caffé on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood on yet another cloudless morning, the patio was crowded with   huddled over bowls of coffee and plates of coconut cake. They were buzzing about their new   or the latest Hulu series. For this generation, a   macher like Mr. Redstone seems as alien as the original Hollywood bosses who built the world’s most glamorous business on this   outpost. “He’s obviously very wealthy and influential,” said Eric Dahan, a    chief executive of InstaBrand, a   that connects brands with influencers on Instagram. “But I’m not too familiar with the case, and I don’t think a lot of my generation are. ” He called Mr. Redstone an “icon,” but confessed that he and others his age were focused on another businessman lately in the news. “People in my social circle care more about Donald Trump and whether he will become president,” he said.",0
11799,U.S. Says Russians Were Behind Cyberattacks on Antidoping Agency - The New York Times,"United States intelligence officials have determined that last year’s cyberattacks on the World   Agency originated with the Russian government, perpetrated in apparent retaliation for what President Vladimir V. Putin deemed to be an   effort to defame Russia for widespread doping. That conclusion was published Friday in a declassified intelligence report ordered by President Obama. The report centered on Russia’s efforts to affect the 2016 American presidential election at Mr. Putin’s direction, while also referring to Russia’s related “influence efforts against targets such as Olympic athletes and other foreign governments. ” “A prominent target since the 2016 Summer Olympics has been the World   Agency,” the report said. WADA, the global regulator of drugs in sports, commissioned numerous investigations into systematic Russian doping last year. In July, the agency recommended that Russia be barred from the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro for its   doping program, which persisted for years and spanned disciplines. Weeks later, the regulator discovered that its database containing the private medical information of international athletes had been breached. A group identifying itself as Fancy Bear  —   a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics experts had tied to the Russian government  —   published the records of athletes who had received special clearance to take typically banned substances for medical reasons. In Friday’s report, American intelligence officials concluded that the Fancy Bear hacking had originated with Russia’s main military intelligence unit, the G. R. U. which had also begun working to influence the American election in March. Many of the records stolen from the doping regulator related to American athletes, including Simone Biles, the gymnast who won numerous medals in Rio, and the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The release of the records was an apparent attempt to discredit the athletes and paint the United States as hypocritical, Friday’s report stated. On Friday, Catherine MacLean, a spokeswoman for the antidoping agency, pointed to the organization’s statement in September condemning the criminal activity and noted that the agency had “asked the Russian government to do everything in their power to make it stop. ” Russian news media and sports officials have repeatedly invoked the stolen records in recent months, arguing that they are evidence of legalized doping and what they perceive to be the preferential treatment of Western athletes. Regulators and Olympic officials have repeatedly defended the affected athletes, noting that they followed proper procedure and received formal clearance. “Russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,” Vitaly Smirnov, a former top Russian sports official appointed by Mr. Putin to reform the nation’s antidoping system, said last month, referring to the hacked records as evidence. “The general feeling in Russia is that we didn’t have a chance. ”",0
11800,“The Fed Failed ….” And that Changes Everything,"By Jeffrey Snider, Alhambra Investment Partners 
There is a growing body of public work that suggests Federal Reserve officials are prepared now for a very different sort of normalization than what had been envisioned up until this year. That comes, as noted earlier , with the realization that the economy is not just in rough shape but likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future . 
The important caveat left off that bleak pronouncement is actually ceteris paribus . So long as the current policy and monetary system remains firmly in place, there is little hope the global economy will just spontaneously ignite. Since economists and central bankers have made it clear they aren’t going anywhere despite being wrong about everything up to now, here we are. 
Even Janet Yellen has been forced to concede that even if the Fed does manage to get on with further rate hikes, the ultimate destination for them in nominal terms is much less than prior “cycles.” Current thinking seems to be aiming for around 3% for the federal funds rate rather than 5% as had long been accepted. The way things are going, and as the Japanese showed , they will be lucky to get even half that far. 
But in what can be only another sign of just how twisted, upside down, and easily receptive to pretzel logic the mainstream is now, that is supposed to be a good thing especially for stocks. Writing today for BloombergView , Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor for Allianz, makes this exact argument . 
Equity investors have also been reassured by the growing — and correct — recognition that this Fed hiking cycle will depart drastically from historical norms. Instead of following a relatively linear path of increases at regular intervals, it will have pronounced “stop-go” characteristics. Also, and perhaps more importantly, the endpoint — or what economists call the “neutral rate” — will be considerably lower than recent historical averages. 
How in the world is that a good thing that would “reassure” equity investors ? Truly rational investors make decisions based on discounted information about the future, and what El-Erian suggests here (and he hasn’t been alone) is that stock investors show more preference for “accommodative” monetary policy than actual growth. A lower rate ceiling implies without much ambiguity continued awful economic conditions here and elsewhere around the world. But to the screwed up nature of mainstream thought, so long as monetary policy is lower overall continued stagnation is forgiven, perhaps even to be mildly celebrated? 
What does it mean by claiming “accommodation” that gives “investors” so much apparent comfort? It can’t mean that in economic terms for obvious reasons; instead we are led to believe that low (meaning desperately insufficient) growth isn’t all that bad so long as interest rates don’t rise too far. Investors are supposed to be paying for growth , not the failure of interest rate “stimulus” to seed it. If the Fed feels it can’t raise rates all that much, with a true “ceiling” yet to be determined, it is a much riskier , not less risky, environment. 
The idea of a lower R* or r-star is truly a defining defeat, though it is, like El-Erian’s attempt here, being spun into what is nothing more than rationalization . As I wrote in September , the falling R-star can mean nothing else: 
There is more complexity when we talk about inflation, of course, but by and large it is commodity prices that have thwarted John William’s (or Janet Yellen’s) “normalizing” narrative. Commodities have been falling more intensely since the middle of 2014 but really dating back to the middle of 2011. Both of those inflections recall and are related to obvious eurodollar or global wholesale money events. Thus, even subscribing to Wicksell’s theory, the current rate must now be, as it has been, above the natural rate, unambiguously indicating “tight” money. Whether it is via Friedman’s interest rate fallacy or Wicksell’s natural rate hypothesis, both arrive at the same conclusion due to seemingly intractable market prices. 
Central banks assume that means they have to “stimulate” more when in fact it is just their math telling them they haven’t stimulated at all – at least not where it counts and has been needed. Translating depression into econometrics is a long and costly affair, but it is at least starting to be done, slowly and in discrete pieces. R* may yet be of some great value, insofar as further calculating just how little monetary authorities know about money. 
Reception of and belief about QE have been very much cult-like and it was thus too thinly constructed to withstand being so thoroughly debunked. This is not even close to making the best of a bad situation; it is instead claiming positive attributes that just don’t exist, being downright offensive to common sense. How anyone, let alone El-Erian, wrote that paragraph (contained within an article further rationalizing the latest of the “rising dollar”) without awareness of its very basic flaw can at best be described as intentionally obtuse while still bordering upon nakedly deceiving. The world of the near future is going to be bad, worse than everything “we” have been expecting, but take heart, the Fed’s monetary policy will reflect just that . Translating it from the original mainstream thought-bubble language truly reveals its truly absurd premise… The Fed failed, and that changes everything; including and especially what is to be made of “accommodation” and what it is that might have “reassured” equity investors in the past and might do so (or not) going forward.",0
11801,Reader’s Guide to This Fall’s Big Book Awards - The New York Times,"It’s that time of year when the literary world hands out its biggest prizes. Next week’s announcement of the Nobel Prize in Literature will be followed by the awarding of the Man Booker Prize later in October and the National Book Awards in November. Here’s a guide to the finalists for the honors  —   and the chatter about who might win the Nobel. Nobel Prize in Literature This year’s Nobel Prize in Literature will be announced on Oct. 13, a week later than usual. The voting process is a closely guarded secret, but that never stops readers from scrambling to figure out who might be next to receive the honor. (Last year’s winner, Svetlana Alexievich, was one of the rare nonfiction writers to take home the medal.) Two familiar names sit atop this year’s odds board, according to the   gambling site Ladbrokes: the Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami and the Syrian poet Adonis. They are followed by Philip Roth, who would be the first American to win the award since Toni Morrison in 1993, though he may not have helped his chances with this comment in a 2014 interview: “I wonder if I had called ‘Portnoy’s Complaint’ ‘The Orgasm Under Rapacious Capitalism,’ if I would thereby have earned the favor of the Swedish Academy. ” Other names on the list include Joyce Carol Oates, the Kenyan novelist Ngugi Wa Thiong’o, the Albanian novelist Ismail Kadare and the Spanish novelist Javier Marías. ◆ ◆ ◆ Man Booker Prize The six Booker finalists were drawn from an earlier longlist, and the winner will be announced on Oct. 25. In 2014, the prize, which had previously been limited to writers from Britain, Ireland, the Commonwealth and Zimbabwe, changed its rules to include submissions from any author whose work was published in Britain and was first written in English. This year’s six finalists:  “The Sellout” by Paul Beatty Beatty’s bold satire about race in America was one of the Book Review’s 10 Best Books of 2015. In the Book Review, Kevin Young wrote about the novel in the context of the history of black satire. He said Beatty takes “delight in tearing down the sacred, not so much airing dirty laundry as soiling it in front of you. ” Dwight Garner wrote that the first third of the book “reads like the most concussive monologues and interviews of Chris Rock, Richard Pryor and Dave Chappelle wrapped in a satirical yet surprisingly delicate literary and historical sensibility. ” “Hot Milk” by Deborah Levy Levy’s novel is about a young woman named Sofia who has traveled to Spain with her mother, Rose, in search of a cure for Rose’s possibly psychosomatic ailments. In The Times, Sarah Lyall called the book “gorgeous,” and wrote: “It’s a pleasure to be inside Sofia’s insightful, questioning mind. ” In the Book Review, Leah Hager Cohen expressed mixed feelings: “As a series of images, the book exerts a seductive, arcane power, rather like a deck of tarot cards, every page seething with lavish, cryptic innuendo. Yet, as a narrative it is wanting. ” “His Bloody Project” by Graeme Macrae Burnet Burnet’s novel about a triple murder in   Scotland will be published in the U. S. on Oct. 18. It starts with a confession, so it’s not a whodunit but a whydunit. “My primary interest is in the psychology of the character,” Burnet recently told The Wall Street Journal, “rather than the mystery of what’s happened. ” “Eileen” by Ottessa Moshfegh One of the most widely praised debuts by an American writer this year, Moshfegh’s novel is about a young woman working at a juvenile detention center in New England in the 1960s. On the cover of the Book Review, Lily King praised Moshfegh’s sentences as “playful, shocking, wise, morbid, witty, searingly sharp,” and said that as a character Eileen is “as vivid and human as they come. ” “All That Man Is” by David Szalay Szalay’s novel is composed of nine narratives with different male protagonists. In the Book Review, Garth Greenwell praised the novel, while questioning its label: “The publisher calls ‘All That Man Is’ a novel, but there’s very little explicitly interlinking its separate narratives. The stories cohere instead through their single project: an investigation of European manhood. ” “Do Not Say We Have Nothing” by Madeleine Thien Thien’s latest novel, which will be published in the U. S. on Oct. 11, traces the effects of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, from Mao’s rise to the Tiananmen Square protests. It follows three musician friends through the country’s changes. ◆ ◆ ◆ The National Book Awards The National Book Awards are given in four categories: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people’s literature. The longlists of 2016 finalists have been announced. The shortlists will be announced on Oct. 6 (moved up from the earlier announced date of Oct. 13) with the winners to follow on Nov. 16. The National Book Awards longlist for fiction: (Update: The following books were announced as shortlist finalists for this award: “The Throwback Special” by Chris Bachelder, “News of the World” by Paulette Jiles, “The Association of Small Bombs” by Karan Mahajan, “The Underground Railroad” by Colson Whitehead and “Another Brooklyn” by Jacqueline Woodson.) “The Throwback Special” by Chris Bachelder Bachelder’s fourth novel follows a group of   men as they reunite for the 16th straight year of an odd ritual:   one of the most iconic and gruesome plays in football history, when the Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor sacked the Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann in 1985, shattering Theismann’s leg and ending his career. In the Book Review, John Williams wrote that the novel’s “imaginative freshness allows for sly new questions to be implicitly asked about men’s relationship to sports, to violence, to nostalgia and to one another. ” “What Belongs to You” by Garth Greenwell In this debut novel, a gay American poet narrates his experience in Bulgaria, where homosexuality remains a cultural taboo. Dwight Garner called it an “incandescent” book, in which “an old tale is made new, and made punishing. ” In the Book Review, Aaron Hamburger praised it as “a rich, important debut, an instant classic to be savored by all lovers of serious fiction because of, not despite, its subject: a gay man’s endeavor to fathom his own heart. ” “Imagine Me Gone” by Adam Haslett Haslett’s second novel centers on Michael, a man who has inherited his father’s psychological instability. In the Book Review, Bret Anthony Johnston wrote: “By putting the readers in the same position as Michael’s family members, Haslett has pulled off something of a brilliant trick: We feel precisely what they feel  —   the frustration, the protectiveness, the hope and fear and, yes, the obligation. ” “News of the World” by Paulette Jiles In this historical novel, being published in the U. S. this week, an elderly war veteran in 1870s Texas goes on a long journey with a    orphan, hoping to return her to relatives in San Antonio. “The Association of Small Bombs” by Karan Mahajan Mahajan’s second novel examines the effects of a terrorist bombing in Delhi on the families of two young boys who were killed. Fiona Maazel, in the Book Review, started her assessment like this: “Allow me to skip the prelude to judgment that usually begins a book review, and just get right to it: Karan Mahajan’s second novel, ‘The Association of Small Bombs,’ is wonderful. It is smart, devastating, unpredictable and enviably adept in its handling of tragedy and its fallout. If you enjoy novels that happily disrupt traditional narratives  —   about grief, death, violence, politics  —   I suggest you go out and buy this one. Post haste. ” “The Portable Veblen” by Elizabeth McKenzie Jennifer Senior called McKenzie’s latest novel “a screwball comedy with a dash of mental illness a conventional tale of family pathos a sendup of Big Pharma a meditation on consumption, marriage, the nature of work. ” It also includes a squirrel that may or may not be communicating with the lead character. In the Book Review, Patricia Park said McKenzie “adroitly skirts the line between the plausible and the absurd. ” “Sweet Lamb of Heaven” by Lydia Millet A woman in Alaska flees her politically ambitious husband, with her daughter in tow, in the prolific Millet’s latest novel. In the Book Review, Laura Lippman wrote: “I have little patience with literary novels that claim to have the propulsive momentum of a thriller, yet Millet pulls it off. ” “Miss Jane” by Brad Watson Watson’s novel is based on the life of a   in rural Mississippi in the early 20th century who couldn’t have children and never married. In the Book Review, Amy Grace Loyd wrote: “Watson’s facility with upending expectations and upsetting the lines between all sorts of categories  —   good and bad, normal and abnormal, pride and shame, love and hate  —   is at its keenest and applied most carefully. ” “The Underground Railroad” by Colson Whitehead Whitehead’s   novel imagines the Underground Railroad as a literal mode of transportation. The book has been selected by Oprah Winfrey’s book club, and has spent eight weeks and counting on The Times’s   list. Michiko Kakutani called it “a potent, almost hallucinatory novel that leaves the reader with a devastating understanding of the terrible human costs of slavery. ” In the Book Review, Juan Gabriel Vásquez wrote: “In its exploration of the foundational sins of America, it is a brave and necessary book. ” “Another Brooklyn” by Jacqueline Woodson Woodson is a celebrated writer of children’s books (“Brown Girl Dreaming” and many others) and this is her first novel for adults in 20 years. In it, an anthropologist returns home for the funeral of her father and is spurred to memories of her girlhood. In the Book Review, Tayari Jones called the novel “haunting” and “powerfully insightful. ” ◆ ◆ ◆ The National Book Awards longlist for nonfiction: (Update: The following books were announced as shortlist finalists for this award: “Strangers in Their Own Land” by Arlie Russell Hochschild, “Stamped From the Beginning” by Ibram X. Kendi, “Nothing Ever Dies” by Viet Thanh Nguyen, “The Other Slavery” by Andrés Reséndez and “Blood in the Water” by Heather Ann Thompson) “America’s War for the Greater Middle East” by Andrew J. Bacevich The military historian Bacevich offers a history and critique of America’s militarized approach to the Middle East. In the Book Review, David Rohde said that Bacevich’s latest book “extends his string of brutal, bracing and essential critiques of the pernicious role of reflexive militarism in American foreign policy. As in past books, Bacevich is   profane and fearless. ” “The Firebrand and the First Lady” by Patricia   The story of Eleanor Roosevelt’s long friendship with Pauli Murray, a black woman born in 1910 who was a poet, memoirist, lawyer, activist and Episcopal priest. Irin Carmon, in the Book Review, wrote: “  allows these women to speak for themselves, a light touch that works with two heavyweights. ” “Imbeciles” by Adam Cohen Cohen revisits the U. S. Supreme Court’s 1927 decision in Buck v. Bell, which upheld a statute that enabled the State of Virginia to sterilize “mental defectives. ” On the cover of the Book Review, David Oshinsky called it “a superb history of eugenics in America. ” Jennifer Senior felt the book was repetitive and disorganized, and wished Cohen spent “more time on the American obsession with the feebleminded  —   which is by far the richest, most fascinating, most horrifying aspect of his book  —   and less time in the courtroom. ” “Strangers in Their Own Land” by Arlie Russell Hochschild In this unprecedented election year, Hochschild’s book takes a close look at Tea Party supporters in Louisiana. In the Book Review, Jason DeParle called it a “generous but disconcerting” work. “While her hopes of finding common political ground seem overly optimistic, this is a smart, respectful and compelling book. ” “Stamped From the Beginning” by Ibram X. Kendi In his latest, the historian Kendi looks at the long history of racist thought in America, and how it has been used to enforce discrimination. “Nothing Ever Dies” by Viet Thanh Nguyen Nguyen won the Pulitzer Prize in April for his novel “The Sympathizer. ” That book was set against the Vietnam War. In this nonfiction work, Nguyen looks closely at the war, and at how it was perceived by the various sides involved. Nguyen discussed his work on the Book Review’s podcast earlier this year. “Weapons of Math Destruction” by Cathy O’Neil O’Neil’s book raises concern about the increasing role algorithms play in regulating people. Clay Shirky wrote: “Her knowledge of the power and risks of mathematical models, coupled with a gift for analogy, makes her one of the most valuable observers of the continuing weaponization of big data. ” “The Other Slavery” by Andrés Reséndez This ambitious history looks at the centuries during which tens of thousands of Native Americans were enslaved, and the profound effect the practice had on Indian populations across North America. “The Slave’s Cause” by Manisha Sinha Sinha, a professor of   studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, aims to connect the war against slavery in the United States to other liberation movements. “It is difficult to imagine a more comprehensive history of the abolitionist movement,” Ira Berlin wrote in the Book Review. “Blood in the Water” by Heather Ann Thompson Thompson’s account of the notorious Attica prison uprising in 1971 is one of the year’s most discussed works of history. “This is not an easy book to read  —   the countless episodes of inhumanity on these pages are heartbreaking,” James Forman Jr. wrote in the Book Review. “But it is an essential one. ” Mark Oppenheimer wrote that “not all works of history have something to say so directly to the present,” but Thompson’s book, “which deals with racial conflict, mass incarceration, police brutality and dissembling politicians, reads like it was   for the sweltering summer of 2016. ” ◆ ◆ ◆ 5 Under 35 The National Book Foundation, which administers the National Book Awards, has also announced the winners of its annual 5 Under 35 honors, which recognize five especially promising debut fiction writers under the age of 35. This year’s winners are Brit Bennett (“The Mothers”) Yaa Gyasi (“Homegoing”) Greg Jackson (“Prodigals”) S. Li (“Transoceanic Lights”) and Thomas Pierce (“Hall of Small Mammals”).",0
11802,"Dilma Rousseff, Facing Impeachment in Brazil, Has Alienated Many Allies - The New York Times","BRASÍLIA  —   They were idealists, united in the struggle against Brazil’s military dictators. As democracy flourished, so did their careers. One of them, Paulo Ziulkoski, became the leader of an association of Brazilian cities. The other, Dilma Rousseff, rose even higher, becoming the president of Latin America’s largest country. But their friendship soon fell apart. During a contentious meeting with the nation’s mayors in 2012, Ms. Rousseff rejected pleas for a share of Brazil’s soaring oil revenues. After the room erupted in jeers, Mr. Ziulkoski said, she stormed up to him, poked a finger in his face and humiliated him with a string of expletives. “I never imagined a president could utter such words,” Mr. Ziulkoski said, noting that dozens of mayors have abandoned Ms. Rousseff and her party. To Mr. Ziulkoski, the public dressing down was the kind of rupture that symbolized “the beginning of the end for her administration. ” As Ms. Rousseff wages a   battle to stave off impeachment and save her presidency, she has accused her rivals in Congress of creating  turmoil, saying they are orchestrating a coup d’état to oust her. More than   of Brazil’s lower house voted last month to approve an impeachment measure on charges that she illegally borrowed from state banks to plug budget holes. (She is not accused of stealing for personal enrichment.) Many experts say the next step, a trial in the Senate that could begin in the coming weeks, will probably end in her removal. “I will struggle with all my might until the   are defeated,” Ms. Rousseff said in an interview. But many political analysts say Ms. Rousseff’s   downfall can also be tied to an autocratic persona and a    work style that has driven away scores of political allies, former staff members and cabinet ministers, many of whom have endured searing episodes of public humiliation. “She’s alienated so many politicians and squandered the good will of so many people, in part because of her terrible political skills but also because of her arrogance,” said Edson Sardinha, the editor of Congresso em Foco, a magazine that focuses on government corruption. “In her hour of need, very few people are willing to run to her defense. ” The upheaval goes far beyond Ms. Rousseff’s leadership style. Brazil is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades, with millions of people falling out of the middle class into poverty. Inflaming their rage, political elites of every stripe have engorged themselves in a   graft scheme involving the national oil company. Ms. Rousseff, who has been politically battered by the scandal, said she was the victim of a naked power grab and sexist assumptions of how a woman should lead. She also said she was a convenient scapegoat for something she cannot control: the global plunge in commodity prices that has sent the economy into a tailspin. But her vow to bring millions of Brazilians into the streets in her defense has produced little popular support. Siding with her opponents are scores of onetime allies, including five former ministers in her administration, the nation’s vice president, and six justices on the Supreme Court who were appointed by Ms. Rousseff or her most powerful defender, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In more than five years in office, Ms. Rousseff has largely refused to meet with members of Congress, both opponents and allies, eroding the majority support she once enjoyed in the lower house. The aggrieved include Eduardo Suplicy, a former senator and beloved figure in Ms. Rousseff’s Workers’ Party, who said she had turned down multiple requests for a meeting. “In politics, either you talk or you die,” said Alfredo Nascimento, a former transportation minister. In April, he voted for her impeachment. “I can’t support a president who is incapable of governing,” he said. In Brasília, the capital, most everyone can recount stories about Ms. Rousseff’s intolerance for dissent and her short fuse. The anecdotes include the time she smashed an office computer in anger, her refusal to meet with indigenous leaders or gay rights activists and the castigation of aides for the smallest of infractions. She is also finding little sympathy from the Brazilian news media, which has long viewed her as cold and condescending  —   a marked contrast to the charismatic, backslapping approach of Mr. da Silva. Some agree that Ms. Rousseff is being judged by a double standard that has unfairly tarnished powerful women around the world. Would she be considered so obstinate and uncooperative if she were a man? Or would she simply be called a strong, decisive leader? “The president is enduring all the stereotypes and prejudices of Brazil’s highly patriarchal and oligarchic society,” said Rosana Schwartz, a historian and sociologist at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in São Paulo. “I’ve even heard people say, ‘We will never again vote for a woman.’ ” But Antonia Melo, a former Workers’ Party member, said Ms. Rousseff’s gruff manner had alienated many of the party faithful. Ms. Melo described a meeting, when Ms. Rousseff was minister of energy, during which activists hoped to make their case against a contentious dam project in the Amazon. Ms. Melo said she had barely finished her first sentence when Ms. Rousseff cut her off, pounded on the table and vowed to press forward with the dam’s construction. Then she turned around and left the room. “We stood there looking at each other in silence, perplexed,” Ms. Melo said. “We felt so disrespected and discarded. ” The episode was stinging given the origin of the Workers’ Party and Ms. Rousseff’s pedigree as a champion of the disenfranchised. The party’s founders were Marxist guerrillas who rose to power through a coalition of trade unionists, landless farmers, indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals who helped pave the way for the   of democracy in 1985. But that coalition is in tatters. Ms. Rousseff is battling accusations that she hid the depths of Brazil’s economic troubles to enhance her   prospects. Many bedrock supporters are disillusioned by widespread corruption in the national oil company, Petrobras, and by what many describe as Ms. Rousseff’s   after her   in 2014, on several campaign promises to preserve generous government spending. In recent weeks, at least 135 mayors aligned with the Workers’ Party have changed their party affiliations  —   about a fifth of the nation’s mayors who had been elected on the party’s ticket. Among them are João Paulo Ribeiro, 31, the mayor of a small city, who said he had grown weary of the attacks by residents and even friends who questioned his association with Ms. Rousseff’s party. “I have to listen to the people,” said Mr. Ribeiro, who changed parties last month, hoping to improve his chances for   in October. It is not as if the political figures lining up to oust Ms. Rousseff are viewed as saviors. Many of them are battling serious accusations of corruption, and they were in positions of great power as the country’s   economy ran aground. Rising unemployment and the broad unrest over Brazil’s economy only added to the strains between Ms. Rousseff and Congress. Had the economy been ascendant  —   as it was in 2005 when her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, became embroiled in a   scandal  —   she might have emerged unscathed. The end of Brazil’s bonanza complicated the patronage used to navigate the fractious legislature, in which more than two dozen parties fight for government funding. “We have a political system based on extracting money from the economy and transferring it to political parties to finance elections,” said Rubens Ricúpero, who served as minister of finance in the  . Many Brazilian economists and policy makers contend that the economic crisis was largely a product of Ms. Rousseff’s own making. She increased the government’s footprint in the economy, spending large amounts on favored industries and corporations to build up national champions. That not only produced an array of big, unfinished projects and bad debt, which now hobbles the   banks, but also opened the door to   corruption. “Brazil insisted in carrying out an industrial policy devoid of logic,” said Arminio Fraga, a former governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. “When the government offers companies all sorts of advantages, through protection, subsidies and contracts, it creates enormous space for this sort of thing. ” Friends and associates say Ms. Rousseff’s worldview and personality were partly shaped by the three years she was imprisoned by the military, a trauma that included torture like beatings and shocks with an electric baton. As president, Ms. Rousseff has refused to seek vengeance against her torturers, and she was widely praised for backing a National Truth Commission that exposed the abuses of the era but did not mete out punishments to the accused. In 2014, she wept on television after receiving the commission’s final report. An economist and career bureaucrat, Ms. Rousseff, 68, had not held elected office until Mr. da Silva, who was barred under the Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term, picked her to run for president on the Workers’ Party ticket. Mr. da Silva has said he was impressed by her grasp of complex data and her   managerial style. Idelber Avelar, an early member of the Workers’ Party, said Mr. da Silva also viewed Ms. Rousseff as a compliant soldier who would continue his policies and keep the economy humming until he could run again. “Clearly, he thought Dilma was somebody he could easily control, a technocrat who would run the machine, which is pretty ironic given that she’s proven to be a disastrous administrator,” said Mr. Avelar, who now teaches at Tulane University in New Orleans. “The root of all her problems is a profound aversion to politics. ” At least 86 cabinet ministers have come and gone since she took office, and only three remain from her first term. Many were forced to resign after being accused of corruption. Nearly   of the 594 members in Congress face serious charges like bribery, electoral fraud, kidnapping and homicide, among them Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the lower house leading the impeachment effort. He has been accused of stashing $40 million in bribes. Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of graft, though many people question her innocence, given her role as chairwoman of the national oil company at a time when the epic kickback scheme was being hatched. In an interview, Ms. Rousseff brushed off suggestions that her disdain for retail politics and the horse trading required to pass legislation had contributed to her woes. She defended her decision to ignore members of Congress. “There were certain types of blackmail negotiations I would not engage in,” she said. For a time, the Brazilian public viewed her steely resolve positively. During her first year in office, Ms. Rousseff’s popularity stood at 77 percent, among the highest percentages in recent history. These days, that figure is in the single digits. Many Brazilians still admire Ms. Rousseff’s ethics. But after two years of economic turmoil, her televised speeches prompt a cacophony on the streets, as thousands bang on pots and pans to drown out her voice. Few give Ms. Rousseff credit for big achievements, including a landmark freedom of information law and measures that gave federal police and prosecutors new tools to tackle corruption. In some ways, analysts said, Ms. Rousseff has become a victim of those laws, which paved the way for the investigations that have claimed scores of the political and business elite, exposing the depths of Brazil’s political rot. “This is one of the greatest paradoxes of her fall, because she put in place the machinery that ensnared the politicians who mattered the most,” said Gregory Michener, a professor at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro. “Dilma did a lot for good government, and I think she ultimately wanted good government, but in the end she wasn’t a good politician because in Brazil’s   party system, she was unwilling to give her allies their fill. ”",0
11803,"Comment on ObamaCare fallout: As premiums rise, so does cost to taxpayers by Glenn47","Going as planned . 
From Fox News : The Obama administration is trying to calm the panic over soaring ObamaCare premiums by pointing to subsidies many will receive to offset the cost — but analysts and GOP lawmakers counter that those subsidies nevertheless will stick taxpayers with a rising bill. 
With enrollment set to begin Nov. 1, the administration announced Monday that premiums are set rise an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market. Some states, such as Arizona, will see premiums jump by as much as 116 percent. 
Department of Health and Human Services officials are stressing that subsidies provided under the law, which are designed to rise alongside premiums, will insulate most customers from sticker shock. 
But the rising cost of subsidies, which already totals tens of billions a year, would be passed on to the taxpayer. 
“Taxpayers are already in for a lot,” Tom Miller, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told FoxNews.com. “The cost doesn’t go away, it just goes into someone else’s pocket.” 
In a March report , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that subsidies given to enrollees in 2016 would amount to $43 billion in 2016, and predicted the cost would rise to $106 billion by 2026 . It also said that over 10 years, ObamaCare provisions would reduce the deficit thanks to tax provisions and cuts to Medicare. That was before the latest announcement by the administration. It’s unclear how exactly the looming premium hikes will affect that picture, though Republicans are now seeking new estimates. 
Analysts say it’s safe to assume taxpayer costs will rise. Miller noted that HHS reported an average subsidy of $291 per month in 2016. A 25 percent increase in premiums would theoretically translate into an extra $73 per month, or about $870 a year per person. 
“If you assume conservatively that there’s 10 million people getting subsidies, that’s an extra $8.5 billion in extra costs taxpayers are getting hit by going into next year,” he said. 
Other experts warned this is likely to continue as long as premiums keep rising. “Its real simple, premiums are going up and up, and subsidies are going to go up with them,” Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former CBO director, told FoxNews.com. 
The Department for Health and Human Services, when asked for comment by FoxNews.com, noted that the law’s coverage provisions are set to cost 28 percent less in 2019 than the CBO originally projected, amounting to about $49 billion less than originally predicted when the law was signed in 2010. A spokesman also said the same office predicted that repealing the law would increase the deficit by approximately $350 billion over 10 years. 
Holtz-Eakin urged caution on the administration’s analysis. “It’s been a mixed pattern, because the enrollments haven’t been what they expected so it hasn’t been as big of an impact financially,” he said. “The bad news is that spending per person is much higher than anticipated due to subsidy increases because of premium hikes.” 
One of the biggest ObamaCare costs to taxpayers has been absorbed into the Medicaid budget, paid for by both state and federal governments. As a sweetener to get states to go along with the plan, the federal government offered to pick up the cost of expanding Medicaid eligibility up to 133 percent of the poverty line. That siphoned low income — and expensive – customers away from ObamaCare exchanges, seemingly contributing to its current solvency. But that cost – in the hundreds of billions — also is borne by taxpayers. 
The CBO projected in 2013 that, in part due to ObamaCare, federal Medicaid spending would more than double over the next 10 years , topping $554 billion by 2023. State governments pay another $160 billion toward Medicaid. “Volume has been greater in Medicaid, and per person costs have been much higher than expected,” Edmund Haislmaier, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told FoxNews.com. 
Sensing a spike in taxpayer costs, the Republican-led House Committee on Energy and Commerce has written to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demanding how much taxpayer money will be spent subsidizing the cost of rising premiums. 
“While the Administration continues to focus on premium ‘affordability,’ it ignores the undeniable fact that federal taxpayers are subsidizing these premium increases through tax credits,” the letter from Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., says. “The Committee is concerned that the federal taxpayer continues to bear the burden of subsidizing the growing cost of health care insurance.” 
The committee is demanding estimates of the amount of money spent covering rising premiums by Nov. 7.

11804,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions Reforming Obama’s Lax Policies on Crime, Drug Trafficking - Breitbart","U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has begun a comprehensive reform of former President Barack Obama’s lax policies towards rising crime and is directing federal prosecutors to use every legal tool they have to remove criminals from communities. [“Unfortunately, the most recent crime data available shows a 10. 8 percent in murders in this country, while federal prosecutions for violent crimes have been declining,” Sessions wrote in a memo to all federal prosecutors Wednesday. He continued:  It is the policy of the Department of Justice to reduce crime in America, and addressing violent crime must be a special priority. With crime rates rising, this is not an easy task as all professionals know. But, we do have strong evidence that aggressive prosecutions of federal laws can be effective in combatting crime. Our Department’s experience over decades shows these prosecutions can help save lives. Sessions reference to rising murder is drawn from the FBI’s 2015 crime report. The report revealed a 10. 8 percent increase in murders from 2014 to 2015 —  the largest increase in a single year since 1971 —  and a 3. 9 percent increase in violent crime overall. Major cities were hit with a staggering 21. 6 percent increase in murders, another FBI report found. Under Obama, a sudden reversal of a   decline in violent crime took place in 2015 after be pushed his “  ” campaign against state and local police following the August 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Sessions has now directed the 94 federal U. S. Attorney’s Offices to work with state and local law enforcement to “specifically identify the criminals responsible for significant violent crime in their districts,” and ensure they are prosecuted. Sessions specifically cited drug trafficking as a major contributor to violent crime, urging prosecutors to take down dealers and their enterprises. “[M]any violent crimes are driven by drug trafficking and drug trafficking organizations. For this reason, disrupting and dismantling those drug organizations through prosecutions under the Controlled Substances Act can drive violent crime down,” he said. The memo also indicates Sessions will demand prosecutors seek mandatory minimum sentences, Politico reports. Sessions’ approach is a complete   from the Obama administration’s efforts to minimize penalties against drug traffickers. For example, Obama launched an unprecedented effort to slash drug traffickers’ sentences, many of whom are armed convicts: He commuted over 1, 700 federal prisoners’ sentences before leaving office, saying it was “the right thing to do” and “we all make mistakes. ” Using revised sentencing guidelines, the Obama administration also released 30, 000 convicts from federal prison. In 2013, former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder told prosecutors not to mention the weight of drugs seized from traffickers when officials were filing crime reports. The purpose was to avoid triggering the strong sentences. The soft approach was bad news for communities, but good news for traffickers eager to get back into the   business: Recidivism rates for those charged with drug crimes stand at 77 percent, according to a Justice Department study commissioned under Holder. While the media uses the term “drug offenders” to paint a sympathetic picture of dealers, there are almost no cases of simple possession in federal courts, as Sessions explained during a May press conference. Nearly all, of 99. 5 percent those incarcerated in federal prison on   charges, were found guilty of trafficking illicit drugs. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent enterprise “inseparable from violent victimization” and the ravages of addiction. Over 47, 000 people died from   deaths in 2014 alone. Heroin overdose deaths have more than tripled between 2010 and 2015. Immigration also fueled this surge of   : Nearly all of the heroin used in the U. S. is brought across the border by   traffickers. “By consistently identifying the leading violent offenders in our communities and employing all available tools to hold them accountable, we will combat violent crime,” Sessions added. The Obama administration’s efforts to slash the prison population is directly linked to the massive   death toll, according to one federal prosecutor. Read Sessions’ memo here.

11805,Jesus Christ's Real Tomb Finally Discovered in Jerusalem underneath Sepulchre Church,"
A burial slab believed to have held the body of Jesus Christ before he was resurrected has been uncovered for the first time in centuries by a restoration team in Jerusalem.
The original limestone shelf, known as a â€œburial bed,â€ was exposed during the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after being covered by marble since at least 1555 A.D.
â€œIt will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid,â€ Fredrik Hiebert, an archaeologist involved in the discovery, told National Geographic.
According to scripture, Jesus Christ was laid on the shelf in the tomb after dying at the crucifixion around 33 A.D. After three days his remains were discovered to be missing and Jesus was said to have appeared over a span of 40 days before ascending into heaven.
The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the National Technical University of Athens (NTU) who were making restorations to the Edicule (â€œlittle houseâ€), a structure which had been built around the tomb.
The tomb was found underneath this Crypt at the Sepulchre Church. Throughout the years there have been many conspiracies about the location of Jesus’s tomb but the Christian Orthodox Church has always maintained that the tomb is underneath Sepulchre Church.
Researchers now hope to study the original surface to better understand the original tomb and how it evolved to become one of the most sacred sites in Christendom.
“We are at the critical moment for rehabilitating the Edicule,” Chief Scientific Supervisor Professor Antonia Moropoulou told National Geographic. “The techniques we’re using to document this unique monument will enable the world to study our findings as if they themselves were in the tomb of Christ.”
The newly-uncovered surface was described as having a grey-beige stone surface.
Also known as the Church of the Resurrection, its custody is shared between six Christian denominations including the Greek Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Armenian Orthodox Church, whom together invited the NTU to undertake the restoration.
At a cost of US$4 million, (â‚Ź3.7 million) the restoration was not cheap, with major donors including Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Mica Ertegun, widow of Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun.

11806,Why ‘This Is Fine’ Is the Meme This Year Deserves - The New York Times,"During the Democratic National Convention, the Republican Party shared a popular meme to Twitter: a   comic of a dog sitting at a table with a cup of coffee. The room is on fire. This is fine. The meme, derived from a webcomic by the    illustrator K. C. Green, is a bit like those “Keep Calm and Carry On” posters, just with an absurdist twist. It is halfway between a shrug and complete denial of reality. “It’s a basic concept that can apply to a lot of differing situations,” Mr. Green wrote in an email on Wednesday. “That’s the whole idea behind memes and the like. ” Many memes, like “Dat Boi” or “Damn, Daniel,” exemplify the sort of     nonsense that can briefly take over pop culture before vanishing. But a durable meme, like “Crying Jordan” or “This Is Fine,” allows people to use it as cultural commentary. “This Is Fine,” which is actually part of a larger comic created for Mr. Green’s webcomic series “Gunshow” in 2013, has inspired fan art and a number of derivative works on websites like Tumblr. The illustration reached the political mainstream with the G. O. P. ’s tweet, and what followed was a relatively unusual exchange between the political establishment and an artist. The Republicans had not compensated Mr. Green. (It’s common for musicians to criticize a political candidate’s use of their song, but a cartoonist criticizing the use of a meme derived from his art? That’s new.) “Having this comic and other images from my past works be made into memes before, this was really nothing completely new,” Mr. Green said of his reasoning for creating the elephant image. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t get to like some of the people who do use it, including the G. O. P. ” Slate saw the Republican tweet as a   development: “The trouble with such tweets  —   whether they’re coming from left or right  —   is that they’re mostly going to make sense to people who will discard them as soon as they spread too far,” Jacob Brogan wrote. But another chapter appears to have given the meme new life: Mr. Green issued an update through The Nib, called This Is Not Fine, in which the dog wakes up from his stupor and panics. “I thought it would be more angry when I was writing,” he said, “but it turned into more just losing your cool in a situation, which reflects better, I think. ” In an email, Matt Bors, an editor of The Nib, said the update was commissioned because “2016 has been such a gross, depressing slog. ” He added: “You acclimate to the crazy, you think ‘this is fine.’ It’s not. We needed that dog to come back. ” In this case, with the staying power comes the merchandise: A Kickstarter campaign launched this week has raised more than $200, 000 to manufacture a plush This Is Fine toy. In the meantime, Mr. Green also continues to work on other projects: He writes and draws “He Is a Good Boy,” a webcomic about an acorn that explores themes of horror, gore and existentialism. This is fine.",0
11807,"Sarah Jessica Parker and Ta-Nehisi Coates, on New Literary Paths - The New York Times","Having conquered their respective fields, the actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the journalist   Coates are heading into the literary unknown. SARAH JESSICA PARKER has a voice made for libraries, which is convenient because we are in one  —   specifically, the Amagansett Free Library on Long Island, a location Parker chose because she has always loved libraries and because it’s close to the beach house she owns with fellow actor Matthew Broderick, to whom she has been married since 1997. It’s late summer. She is wearing a seasonable, unfashionable tan under a white cotton dress with high espadrilles and she has brought her glasses, her Blackberry, her sweater in case of air conditioning and a   manuscript. You’d be excused for guessing the manuscript is her own. Parker, 51, has been acting for over four decades, which is plenty of justification for a memoir. It’s been almost 20 years since the premiere of “Sex and the City,” the show that fixed her star in Manhattan’s sky and made her character, Carrie Bradshaw, the avatar of   womanhood. Neither character nor actress has since known a day’s rest from inspiring other people’s personal style, and if Parker were to print an inventory of her storage closet and bind it in her favorite color, peacock blue, it would be a best seller. Yet Parker would rather see her initials on the spine than her name on the cover, and next year she will. Hogarth, the publishing house founded in 1917 by Virginia and Leonard Woolf, is mounting SJP for Hogarth, where, as editorial director, Parker will help to find, edit and publish three or four new novels a year. The head of Hogarth, Molly Stern, met Parker at a luncheon three years ago and offered her the role over dinner this past spring. Parker said yes in a second. “I have always loved to read for the same reason I love to act,” she says, “which is that other people’s stories are more interesting to me than my own. ” Parker’s father was a poet and journalist, and she has “the greatest respect and love” for what writers, editors and even literary agents do. What she is doing herself, for Hogarth, is an ode more to her mother, Barbara Forste, a retired nursery schoolteacher and lifelong, compulsive reader. If Parker can be found reading in the makeup chair on an HBO set, it is because Forste used to drive the kids to school with a novel in her lap, and if Parker is excited to work with librarians  —   Hogarth is partnering with the American Library Association to get more books, and not just Hogarth books, into more hands  —   it is because Forste made sure a young Sarah Jessica was never without a library book in her school bag. “What are you reading?” she asks me, picking up one of the two paperbacks I’ve brought with me, scanning the back cover and opening it at random to bury her nose in the crepey musk. “People have tried to bottle the smell of old books,” she says, “but it’s the most elusive thing, like trying to recreate a great story. You can’t, which is what makes it special. ” A literary manuscript, she says, should come with a blank white cover  —   no title, no name  —   like a vial of perfume for a blind test, without a whiff of identity. The manuscript she’s reading is of a novel by Edan Lepucki, “Woman No. 17,” to be published by Hogarth in May, and it is one of dozens she will read  —   for research, a sense of the landscape  —   before fall, when SJP for Hogarth makes its first round of selections. Criteria, says Parker, include “great stories” and “global voices,” which is another way of saying she can’t say too much. But we can take our clues from the qualities she has noted in recent literature. The Irish novelist Eimear McBride wields a language in her 2013 debut, “A Girl Is a   Thing,” that is as “brutal and mythic, almost familiar” as it is formally inventive, whereas Colson Whitehead takes a history of mass brutality and makes it “happen right in front of you” in his latest, “The Underground Railroad. ” Donna Tartt’s 2013 novel, “The Goldfinch,” is magnificent in its sweep but also in its dusty particulars, like “the smell of dad’s wet wool in the back of a closet,” while Lionel Shriver’s “The   World” makes a trip to the grocery store unforgettable. (Details, for Parker, are “the marrow that you suck out of the bone” of a story.) From the Modernist period, her favorite novelist isn’t Virginia Woolf, who wanted to have no country, but rather Evelyn Waugh, whose characters are most in need of home. Home is what draws Parker, too, to the origins of Hogarth. “Because Virginia and Leonard Woolf were printing books out of their home, and because they were publishing work by their friends, they were telling exactly the stories they wanted to tell,” she says. “I love most the idea of community here, and that the history of the imprint is personal. There was nothing mercenary about it. The Woolfs were storytellers. ”  —   Sarah Nicole Prickett YOU COULD CALL IT A career crisis, though that would be putting it mildly. After a period of exile, T’Challa, the king of Wakanda, has returned to the seat of power to find his nation roiled by natural disaster, political strife and war. The king’s most trusted adviser, his sister Shuri, had ruled in his absence, but died in battle. He is facing a rebellion against the crown led by a charismatic female warrior. And that heady brew of toil and trouble  —   those are just   problems. T’Challa has a superhero   Black Panther, that comes with its own welter of burdens and existential anxieties. These are the circumstances in which we meet the eponymous hero in the latest   story arc of “Black Panther,” the venerable Marvel Comics series, set in a mythical African country. The new stories are written by the journalist   Coates, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, who has emerged in recent years as one of America’s most powerful voices. Coates’s writing on race and politics combines reportage, deep dives into history and the sort of exhortative   that merits the heady adjective “prophetic. ” “The Case for Reparations,” his acclaimed 2014 Atlantic cover feature, reframed the debate about the American social compact around the bitter histories of white supremacy, redlining and the plunder of black wealth and black bodies. These themes came together, in a kind of stormy blues fugue, in the   essay “Between the World and Me,” a best seller that won the National Book Award last year, was a finalist for the Pulitzer and landed the author a “genius grant” from the MacArthur Foundation. Coates has attained an exalted perch, the rare public intellectual whose reach extends from the ivory tower to the street, hailed by Toni Morrison as the heir to James Baldwin, shouted out by Chance the Rapper on a mixtape. These days, Coates finds himself turning down more offers than most journalists get in a lifetime. But when Marvel came calling, he didn’t hesitate. “It was the craziest offer I ever got,” says Coates, who ended up collaborating with the artist Brian Stelfreeze. “I didn’t have to mull it over. ” Writing comic books would seem to represent a radical change of course for Coates. But it is also a return to roots. Growing up in West Baltimore, he was an obsessive reader of “ ” and “The Uncanny  . ” “They felt like an allegory for what my life was,” Coates says. “Black Panther” has the rock ’em, sock ’em action and pulp plotlines that comics fans expect. But Coates’s preoccupations peek through. His “Black Panther” is a meditation on the burdens and costs of political power, on gender relations, on the dynamics of popular uprisings. The language also has a telltale Coatesian ring, mixing a journalist’s economy with ringing lyricism. “Before I became a journalist, I really wanted to be a poet,” he says. “’u2009‘Black Panther’ reminded me of the old days of trying to write poetry. You need to get things across but you don’t have much space. ” Coates has signed on to write another dozen “Black Panther” books. And he has become something of   impresario, helping to recruit two leading black writers, the essayist Roxane Gay and the poet Yona Harvey, to collaborate on a “Black Panther” companion series, “World of Wakanda. ” For Coates, the sideline in comics is more than just another way to exercise his muse. It is a relief: “It was very hard to write ‘Between the World and Me.’ I don’t mean the craft, although of course the craft is hard. I mean that it takes a toll on you emotionally. You need to go in another direction every once in a while. ” He chuckles. “‘Black Panther’ is where I go to play. ”  —   Jody Rosen",0
11808,US ‘Laying Groundwork’ For Raqqa Offensive In Syria,"  Carol Adl in Middle East , News , US // 0 Comments 
The US- led coalition is preparing an offensive to oust ISIS from its de-facto capital Raqqa in Syria according to the US Defense Secretary. 
Ash Carter said the operation will likely start before the battle for Mosul is won and Russia has not been invited to join the effort. 
In an interview with NBC, Carter said the assault will start in the next few weeks. 
“We have already begun laying the groundwork to commence the isolation in Raqqa,” the Pentagon chief said at a press conference in Paris. 
RT reports: 
According to Carter, the two officials agreed that the 13-state military coalition that gathered in the French capital would proceed with a sense of “urgency and focus” and confirmed previous statements that there will be a likely “overlap” with the assault on Mosul, which began earlier this month. 
Earlier on Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande warned that many of the ISIS fighters in Mosul could simply sneak out among refugees and relocate to Raqqa, unless the coalition cuts them off. 
There were up to 6,000 Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) fighters in the Iraqi city before fighting began, while Raqqa, which Carter described as “the nexus of much of [IS] operational planning,” will be defended by an estimated 3-4,000 recruits. 
Carter stated that the bulk of the assault contingent would be assembled from “capable and motivated local forces that we identify and then enable.” 
“The lasting defeat of [Islamic State] can’t be achieved by outsiders; it can only be achieved by Syrians enabled by us,” said Carter. 
With the battle over Mosul – a city of 1.5 million people before it was conquered by Islamic State in 2014 – expected to last weeks or months, the Pentagon is not committing itself to a tight deadline. 
“I think everything is trending positively, and that we should be able to commence that effort sometime in the near future. And again, I can’t even ballpark ‘near future’ right now but it’s imminent,” said a senior Pentagon official, speaking to Reuters and other media anonymously in Paris. 
Russia has not been invited to join the effort. The US-led coalition has condemned Moscow’s involvement in Syria, which was officially invited by the government of President Bashar Assad. 
“Russia is not a participant in our Raqqa plan,” said Carter, who insisted that despite the breakdown of a proposed US and Russia-mediated ceasefire and accusations over Aleppo the two sides have a shared interest in defeating IS. 
“We do deconflict our coalition operations with Russia through a very professional military-to-military channel. That channel is active every day, and everyone behaves themselves very professionally on both sides in that channel,” Carter added. 
The Kurds, another major faction that has played a key role in combatting Islamist threats in Syria, are expected to stay away from Raqqa, in part because it lies outside the area they view as their unrecognized homeland. 
“Truthfully, the Kurds that I’ve dealt with don’t intend – they’re not comfortable going into Raqqa. They know they can play a role in shaping and isolating Raqqa but it’s not their intent to be involved in the actual seizure of the city,” said the Pentagon source cited by Reuters. 
The Syrian administration has so far not reacted to the plan, though has previously condemned the international force – which has supported the uprising against President Assad since 2011 – for violating the country’s sovereignty. 
The US-led coalition has executed air strikes on Raqqa since 2014, despite having no UN mandate to operate inside Syria. It has not been in position to carry out a full-scale ground assault. 
Despite saying he was “encouraged” by the progress of the campaign against ISIS, both Carter and Hollande warned separately that the group may further evolve its tactics and redirect its efforts towards guerilla insurgency or suicide attacks in Europe.",0

Gee, that’s the spirit! 
From Infowars : 
A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump features Hillary ally Wendy Bronfein advising Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta on how to reach “f**king dumb” young people. 
Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton “may not be the best face” to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize “trending figures” as par of an “infusion to pull younger voters” because “that’s the crap that young people pay attention to”. 
Bronfein goes on to state, “It’s f**king dumb but being “cool” counts for more than it maybe should.” 
She references Bill Clinton’s saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, “I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they “follow”. So if someone they identify as cool endorses – they will likely fall in line with that candidate.”

11813,The Song in the Heart of Many Chinese Comes From Insects - The New York Times,"Mosquitoes. Flies. Cockroaches. The bugs that thrive in the heat of summer vex Chinese urban dwellers just as they do in most of the world. But in China, some insects are viewed not as pests, but as pets  —   especially if they sing for their supper. Chirping bugs like katydids, cicadas and crickets are prized throughout the country, collected by children and old men who keep them in clay vessels or bamboo cages and nourish them with grains of rice and   slices of green onion. Crickets are even bred for their fighting prowess, and a pedigreed champion can be worth hundreds of dollars. But typical crooners can be bought for a few dollars. “Summer isn’t complete without the sound of a singing katydid in your courtyard,” said Wang Xiaoming, 68, a lifelong Beijing resident who lives in a traditional hutong neighborhood, a warren of narrow alleys that are the last bastion of many Chinese traditions. In contrast to the soft trill of the field cricket, cicadas and katydids produce the kind of deafening hiss that can drown out conversation. The practice of collecting singing insects is said to have begun 2, 000 years ago. They were sought as   talismans, and later as companions for imperial concubines, who kept them in gilded cages. The insects are embedded in Chinese culture. Ancient poems praise their melodious songs, and many idiomatic expressions use crickets and grasshoppers as metaphors for fertility, friendship or the passage of time. The keeping of insects faded during the 1950s and ’60s, when Mao Zedong waged war on traditions deemed bourgeois and retrograde. But it has been revived in recent years by aficionados like Mr. Wang, a retired professor of Chinese literature, who is worried about its future. “Young people would rather play with their phones than an insect,” he said. There is, of course, a downside to befriending singing insects: They are among the most ephemeral of pets. Most live for just a few months, and even the most pampered katydid will be silenced by the first autumn frost.",0

11815,Trump Backers Like His First Draft of a New America - The New York Times,"MOUNT GILEAD, Ohio  —   The challenge Annette Cottrell pondered was how to grade President Trump’s stormy first full week on the job. A trade war bubbling up with Mexico. A divisive border wall. A ban on refugees from   countries. Brawls with the news media and national parks. “I’d give him an ” Ms. Cottrell, 38, said from her salon, Mane Attraction, on Main Street here in the seat of a conservative Ohio county of pastures and maple groves where Mr. Trump won 70 percent of the vote. “He’s doing what he said he was going to be doing. ” So, about that   week. Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community. His   executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration, abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them. But in more than two dozen interviews this week, voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency  —     and reluctant supporters alike  —   were cheering from their living rooms, offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape, even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping. Yes, they said, Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward “exaggeration. ” “Honestly, he sometimes needs to shut up,” said Joshua Wade, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich. a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. “Just do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It’s fine. ” Gun rights top Mr. Wade’s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend   rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office. “There’s no doubt: He’s good at showmanship,” said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. “But I think this first week is proving he’s capable of following through on that with real action. ” But what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump only a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded. Still, Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved  —   freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several   nations. “Trump’s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,” said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio. The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B. L. T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1, 900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the   border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35, 000, and it has grown only 0. 3 percent in the past five years. Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour’s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump’s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants. “I’m 100 percent behind the wall,” said Ms. Cottrell, the salon owner. “If he asked me to lay the first brick, I’d sign up. I’m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us. ” She and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate’s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton’s. Mr. Cottrell, 34, said he supported aid to feed and shelter refugees  —   but he blanched at welcoming them here. “It should be about America first,” Mr. Cottrell said. “We see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we’re helping refugees and immigrants. ” Mr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the   staff of the V. A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that did not affect his support for Mr. Trump. “I have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,” he said. Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall. But moves like banning funding for overseas health providers who discuss abortion have a more rapid effect. Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States. “We have a   president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,” she said. Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday’s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march. If President Obama was a   “Rorschach test” for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump’s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were   sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details. Robert Kersey, 82, the president of an   foundry in Muncie, Ind. said he hoped Mr. Trump would pull back a recent announcement from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addressing silica dust, which can lead to debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Mr. Kersey said he sees the rule as a burden and does not believe it will make his employees safer. Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead’s   downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year. Eddie Lou Meimer, 70, walking through her family farm south of town, said she wanted the federal government to ease the kind of   regulations that she said had forced her to build a $40, 000 canning room for her   business. “He’s a    person,” Ms. Meimer said of the president. “I wish somebody would grab his phone. But it seems to take the press’s mind off what he’s really doing. ”",0
11816,The devil you know will drag us through hell,"Posted 10/31/2016 12:28 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments 
Halloween seems as good a time as any to remind ourselves that the United States is in the midst of perhaps the most truly horrifying presidential election in modern history. Sure, we’ve seen buffoons, members of political crime families and unhinged warmongers run for president before — but seldom in American politics has a political candidate been as unpredictable as Donald Trump or checked as many unsavory boxes as Hillary Clinton. 

In case you’re hoping to read an endorsement of Republican Donald Trump within the body of this piece, allow me to chill your anticipation: There won’t be one. 

While Trump has certainly led a successful life and smartly built a business empire by gaming a system which is stacked against the vast majority of Americans, there’s little reason to believe that he’s any more trustworthy than your average backcountry used car salesman. 

Trump’s worldview is shaded by a personal belief that everything he says and thinks absolutely is correct, believe me. That’s what makes him such a maverick salesman. In any sales 101 course, students learn that customers respond best to sales tactics dripping in assertions of authority on the subject of the product being sold. They don’t necessarily have to be true—but any fast talker worth his commission knows all the best words to make anything appear honest, if only long enough to get that signature on the dotted line. 

Trump is a gamble. 

And with that, maybe there is room for a slighted endorsement of a Trump presidency. At least he’s peddling a product to the American voting public. He’s going to “Make America Great Again,” whatever that means. 

We haven’t actually gotten a good look at the nuts and bolts of the Trump sales equation, so it is at best an as-is sale. 

Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, can be precisely defined as “the devil we know.” 

Not only has she spent three decades in various states of public office, but by mishandling sensitive information she’s also carelessly made available the finer points of her plans for the American future. 

Unfortunately, the terrifying reality of Clinton’s vision are of little consequence to her campaign. The Clinton family developed a winning formula for media manipulation way back when they occupied the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion, so she has no need to finesse supporters into believing in her product. 

If you know anyone supporting Clinton simply because they are put off by Trump’s lack of a political record, here are a few things you ought to let them know. 

Clinton’s email scandal is only just beginning. As president, the controversy would likely continue to distract her from the work of running America. 

She is a deranged sociopathic war criminal who should be indicted for conspiracy and murder. 

A Clinton White House would heighten tensions between the U.S. and Russia by doubling down on Clinton’s failed State Department policies. 

Clinton refuses to take responsibility for any of her actions . 

Given Clinton’s trouble from transparency groups, her election would likely bring about a major crackdown on whistleblowers. 

Clinton is also, as one journalist put it, beholden to scumbags who she will work for from the Oval Office. 

The bottom line here is that Americans hoping for a transformative outcome in the 2016 presidential election are likely to be very disappointed. Aside from saying “not Clinton,” it’s pretty impossible to say anyone really deserves a thinking American’s vote in this cycle. The third-parties, as usual, are hell’s snowballs thanks to the political establishment’s efforts; and neither mainstream candidate is likely to reverse the nation’s leading causes of decline: cronyism, military adventurism, ballooning government and a continued disregard for the constitutional principles on which it was founded.",0

11819,Sweeping Federal Review Could Affect Consent Decrees Nationwide - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a sweeping review of federal agreements with dozens of law enforcement agencies, an examination that reflects President Trump’s emphasis on law and order and could lead to a retreat on consent decrees with troubled police departments nationwide. In a memorandum dated March 31 and made public Monday, the attorney general directed his staff to look at whether law enforcement programs adhere to principles put forth by the Trump administration, including one declaring that “the individual misdeeds of bad actors should not impugn” the work police officers perform “in keeping American communities safe. ” As part of its shift in emphasis, the Justice Department went to court on Monday to seek a   delay in a consent decree to overhaul Baltimore’s embattled Police Department. That request came just days before a hearing, scheduled for Thursday in the United States District Court in Baltimore, to solicit public comment on the agreement, which was reached in principle by the city and the Justice Department in the waning days of the Obama administration. Mayor Catherine E. Pugh said late Monday that the city would “strongly oppose any delay in moving forward. ” Supporters of police reform called on Judge James K. Bredar, who is overseeing the negotiations between Baltimore and the Justice Department, to deny the request, arguing that Mr. Sessions was interfering with the will of the city. “This has all been negotiated by the affected parties,” said Ray Kelly, the president of the No Boundaries Coalition, a citizen advocacy group. Referring to Mr. Sessions, he said, “Now we have an outside entity telling us what’s best for our citizens and our community when he has no experience, no knowledge. ” Baltimore is one of nearly two dozen cities  —   including Ferguson, Mo. Cleveland and Seattle  —   that were the subject of aggressive efforts by the Obama administration to improve relations between the police and the communities they serve. That effort produced   consent decrees with 14 departments. The broad review announced Monday could threaten some of those decrees if the Justice Department seeks to change its past stance about systematic police abuses in the affected agencies. But the Justice Department would not be able to unilaterally unwind the agreements without court intervention. Vanita Gupta, who ran the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama and negotiated the Baltimore consent decree, said it was unclear whether Mr. Sessions could withdraw from that agreement, which has not yet been officially approved by a judge. Noting that Kevin Davis, the Baltimore police commissioner, had expressed strong support for the plan, Ms. Gupta questioned “whether the attorney general is really in sync with law enforcement. ” She added that Monday’s announcement “signals an alarming retreat away from ensuring that police departments engage in constitutional policing. ” Beyond Baltimore, the most closely watched decision will come in Chicago, where the Obama administration, in its final days, issued a report that found failures in the Police Department after a series of police shootings of minorities. Negotiations have begun for a possible monitoring agreement, but Mr. Sessions has indicated he thinks the report was shoddy, casting doubt on the prospect of a deal. In a joint statement on Monday night, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the Chicago police said Mr. Sessions’s announcement would not alter their own plans, outlined several weeks ago, for police reform in Chicago. “We can only speak for our intentions, we can’t speak for the federal government’s,” they said. In Baltimore, a   city with a history of tensions between   and the police, the consent decree grew out of a federal review that followed the unrest in 2015 over the death of a    black man, Freddie Gray, in police custody. The review culminated in August, when the Justice Department issued a blistering report that found that the Baltimore police had engaged in a “pattern and practice” of discrimination that systematically violated the civil rights of black residents. In January,  days before Mr. Obama left office, Mayor Pugh and the Justice Department signed a broad blueprint for an overhaul. In its court filings on Monday, the Justice Department noted that the Trump administration had “announced several new initiatives and policies that prioritize combating and preventing violent crime” in response to spikes in violence in cities across the country, including Baltimore. Mr. Sessions has expressed deep skepticism about the value of consent decrees like the one planned for Baltimore, saying they vilify the police, and he has indicated that he wants to scale them back. In a speech in February, his first as attorney general, he said that the federal government’s role should be to “help police departments get better, not diminish their effectiveness. ” Mr. Sessions said the agreements were demoralizing to the police and could be generating a rise in violence and murders in some large cities, a contention that has been challenged by many criminologists. Kristen Clarke, who leads the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has fought for greater federal oversight of troubled police departments, said the request for a delay in the Baltimore case was deeply troubling. “Attorney General Jeff Sessions is undermining and obstructing extensive efforts that have been made to promote policing reform in a small set of the most broken police departments in our country,” she said.",0

11822,No Search Warrant Yet: FBI Can’t Move On Email ‘Investigation’,"No Search Warrant Yet: FBI Can’t Move On Email ‘Investigation’ By Michelle Oxman on October 30, 2016 Subscribe 
You bet James Comey jumped the gun when he wrote to Congress that the FBI was looking at more Clinton emails. Apparently, he had decided that emails on Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s home laptop computer should be examined further. But that didn’t mean that the FBI had the legal authority to look at them yet. Actually, it didn’t—and still doesn’t—have that authority. What Did The FBI Find? 
Let’s remember, first, that the FBI was investigating Weiner’s use of the internet to send sexts and photos to a 15-year-old girl. They searched a laptop that they say was used by both Weiner and Abedin, and they found emails from the State Department, forwarded by Huma Abedin from work to home. There is no indication that Hillary Clinton sent any emails to or received emails from Abedin on this computer. When Will We Know What’s In The Emails? 
No one knows. The FBI needs a warrant to view the emails. The warrant for Weiner’s emails and texts doesn’t apply to emails that Weiner neither sent or received. As of Sunday afternoon, October 30, the FBI has not gotten a warrant to search the emails. Pending requests for search warrants are not usually made public, so we wouldn’t know if the FBI has even asked for a warrant. Is Search Warrant Available? An Open Legal Question 
As the Washington Post reported on October 30, 2016, there are good reasons to think that the FBI would be denied a warrant to search the couple’s computer for emails related to Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State when the purpose of the FBI’s access was to review Weiner’s recent emails and sext messages. By what logic would the FBI be justified opening emails to and from Huma Abedin’s accounts from 2009 to 2013? Unfortunately, some people, especially conservatives, resist arguments based on the “technicality” of the Fourth Amendment. Comey’s ‘Explanation’ 
According to Yahoo News , as of Saturday night, the Department of Justice and FBI officials were discussing what to do next. Because the FBI did not have a warrant to read Abedin’s emails, on Thursday, October 28, Comey accepted the investigators’ recommendation that the Bureau “seek access” to them. On Friday, he sent a memo to FBI employees explaining that he felt he had to update Congress because of his previous testimony that the Clinton email investigation was finished. On the other hand, he didn’t know yet what significance the emails would have. and he didn’t want to create a “misleading impression.” Violating Policy 
There seems to be no doubt that Comey’s letter to Congress violated two long-standing tradition and policies: (1) prohibiting discussion of ongoing investigations; and (2) not taking actions to favor one side or another in elections. Two former Deputy Attorneys General, one Democrat and one Republican, publicly questioned Comey’s fitness to lead the FBI because of it. In addition, others have pointed out that Comey has repeatedly gone beyond established limits in his discussions of the Clinton email investigation.

A water protector stares down police off highway 134, October 27. (Photo: Derrick Broze) 
AUSTIN, Texas — When it comes to the Dakota Access pipeline, musicians want to stop the music. 
Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation building the controversial $3.8 billion pipeline, also owns Music Road Records, a small record label which presents the annual Cherokee Creek Music Festival in Austin, Texas. 
The Indigo Girls announced in September that they would not be playing at the next festival, slated for May 2017. 
Reaffirming their support for “ Standing Rock, the Standing Rock Sioux, their friends and allies in protecting their sacred land and water by stopping the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and all pipelines that carry dirty oil and threaten massive ecosystems, ” the folk rock duo also encouraged other musicians to cancel their plans to perform at the festival. 
Emily Saliers, one half of the Indigo Girls, recently explained that she hadn’t realized Warren was responsible for both the pipeline and the music festival until a fan alerted her to the connection via Facebook. 
“Once we found out, we immediately started talking about what can we do to rectify the situation and our presence in something that is completely the antithesis of what we stand for as artists and as allies for Native communities,” Saliers told Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman on Thursday. 
In addition to playing at the festival twice, Saliers and her musical partner, Amy Ray, also contributed a song to a tribute album published by Music Road to honor the legacy of singer-songwriter Jackson Browne. Saliers and Ray said they reached out to Browne and the other musicians on the album, then contacted Warren to inform him of the growing boycott. VIDEO: Emily Saliers of the @Indigo_Girls reads letter to #DAPL CEO Kelcy Warren, urging him to halt construction on Dakota Access pipeline pic.twitter.com/gD98Uu7rdY 
— Democracy Now! (@democracynow) November 4, 2016 
Ray read from the letter to Warren on Democracy Now!: “Sadly, we realized that the bucolic setting of your festival and the image it projects is in direct conflict with the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, a project your company, Energy Transfer Partners, is responsible for spearheading. This pipeline violates the Standing Rock Sioux nation’s treaty rights, endangers the vital Missouri River, and continues the trajectory of genocide against Native peoples.” 
In a statement published by Indian Country Today Media Network , Browne vowed to donate all the profits from the Music Road tribute album to the Standing Rock “ water protectors .” Like Saliers and Ray, Browne said he’d been unaware of Warren’s involvement in the pipeline when he met him and agreed to have Music Road produce the album. He continued: “I do not play for oil interests. I do not play for companies who defile nature, or companies who attack demonstrators with trained attack dogs and pepper spray. The list of companies I have denied the use of my music is long. I certainly would not have allowed my songs to be recorded by a record company whose owner’s other business does what Energy Transfer Partners is allegedly doing — threatening the water supply and the sacred sites of indigenous people.” 
Amy Goodman noted in a Nov. 3 editorial co-written with Denis Moynihan that, “Kelcy Warren is a Texas oil billionaire several times over, and might not be easily deterred by a threatened boycott.” 
The notion that Warren may not be moved by a boycott isn’t stopping music fans from taking up the cause. A group of activists and fans from Denton, Texas, are asking musician Hal Ketchum to end his association with Music Road, and they’re planning to protest his concert there on Wednesday night. 
In addition to dabbling in the music industry, Warren and Energy Transfer Partners also spend millions influencing U.S. elections . Energy Transfer Partners PAC spent over $869,000 in the 2014 and 2016 federal election cycles, according to OpenSecrets , a project of the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Andrew Wheat, research director at Texans for Public Justice , an Austin-based nonprofit that tracks the influence of money and corporate power, told MintPress News that Warren, himself, has spent far more influencing elections on the state level. He was awarded a position on the board of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, likely due to his largesse.",0
11824,A View of the Syrian War From the Golan Heights    :," A View of the Syrian War From the Golan Heights One Syrian lieutenant described to me how he directed his artillery fire onto an Israeli jeep in the Jabhat al-Nusra occupied town of Al-Hamidiya inside Syria and destroyed it. The jeep might have been a gift or borrowed from Israel
By Robert Fisk
November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" The Independent "" - From Colonel Salehs forward position on his front line north of Quneitra, he has a unique and exclusive view of the Syrian war. To his west and south is a vast area of his country which is occupied by Jabhat al-Nusra Islamist fighters  their earthen ramparts and supply roads are scarcely half a mile away. Then, another couple of miles away, Israeli soldiers are inside their concrete positions on the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, above the old and Nusra-held Syrian city of Quneitra.
You see that mosque over there, just to the right of the water tower? the colonel asks. Well, Nusra is there. And you see the triangular hill beyond? The Israelis are there. Its what you call a politically intriguing battlefield  yes, shells do come whizzing in towards the Syrians from Nusra and also from the Israelis. The Syrians concentrate their fire on Nusra but Nusras casualties are often taken through the Israeli lines for hospital treatment in Haifa.
So whose side is Israel on? Baath City is a concrete conurbation created back in pre-civil war days to defy the vandalisation of the old Quenitra. It was occupied by the Israeli army during the 1973 Middle East war and then  before they abandoned it under the Kissinger agreement  totally destroyed with explosives by Israeli troops. Nusra now occupy these 43-year old ruins. As for Baath City, its university, banks, fire station, schools, police force and hospitals are defiantly maintained by the Syrians under the eyes of their two enemies: the Nusra Islamists and the Israelis.
According to the Syrian army in Baath City  their forward lines and tanks are positioned in unfinished apartment blocks on the edge of the town  their intelligence departments Hebrew speakers constantly monitor conversations between the Israelis and between Israeli and Nusra fighters. They know  and the Israelis have made no secret of the fact  that wounded Nusrah fighters are taken to Haifa for hospital treatment. On one occasion, a Nusrah man travelling in an Israeli ambulance on the Golan was dragged from the vehicle and lynched by a crowd of enraged Druze men who are largely loyal to the Syrian government and regard Nusrah as their mortal enemies. Reports of the mans murder highlighted the highly ambiguous relationship between Israel and the Islamists, whose name-changing cannot conceal their al-Qaeda roots.
Druze towns inside Syria and close to Baath City have taken the side of the regime  this does not apply to other Druze areas  but it makes the geography of the front line here all the more surreal. One Syrian lieutenant described to me how he directed his artillery fire onto an Israeli jeep in the Nusra-occupied town of Al-Hamidiya inside Syria and destroyed it. The jeep might have been a gift or borrowed from Israel  whether there were any Israeli personnel inside it if it was hit is another matter. The Syrians, however, also say that Israeli bulldozers were used to build a new supply route for Nusrah between Quneitra and Golan  again, inside Syrias frontiers.
All of which raises a compelling question. The Nusra-controlled territory between the Syrians and the Israeli lines on Golan  and other Islamist groups and a few remnants of the old Free Syrian Army allied to them in this location  stretches all the way south to the edge of the Syrian city of Deraa and right down to the Jordanian frontier. And beyond that frontier is the so-called Military Operations Centre  the MOC of which both the Islamists and the Syrian army refer  where Western intelligence officers maintain a liaison and weapons supply depot for the anti-government Syrian forces.
So what is the relationship between the MOC and its Western backers  who maintain contact with Nusra  and the Israelis who treat Nusras wounded in their hospitals? The Jordanian border and the Israeli lines on Golan are at their most only about 70 miles apart and opposition fighters hold all the land in between.
Littered around the front lines outside Baath City are the wreckage of past battles and the abandoned UN posts from which Filipino UN soldiers were kidnapped en masse more than a year ago; the Syrian army now occupies several of these positions, the UN logo still painted on the walls although several of the igloo-type UN accommodation huts have migrated to Syrian compounds in the rear lines. The UN force on Golan now operates only inside Israeli-occupied territory.
Only a few hundred yards away from Nusra-held territory, we found Abu Hashem, a farmer who fled from his village, now held by the Islamists, living today in family property close to one of the old UN posts. He fed us tea and coffee and walnuts from his orchard. His wife and six children now exist in this unfinished, cold house along with a small library of books  the speeches of Imam Ali (the Najul Blagha) and a collection of medical books of Aleppo herbal cures for headaches and kidney infection, published in Beirut. He says the people in his Nusra-occupied village are divided. Some are sympathetic towards the Islamists  they are not fighters  while others are sometimes permitted by Nusrah to cross the front lines for treatment in Syrian government hospitals. They are Bedouins and farmers, the unsettled and the landowners, always prey to the wolves of civil war insurgents.
Colonel Saleh, who is 50 years old, has been guarding his echoing and weed-strewn apartment blocks on the edge of Baath City for three years, noting wearily that the Israelis attack his army but never attack Nusra who  being al-Qaeda  might logically have earned Israels enmity. But no. I know every stone here, the colonel says. I can see if a rock or a vehicle has moved across the fields in front of us  and I can immediately see if one vehicle has become two vehicles. We know when they are going to attack  they always precede their offensives with a big artillery and mortar barrage.
Sometimes the voices of Nusra men shout insults at the Syrians on their own radio sets, calling them kafirs  infidels or unbelievers. If I am in a good mood, I invite them for coffee, Colonel Saleh says. If Im in a bad mood, I am silent. Their accents are very similar to the Jordanians. They come from the south of Deraa, along the Jordanian border.
As we spoke, further down the line, the Syrians and Nusra were fighting with tanks, artillery and mortars. The Syrians claimed that their enemies arrived in several directions in a convoy of at least 13 vehicles. They spoke, too, of a Nusra female officer called Souad al-Qatahani (nicknamed Al-Nood), the 30-year-old sister of a Nusrah general called Qais al-Omani who commanded 1,200 fighters. She was, they pointed out rather remarkably, a former first lieutenant in their own Syrian government army.
And one further feature that the Syrians have noted about their enemies outside Baath City. Whenever Nusra fire a missile, they have to take a photograph of the rocket leaving its launcher  presumably to prove to their suppliers that they have not sold the weapon to someone else. Trust, as usual in the Syrian war, is in short supply.",0
11825,Scrabble Spells Doom for the Racial Hypothesis of Intelligence,"11 27 
Top three nations with elite Scrabble players on the WESPA ratings list. Nigeria is on top, despite constant travel visa rejections to play in world tournaments. 
Besides Nigeria, countries like Kenya, Ghana and Uganda also contribute players to the world top 100. 
An even more astonishing picture of African performance unfolds when we look beyond the English-speaking African countries. 
Scrabble in French? 
In 2015, Nigel Richards, an English-speaking professional Scrabble player from New Zealand, confirmed his reputation as perhaps the greatest Scrabble player in history by winning the French World Scrabble Championship, after memorizing the French dictionary in nine weeks. His goal in 2015 was apparently to hold both the English and French world championships simultaneously. He was robbed of his full glory by the Nigerian Wellington Jighere in the English version, but managed to pull off a more phenomenal victory in the language he does not speak! 
Nigel Richards is said to have an authentic photographic memory . 
What caught my eye in all the frenzied media reports was the name of the person Richards defeated in the finals (I was fully expecting a French name): Schelick Rekawe. An African (from Gabon) had reached the finals of the French world championships? How? 
When I looked into the history of the French Scrabble World Championships, I was stunned to find that Francophone African countries have been even more dominant in French Scrabble, and over a longer period, than Nigerians have become in English Scrabble, despite a very active expert Scrabble club culture in France and other native French-speaking countries. 
The full list of the top players in the 2015 French Scrabble championship that Richards won gives a clear picture of this African dominance: 2015 French World Championships final standings. Source: French Wikipedia 
A look at Gabon’s demographics makes the Scrabble achievement of Gabon impossible to explain under the present racial hypothesis. 
Gabon has a population of 1.7 million and a reported national IQ of 64. 
If the world champion needs an IQ of just 140 (it should probably be higher than that, given the level of gender disparity at the very top), then there is statistically no one in Gabon who should ever come anywhere close to the world championship. Three made it to the top 10 in 2015. 
Note that the strongest version of the genetic hypothesis is contradicted even before you do the math: the very existence of such high interest in a mathematical game can not be predicted from a genetic theory that claims heritability of (cognitive or other) human interests, if it is indeed true that Africans have the lowest genetic endowment in mathematical (or even verbal) ability. 
Is French Scrabble perhaps less mathematical than English Scrabble? Not at all. The very fact that someone could successfully cross from English Scrabble to French Scrabble (Nigel Richards) should indicate that it requires similar cognitive skills. But I still looked at some profiles of the top French Scrabble players in Europe just to make sure, and found clear signs to confirm this. For example, the French Wikipedia entry on France’s best player (the last French player to keep the French World Championship from Africans, and the only one to have won it twice) says: 
Christian Coustillas, professeur agrégé et génie des mathématiques, est un joueur français de Scrabble. 
I do not know any French, but I can bet that there is the word ‘mathematics’ somewhere in there and perhaps even an academic career in it! 
In 2016, Nigel Richards returned to defend his World Championship title and this time the Africans vowed to keep the crown from him. Like the year before Richards stole the French championship, the two finalists in 2016 were both Africans again; Richards was fourth, behind three Africans. The French math professor and former world champion, Christian Coustillas, could not make it to the top ten as more Africans dominated the chart: 2016 French World Championships final standings. 8 /10 positions are African. Source: French Wikipedia 
Notice that the names of the 2016 top Gabonese players are different from the ones in 2015, which defies the probability projections from their population and national IQ even further. Senegal (population 13 million, IQ 76), which has probably had the most success at the world championships historically, achieved this with a literacy rate of only 40%! 
Something Special about Scrabble for Africans Perhaps? 
The man who won the French World Scrabble championship in 2014, Julien Affaton from Benin, also happens to be a top master draughts (checkers) player in his country. This should immediately suggest that whatever he is using to win his Scrabble games probably has something in common with what is needed to be a master in checkers, because it is highly improbable to be that exceptional in two different areas that require unrelated skills. 
The question can then be asked: if this is true, then why aren’t Africans also very good in checkers at the world level, just as they are with Scrabble? Isn’t checkers an even more natural field for Africans since it is cheaper to make a checkers set? 
Meet Baba Sy. 
Baba Sy breaking world record for simultaneous draughts play. 
Back in 1960, a draughts expert from France was visiting the French colony of Senegal when he decided to watch some of the street games in poor communities after the French settlers had introduced the game to the black natives. He could not believe the accuracy and speed of their calculations, despite their lack of exposure to theory, and he decided to expose one of the stronger players to his homeland of France where there was a strong checkers club culture among the mathematically-inclined elites. To the utter shock of everyone in France, the young Senegalese player, Baba Sy, defeated every single expert in France and instantly achieved national fame by becoming the national champion of France! 
France had once been the most dominant nation in the world of international draughts, before the Netherlands (briefly) and then the Soviet Union (permanently) took this honor from them through the latter’s state-sponsored program of monetarily professionalizing chess and checkers careers. With the phenomenal rise of Baba Sy, the French thought they had the chance of recapturing the World Championship from the Soviets by using this brilliant talent from one of their colonies. 
Baba Sy participated in the 1960 World Championship tournament and shocked the Soviets by coming second in the world, in a variant of draughts he had just been introduced to that was different from his Senegalese one. Sy was not convinced that there was a human who was better than him at any form of checkers, so he decided to challenge the world champion in a more decisive one-on-one World Championship match instead of an open tournament of cumulative points against different players. But by the time this match was supposed to happen, Baba Sy had gained enough mastery of this standard variant to convincingly demolish the best of the Soviets, including their reigning champion and best match play genius at the time, Iser Kuperman. This made the Soviet government reluctant to allow the official World Championship match to take place, apparently for fear of the international embarrassment this title loss would cause, given their heavy investment in the game (they had the same fears over Bobby Fischer in chess). On the day of the match, the Soviet champion simply did not show up, and thus began a long contentious diplomatic standoff between the governments of the Soviet Union and Senegal, as the world of international draughts hotly debated who the rightful champion of the world was for many years. It was only fully resolved posthumously for Baba Sy. List of Draughts World Champions. Source: Wikipedia 
Again, a person like Sy should not exist outside the realm of science fiction if the racial hypothesis is correct. In 1960, Senegal’s population was 3 million, and IQ 76. The population of France was 47 million, and the population of Russia was 120 million, with national IQs of 98 and 97, respectively. 
It should be impossible for a Senegalese champion to beat just the high school champions of either France or the Soviet Union. The reason we have never seen a child become world champion in checkers or Scrabble (or anything) is probably because their brains are not fully developed (brain development continues to 25 years of age); and yet the racial hypothesis tells us that the fully developed African brains are on average the mental age equivalent of the white 12 year olds. So why do (the smartest of) Africans produce world champion level players and the smartest of the white 12 year olds (or even the much more “superior” 18/19 year olds) never do? 
Baba Sy was not some freakish anomaly in African draughts. Former African colonies of France have continued to offer the biggest challenge to Russia’s traditional dominance of the game, even though, like Scrabble players, most of them still have little access to international tournaments to raise their ratings (the fact that many of them come from lower income communities even by African standards makes it harder for them to obtain travel visas.) In 2015, Jean Marc Ndjofang , a Cameroonian player who has migrated to Europe, managed to qualify as the challenger to the Russian world champion (by defeating everyone else, including other Russians), and only came short of ending the iron grip of the Russians on the world title through a tie-break, as the two failed to beat each other after seven games of normal classical match play. The 2015 World Champion, Alexander Georgiev, in a heated tournament game against the Vice-World Champion, Jean Ndjofang. 
American Checkers. 
Americans play a different variant of draughts called English checkers or American checkers; the different variants mainly differ on the number of squares on the board. Although the game is mostly popular with children in the US, there is a whole world of professional checkers players who also have a clear endowment in mathematical ability. Thus, the most famous world champion in the history of American checkers was a distinguished math professor, Marion Tinsley . (There are now two variants of Anglo-American checkers: the normal Go-As-You-Play or GAYP and one called 3-move, in which the first three moves are pre-chosen, to prevent memorized opening plays that increase probabilities of draws). 
After Tinsley’s indomitable reign, the most dominant English-checkers player in the world became the appropriately named Ron King, who won American championships and 12 world championships. At the height of his dominance, Ron King faced the biggest challenge of his career from an unknown player named Lubabalo Kondlo. King was able to retain the title after a grueling match that was later made into a documentary . Kondlo happens to be a black man from a very poor area in South Africa. Ron King is also black, from Barbados, and he is known as the Muhammad Ali of checkers for his “trash talking.” At the height of his career, King entered the Guinness Book of World Records for playing an unbelievable 350 simultaneous games and winning them all! 
Ron King successfully defended his World Championship against strong Russian players who had shifted to the Anglo-Saxon checkers, including Alexander Moiseyev , a grandmaster in three variants of the game. Moiseyev, a computer programmer, finally snatched the crown from King in the 3-move variant in 2003. 
Incredibly, Ron King held on to the World Championship of the GAYP variant until 2014, when he forfeited it to an Italian grandmaster, Sergio Scarpetta , when he failed to show up for the last four games of the World Championship match. South Africa’s Kondlo has continued his quest for the world title; he qualified again to play the World Championship match in 2015 in 3-move checkers (after defeating a strong field including Scarpetta), but lost the match to the world champion, Italian Michele Borghetti. 
Canadian Checkers. 
Canada also has its variant of checkers. The 2015 Canadian Champion is a Senegalese immigrant, Souleymane Keita. He defended his title against (a-Russian-immigrant-sounding name) Vladimir Lubarsky. 
In summary, a player from sub-Saharan Africa was the finalist or world champion of 2015, in International Draughts, American checkers, Canadian checkers, English Scrabble and French Scrabble. 
Why aren’t Africans also dominant in chess? 
The simple reason seems to be that, unlike Scrabble and Checkers, master level chess requires access to a very large body of ever-growing literature in chess theory (even ignoring the difficulty of making homemade chess pieces); it’s no longer possible to teach yourself grand master level chess, without memorizing these long chess openings. Africans do not have this access to chess materials (which now includes computer programs) for the same reason that they have no access to mathematics text books and other educational materials in schools or public (I would be surprised if even 1 percent of Africans have ever seen the word “library” on a building anywhere; they simply don’t exist). Chess has become more resource-demanding than any school subject. 
Fischer himself decried the increasingly heavy reliance of top-level chess on familiarity with professionally analyzed theoretical opening lines that the Soviet chess machine engendered (Fischer had to learn Russian just to keep up with the countless Russian opening analyses), and he ultimately invented a variant of chess (called Fischer Random chess) that basically rearranges the pieces at the start of a game. But standard chess continues to be the most popular in the world and Africans continue facing a training deficit for as long as there are no books there. 
Thus when the New York Times reported on the incredible Grandmaster achievement of an amateur Zambian chess player in 2007, their article was revealingly titled “Zambian with Little Training Stands Poised to Make History.” (By contrast, re women in chess, a 1992 book about the best chess playing female trio in history, was skeptically titled “The Polgar Sisters: Genius or Training? ”). 
The resource disadvantage of Africa in chess still does not mean, as some racial hypothesis bloggers seem to constantly suggest, that African chess teams relatively perform at a level that “confirms” their low national IQ scores. On the contrary, Zambia has a stronger national chess team than either Japan or South Korea, for example. Thus, Zambia (population 15 million, national IQ 78) quite easily defeated South Korea (population 50 million, national IQ 106) last time they met at the Chess Olympiads, with the former not even featuring its grandmaster. (China, on the other hand, is now an East Asian chess powerhouse, although it should be mentioned that they achieved this through a semi-Soviet-style professionalization program dubbed “ Big Dragon Project ”, initiated by an Asian billionaire in collaboration with Chinese officials, with the explicit aim of raising East Asian chess performance). South Africa’s first chess grandmaster, Kenny Solomon. 
Even within some historically multiracial countries, you can find some hints of anomalies to the racial hypothesis: South Africa has produced only one chess grandmaster in its history, and he happens to come from the black community. The fact that the black population of South Africa is larger shouldn’t really matter; after all, the top swimmers in South Africa are all white (for likely genetic reasons), and the fastest runners in white majority multiracial societies are black. 
What about American blacks? 
The vast majority of observations that have led to the conclusions of the racial hypothesis are based on the intellectual performance of blacks in America, where a historical IQ gap of one standard deviation seems to be intractable. 
Indeed the game of expert Scrabble itself appears to confirm the ethnic conclusions of Jensen et al within America because black Americans perform (on Scrabble) exactly as predicted by IQ data. Top black American experts generally perform lower than white American women at the top expert level. 
The best male native black American Scrabble player, Marlon Hill, has apparently made it his open mission to beat whites at Scrabble, a story that has not escaped Rush Limbaugh ‘s amusement. He has so far failed to convincingly establish his racial “superiority.” His rating does not appear on the top 1000 players of the world (WESPA) or even on the top 100 rated players in North America (NASPA). (By contrast, Marlon Hill’s old training partner , Sammy Okosagah, a Nigerian immigrant, has been ranked as high as number one in North America at his peak in 2004, and was one of the highest performing American duo, with David Weigand, at the 2013 World Championships when he came third in the world.) Lisa Odom, the highest ranked native Black American player. 
Quite surprisingly, there are some signs that the well-known gender reversal of intelligence that has been observed in black Americans may be slightly confirmed in Scrabble. A female black expert, Lisa Odom, does not appear on the recent international WESPA ratings list (although she has qualified in the past to play at the world championships) but she appears on the North American top 100 NASPA list . She is presently 59 th on that list (it changes frequently), which makes her not only the highest ranked native black American, but also one of the highest ranked women of any race in North America. (Incidentally, the third highest ranked player on the entire North American list at the time of this writing is a Kenyan immigrant, Patrick Gitonga Nderitu, who is ranked just above the Stanford wonderkid, Mack Meller.) 
A Jewish Rule? 
One simple informal test of the “g-loadedness” or cognitive intensity of any intellectual field is the presence of Jewish over-representation at the very top of the game, so to speak. This rule seems to work for the game of Scrabble. 
One of the highest rated Scrabble players in the world, second only to the great Nigel Richards in official rating at the time of this writing, is an Australian player named David Eldar. Eldar attended a special school called King David High School, whose Wikipedia description sounds like it was exclusively formed to serve the Australian Jewish community. Ashkenazi Jews are only 0.5% of that country. Although Eldar has not yet won the world championship, the odds are highly in his favor, as the second highest rated player in the world. 
Someone who has won the World Championship is Joel Sherman, who is one of only three Americans to have held the coveted title. Even without digging further for more Jews on the long list of highly rated players in North America, these examples are already sufficient to establish Jewish statistical over-representation on Scrabble super-achievement. And we have a strong reason to believe that there are even more. In a 2005 interview where he was asked to confirm his Jewish roots after he appeared on a list of Jewish sports figures, Sherman disclosed: 
… Several other North American Scrabble ® Champs have been Jewish and they’re not listed, presumably because the Wikipedia contributor who compiled that list found my Jewishness mentioned in “Word Freak” and the same info is not readily available about them. I won’t “out” them because I don’t know how they would feel to share that listing as well. My own feeling is ambivalent: it’s nice to be noted, but I’d rather my born religion was not the criterion for my inclusion, as I have been an atheist since even before my Bar Mitzvah… 
Seven years before Sherman’s statement, a 1998 New York Times report on computers playing Scrabble against human experts, contained a revealing sentence in the long article: “The leading Scrabble players, many of whom are Jewish, …” 
The over-representation of Ashkenazi Jews at the top of such cognitively demanding games might also put in doubt any suggestions of steep declines in real Jewish IQ in the 20 th century. 
The game of checkers does not escape this Jewish rule (no pun intended). I found that the greatest checkers match player in the Soviet Union at the height of Soviet sponsorship of the game, the man the Soviets were apparently shielding from Senegal’s Baba Sy, Iser Kuperman, was Jewish . This means that the two Russians who held the World Championship in chess and checkers at this time of Soviet dominance were both Jewish (the great Mikhail Botvinik was the chess world champion at this time in the early 1960s). 
It is said that this ambitious Soviet promotion and glorification of chess and checkers was originally instituted by Stalin to keep the most intelligent elites of his country, especially the Jews, occupied with something that would keep them from meddling in politics (in more recent years, Gary Kasparov, an Ashkenazi Jew, has indeed become quite troublesome for the Russian government after retiring from chess). It was of course also later used for propaganda purposes to convey the intellectual “superiority” of the Soviet system internally and internationally. 
Jewish brilliance has not left the world of checkers to this day. Alexander Moiseyev, the Russian who ended the World Championship reign (in 3-move American checkers) of the Barbadian Ron King, is of Jewish descent . (The 2015 finalist against Senegalese Souleymane Keita in Canadian checkers, Vladimir Lubarsky, is also almost certainly Jewish .) 
The bottom line is that if the cognitive hierarchy under the racial hypothesis was true, there should be no single popular intellectual activity in the world in which Africans and Ashkenazi Jews are both over-represented at the top (just as there is no single world athletic activity requiring high speed, in which the slowest populations and the fastest populations are both over-represented at the top). Scrabble and Checkers are in violation of that logical axiom. 
Jewish over-representation at the top of such games (checkers, scrabble, chess, etc) also puts in doubt any conclusions that the male advantage over females has to do specifically with visuospatial abilities, as Jews are not exceptional in that regard. It would seem that the advantage has to just do with general intelligence. 
No East Asians in Scrabble? National School Scrabble championships, source: Wikipedia 
East Asians have the reputation of being good at math in school and college, but their dominance does not extend to the highest award in math (the Field’s Medal), so it is not an anomaly for Scrabble that they are not over-represented at the world championships (especially those born in English-speaking nations). The question still is: why aren’t they good at Scrabble in school, since they are so conspicuously good in math at that stage? Does their failure at this stage pose a problem for Scrabble as a math game? 
Actually, they do quite as well at Scrabble as they do in school mathematics. 
It appears that there has been an East Asian name among the winners of the highly competitive National School Scrabble Championships in four of the last six years! (They are only 6% of the US population). Notice that only one female name has appeared (Aune Mitchell, 2007) even at this stage. I did not investigate the Jewishness of the other names, but it would not be surprising if there were a few.

Discussion 
“For expert players, the game requires the simultaneous interplay of verbal, visuospatial, and mathematical abilities under speeded conditions. There are no other games that require the simultaneous, rapid use of all of these abilities.” Halpern and Wai, The World of Competitive Scrabble , Psychology Today. 
Spearman’s hypothesis , an idea used by Arthur Jensen to demonstrate the biological nature of the black-white performance gap, predicts that the gap should expand the more you use a test that relies on more raw brain power or ‘g’. Scrabble involves much more mental manipulations than the simpler well-known “WordSum” Vocabulary test and the latter shows a wide gap between blacks and whites (in America). This gap does indeed appear to grow even further when you replace WordSum test with Scrabble, but only when you limit “black” to native black Americans. The gap appears to reduce and even reverse when you introduce black Africans, which is an anomaly for the racial hypothesis. The fact that we are talking about the most elite players should actually make it even more impossible for this to happen since the black-white gap should be even more conspicuous (in favor of whites) at higher ends of cognitive performance. 
In the same vein, the game of draughts (especially its speeded up form, called “blitz draughts”) is much more g-loaded than a simple “ Reaction Time ” test that is used by cognitive psychologists to test natural brain power differences by comparing how long it takes one to react to certain simple stimuli. Blitz draughts does not only demand your quick reaction to the move of your opponent, it includes the added mental challenge of calculating your reaction move based on assessing a constantly changing position. Besides playing the World Championship match in the slow classical draughts, an African player reached the top two slots of the super-elite world championships in blitz draughts for both 2015 and 2016 . 
If Africans are doing well on these games because of some special environmental reason, then that contradicts the genetic racial hypothesis. If Africans in Africa are outperforming others due to some environmental reason, then black American performance on Scrabble can also be raised by environmental methods; if black American Scrabble performance can be raised to equal whites, then black American math performance can also be raised by environmental intervention. If it can’t, then the fallacy of the hereditarian position has been to assume that native black Americans are cognitively representative of blacks everywhere. 
The global racial hypothesis is therefore not just contradicted by these findings, it is logically refuted . Under this hypothesis, there should not be even one single cognitive field where the top blacks are equal or more over-represented than the top whites, especially when white participation in such fields is elite enough to result in a wide gender performance gap in favor of males even with relatively high numbers of female participants. The additional presence of Jewish over-representation at the top of a field should only reinforce the impossibility of black dominance or equality under that hypothesis. You have the opposite empirical result in Scrabble and checkers since you get increasing African over-representation with rising cognitive selectivity, suggesting a reversal of the gap, if anything. 
The falsifiable part of the racial hypothesis is duly falsified.

11827,Assange Confirms: WikiLeaks Didn’t Get Emails From Russian Govt,"Accuses Clinton Campaign of 'Neo-McCarthyist Hysteria' by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
In an interview with John Pilger, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has confirmed today that the organization did not get any of the hacked emails they published from the Russian government. WikiLeaks has a long-standing policy of not commenting on sources , so even such a denial is highly unusual. 
Assange insisted however that it was necessary to deny the claims, saying that Hillary Clinton’s camp “has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria” with false claims that Russia’s government in behind the hacked emails as part of a plot to rig next week’s election. 
Russia has long denied being involved in the hacking, but the Clinton campaign has run heavily on the issue, accusing Republican candidate Donald Trump of being a “puppet” of the Russian government, who they are trying to install by leaking embarrassing emails. 
The campaign’s allegations have so far been pretty effective at limiting media coverage of the content of the leaks, with a lot more attention going to the speculation that Russia is plotting to “hack the vote” for Trump. Whether Assange’s straightforward denial is sufficient to bring the focus back to content remains to be seen, though the Democratic campaign is unlikely to give up what has been materially their main talking point over the past several months just because the facts don’t support it.

11828,Official: Russia Knew Syrian Chemical Attack Was Coming,"(AP) WASHINGTON  —   The United States has concluded Russia knew in advance of Syria’s chemical weapons attack last week, a senior U. S. official said Monday. [The official said a drone operated by Russians was flying over a hospital as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment. Hours after the drone left, a   fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons.  The senior official said the U. S. has no proof of Russian involvement in the actual chemical attack in northern Syria. But the official said the presence of the surveillance drone over the hospital couldn’t have been a coincidence, and that Russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming and that victims were seeking treatment. The official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity, didn’t give precise timing for when the drone was in the area, where more than 80 people were killed. The official also didn’t provide details for the military and intelligence information that form the basis of what the Pentagon now believes. Another U. S. official cautioned that no final American determination has been made that Russia knew ahead of time that chemical weapons would be used. That official wasn’t authorized to speak about internal administration deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. The allegation of Russian foreknowledge is grave, even by the standards of the currently dismal U. S.  relations. Although Russia has steadfastly supported Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, and they’ve coordinated military attacks together, Washington has never previously accused Moscow of complicity in any attack that involved the gassing of innocent civilians, including children. The former Cold War foes even worked together in 2013 to remove and destroy more than 1, 300 tons of Syrian chemical weapons and agents. Until Monday, U. S. officials had said they weren’t sure whether Russia or Syria operated the drone. The official said the U. S. is now convinced Russia controlled the drone. The official said it still isn’t clear who was flying the jet that bombed the hospital, because the Syrians also fly   aircraft. U. S. officials previously have said Russians routinely work with Syrians at the Shayrat air base where the attack is supposed to have originated. U. S. officials say the chemical weapons were stored there and that those elements add to the conclusion that Russia was complicit in the attack. Last Thursday 59 Tomahawk missiles were fired on the   base in the United States’ first direct military action against Assad’s forces. The U. S. has been focusing its military action in Syria on defeating the Islamic State group. On Monday, Col. John J. Thomas, a U. S. military spokesman, said the U. S. has taken extra defensive precautions in Syria in case of possible retaliation against American forces for the cruise missile attack. Thomas told reporters at the Pentagon that the increased emphasis on defensive measures to protect U. S. troops on the ground in Syria led to a slight and temporary decline in offensive U. S. airstrikes against IS in Syria. There has been no Syrian retaliation so far for the cruise missile attack, which destroyed or rendered inoperable more than 20 Syria air force planes, he said. Thomas said the U. S. intends to return to full offensive air operations against IS as soon as possible.",0
11829,Rep. Dave Brat: ‘Overwhelming Political Pressure’ from White House and GOP Leadership on AHCA - Breitbart,"Rep. Dave Brat describes the “political pressure” placed by the White House and Republican leadership upon conservatives to vote for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) as “overwhelming. ”[Brat was a guest on The Laura Ingraham Show Thursday, where he described “pressure like crazy” with both the Trump administration and House Speaker Paul Ryan’s whips trying to get the votes they need to pass the bill.  A member of the House Freedom Caucus, Brat said he knows the grassroots base of the GOP wants Obamacare finally repealed, so for Republicans to vote for the AHCA  —   which many say “cements” the primary flaws found in Obamacare  —   could be detrimental to President Donald Trump. “We want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don’t want to handle a bill that’s going to fail in a few years,” he told Breitbart News Saturday.",0
11830,SB Nation Claims New England Patriots Have a ’Trump Problem’ - Breitbart,"New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady, Head Coach Bill Belichick, and principle owner Robert Kraft, according to SB Nation staff writer Charlotte Wilder, by supporting New York billionaire Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, somehow leave their fans struggling with “emotional implications” making it hard for them to watch the games and enjoy the team’s march to a potential fifth Super Bowl victory. [Without citing any hard evidence that the team won’t be supported —  like organized protests or decline in ticket sales —  Wilder instead provides some anecdotal stories about some liberal friends not being able to enjoy the games because they were upset with Trump’s message. She also says Brady’s facebook page was inundated by negative remarks from alleged fans.   But Wilder doesn’t really make a very good case that the fans will be bailing on Tommy and the boys. Significantly, she fails to point out that Boston Red Sox fans didn’t have any problems supporting conservative pitcher Curt Schilling when their team, which sits in the hub of New England’s liberal leaning swath of America, helped upend the   curse of the Bambino by sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. Now Wilder contends that although Pats fans never lost faith and were able to endure   and   “recently, that blind faith has faced its greatest test in the form of the team’s connection to Republican   Donald Trump. ” Wilder, who hails from Lincoln Mass where 77. 7 % of the population voted for the failed   ticket, argues, “The trouble began when Patriots reporters spotted Brady with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker in Foxboro in the fall of 2015. ” Wilder points out that the New England legend donned the hat “soon after Trump announced his candidacy and called Mexicans rapists in the same speech. ” Wilder’s bias intentionally mischaracterizes Trump’s comment. As Breitbart News reported in June, Trump was not referring to all Mexicans as Wilder implies but “was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.  border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. ”  Wilder demonstrates that she’s the one with the Trump problem when she calls the    “one of the most divisive and   figures in the history of American politics.’  When Brady said back in 2015 that it would be “great” if his “friend” Trump won the election, and Trump responded by saying “Tom Brady is a great friend of mine. He’s a winner and he likes winners,” Wilder claims that shock permeated the internet. Brady never went on record saying who he actually voted for. The SB Nation writer goes on to characterize the man who will be President of the United States on January 20th as one who ran “with the most   (and racist, misogynistic,   Islamaphobic, etc.) rhetoric. ”  To support her case that the Patriots have a “Trump Problem,” the author cites a story that her mom told her about one of her friends, who once was a   fan but can no longer watch Pats games. Wilder’s mom said, “She used to watch every Sunday with her family, and now she just can’t do it. ” Wilder called the friend soon after she was told the story and asked her if she can no longer support the team. “Yeah, I just will not watch,” Susan Pease said:  I really enjoy watching the game with my family. I like what it means for my family to sit down and talk and laugh and watch and snack and now   …     I just, it’s just ruined for me. It’s not the worst thing about this, of course  —   this whole thing stems from my tremendous disappointment over this election and country. But it will forever color my opinion of the team. I will not watch, I will not buy any more jerseys. I’m done. But Pease is not alone,  Wilders claims “at least 6” other people she knows can’t watch the games either. I’m sure that will make a big dent in the ratings for the playoff game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, where the Patriots will host the Houston Texans in the NFL Divisional Round on Saturday. ",0

11833,"Oakland Sets Up $300,000 Anti-Deportation Fund - Breitbart","Oakland, one of California’s many sanctuary cities, set up a $300, 000   fund on Tuesday in response to President Donald Trump’s executive order last week that aims to cut off federal funds to “jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply” with federal immigration enforcement. [According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the fund will be disbursed to to a “rapid response network” composed of 12 Oakland organizations to help families that cannot afford legal representation and whose illegal status could result in deportation. Money will also go towards creating an emergency hotline for residents, holding “know your rights” workshops, and providing free consultations.  “Without counsel, up against a federal prosecutor, they’re supposed to represent themselves in one of the most complex areas of law, where the stakes are permanent separation from their families,” Eleni   immigration program director of Centro Legal de la Raza, told the Chronicle. According to the Chronicle, over a quarter of residents in Oakland are  . The publication further noted that on Tuesday, during a City Council meeting to discuss Oakland’s budget for the next two years, Mayor Libby Schaaf said, “I caution that we are at a moment of unprecedented uncertainty in this new, I would say, horrific federal environment. ” Schaaf had previously warned, according to the San Jose Mercury News, that Turmp’s order would “destroy trust in government” and complaining that “it’s disrespecting the American tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. ” Trump’s order states, “Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States.  These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic. ” It stipulates that such jurisdictions will not be eligible to receive Federal grants unless they are found necessary for law enforcement purposes as prescribed by the Attorney General of Secretary of Homeland Security. Oakland is located just over 10 miles away from San Francisco, another sanctuary city where Kate Steinle was infamously murdered by an illegal alien and felon with multiple convictions and deportations in July 2015. Only one mayor from a major California city agreed with Trump’s order. Last week, Fresno Mayor Lee Brand told the Fresno Bee, “I’m not going to make Fresno a sanctuary city because I don’t want to make Fresno ineligible from receiving potentially millions of dollars in infrastructure and other types of projects   …      My philosophy is to follow the law and to avoid these national   questions. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz",0
11834,BREAKING: Trump Just Gave Obama HORRIBLE News... Check Out What The Pentagon JUST Did,"
Dean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS – 
Last week, the Pentagon issued a Defense Department directive that allows “Department of Defense (D0D) personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties.” 
The Defense Department has been working on changing the “gun-free” zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years. 
Military.com reports that the directive “also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on DoD property.” It authorizes “commanders, 05 and above…[to] grant permission to DoD personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm (concealed or open carry) on DoD property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status.” 
The directive also makes clear that DoD will consider further changes to grant “[standard] authorizations for other DoD personnel, who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a government-issued firearm, to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on DoD property.” This would allow DoD with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander. 
Kim Smith at Conservative Tribune notes that the policy was a response to an NRA-backed provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that required the Defense Department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base. 
“It is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members, but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available,” NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Washington Free Beacon . 
Those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least 21 years old and meet all federal, state and local laws, the directive said. 
It would appear that the Pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support. 
President-elect Donald Trump ran on removing gun-free zones from military bases. On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by “[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.” 
The immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway. And that’s good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops, which should always be a priority.

11835,Kraft Heinz Offers to Buy Unilever in $143 Billion Deal - The New York Times,"The world’s grocery carts could soon be filled with more and more products from one global colossus. Food, beverage and   companies have been seeking merger partners to obtain greater scale and efficiencies as consumers, particularly younger shoppers, eschew the boxed and jarred foods of their parents’ generation. Now, one such recently merged giant, Kraft Heinz, has set its sights on the biggest target to date: Unilever, the home of Dove soap and Axe body spray, Ben  Jerry’s ice cream and Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Kraft Heinz disclosed on Friday that it had made a $143 billion takeover offer for Unilever. If completed, it would be the largest   merger since the British wireless provider Vodafone’s $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann of Germany in 2000. Unilever said it had spurned the offer, which it said “fundamentally undervalues” the   company. Still, that is not expected to end the matter. Pressed by growing competition from upstarts and changing consumer habits, food and   giants will have little choice but to seek deals. And 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that bought Heinz, then Kraft just two years ago, has the resources and the good will of Wall Street to continue to pursue Unilever. It also has the support of Warren E. Buffett, who has previously collaborated with 3G and is expected to provide financing in any deal with Unilever. A combination of Kraft Heinz and Unilever would create an empire of hundreds of household names, with more than $82 billion in sales. Kraft Heinz’s geographic strength in North American   sales would complement Unilever’s stronger sales in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Kraft Heinz executives have “said they really want to develop and have an international platform for those Kraft Heinz brands,” said Brittany Weissman, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. “I think Unilever would give them that international platform to get those brands out overseas. ” But a merger would be certain to draw antitrust reviews by regulators from many countries. “Market power would be much increased, as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,” John Colley, a professor of practice in strategy and leadership at Warwick Business School in Coventry, England. Kraft Heinz approached Unilever about a potential deal in the last few weeks, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. Among its pitches, these people said, was that the combined company would maintain headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. That could prove important amid rising nationalist sentiment, given Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and an election approaching in the Netherlands. Kraft Heinz, with 3G behind the wheel, has long been considered the most likely to drive a wave of consolidation in the food industry. Friday’s disclosure followed speculation late last year that Kraft Heinz might make an offer for Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos and Ritz crackers Shares of Mondelez, and those of companies like General Mills and Campbell Soup that had been seen as potential targets, fell on Friday in part because of disappointment over news of the Unilever bid. Shares of Kraft Heinz surged nearly 11 percent. The Brazilian principals of 3G have led a buying spree over two decades to become a global force in food and beverages. In doing so, they have won the admiration of no less a business eminence than Mr. Buffett. They took a small Brazilian brewing company and eventually transformed it into   InBev, the   gorilla of beer. They moved into fast food by buying Burger King, then merging it with Tim Hortons, Canada’s foremost purveyor of coffee and doughnuts. And with Mr. Buffett’s help, they bought Heinz in 2013, transforming a staid American ketchup legend into a lean maker of condiments and canned soups. Two years later, in 2015, they bought Kraft to become even bigger. Now  —   almost two years after the Kraft deal  —   3G and Kraft Heinz are casting their eyes on Unilever, which is the   seller of packaged food worldwide and the     maker behind Procter  Gamble. Unilever, which is based in London and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, has embraced sustainability measures aimed at reducing the company’s environmental impact and improving customers’ health. It has also moved to update its products with younger, hipper names by buying   like Dollar Shave Club and the cleaning products maker Seventh Generation. And the company has built an important presence in developing countries, which now account for some 58 percent of its revenue. Still, Unilever has been weighed down by slowing sales in the last year, prompting some analysts to call for additional cost cuts. Combining with Kraft Heinz would leave the company in the hands of masters of   who have won praise from Mr. Buffett. At Burger King, for example,   executives disposed of luxurious corporate offices, the corporate jet and even workers’ personal printers. At Kraft Heinz, that approach has helped lead to profit margins of about 30 percent, compared with roughly 15 percent at Unilever. Unilever said that Kraft Heinz’s bid was valued at roughly $50 a share, for an 18 percent premium to the target company’s closing price on Thursday. The offer consists of $30. 23 a share in cash and 0. 222 in shares in the combined company. Under British takeover rules, Kraft would have until March 17 to announce its firm intention to make an offer for Unilever or it would have to walk away. Shares of Unilever jumped in Friday trading in London after The Financial Times’s Alphaville blog reported the offer. A deal for Unilever would be expensive by any measure, particularly because Kraft Heinz already has nearly $30 billion in   debt on its books. But Kraft Heinz has argued in private that it has healthy cash flows that could easily service the additional debt that would help finance the bid. Potentially further bolstering Kraft Heinz’s firepower is Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which helped finance 3G’s $23 billion purchase of Heinz and its merger with Kraft. Some analysts, however, were cautious on the prospects of a Unilever sale. Raphael Moreau, an analyst with Euromonitor in London, said that Unilever might ultimately be willing to pursue a smaller deal with Kraft to offload some of its food brands. “While creating synergies in sauces and soups could be a rationale for such a deal, a combination of Heinz and Hellmann’s in mayonnaise could struggle to be given approval by competition authorities,” Mr. Moreau said. And some British lawmakers have already criticized Kraft Heinz’s approach, pointing to Brexit and the decline in the pound as paving the way for “fire sales” of British companies. The chairman of Parliament’s business committee, Iain Wright, said on Friday that “a lot of very good British companies will be subject to fire sales without taking into account their performance and quality. ”",0
11836,"Military Will Not Be a Deportation Force, DHS Tells Mexico","Department of Homeland Security John Kelly said the U. S. military would not be used in America’s efforts to deport criminal aliens. He also stated there would be no mass deportations. His comments came during a press conference in Mexico City where he and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with their  counterparts. [“Let me be very, very clear, there will be no, repeat, no mass deportations,” Secretary Kelly told reporters. “Everything we do in DHS will be done legally and according to human rights and the legal justice system of the United States. ”  His comments followed shortly after remarks made by President Donald Trump when he referred to the targeted immigration enforcement efforts as a “military operation,” The Hill reported. White House Spokesman Sean Spicer later clarified the remarks reminding reporters that President Trump used the phrase as an adjective. “The president was clearly describing the manner in which this is being done,” Spicer explained. Kelly also appeared to reference a fake news article from the Associated Press last week that claimed President Trump was considering using the National Guard as deportation officers. The White House and DHS flatly denied the allegation. “That is 100% not true. It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this,” Spicer told reporters during a news briefing. Department of Homeland Security Spokesman David Lapan responded to an inquiry from Breitbart Texas stating, “The Department is not considering mobilizing the National Guard for immigration enforcement. ” The DHS has repeatedly said their department is not and will not be engaging in mass deportations. The department has been engaged in a targeted enforcement action aimed at taking criminal aliens and those who have been ordered removed from the country by an immigration judge. Nearly 700 such people were rounded up earlier this month in Operation Cross Check. Despite the targeted nature of the operation, many fake news reports scared members of immigrant communities  spreading rumors of mass sweeps and raids, Breitbart Texas reported. One post by an Austin city council member went as far as to claim the arrest of criminal aliens was somehow an act of retaliation by the Trump Administration because of immigration protests. Kelly and Tillerson were expected to meet with President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto, and the Mexican ministers of Interior, Foreign Relations, Finance, National Defense, and the Navy to discuss border security, law enforcement cooperation, and trade.

11837,"When You Look Pregnant, but You’re Not - The New York Times","“Congratulations, when are you due?” Pregnancy holds a special place in the culture: There are few other circumstances in which someone could glance at a stranger’s body, make assumptions and feel entitled to touch her or offer unsolicited advice. Even, in my case, when a woman is not actually pregnant. This happened to me recently while riding a bus in the Bronx. I was standing up on the BX12, holding on to a pole and texting a friend. A white   man wearing pleated khakis and a blue   shirt sitting nearby turned to me and said loudly, “Please, ma’am, take my seat. ” I shook my head, indicating that I was getting off soon. He persisted: “Please, ma’am, you really shouldn’t be standing up. Every bump this bus goes over can jostle and hurt your unborn baby. ” I was not, nor have I ever been, pregnant. I was just a   woman in her 30s on her evening commute wearing an   dress. (Admittedly, that particular style of dress, which cascades down from the fitted bust and helps to disguise protruding stomachs, is a favorite of maternity clothing designers. But that is beside the point.) This stranger felt as if he were responsible for the   of my nonexistent fetus and took it upon himself to scold me in front of the rest of the bus, providing unsolicited and inaccurate advice. Recently, the Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie revealed in an interview that she had had a baby but had kept her pregnancy quiet to avoid having to “perform” pregnancy. The pregnancy performance also encompasses the notion that pregnant women’s bodies are public property, available for anyone to grope. Again, even the appearance of pregnancy is enough for many people to think that a woman’s tummy is (literally) up for grabs. When I finally acquiesced and took that man’s seat on the bus that day, he put both hands on my belly and rubbed it as we switched places. By the time I processed what had happened, he got off the bus. As a bioethicist specializing in reproduction and sexual health, I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about various aspects of pregnancy, including trying to figure out why this attitude toward pregnant women is so prevalent. My theory: Pregnancy happens inside women’s bodies, so it is very personal, but also mysterious, since (with the exception of a few ultrasounds) it is largely unseen. Fascination with pregnancy and pregnant women’s bodies is not surprising. But that does not provide people with an open invitation to involve themselves in the process. Women become pregnant under varied circumstances, not all of them planned or positive, so even the   congratulatory comments are not always appropriate. A simple “How are you feeling?” is a neutral option. Concern and comments regarding a woman’s decisions surrounding motherhood are probably coming from a good place few people actually endeavor to be patronizing. It is absolutely possible to show concern for a pregnant person while still being respectful and not insulting. By all means, make accommodations for anyone  —   including pregnant people, the elderly or someone on crutches  —   who may look as if they could use a break. But if someone declines the offer to take your seat on the bus, move on and let it go.   comments are unnecessary. It’s possible that a person who appears to be pregnant may have an unwelcome medical condition that she doesn’t wish to discuss. There is also a connection between the unsolicited advice given to pregnant (or potentially pregnant) women, and the way society views women who are not the ideal Size 6. Once it is discovered that we are not, in fact, pregnant, it does not necessarily stop people from telling us what to do or how to dress. Perhaps they think that if we don’t have enough   to eat properly, it gives them the right (maybe even the obligation) to advise us on how to better ourselves. Once during a crowded subway ride, an elderly woman looked at me knowingly and said: “Here you go, honey. You sit down right here,” gesturing toward my belly. “Thank you so much, but I’m actually not pregnant,” I responded, feeling my already sweaty face turning a brighter shade of red. Just when I thought the exchange was over, the woman continued: “Oh, O. K. honey. But really, a woman of your size shouldn’t be wearing those   dresses. It looks like you’re trying to trick people into thinking you’re pregnant. ” A few weeks later, I attended a clothing swap and got rid of three comfortable cotton   dresses. I almost felt obligated to tell the woman who took them that they’re not only great in the summer heat, but they may also result in comments from strangers on public transit concerned with a hypothetical fetus. I hope she’s having better luck with them than I did.",0

The fact that she stole State Department furniture shouldn’t shock anyone. Recurring Hillary Clinton behavior. 63. Hillary told Tim Kaine back in July 2015 he would be VP https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25445#efmALMAM- “…HRC has personally told Tim Kaine he’s the veep.” “Won’t stop assuring Sens Brown and Heitkamp (at dinner now) that HRC has personally told Tim Kaine he’s the veep.” Kaine says he only knew 48 hours before the announcement. Solidifies all theories that he dropped out as the DNC chair so Debbie Wasserman-Schultz could replace him (and help ensure she rigged the primary for Hillary against Bernie as evidenced in earlier leaks) and open door for Kaine to be VP. This is despite her saying he would be a terrible choice for Obama’s VP in her book when she was talking about the last election. But she needed DWS in charge to ensure she was the nominee. 64. Hillary tweaks her policies based on donors’ wants https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25320#efmAFmAHCATBAUQ “Raisers are effectively salespeople selling the candidate on the donor marketplace, so their feedback is valuable to HQ in terms of tweaking policy, messaging, tone, etc … big donors usually have ideas/advice and want to feel like they are being heard.” These leaks prove that Hillary will do anything for money, regardless of morals. Her staff even comments often about how worrisome it is. She takes money from countries who kills gays, enslave women, and persecute Christians and doesn’t care about any of it. She changes her policies based on who gives her what. She sells U.S. assets to countries who donate… what a mess… 65. Hillary camp admits it doesn’t support $15 minimum wage https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2893 “Substantively, we have not supported $15 – you will get a fair number of liberal economists who will say it will lose jobs.” Even if they flip-flop and say they will implement it, they still admit that it is bad for the economy according to liberal economists. 66. Illegally coordinating with Priorities USA, a SuperPAC funded by George Soros https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2372 “So afraid that NYT is going with this story on Priorities whether we like it or not. They have sources about the meetings.” They were scrambling to make sure they were within the law and really worried the donor list was about to come out. The New York Times spiked the story about the corruption to protect her, shielding the donors which OpenSecrets.org shares with us from a later disclosure . As you can see clearly there, the top contributor is none other than George Soros with $6 million in. Staff from the two groups met and coordinated efforts, which caused the concern from Hillary’s side because the Priorities people were talking and the media, specifically the New York Times hid this violation of campaign election law. 67. Racist and sexist remarks: “too white and too male” https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24546 “Reed’s lists are still too big, too undifferentiated too white and too male.” Just because the people being referred to are white and male does not stop it from being racist. Just replace it with black and female and you can see why. Race and gender should not be the main determining factor when it comes to administrative positions, only experience and merit, but for Hillary’s staff and democrats race and gender are the determining factors unfortunately. 68.

I’m holding a TS clearance. Scott, you may need to figure out what we need to do to add me to the review authority.” Why does Podesta have a top secret clearance? He’s not holding a government position… 69. Podesta connects to unsecure network where anyone could access classified files https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10270 “Yes inbox finally opened up. I should never connect to Amtrack wifi. Seems to always screw things up.” Holds TS clearance, conducts official campaign business on unsecure Amtrak WiFi… These are the people Hillary will trust to secure our secrets once in office. Good God… 70. Hillary’s speechwriters: “I don’t mind the ‘backs of dead Americans’ because we need a bit of moral outrage.” (Benghazi) https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3049 One prominent theme throughout the leaks is that Hillary is just a put together political head piece that is drafted, rewritten, and approved before being sent into public. They note where she should be outraged, they note where she should smile, she even sighed when they told her to sigh. All of the words coming out of her mouth go through weeks of tweaking so that she comes off as likable – and yet she still comes off as a cold. 71. The AP colluding with the Hillary campaign https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099 “They do not plan to release anything publicly, so no posting online or anything public-facing, just to the committee. That said, they are considering placing a story with a friendly at the AP (Matt Lee or Bradley Klapper), that would lay this out before the majority on the committee has a chance to realize what they have and distort it.” And the AP is supposed to be THE NEUTRAL news source… wow… 72. Hillary’s camp says she has a “character problem” and is “arrogant” https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11136#efmAC0AGw “I know this email thing isn’t on the level. I’m fully aware of that. But her inability to just do a national interview and communicate genuine feelings of remorse and regret is now, I fear, becoming a character problem (more so than honesty). People hate her arrogant, like her down. It’s a sexist context, but I think it’s the truth.” Her closest confidants admitting what everyone already knows. She is not genuine. 73. Staging fake anti-Trump protest, conspiring with Univision CEO https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3718 “Thinking about the early 4, there is the Trump International Hotel in Vegas. Maybe there is an organizing opportunity next week. Would be good to reach out to unite here.” Previous leaks months ago proved many of the “protests” were staged and hired people to be there with professional signs. The James O’Keefe bombshell video ( first one ) proves that all these “protests” were staged and they paid mentally ill people to incite violence. 74. Meeting to go over Cheryl Mills’ testimony https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12105#efmAC4ADoAHvAIE “Please see below for today’s 8am meeting agenda. Also, please note that this meeting should last a full hour” Lists items to talk about “Timing of Focus Groups re Debate Prep”“8/31 Email Release”“Jake/Cheryl Testimony.” Memo revealing they were discussing the testimony of Cheryl Mills in meetings It must have been highly important to keep all of their stories straight, properly vetted and discussed. 75. Iran nuclear deal was “greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler” https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/727 “This agreement condemns the next generation to cleaning up a nuclear war in the Persian Gulf… Yup.” Top Hillary advisor agrees with that statement, indicating they know the Iran deal was terrible despite what they state publicly (another public vs private position). 76. Journalist talks strategy with Clinton staff and asks for permission to write article https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6453 “am not going to raise this publicly, but one of HRC’s opponents will soon charge that she is running an “imperial campaign.” If it is the right opponent, Democrat or Republican, the charge will resonate.” “BTW, I may doing an Elizabeth Warren column soon. If I write that my optimum scenario would be for Elizabeth to ultimately give a big endorsement to HRC and give the keynote speech at the Convention, totally off the record, would that give you a problem? It would be my personal opinion only, but if you have a problem with my suggesting this as my idea, I won’t tell anyone and I won’t include it, deferring to you” Yes. This supposed journalist is discussing strategy with the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign. Giving him information and warnings about things he learned from other sources most likely off the record. Extreme collusion between the media and Hillary’s staff. But wait, there is more! He is asking permission from Podesta to write parts of an article. John Podesta responds to the email, and grants permission for the journalist to write the story as originally planned. 77. Bill Clinton admits Clinton Foundation has no “real projects” “He also said he’s worried about the pensions commitment and not having real projects to announce at CGI america. I said we are concerned too…” It was also mentioned that the employees are unhappy. 78. Violating campaign finance law https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/13999#efmAClADMADOAEwAIPAI3 “I’m swinging way above my weight class here. And I’m 100% sure this out of protocol. I’m trying to land the campaign a big fat whale that can give between $100,000 to maybe $1 million if their ego can be reassured that they won’t be just treated “just like any other donor. With your permission, can I CC you in an email to these guys. I’m work with Haim Saban’s political director on these same guys. If it’s 100% inappropriate I understand.” Haim Saiban is the owner of Univision, who has been working with Hillary as revealed throughout the leaks. 79. Interfering with the 2008 Republican primary process https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/27648 “Yes, we need to move with some tactics to try to stop him. Ideas? We should take another swing at the immigration angle. I think this is a crisis. We need to ring the alarm bell. But I’m not sure how we could affect the GOP primary? Earned media play on McCain and immigration. Robocalls to suppress his vote? Turnout evangelicals for Huck?” What right do they have to interfere in another party’s primaries? Not surprised though. 80. Proof that ‘Correct the Record’ (SuperPAC) is directly coordinating with the Hillary campaign against federal campaign law https://www.wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/5636 (in attachments) “In May of 2015, CTR separated from its parent organization, American Bridge, and became its own SuperPAC. This structure allows CTR to retain its independence but coordinate directly and strategically with the Hillary campaign. This work is necessary now more than ever.” Correct the Record (CTR) is a group funded by globalist billionaire George Soros to pretend Hillary has support online. They pay “an army of nerd virgins” ( their own words ) to create memes and pretend to support Hillary. On popular internet sites like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook, they are paid to ‘downvote’ or ‘dislike’ or delete anything pro-Trump/anti-Hillary, and fake-promote anything pro-Hillary/anti-Trump. Incredibly sad, but Hillary and her “support” is staged in every department. The same attachment describes everything. 81. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in direct contact with the Hillary campaign https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15092#efmARfAUUAZpAd9AfGAf6 “[He is] particularly interested in meeting people who could help him understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy issues he cares most about. He wants to meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective political operations to advance public policy goals” They are basically saying he wants to learn how to bribe people. Mark Zuckerberg has been very outspoken about Trump and his wall idea, when he himself is building a large wall around his mansion. Guess protecting yourself is OK, but not the American people. Facebook also manipulates it’s trending stories to not show pro-Trump/anti-Hillary articles or trends, and even censors videos against Hillary . The censorship is well known and has reduced Facebook’s integrity tenfold. Pro-Trump stories with hundreds of thousands of mentions are deleted to allow room for anti-Trump articles with less than a thousand mentions. Happens literally daily. Unfortunately this is the case across Twitter , YouTube , Google , and Reddit as well (and why it seems like at times more support Hillary despite Trump getting 30,000 at his rallies and Hillary getting 200 ). They are in the tank for Hillary. 82. Hillary’s team working with hundreds of MSM news pundits https://www.wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/5636 (in attachments) “IMPACTING THE DIALOGUE: CTR has identified 372 surrogates including influential and frequent pundits on broadcast and cable news for Presidential 2016 politics and provided them around 80 sets of talking points…” Once again, shows the media collusion with the Hillary campaign. 83. Katy Perry is a puppet for Hillary Clinton https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/27006 “She said no to asking Chelsea. Would go herself before asking her daughter. So we are at plan B: Katy Perry it is.” Huma Abedin writes that they have to send Katy Perry to do an Arkansas event because Hillary is unwilling to ask her daughter to go. Katy Perry is such a puppet for them that they can use her as a replacement for Chelsea when needed. 84. Hillary tries to hide her tiny rallies",0
11839,"China to Raise Military Spending, but Less Than in Recent Years - The New York Times","BEIJING  —   China said Saturday that its military budget would rise by about 7 percent this year, apparently the lowest increase in seven years, signaling that its leaders do not plan to engage the United States in an arms race even as President Trump seeks to bolster the Pentagon’s spending. Addressing reporters before the start of the annual National People’s Congress, Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for the legislature, said the increase would be “about” 7 percent. She said defense spending would amount to roughly 1. 3 percent of China’s gross domestic product. Last year’s proposed increase was 7. 6 percent, though China has yet to release final figures indicating how much was actually spent. Those figures, and the exact number of this year’s projected increase, will be revealed in a budget that the government releases on Sunday, when the national legislature starts its annual full session. Before 2016, the military budget had received   increases for six years, a reflection of China’s   economy. Chinese experts said the new budget would keep military spending roughly in line with the government’s usual formula of G. D. P. growth plus inflation. As China’s economy continues to slow, annual growth in the gross domestic product is expected to be about 6. 5 percent. Inflation hovers around 2 percent. And the government must also find more money for health care, education and other increasingly expensive social needs. Chinese and Western military analysts said it was notable that Mr. Trump’s recent pledge to raise American defense spending by $54 billion had not spurred China to elevate its own spending further. Ms. Fu said that China wanted good relations with the Trump administration but would respond to any challenges. “President Xi Jinping and President Trump have had two direct phone calls, and the message was very clear, which is that there must be more cooperation between China and the United States so we become good partners,” Ms. Fu said. But she added that China would watch the effects of Mr. Trump’s global policy changes. “Of course, everyone hopes that their impact will be positive, but if there are challenges, China will respond calmly,” Ms. Fu said. The U. S. military is vastly more powerful than China’s, as Ms. Fu noted. “Fundamentally, this is about the United States worrying that China could catch up and surpass the U. S. in its ability,” she said. “But in fact there is a still a huge gap in ability between the U. S. and China, which is still a developing country. ” To emphasize his intent to strengthen the American military, Mr. Trump visited the country’s new aircraft carrier this week. The Gerald R. Ford is a     floating fortress due to be commissioned this year and is the first in a new generation of supercarriers. The United States has 10   supercarriers. In contrast, China is building its first aircraft carrier, a   vessel, and has one refurbished carrier from Ukraine. Wang Xiangsui, a retired senior colonel in China’s Air Force who is now director of the Research Center of Strategic Issues at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said Mr. Trump’s plans to increase military spending were unlikely to prod China into following suit. “I don’t think China will be oversensitive about this,” he said. “Despite all the aggressive talk, no one wants a war,” Mr. Wang said. While the $54 billion increase sounds like a lot, he added, ”the Americans didn’t achieve anything after spending six trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan. ” China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, who visited Washington this week and met briefly with Mr. Trump at the White House, probably had the military budget on his mind as he tried to judge the mood of the new administration, said Dennis J. Blasko, an American expert on the Chinese military. “I’m guessing Yang Jiechi was tasked to make an assessment of the state of the bilateral relationship to see if there may need to be a   adjustment in reaction to the requested increase for the U. S. defense budget,” said Mr. Blasko, a retired army lieutenant colonel and the author of “The Chinese Army Today. ” Mr. Yang probably found the relationship to be on a sound enough footing, Mr. Blasko said. “I don’t think they want to get into a military budget fight with us, not even a rhetorical one. ” Ni Lexiong, a naval expert in Shanghai, said that if China really felt the need to spend more heavily on the military, it would not hesitate to do so. “If China felt threatened, I don’t think slower economic growth would stop them from spending more on the military,” Mr. Ni said. “You have seen how the Chinese were willing to starve to build an atomic bomb. We do not worry about poverty when we think a larger military is necessary. ” He said the new budget would allow China to keep modernizing its navy and air force, the two services currently getting the most attention. The navy launched 22 warships in 2016 to replace old ones, and the budget would let it keep up that pace this year, he said. “A chunk of the expenditure will go towards developing and manufacturing the latest weapons for a stronger air force and navy,” he said. “I believe this speed of replacement will continue, because it has been one of China’s   growth goals to build a military stronger than America’s one day, in either quality or quantity. ” While China’s future aircraft carriers are likely to be nuclear powered, the Chinese Navy will probably be focused on other, more important areas, said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the U. S. Naval War College in Rhode Island. “Chinese submarine development and the building of destroyers and frigates are likely more expensive and more consequential for the overall military balance,” he said. If Mr. Trump were to win his proposed increase of $54 billion, the American defense budget would be $603 billion, about 3 percent higher than under former President Barack Obama’s last budget plan. The People’s Liberation Army’s official budget was about $146 billion in 2016. Western groups that study the Chinese military say that actual spending is roughly 1. 2 to 1. 5 times greater than the announced figures. Using a rough estimate that assumes an average G. D. P. growth in China of 6. 5 percent and a U. S. growth rate of 3 percent, China’s military spending would be expected to surpass America’s around 2040, said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Among the issues that Chinese military planners must deal with is how to handle the retrenchment of 300, 000 personnel announced by President Xi Jinping in 2015, part of an effort to streamline the P. L. A. into a modern fighting force. Although most of those leaving the army are   to   officers and soldiers, the severance costs are expected to be substantial, retired Chinese officers said.",0
11840,Sioux Indians Wish Dakota Pipeline Protesters Would Go Home,"Sioux Indians Wish Dakota Pipeline Protesters Would Go Home October 30, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
The ecoloons protesting the Dakota pipeline have the support of the media and the White House. But many of the local Sioux don't see them as defenders. They just wish they would go home . 
Ask around and you'll hear stories of pipeline protesters who've traveled great distances. They've come from Japan, Russia and Germany. Australia, Israel and Serbia. And, of course, there are the allies, not exclusively Native American or indigenous, who've flocked here from all corners of the US. 
Demonstrating is their proud daily work. 
The obnoxious leftists of the world have united. And they want no pipelines or showers. 
No one makes this clearer than Robert Fool Bear Sr., 54, district chairman of Cannon Ball. The town he runs, estimated population of 840, is just a few miles from the action. It's so close that, given the faceoffs with law enforcement, you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it. 
It's about time people heard from folks like him, he says. 
Fool Bear has had it with the protesters. He says that more than two years ago, when members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known, they didn't care. Now, suddenly, the crowds are out of control, and he fears it's just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt. 
Go down to the camps, he says, and you won't see many Standing Rock Sioux. 
""It irks me. People are here from all over the world,"" he says. ""If they could come from other planets, I think they would."" 
And the Sioux are stuck helping leftist idiot protesters. 
Not long ago, he found three teenage girls from Ontario, Canada, camped out inside his storage shed. A white woman from Spokane, Washington, came to see him for help, saying she'd come here with nothing and her car had broken down. When he was at the casino recently, someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested. 
Even though Fool Bear is against the protests, that doesn't mean he's not preparing to help people out, too. He anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter, and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office. 
Those protesters from Arizona, Georgia and California won't know what hit them when the cold rushes in, he says. 
Instead of helping the Sioux, privileged leftists have become a burden for them to take care of.",0
11841,Press Secretary Affirms that Trump Believes Lie of Millions of Illegal Voters - The New York Times,"■ White House press secretary Sean Spicer stood by President Trump’s false assertion that millions of illegal voters gave Hillary Clinton her popular vote win. ■ Gag orders seem to be proliferating throughout the federal bureaucracy, but the national parks are taking to Twitter to speak up. ■ A new national security political action committee, assembled by former intelligence officers and national security officials, has begun posting “no spin” research on the president’s business interests abroad. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that President Trump has long believed that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in the 2016 election, furthering a false claim from the podium of the West Wing briefing room and refusing to rule out an investigation down the road. “He said 3 to 5 million people could have voted illegally, based on the studies that he’s seen,” Mr. Spicer told stunned reporters, acknowledging a statement that Mr. Trump made privately in a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday afternoon. Mr. Trump and his aides repeatedly suggested during the transition period that “irregularities” contributed to his   loss by nearly 3 million ballots to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump won the Electoral College, but his    popular vote loss to Mrs. Clinton was the largest for a winning presidential candidate since the disputed election of 1876. Democrats and some Republicans have pointed to that margin to claim that Mr. Trump is an illegitimate president. Such assertions have rankled Mr. Trump deeply. A November 2016 blog post on Infowars, the conspiracy   website run by radio host Alex Jones, posited the idea that roughly 3 million people voted illegally. Mr. Jones has hosted Mr. Trump on his radio show in the past. The assertion was based on tweets from a   voter expert, who claimed to have a study. However, there’s no evidence of the study. And officials in swing states where Mr. Trump secured victory, many of which are governed by Republicans, say that there is no evidence of such fraud. Mr. Spicer also made vague reference to another Pew Research Center study that supposedly backed up Mr. Trump, but the author of the study in question, David Becker, now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, tweeted again that no such fraud happened. When a reporter pointed out to Mr. Spicer that such widespread fraud would be one of the biggest scandals in American electoral history and asked why the administration isn’t investigating, the press secretary said, “Maybe we will. ” Mr. Spicer, who worked at the Republican National Committee before working for Mr. Trump, declined to say whether he personally believes this claim. “What does it mean for democracy?” a reporter asked about Mr. Trump’s belief. “It means that I’ve answered your question,” Mr. Spicer said. With reports proliferating about executive branch agencies under gag orders, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the White House is “looking into it,” though he didn’t exactly deny it. “I don’t think it’s any surprise that when there’s an administration turnover, that we’re going to review the policies,” he said. It started when the National Park Service retweeted crowd shots this weekend attesting to a smaller audience for President Trump’s inauguration than for Barack Obama’s first in 2009. That prompted a blackout, then an apology, then lots of pretty pictures. “They had inappropriately violated their own social media policies,” Mr. Spicer said. “There was guidance that was put out to the department to act in compliance with the rules that were set forth. ” Well, looks like Badlands National Park has gone rogue. But it looks like    out there. Poor man wanna be rich. Rich man wanna be king. And a king ain’t satisfied, Till he rules everything. “Badlands,” Bruce Springsteen Daring Mr. Trump to make good on his grand infrastructure promises, Senate Democrats on Tuesday will unveil a   plan to rebuild the nation’s roads, railways, airports, waterways and sewer systems over 10 years. “From our largest cities to our smallest towns, communities across the country are struggling to meet the challenges of aging infrastructure,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, will say. “Our urban and rural communities have their own unique set of infrastructure priorities, and this proposal would provide funding to address those needed upgrades that go beyond the traditional road and bridge repair. ” Republicans resisted President Barack Obama’s push for an infrastructure “surge” for eight years, arguing that the federal government couldn’t afford it and that state and local governments should shoulder more responsibility for improvements. But Mr. Trump has taken up the Democratic cause. “We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation,” he vowed in his Inaugural Address. The plan dedicates $180 billion to rail and bus systems, $65 billion to ports, airports and waterways, $110 billion for water and sewer systems, $100 billion for energy infrastructure, and $20 billion for public and tribal lands. “We’re asking President Trump to work with us to make it a reality,” Mr. Schumer will say. Next up from the Trump White House news fire hose: a nominee for the Supreme Court. President Trump has invited Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, as well as both the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to the White House at 3 p. m. Tuesday to discuss the nearly   vacancy on the Supreme Court. The president said a nomination would be announced next week. “We will pick a totally great Supreme Court justice,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the end of an event where he signed executive actions. Mr. McConnell, on the Senate floor Tuesday, said, “I appreciate the president soliciting our advice on this important matter. ” Mr. McConnell blocked consideration of any nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February, during the final year of President Obama’s term. Former intelligence officers and national security officials have formed a new national security political action committee, called 4DPac (Democracy Development Diplomacy Defense) to publish what they call   research on Mr. Trump’s foreign investments. Their concern: that the president’s business dealings could clash with the nation’s national security interests. Their first targets: India and Turkey, with many more to come. White House aides have been trying to nudge the president to ditch his personal Twitter account and use the official @POTUS handle. After all, presidential communications are supposed to be archived and preserved under specific rules. Think Hillary Clinton’s private server, not something Mr. Trump appeared to approve of during the campaign. It’s not working. He started the day with: He continued with: (That one has the peculiarity of misstating the date of Mr. Trump’s inauguration.) And he has kept going. #MAGA! House and Senate Republicans decamp from Washington on Thursday for their annual retreat  —   this time in Philadelphia. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made it official: President Trump will be the guest of honor. Despite a rocky start to their relationship, Walter M. Shaub Jr. the head of the Office of Government Ethics, is apparently still “willing and ready” to help Mr. Trump handle his potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Shaub met with members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a   session on Monday afternoon at the request of the chairman of the panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. After Mr. Shaub publicly criticized Mr. Trump’s plans this month, Mr. Chaffetz accused him of playing politics  —   prompting Democrats and other watchdogs to come to the ethics monitor’s defense. According to a recap of Monday’s meeting by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, Mr. Shaub said that his office had not received copies of documents that Mr. Trump referenced at a news conference on Jan. 11, and that it had been provided with no new information. Still, Mr. Shaub said he would help the president, if called upon. There were about nine members of the committee at the meeting  —   eight Democrats and Mr. Chaffetz, according to his spokeswoman, M. J. Henshaw. After Mr. Chaffetz left the meeting with Mr. Shaub, he told reporters: “I think we understand each other better. ” Big Labor may have been With Her, but the unions that represent builders and pavers Love Him. “We have a common bond with the president,” said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, after meeting on Monday with Mr. Trump and hearing him promise a major push to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. “We come from the same industry. He understands the value of driving development, moving people to the middle class. ” If the labor movement divides over Mr. Trump, it would not be the first time. An old saying holds that the building trades would pave over their mothers’ graves if it created jobs. And before Mr. Trump’s rise, unions like the Communications Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union had split with the building unions over the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, with the former siding with liberal environmentalists and the latter seeing opportunities for work. In this case, the unions may unite with Democrats behind the new president  —   leaving Republican spending hawks in the cold. On his first working day as the country’s new secretary of defense, James N. Mattis spoke with the head of NATO and told him that the United States depends on it and on Europe for   security. The telephone conversation came just a week after Mr. Mattis’s boss, Mr. Trump, called NATO “obsolete,” because, Mr. Trump said, the alliance hasn’t done enough to combat terrorism. Mr. Mattis “wanted to place the call on his first full day in office to reinforce the importance he places on the alliance,” a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, said in a statement on Monday night.",0

11843,Travelers Stranded and Protests Swell Over Trump Order - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump’s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president’s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president’s team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. “We’re not willing to be wrong on this subject,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. ” The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. “To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” he said in a written statement. “This is not about religion  —   this is about terror and keeping our country safe. ” He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama’s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. “We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,” he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in Syria. “I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,” he said. “My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. ” While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from   nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. “Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,” he wrote. “We cannot allow this horror to continue!” His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York’s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was “in compliance with judicial orders. ” Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and “they said we’ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,” Mr. Connolly said. “I said that’s not acceptable,” he continued. “We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That’s where the problem is, and that’s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. ” The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to “claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. ” The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   Worth Airport. “We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,” he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America’s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she “is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. ” Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did “not agree with this kind of approach. ” The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump’s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. “Shame,” they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie “Finding Dory. ” “No hate, no fear,” they added later. “Refugees are welcome here. ” Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. “This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. “That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. ” Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump’s handling of the issue. “We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,” said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs’ donor network. “The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. ” Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was “poorly implemented” and urged the president to “make appropriate revisions. ” Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. “They are sadly weak on immigration,” he wrote. “Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. ”",0
11844,Militarized Police Raid Peaceful Standing Rock Protest to Enforce Corporate Dream,"Waking Times 
Today, the government has returned in force, in multiple busses brimming with militarized police and tactical weaponry, all for some peaceful non-violent protesters. Arrests have already begun at the “front-line camp,” a no-fly zone has been instituted, and cell and internet coverage have been shut-down; all the more reason to question the legitimacy of this pipeline and the people from whom the land is being taken , as clearly the desire is to have as little coverage of this as possible. 
Ask yourself why, despite the national outcry against the DAPL and others like it, and virtually zero support save for corporate and governmental entities, the US government is unfaltering in its push to accomplish this environmentally damaging, unconstitutional defiling of land that will put to risk, not only multiple states’ well-being, but desecrate sacred Native-American land. It’s not enough that this entire nation is built on the robbery of land from an entire race of people, but it appears the government has returned to finish the job. 
Now this may seem sensationalist to many, but for those who have been following the story in North Dakota, the level of totalitarian police state control that is being witnessed is staggering. From stars such as Shailene Woodley being singled out from thousands involved and arrested for simply participating in a peaceful protest(as if to make a clear point to other famous Americans with a conscious), to children and senior citizens getting attacked and treated like criminals for attempting to stand, in a non-violent fashion, and fight for their rights as Americans; the original ones at that. Journalists are even getting arrested and charged just for trying to cover this extremely relevant story . 
After being outlasted and outmanned, the government had recently chosen to leave the scene, claiming a lack of man-power to remove the protesters. This left many to hope that they might have come to their senses and realized that this level of resistance and this type of national story wasn’t worth it; or that the government realized that they should be fulfilling the will of the people and not fighting for some faceless corporate entity … but those wishful thinkers clearly didn’t realize how dedicated the US government is to maintaining its symbiotic relationship with its corporate sponsors , and its unwavering ability to disregard the Constitution when it suits their needs. 
Aside from the obvious constitutional violations, one must consider that the leaking and spilling of these pipelines in the surrounding areas, is a common occurrence . If recent years have shown us anything, it’s that environmental catastrophes such as these are the rule, not the exception. It has become so common place that these corporate giants can devastate the Amazon with a massive oil spill , and it does not even make the evening news . 
What many don’t know, is that the clean-up associated with a spill from one of these pipelines, or from a tanker for instance, is massive business, and creates millions in profit for those involved . Connections between the oil companies and the groups hired to conduct the oil clean-up are quite apparent, but with the infectious nature of corporate influence today, these companies no doubt have clear connections with just about every one of relevance. That being said, the mutually beneficial partnership that exists in this dynamic is nonetheless alarming. BP makes enough in under a week to cover much of the costs that go along with such an intensive clean up. In an article by Think Progress , they outline this absurdity following the Gulf spill : 
For now, at least, BP’s prodigious costs combating the oil spill in the Gulf are outweighed by prodigious profits. 
On Monday , BP said it spent $350 million in the first 20 days of the spill response, about $17.5 million a day. It has paid 295 of the 4,700 claims received, for a total of $3.5 million. By contrast, in the first quarter of the year, the London-based oil giant’s profits averaged $93 million a day. 
The amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico has been estimated at 5,000 to 25,000 barrels a day. In the first quarter, BP produced 2.5 million barrels of crude oil a day worldwide — and it received $71.86 for every barrel. 
When confronted with the astounding level of profit that these oil companies make in a given day, it is very clear that, to them, the losses taken were inconsequential, which gives them all the more motivation to play it fast and loose next time around. It is also clear that they make enough money to spend more to ensure this simply no longer happens if they truly wanted to, yet, they instead choose to play chicken with the world’s ecosystem, as the US government seems to have no problem turning a blind eye when it pertains to any such industry. 
The continual profit being made by cutting corners and forgoing precautions, due to their lack of concern of actually being held accountable, surpasses the minuscule cost to them of hiring their clean-up company, from which they no doubt receive some sort of kickback and most likely have on speed dial. “At $93 million a day in profits, BP makes $350 million in about 3.8 days. The Washington Post noted that Exxon, through a decision by the Supreme Court, was able to pay only $507.5 million of the original $5 billion in punitive damages that it had been assessed for the 1989 Valdez disaster.” So even when being “held accountable,” if you can call it that, these monolithic companies get let off with a proverbial “slap on the wrist” when considering the amount of profit they generate in a given year. 
Some would even go as far as to make the claim that companies will intentionally create circumstances that make these type of disasters more of a possibility, just to create an artificial demand, hire their go-to clean-up company, and start the process all over again. And many are unaware that deliberate discharges from oil tankers have traditionally been the biggest source of oil pollution from ships, greater than the accidental spills by far, and they are common-practice. So either way, this entire industry is one big environmental disaster that continues to grow with dependence upon it. 
These pipelines, such as the one being forced upon the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota, are put in as quickly as possible by the lowest bidder with little to no concern for the preservation of the local lands. The only motivation given to the locals, if any, is that there will be an increase in jobs from the pipeline(while being built), but that is hardly worth the environmental destabilization of ones homeland. This does not even take into consideration the detrimental effects of the drilling and construction work alone, but that aside, one single leak can cause generations of problems, that in many cases will never be recovered, such as an endangered species . Yet sadly, this country has all but forgotten about the damaging effects its industry can have on our co-inhabitants of this planet. 
As this atrocity continues in the face of public resistance and nationwide protest, ask yourself if this feels like the democracy politicians so fervently claim we have (even though it should be a republic), or the freedom we are continually told the world begrudges us. Ask yourself if the will of the people ever truly dictates the path of the United States, or if that is simply what we are told. About the Author

11845,White House Staff begins baby proofing measures in preparation for president Trump,"Thursday, 10 November 2016 ""My White House will be the best White House ever. I have all the best white houses."" 
The White House staff was in full swing as measures are put in place in expectation of the needs of incumbent president Trump. 
""The first thing we did was put baby proof door knobs on all of the military related areas,"" stated Denis Richard McDonough. ""We put an extra baby lock on ""the button"", McDouough explained further. ""It is our understanding that he has exceedingly short fingers and a quick temper, so our hope is that he'll get frustrated and walk away mad like most children would after a couple of unsuccessful attempts to access it."" 
Some other measures taking place are plastic coverings being placed on all historical furniture in the event of any ""spillage"" during one of the president's private meetings with female visitors. All attractive women on staff will also be fitted with hockey masks in the event that the president isn't able to control his lips in their presence. 
Some other upgrades include all signage will be changed to extra large print and throne shaped chair lifts will be installed on all stairs to replicate the 70 year old's current comfort level at Trump Tower. 
There is also talk of adding 5 new members to the grooming staff to reduce the amount of time it takes for Trump to comb his hair from three hours down to something more manageable for the hectic schedule of the president of the United States. 
""Overall, our transition is going quite smoothly,"" McDonough said, ""now, all we have to do is determine which rooms we can configure to house Trump TV and its staff. It will be a first for our country to have an in-house broadcast network right inside the White House. I'm sure this level of access will only further the American people's understanding of the inner workings of our government."" 
It was unclear if having to compete with a private TV network owned by the president would affect access of other competing news organizations. ""Most people just probably assume they'll make stuff up just like they did during the past election cycle."" offered one staff member. 
Some other firsts appear to be the addition of stripper poles and a rotating zebra print circular bed in the oval office, and portraits of former Presidents being replaced by advertisements for Trump University and many of the incumbent president's other business ventures. 
""We are trying to advise against replacing the Roosevelt Chandelier with a disco ball, but the incoming family does have a certain amount of leeway when it comes to White House decor,"" the exasperated Chief of Staff explained. ""Although, we did had to flatly dent the request for each Trump family member to have their own new White House constructed."" 
One staffer summed the experience up best, ""I think it makes sense on a metaphorical level. The American people clearly wanted the government tore up, and that's exactly what Mr. Trump is doing to the White House."" Make StubbornGorilla's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

11848,"Inside Hillary Clinton’s Outrage Machine, Allies Push the Buttons - The New York Times","Just before 9:30 p. m. on Sept. 13, the first Twitter post appeared, directing users to an obscure article about a remark Donald J. Trump had made last year that 50 percent of the country did not want to work. Over the next 48 hours, 1, 819 people, seemingly furious that the news media had paid more attention to Hillary Clinton’s assertion that half of Trump supporters fit into a “basket of deplorables,” lashed out at reporters and news outlets. “Dear Media: If you don’t cover this, you’re covering for him, #Trump50percent,” wrote one Twitter user. “@CNN @CNNPolitics have been in bed with #Trump for a year! They refuse to report #TrumpScandals #Trump50percent” wrote another. By the end of the week, the hashtag #Trump50percent had appeared in Twitter timelines more than 30, 000 times. Other liberal Twitter users, some of them with more than a million followers, linked to the article and spread the same complaint the Clinton campaign had made: that a shameful false equivalence was causing the media to   Mr. Trump’s many transgressions and overplay the few it could find on Mrs. Clinton. At first glance, the Clintonian grass roots seemed to have organically sprouted in anger. But closer inspection yielded traces of   that led to the sixth floor of a building in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan. There, surrounded by   tech companies, “Star Wars” posters and   televisions fixed on cable news, Peter Daou sat with his team at a long wooden table last week, pushing the buttons that activate Mrs. Clinton’s outrage machine. Mr. Daou’s operation, called Shareblue, had published the article on Mr. Trump’s comment on its website and created the accompanying hashtag. “They will put that pressure right on the media outlets in a very intense way,” Mr. Daou, the chief executive of Shareblue, said of the Twitter army he had galvanized. “By the thousands. ” In the sprawling Clinton body politic, Shareblue is the finger that wags at the mainstream news media (“R. I. P. Political Journalism ( )”) or pokes at individual reporters. It is a minor appendage, but in an increasingly close race for the presidency, it plays its part. And it is already warming up for the biggest event of the general election so far: the first debate, on Monday night. It has already published a piece calling on moderators to   Mr. Trump on the spot, and will continue through debate night, whipping up support online with the hashtag #DemandFairDebates. Shareblue is owned by David Brock, the onetime Clinton critic who remade himself into a Clinton supporter and architect of a conglomerate of organizations designed, he said, to be the liberal answer to the conservative messaging of Fox News. The Brock network includes his Media Matters for America watchdog website two   “super PACs,” the opposition research outfit American Bridge and the     and   operation Correct the Record and Shareblue, which filled the need, Mr. Brock said, for a progressive outlet that spoke directly to the grass roots and which “was avidly and unabashedly  . ” Shareblue’s    content is exposing what it considers to be news coverage stacked against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Daou was particularly excited about a project seeking to show that Mrs. Clinton’s email travails had been in the news every day since the story originally broke in March 2015. Often, their editorial direction seems in sync with the Clinton campaign, which has instructed its surrogates to blame news coverage for negative press. “Are they going to hold Hillary to a different standard again?” read one recent “talking points” memo sent by the campaign to its surrogates. That approach became clear this month. On Sept. 1, The Washington Post broke a story about the Donald J. Trump Foundation being fined for improperly donating $25, 000 to Pam Bondi, the attorney general of Florida, around the time that her office was deciding whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. The next day, the Clinton campaign put out a statement contending that while the news media had an unhealthy obsession with the Clinton Foundation, Mr. Trump’s charity had been caught in an “actual    scandal. ” The Clinton campaign’s foreign policy spokesman, Jesse Lehrich, wrote on Twitter: “Awaiting outrage. ” He didn’t have to wait long. Mr. Daou and his website incessantly demanded coverage of the Trump Foundation story. “We just have to start the fire,” Mr. Daou said in an interview last week. Many liberal columnists, Democratic operatives and members of the Media Matters family reached the same conclusion, excoriating news outlets and individuals for grading Mr. Trump “on a curve. ” Whether it truly cleared the air about Mr. Trump’s foundation or merely muddied the water about Mrs. Clinton’s, Mr. Daou took credit for injecting the notion of false equivalence into the social media bloodstream and for forcing some news outlets to adjust their coverage. “  people are now talking about the double standard in coverage,” Mr. Daou said. “We feel we were way ahead of the curve. ” Mr. Brock recruited Mr. Daou to join what was then called Blue Nation Review (it relaunched as Shareblue this month) during a breakfast at the Regency Hotel in New York in November. Mr. Daou grew up in Lebanon and spent the ’90s working in dance music with his first wife as part of a group called The Daou, which put the words of his aunt, the novelist Erica Jong, to music. He then worked as a producer and keyboardist for Björk and other musicians. In the 2000s, Mr. Daou broke into progressive blogging and claimed to have helped found The Huffington Post. His suit accusing the company of denying him appropriate credit and compensation was settled in 2014. He also worked directly in politics, first for John Kerry in 2004 and then for Mrs. Clinton in 2008, leading her digital operation. Beyond creating a boisterous echo chamber, the real metric of success for Shareblue, which Mr. Brock said has a budget of $2 million supplied by his political donors, is getting Mrs. Clinton elected. Mr. Daou’s role is deploying a band of committed, outraged followers to harangue Mrs. Clinton’s opponents. “The pond scum of American politics,” is how Tad Devine, a senior strategist to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, described the website in March for its frequent attacks on Mr. Sanders. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, viewed Shareblue more as a necessary voice in a world teeming with conservative radio, television and internet outlets that fire up the Republican base. “On the left, frankly, having more of that is not a bad thing,” Mr. Merrill said. Of Mr. Daou, he added, “He has a great sense of what’s moving around and where in the depths of the Twittersphere. ” Just how much Mr. Daou coordinates his efforts with the Clinton campaign is hard to pinpoint. The campaign said there was no formal coordination with Shareblue, and Mr. Daou said he did not take any direction from the campaign. “Now do I communicate with them regularly? I do,” Mr. Daou said, noting that because of his years working for Mrs. Clinton, “half the people on that campaign, if not more, are former colleagues and friends. ” He added that when one of their stories takes off, “I’ll let them know, ‘Hey check out what we just posted, it looks like a good angle. ’” Mr. Brock said his Correct the Record PAC talked to the Clinton campaign. But as for his Shareblue operation, he said: “There are people in the campaign who are aware of what we are doing and who have been encouraging about what we are doing. I wouldn’t go further than that. ” While Mr. Daou, the pianist, can accompany the larger Clinton ensemble, he can also step forward as a soloist when need be. When video of Mrs. Clinton falling ill on Sept. 11 exploded in the news media, the campaign, which had at first said she overheated, apologized for not revealing her diagnosis of pneumonia beforehand. Correct the Record went virtually dark. “It was waiting for guidance from the campaign,” Mr. Brock explained. But Mr. Daou quickly started defending Mrs. Clinton from critics on Twitter (“They should be ashamed”) and that evening posted an article on Shareblue about Mrs. Clinton’s grit, headlined “Hillary Clinton’s feat of strength obliterates months of health conspiracies. ” It was roundly mocked as a blatant example of   spin. But two days later, the Clinton campaign distributed another memo of talking points to its surrogates using her near collapse as an opportunity to talk about her stamina. “To anyone who knows Hillary,” read the first bullet point, “it does not come as much of a surprise that even when she’s under the weather, she would want to power through her normal schedule. ”",0
11849,Stephen Bannon Reassures Conservatives Uneasy About Trump - The New York Times,"OXON HILL, Md.  —   In an administration hardly five weeks old, Stephen K. Bannon’s reputation has taken on almost mythic proportion as a   populist, emerging power center, man of mystery. When Mr. Bannon, President Trump’s chief strategist, appeared in public on Thursday for the first time since the president was sworn in, it was to deliver, in his own combative way, a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activists gathered here for their annual assessment known as the Conservative Political Action Conference. Do not believe the “corporatist globalist media” that was “crying and weeping” on election night and is still “dead wrong” about what the Trump administration is doing. Inside the White House, Mr. Bannon said, everything is going according to plan. The “deconstruction of the administrative state” has just begun. Appearing with Reince Priebus, the president’s chief of staff, he joked about how well the two get along despite the friction that had always existed between them. “I can run a little hot on occasion,” Mr. Bannon said, complimenting Mr. Priebus’s equanimity. And he urged a ballroom full of activists to stick together against the forces that were trying to tear them apart. “Whether you’re a populist, whether you’re a   conservative, whether you’re a libertarian, whether you’re an economic nationalist,” he said, “we want you to have our back. ” Despite Mr. Bannon’s assurances, a simmering unease remains among conservatives over whether Mr. Trump will honor his promises to them, given that he was not part of their movement  —   or any political movement, for that matter  —   until very recently. Not too many years ago CPAC almost denied Mr. Trump a speaking slot because it feared he only wanted to promote himself. As for Mr. Bannon, he was essentially banished from the premises when he was running Breitbart News. So Mr. Bannon started a  rival conference at a hotel down the street and called it The Uninvited. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, acknowledged the discomfort that comes with any hostile party takeover when she addressed the meeting. Mr. Trump, she said, had to uproot the political system. “Every great movement ends up being a little bit sclerotic and dusty after a time,” she said. She predicted that CPAC would wholly embrace the new president. “Well, I think by tomorrow this will be TPAC,” she said. Part of what has been so problematic in Mr. Trump’s first month is that the disruption he promised to unleash on the federal bureaucracy so far seems to be occurring in the wrong place: his administration, which has been rife with infighting and rattled by early missteps. The destructive forces that Mr. Bannon and other conservatives complain about can sometimes come from within. Mr. Trump’s first nominee for labor secretary withdrew after allegations of domestic abuse and revelations that he had employed an undocumented immigrant he did not pay taxes on. His hastily carried out executive order barring refugees and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has been tangled up in the courts and blocked from going into effect. He fired his national security adviser. And questions of how closely members of his inner circle may have worked with the Russians to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s campaign continue to attract interest from investigators. “Disruption is a good thing,” said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC. Still, he acknowledged, “on some days they do it better than others. ” There is another lens through which to see the disorder that has characterized this White House, Mr. Trump and his supporters say. And that is to understand that the president’s enemies  —   especially in the news media  —   want to distort his actions, exaggerate his mistakes and not discuss issues like safety and unemployment that are on the minds of his supporters. Gov. Matt Bevin, Republican of Kentucky, said he was appalled by the “unbelievable incessant focus on the most mindless things,” with regard to how the president is portrayed in the news media. “Let’s talk about crime rates. Let’s talk about economic viability. Let’s talk about joblessness,” Mr. Bevin added. “Let’s focus on things that matter and stop being so   and titillated by idiocy. ” Ms. Conway said the stories of disarray in the White House, including recent accounts that she has been sidelined lately, were nothing more than tiresome palace intrigue. And without naming names, she said the attacks directed at her were really desperate attacks against the president by political enemies still sore about the election. “To try to remove me from the equation would remove one of his voices and one of his trusted aides. And that would be hurtful to him,” she said. “They didn’t see this coming. They weren’t prepared for this result  —   even though they all ran around and said: ‘We’re a divided country! We’re a divided country! ’” It was not as if the support for Mr. Trump, who will speak to the conference Friday morning, is not enthusiastic. “I always said he’s not a stupid man. And if he has the right people around him he’s going to do the right thing,” said Daniel Cirucci of Cherry Hill, N. J. who was standing in line on Thursday evening to listen to Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative he said he deeply admired. “I think he realizes the enormity of the job,” Mr. Cirucci added. “Now does that mean Trump is going to stop being Trump? No. ” These should be good times for conservatives  —   and much of the time they are. They control not just the White House but both houses of Congress and appear on the verge of regaining a majority on the Supreme Court. They have not dominated so many state governments in close to a century. But part of the subtext of CPAC this year has been how conservative leaders are trying to smooth out the rougher edges of their movement, not all of which involve Mr. Trump. Because of the association that a fringe element of Trump supporters has with white nationalists, the CPAC organizers held a panel discussion on Thursday to signal their strong disapproval. Its title: The   Ain’t Right at All. Yet after the panel was over, the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer stood in the hall just off the main stage and declared himself a conservative. “I’m a conservative in a deep sense, in a sense that I care about people and defending a culture. ” And the organizers had to cancel a planned speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart editor and Trump supporter who has a history of insulting Jews, Muslims,   and other minorities, after a tape surfaced in which he condoned sex with boys as young as 13. The projections of placidity inside CPAC tried to mask how fractious the movement remains. Yet optimists were not hard to find. Mr. Pence said the Trump victory has given conservatives “the most important time in the history of our movement. ” “My friends, this is our time,” he told the conference Thursday night. “This is the time to prove again that our answers are the right answers for America. ” In his brief remarks, Mr. Bannon ended on a conciliatory note. He insisted that conservatives all had more in common than most people realized. “We have wide and sometimes divergent opinions,” he said. But the core of what conservatives believe is “that we’re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders  —   that we’re a nation with a culture and a reason for being. “And I think that’s what unites us,” he added. “And I think that’s what’s going to unite this movement going forward. ”",0
11850,"Putin, Admired by Donald Trump, Emphasizes Strength as Virtue - The New York Times","MOSCOW  —   Tiger shooter,   horseman and architect of Russia’s revival as a muscular global power, President Vladimir V. Putin, dressed in a somber suit and tie, sat for over an hour this past week sipping tea from a delicate porcelain cup and offering earnest advice on how to improve housing, medical care and other services in a provincial town south of here. State television broadcast the entire encounter, in between reports of Russian airstrikes in Syria ordered by Mr. Putin and gleeful accounts of how, thanks to a stunt by a   athlete, the Russian flag appeared during the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro despite a ban on the Russian squad because of a doping scandal. It was, in the span of just a few hours, a dizzying display of the political mastery that Mr. Putin has over his country and his own image  —   a tough,   warrior caring father of his people and guarantor that no slight to Russia’s pride will go unanswered. Mr. Putin, 63, has shown an extraordinary ability to project an image of towering strength no matter what the circumstances. When he first took power, an old schoolteacher of his in St. Petersburg, Vera Malishkina, remembered her former pupil, who is below average height, as a superb basketball player because he was “very tall. ” He has many critics, many of them now in exile outside Russia or voiceless outside the coffee shops and wine bars of cosmopolitan cities like Moscow. But as Donald J. Trump said with admiration: Mr. Putin has “very strong control” over Russia. According to Mr. Trump, the Republican Party’s presidential nominee, “He has been a leader far more than our leader. ” The beauty of that is largely in the eye of the beholder, and is certainly lost on Mr. Putin’s Russian opponents. “Vladimir Putin is a strong leader in the same way that arsenic is a strong drink,” Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion and a fierce critic of the Russian president, said in a Facebook post. “Praising a brutal K. G. B. dictator, especially as preferable to a democratically elected U. S. president, whether you like Obama or hate him, is despicable and dangerous. ” But what, aside from his undeniable skill at rallying the support of the Russian public, has made Mr. Putin such a potent figure, giving him a growing band of admirers like Mr. Trump and any number of   populist leaders scattered across Europe? Mr. Putin has annexed Crimea, stirred up and armed a   rebellion in eastern Ukraine, turned a once vibrant Russian news media into an echo chamber, and restored Moscow as an indispensable player on the world stage, by turns a peacemaker and troublemaker. His peacemaking was at the fore early on Saturday when Russia and the United States agreed in Geneva to a new plan to curb violence in the Syrian conflict, in which Washington and Moscow back opposite sides but share a desire to destroy the Islamic State. Judged by many of the yardsticks of success he set before his first presidential race in March 2000, however, Mr. Putin has often faltered. He has cut down to size or driven into exile some of the   oligarchs who made billions in murky deals under President Boris N. Yeltsin in the 1990s. But far from eliminating “oligarchs as a class” as he promised, he has created a new class of business moguls who still enjoy sweet insider deals and whose only real difference with those who thrived under Mr. Yeltsin is that they do not dare challenge the Kremlin. Mr. Putin’s economic record has also been mixed to poor. The economy grew rapidly during his first two terms as president, from 2000 to 2008  —   about 8 percent annually, on average, thanks largely to soaring prices for energy, of which Russia is a major exporter. But it developed none of the diversity beyond oil and gas or freedom from corruption that Mr. Putin repeatedly promised. And with oil prices now below $50 a barrel, half what they were in 2014 and far off their peak of $145 in 2008, the economy is in the doldrums. It perked up slightly in June but has declined over all by nearly 1 percent since the start of the year. That is better than the decline of 3. 7 percent last year but still a threat to what had been Mr. Putin’s contract with his people: rising prosperity in return for obedience. With the economy on the ropes, the Kremlin has turned increasingly to foreign affairs to keep Mr. Putin’s popularity at levels that would delight any Western leader. His ratings soared after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which unleashed a wave of patriotic fervor across Russia  —   and caused more economic pain as the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions. The military interventions in Syria to prop up President Bashar   have been accompanied by a drumbeat of reports on state television celebrating Russia’s role as a key power without which no military or political knot can be untied. This has reinforced his status at home, but also a deep wariness of his intentions among mainstream political leaders abroad. He has inserted Russia not only into Syria but also into the even more intractable   conflict, with Russian diplomats working frantically to organize a meeting in Moscow between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. “It is important for Putin to drive home the message, especially to the U. S. that Russia is a global power,” said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Moscow Carnegie Center, a research group, and an expert on Russian foreign policy. Mr. Putin, he said, was “incensed” in 2014 when President Obama dismissed Russia as a “regional power. ” Eager to show that Mr. Obama underestimated Russia’s reach, Mr. Putin has since embarked on a whirlwind of diplomatic activity across the Middle East and in Asia, asserting Moscow’s role far beyond the narrow confines of the former Soviet Union. “You can criticize Russia for anything, but if you belittle Russia, that is a crime,” Mr. Trenin said. That Russia is now a power to be reckoned with is a message drummed home relentlessly on television. Under President Yeltsin, television had a wide array of state and private channels offering a cacophony of views, but now it is largely   and entirely on message with the Kremlin. “We interpret freedom of expression in different ways,” Mr. Putin told three Russian journalists who were writing a book to burnish his image before the 2000 presidential election, when he was a   former K. G. B. officer. One of those journalists, Nataliya Gevorkyan, has since been beaten up twice by unidentified assailants in Moscow, and her old and once freewheeling newspaper, Kommersant, was taken over by a   businessman. Effectively barred from publishing in Russia, she lives mostly in France. While never a fan of Mr. Putin  —   “I was sure a guy who served in the K. G. B. should never be president”  —   Ms. Gevorkyan granted the Russian president one indisputable asset, one that appalls Moscow intellectuals but enthralls admirers like Mr. Trump: “People elected him. ” “He is popular. Maybe not 86 percent, but definitely more than 50 percent,” she continued. “That is democracy. I really don’t know about democracy anymore. ” Mr. Putin’s ratings are certainly far higher than those of Mr. Obama, and Mr. Putin should easily win the next presidential election in 2018 if he runs. But the authorities are taking no chances. In the latest strike in a sustained campaign to shut down or at least tame alternative sources of information, Russia’s Justice Ministry recently announced that it would place the Levada Center, an independent and highly respected national pollster, on its official register of organizations “operating as foreign agents,” a listing that the center said would cripple its work. The decision to brand the country’s most reliable polling organization as an alien force followed the release of an opinion survey that showed declining support for Mr. Putin’s United Russia Party ahead of elections for Parliament on Sept. 18. Mr. Putin’s popularity, said Peter Kreko of the Political Capital Institute, a research group in Budapest, has made him a seductive figure for Western politicians and electors, who often pine for decisive action and a more secure world, free from the uncertainties created by immigration, insecurity and economic globalization. “All Western politicians that define themselves as out of the mainstream tend to have positive views of Russia and Putin,” he said. “They regard the Putin regime as   contrary to the hesitant democratic and sometimes incompetent and paralyzed systems in their own countries. ” This efficiency, Mr. Kreko added, is mostly a myth but is widely believed. “We used to think that because of pluralist media, checks and balances, and globalization that people could not be brainwashed,” he said, “but what we see in Russia and also Hungary is that people can be brainwashed. ”",0
11851,"After Sweeping Election, First Thing Trump Invites Netanyahu to U.S. for Meeting","Field of Valor in Orange waves thank-you to veterans ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. After Sweeping Election, First Thing Trump Invites Netanyahu to U.S. for Meeting By VNN on November 9, 2016 To Hell With Detroit or New Orleans, Trump Calls ISRAEL to Pay Hommage to Masters! 
After sweeping the election on Tuesday, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. for a meeting. 
The two spoke on the phone on Wednesday hours after Netanyahu congratulated Trump on his surprising win, saying Trump was a “true friend of Israel.” According to a statement by Netanyahu, during their phone call, the two agreed to meet at the “first opportunity.” 
Following the election results, Netanyahu published a statement congratulating Trump, saying: “President-elect Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel. We will work together to advance the security, stability and peace in our region. The strong connection between the United States and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared destiny. 
“I’m certain that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the United States, and bring it to new heights,” he added. 
This after it was disclosed earlier this month that Donald Trump was paid $ 25 million by Israeli Firster Zionist Billionaire Sheldon Adelson who fronts for AIPAC and the Zionist State. 
President Reuven Rivlin also congratulated Trump. 
“I want to congratulate President elect Donald Trump, his family, and all the American people who have once again shown the world it is the greatest democracy.” 
“I hope together Israelis and Americans can grow our innovation and cooperation, which are the fruits of liberty, and equality. God bless you, Mr. President,” Rivlin added. 
Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Zionist Union) congratulated Trump on Facebook: “Warm wishes to the president of the strongest and biggest global power: Donald J. Trump!” 
Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett, meanwhile, hoped Trump’s election would bring an end to the two-state solution. 
“Trump’s victory is a tremendous opportunity for Israel to immediately announce its intention to renege on the idea of establishing Palestine in the heart of the country – a direct blow to our security and the justice of our cause. 
“This is the president-elect’s outlook as it appears in his platform, and that definitely should be our way. Salient, simple and clear. The era of the Palestinian state is over.”",0
11852,Health Bill’s Failure Leaves Supporters in a Political Jam Back Home - The New York Times,"They went to unusual, even dangerous lengths to support President Trump’s unpopular health care bill, facing down protesters at home and begging for special accommodation from House leaders in Washington. John Faso of New York negotiated a side deal for his state in exchange for backing it. Mike Coffman was the lone Colorado lawmaker to endorse the bill, while his Republican neighbors agonized and stalled. But with the collapse of the legislation on Friday, such Republican representatives now have nothing to show for their trouble. They ventured far out on a political limb, only to watch it disintegrate behind them. And when they run for   next year, they may have to defend their support for a politically explosive bill that many Republicans backed only reluctantly, and that never came close to reaching the president’s desk. The fiasco in Washington is already rippling at home: Back in their districts, there are early signs of backlash against these lawmakers, including from constituents who voted Republican last November. Many voters’ complaints echo the criticism they leveled against the passage of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare: that it was passed too quickly, with too many   deals and too much potential to destabilize the insurance system. Even voters supportive of Mr. Trump said the process had unfolded in a slapdash way, without sufficient attention to explaining the bill to people whom it might affect directly. At the Kings Valley Diner in Mr. Faso’s district, stretching across the Catskills and north past Albany, the congressman won some harsh reviews. He had at first hesitated over the health care proposal, which the Congressional Budget Office projected would lead to 24 million fewer people having health insurance over a decade. But Republican leaders pursuing Mr. Faso shifted the cost of Medicaid programs away from upstate counties like the ones he represents, and he backed the bill days before it fell apart. “Faso played that whole thing like an idiot, to be frank,” said Jim Palmatier, 62, who said he was disappointed to see the congressman   over a doomed bill. “He tried to be a little too clever, and he just ended up looking like a fool. There’s no way I’m voting for him next time around. ” Eating breakfast with his teenage grandson, Mr. Palmatier, who described himself as a conservative, said he wanted to see the Affordable Care Act repealed but had been disappointed with the Republicans’ replacement. “They tried to get it through so quickly, they barely had time to explain the thing,” he said. In Representative Adam Kinzinger’s district, a Republican seat in a largely rural area outside Chicago, even conservative voters voiced unease with Mr. Kinzinger and his party’s sputtering approach to health care. Bill Chivers, 64, a teacher in Onarga, Ill. who said he leaned Republican, questioned whether lawmakers understood the bill: “Nobody knew what it was. Not even Congress  —   they don’t even know what it means. ” Anthony McIntyre, 55, who was grilling pork burgers for a   outside the Hometown Family Foods store in Gilman, Ill. said he was relieved that the bill had failed. Mr. McIntyre, who has health coverage through his job in roofing, said he feared that the bill would have led to higher insurance rates. “They can write it better,” said Mr. McIntyre, who said he regularly voted Republican. “They have to do a better job with it. ” Told that Mr. Kinzinger supported the bill, he was not pleased. “Oh no, he can’t do that,” Mr. McIntyre said. “Congressman Kinzinger  —   I might not want to vote for him again. ” In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Kinzinger, 39, said he understood that many voters were concerned about change to the health care system, and suggested that Republicans should now try to work with Democrats on more incremental changes instead of pushing for wholesale repeal. “Anytime you do something like this, it’s unpopular at first,” he said. “People may dislike the health law in its current form, but they always get nervous for change. ” Mr. Faso, 64, said he did not regret supporting the House health care bill, calling it merely a “partial solution” to a difficult policy problem. He said he had heard from constituents supportive of unwinding the Affordable Care Act, but had also been confronted by   protesters as recently as Saturday morning, at an event in New Lebanon. “I would say that my constituency is pretty divided on this whole question,” Mr. Faso said in an interview. “A lot of people want to see the A. C. A. or a   system and just as many people, in my view, want to see us get rid of the A. C. A. I’m trying to listen to both sides. ” It is not only supporters of the   bill, known as the American Health Care Act, who may face censure from voters. Dozens of Republican lawmakers opposed the measure after campaigning for years on a pledge to undo President Barack Obama’s signature achievement. Mr. Trump suggested repeatedly that he might seek to punish Republicans who failed to support the proposal, raising the possibility of primary battles next year. But it was Democrats who moved fastest to exploit the Republican health care debacle: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced on Saturday that it was running online advertisements against more than a dozen Republicans, including Mr. Faso, who voted for versions of the health care bill when it was being drafted in committees. Democratic strategists said their private polling found the   health care bill to be extremely unpopular, a finding mirrored in public opinion surveys. A Quinnipiac University poll published this past week found that just 17 percent of voters approved of the legislation, compared with 56 percent who disapproved. Three in five independent voters said they were against it. The Democratic campaign committee said it would even go after Republicans who never endorsed the final version of the bill, if they voted for it in earlier drafts, like Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Leonard Lance of New Jersey. The squeeze facing Republicans was evident in Mr. Curbelo’s district, where even voters critical of Obamacare were divided over the Republican strategy for replacing it. Sara Reig, 71, who said she was familiar with the main particulars of the bill, said the party should have been more patient and taken the time to craft a stronger piece of legislation. “What’s the rush?” she asked. “Better to fix it right and make it clear and really let us know what is in there,” Ms. Reig added. “They want to support the president, which I agree with, but it has to be done right. ” National Republicans, still reeling from their unexpected defeat, expressed hope that health care might fade as an issue before the congressional elections in 2018. With more than a year and a half until voters next pass judgment on the   Congress, party leaders say they have plenty of time to record victories on issues like a tax code overhaul and infrastructure spending. Mr. Trump and Speaker Paul D. Ryan indicated on Friday that they did not intend to revisit health care in the near future. But Republican strategists also acknowledged that they would probably have to give extra help to vulnerable members of Congress who supported the health care bill. Corry Bliss, the chief strategist for the Congressional Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” backed by Mr. Ryan, said the group would go out of its way to protect lawmakers who backed the bill. “We are committed to helping advance the legislative agenda of House leadership,” Mr. Bliss said on Saturday. “Of course we are going to give preferential treatment to friends and allies. ” By contrast, Mr. Bliss noted that the group had cut off funding to Representative David Young of Iowa, a Republican who opposed the health care bill. It is unclear whether voters’ anger over health care will be enough help Democrats win a majority in the House next year. Republicans control the chamber by a sizable margin, and the district maps in many states were drawn to protect the party’s incumbents. And some voters appeared willing to give their representative a pass on the messy health care process. In Mr. Coffman’s district, anchored in the Denver suburbs, George Markline, 52, said he did not care for the Republican bill, pointing out that it would lead to higher premiums for people who lose their coverage. Yet Mr. Markline, a Republican, said he believed Obamacare needed changes and gave Mr. Coffman credit for trying. “I like the fact that he’s standing up for a change that needs to be done, even though it may not have been fixing everything, as it needs to be,” said Mr. Markline, who works in logistics at a warehouse. But other voters who once eagerly supported Republican opponents of Obamacare said the last few weeks had given them second thoughts. In Kingston, N. Y. on the eastern edge of Mr. Faso’s district, Sal Traficante, the owner of a small construction business, said he had begun to question his support for Republicans. Mr. Traficante, 57, said he wanted the Affordable Care Act to be modified, but was dismayed at the thought of tens of millions of people losing health care coverage. “Those are working people who need the coverage,” he said. Mr. Traficante said he was disappointed by the Republicans: “I liked the idea of repealing Obamacare, but I thought the Republicans would actually have a plan. ”",0
11853,College Republicans’ Lawyer Suggests Deploying National Guard If Mayor of Berkeley Cannot Maintain Order - Breitbart,"Harmeet Dhillon, a San Francisco lawyer representing the UCB College Republicans, held a press conference Monday to discuss the case being brought against UC Berkeley and suggested deploying the National Guard to provide security if Berkeley’s mayor could not maintain control of the city. [One reporter asked Dhillon (at 29:00 in the video) whether or not the President should federalize the National Guard and have them provide security to speakers at UC Berkeley. In response, Dhillon said:  Well again, I don’t think it’s Ann Coulter’s or YAF’s or Berkeley College Republicans’ problem to solve that problem. First of all I think the Governor has to call out the National Guard. The President declaring martial law in Berkeley so that Ann Coulter can speak is a bit extreme. I’m not suggesting that would be an appropriate outcome, but I think the problem runs deeper than this Ann Coulter event. To be clear, what we have here is a shadowy policy that is, like I said, double secret we didn’t find out about it until we were on the verge of a lawsuit. And we have a policy that’s going to be applied in the future to other speakers in the future unless it’s going to be brought out into the open, debated, and accommodated between the needs of the students who want to hear interesting speakers and the university which has an interest in the safety of all people, I accept that. But to unilateraly declare that certain facilities  —   all the desireable facilities are “not securable” in the sole discretion of the university, when they were securable for Vicente Fox last week  —   that does not pass the smell test of credibility. And so that’s the problem we’re dealing with, the double standards. Absolutely, if the Mayor of Berkeley cannot maintain control of his city, the Governor should call the National Guard, because that’s a serious public health issue.

11855,US Sent Huge Weapons Shipments To Saudi Arabia Weeks Before Yemen Funeral Bombing,"US Sent Huge Weapons Shipments To Saudi Arabia Weeks Before Yemen Funeral Bombing Without U.S. support there’s no way Saudi coalition could wage the war at this level.” | October 28,   Members of the Higher Council for Civilian Community Organization inspect a destroyed funeral hall as they protest against a deadly Saudi-led airstrike on a funeral hall in Sanaa, Yemen, Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016. 
Published in partnership with Shadowproof . 
The United States shipped hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to Saudi Arabia just weeks prior to the Saudi-led coalition’s funeral bombing in Sanaa, Yemen, according to a new analysis of U.S. government data conducted by Shadowproof. 
The October 8 bombing killed 140 and wounded over 500. It was widely condemned by human rights groups and exposed U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen to greater scrutiny. 
In response to a query from Shadowproof about the funeral strike, State Department spokesperson Frankie Sturm replied, “We have regularly expressed our concerns to the Saudi-led coalition, and urged them – as we have urged all sides, including the Houthis – to take all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians and civilian objects and return to a cessation of hostilities.” 
Despite the US government’s purported desire for a “cessation of hostilities” and “concerns” for civilians, Shadowproof’s analysis shows that large quantities of U.S. weapons continue to flow to the Saudi government, impeding a sustained ceasefire and enabling civilian carnage. 
In July and August, the U.S. shipped Saudi $8.8 million in bombs, $47.3 million in parts for bombs, 313 guided missiles worth $26 million, one military helicopter worth $15.7 million, and 334 armored fighting vehicles and 19 armored vehicles, which together are worth over $197 million. 
From April to July, when peace talks were active, the U.S. shipped $50 million in armored vehicles and $82 million in parts for bombs. Talks broke down in July and were followed by a major increase in coalition air assaults in Yemen. 
Following the attack on a funeral, the U.S. government announced it was “ reviewing ” its support for the Saudi coalition; however, as of October 10 , there were no changes to U.S. military support for coalition operations. 
A UN-brokered ceasefire implemented in April ushered in a major reduction in fighting. Yet, U.S. weapons shipments continued. 
In fact, over the course of President Barack Obama’s administration, it has approved a staggering $115 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia—including a $1.29 billion sale in November 2015, which included over 19,000 bombs and a $1.15 billion sale of tank components, ammunition, and other weapons. 
The U.S. government has also provided logistical and intelligence support that has facilitated the Saudi coalition’s carnage. 
Given Saudi’s dependence on the U.S. government for military support, it is difficult to overstate the degree of influence the U.S possesses over the Saudi government. For example, Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said in April, “If the United States of America and the United Kingdom tonight told King Salman that this war has to end, it would end tomorrow.” 
Kristine Beckerle, who researches Yemen for Human Rights Watch, told Shadowproof, “The Saudi-led coalition’s air campaign in Yemen has been devastating for civilians, hitting marketplaces, factories, homes and hospitals. There is no question US weapons have been used in some of these unlawful attacks, including one of the most deadly. The US should be suspending arms sales to Saudi, until it not only curbs unlawful strikes but also credibly investigates those that have already occurred.” 
A survey conducted by the Yemen Data Project found that, from the beginning of the Saudi coalition’s air campaign in Yemen in March 2015, through August of 2016, more than one-third of the coalition’s 8,600 strikes hit non-military targets. 
“The coalition is responsible for twice as many civilian casualties as all other forces put together, virtually all as a result of air strikes,” UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said back in March. 
Nasser Arrabyee, a journalist in Sanaa, told Shadowproof, “In the first weeks of the war the battle for Sanna was over, all the military sites were destroyed, yet the coalition strikes continue on a daily basis, often hitting civilians.” 
The U.S. government continues to insist the Saudi coalition isn’t intentionally targeting civilians, but Colette Gadenne, who heads Médecins Sans Frontières’ (MSF) Yemen mission told Shadowproof, “We’ve seen airstrikes hit civilian locations so often. For example, there was a strike on a crowded marketplace in Harad at 8 pm on July 4. It took place after people broke their Ramadan fast. And we only know about the strikes we see directly.” 
Three MSF hospitals, one MSF mobile clinic, and an MSF ambulance were attacked by coalition forces. 
After the funeral attack, images appeared on social media allegedly showing fragments of a U.S-supplied tail fin for a JDAM guidance kit for a U.S-made Mark 82 500 lb. bomb. 
Ali Al-Ahmed, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Institute for Gulf Affairs and himself a Saudi, told Shadowproof the Saudis indeed target civilians. 
“They couldn’t defeat [the Houthis] on the battlefield so they’re killing women and children, bombing schools, to get that result,” Ahmed explained. 
Back in 2010, U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning disclosed a State Department cable from the same year that showed the U.S. government provided “imagery” of the Yemen border to the Saudi government, despite evidence Saudi aircraft were attacking civilians when attacking Houthis in northern Yemen. Assistant Minister of Defense and Aviation Prince Khaled bin Sultan appealed to a U.S. ambassador to give them a Predator drone to help limit civilian casualties. 
Another cable from 2009 that was also disclosed by Manning shows the U.S. government approved military assistance for Saudi Arabia or Yemen if aid was not used against Houthis. Since then, the U.S. government has allowed the Saudi Kingdom to pull them into an open-ended war. 
With regard to al Qaida, Ahmed noted, “Hundreds of Saudi jets and their allies bombing Yemeni forces have avoided bombing…positions in Yemen of al Qaida.” 
“The Saudi air force is really becoming the air force for al-Qaida,” Ahmed said. “The Saudi bombings have helped mostly one group: al-Qaida.” 
Ahmed also stressed the bombings fuel “anti-Americanism.” Prior to the war, the Yemeni government cooperated closely with the U.S. in counterterrorism matters. 
In a letter to President Obama, 36 members of congress urged him to block the $1.15 billion arms deal announced in August. The letter stated, “Amnesty International has documented at least 33 unlawful airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition across Yemen that appear to have deliberately targeted civilians and civilians facilities, such as hospitals, schools, markets, and places of worship. These attacks may amount to war crimes.” 
According to a recent report by Reuters, the coalition has hit sites the U.S. government put on a “do not strike” list. The U.S. designated these locations as being vital infrastructure for delivery of food aid and for post-war reconstruction. 
The Saudi coalition declared as a target the entire Saada Governorate (measuring 4,000 square miles), which borders Saudi Arabia. It also reportedly used incendiary weapons, white phosphorous, as well as cluster weapons, which are banned by most countries. 
Both of these weapons were supplied by the U.S. 
The war’s effect on civilians in Yemen is enormous. “The jets overhead scare the children. There is no place people can go to be safe, even hospitals are hit in strikes. The population is traumatized,” Gadenne said. 
More than 10,000 civilians have been killed since the Saudi-led coalition began, including more than 1,000 children. More than 80 percent of the population now requires some form of humanitarian assistance for survival. 
Beatriz Ochoa from Save the Children told Shadowproof, “The number of children that are severely malnourished has doubled to 370,000 since the beginning of the coalition bombing. 1.6 million women and children under 5 are suffering from acute malnutrition with over 14 million, or roughly half of Yemen’s population, are considered food insecure.” 
The coalition imposed a blockade, which has resulted in shortages of medicine and food, as well as price spikes and hoarding of goods. 
Recently, there was a reported cholera outbreak, which may exacerbate the already dangerous health crisis. 
Another serious concern is unexploded ordnance. “A 16-year-old girl was collecting firewood in Sadaa, and there had been an air strike in the area 3 months prior. An unexploded ordnance went off and she lost a leg,” Gadenne recalled. 
Ms. Gadenne said MSF has seen victims from unexploded ordnance all over the country. Research from Amnesty International found thousands of unexploded munitions in northern Yemen, following a 10-day tour of the region earlier this year. 
The dire humanitarian crisis resulting from the war has given rise to a great deal of anger in Yemen, according to Arrabyee. “Yemenis see the war as an American war, as the coalition couldn’t carry out the strikes in Yemen without U.S. support. There is a big campaign saying Americans are the ones killing the Yemenis people.” 
William Hartung from the Center for International Policy told Shadowproof the U.S. is directly involved in Yemen, even if it’s not the one dropping the bombs. 
“Without U.S. support there’s no way Saudi coalition could wage the war at this level,” Hartung said. “The large weapons deals and mid-flight refueling provided by the U.S. play an important role in Saudi’s ability to conduct strikes in Yemen.” Be Sociable, Share!",0

11858,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 6, Episode 7: Never Too Late - The New York Times","“Never too late to come back. ” So sayeth the High Swearengen, ministering to his followers but speaking in particular to a certain disfigured member of his flock. It was a clever bit of sermonizing, applying both to its target’s potential for salvation within the story as well as his renewed purpose, overall, in the world of “Game of Thrones. ” For Sandor Clegane, also known as the Hound, who has not been seen since the end of Season 4, has returned. You’ll recall that he was beaten nearly to death and tossed off a cliff by Brienne, who then let Arya escape anyway. Some time later, we learned Sunday, the roving    played by Ian McShane discovered and nursed him back to health. It was unclear how he did it or where they had all ended up. The group seemed to be building a church in a pastoral field but everyone was apparently wiped out by a rather prickly Brotherhood Without Banners contingent before they could explain what they were up to. The big Hound reveal was less surprising than it might have been, thanks to Mr. McShane’s letting some clues slip a few months ago. (The resulting hubbub led to the actor’s memorably terse, but unprintable, description of the show.) But it was still fun to again see the Hound, who showed up looking perhaps worse for the wear. Who could tell, really? The man was never in this tale for his beauty  —   what’s important is that he’s still strong and he feels as if he has some atoning to do. Oh, and he has an ax. That could come into play at some point. The return of the Hound, revealed in a rare cold open, provided the spine of an episode that was largely about alliances productive and wearying, newly forged and torn asunder. As Sansa and Jon Snow tried to drum up support in the North, Arya dealt with the consequences of cutting ties with the Faceless Men. As Jaime worked to counteract the general numbskullery of the idiot Freys at Riverrun, Cersei watched as her former collaborator Lady Olenna called her “the worst person I’ve ever met” on her way out of town. Those crazy Greyjoy siblings, for their part, are eying a new partnership with Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen, which would be good news for multiple reasons. (More on that in a minute.) The alliance between the Hound and Mr. McShane’s Brother Ray was the one partnership of the night that wasn’t purely transactional, which means it was doomed from the beginning. If you had any doubt, there was Ray, on an undefensible open plain, preaching about the uselessness of violence on one of the most violent shows on television. “Violence is a disease,” he said. “You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people. ” Which is true, but there aren’t many people in this story interested in curing that particular disease. Morality is fluid in “Game of Thrones” the one cardinal sin seems to be to refuse to deal with the world as it is. (Ned Stark is the enduring example of this.) Which is to say: this thing was going to go only one way. The real tragedy is that Mr. McShane, almost always the best part of whichever screen he’s on, is already gone. And so now, the Hound and his trusty ax are off in search of new alliances. It remains to be seen whether that leads toward revenge on the Brotherhood  —   they have a complicated history, remember  —   or Brienne or his undead brother or something else entirely. Arya sure could’ve used her old protector this week. Last seen lying in wait for the Waif in the dark  —   at least that’s how it looked to me  —   Arya on Sunday made travel plans in broad daylight and otherwise behaved in oddly leisurely fashion for a woman who just defied a band of deadly assassins. She strolled around Braavos, taking in the sights, and what’s this? A kindly old woman wants to have a word? Soon there were a few new holes in her belly and, a quick swim later, she was bleeding in the streets among a sea of unfriendly faces, any one of which could bring more stabbing. So what’s the plan, Arya? I still think we’re not done with the theater troupe so perhaps someone among them has some medical expertise. (I’m sure we all remember the young actor seeking help for his skin problem a few weeks ago.) A key scene from an early trailer found Arya taking a terrific flying leap so perhaps a future escape will make up for this week’s bizarre lack of urgency. A world away, Arya’s sister tried to rally the North and only ended up with some Wildlings and 62 Mormont men for her trouble. On the bright side, Wun Wun the giant is among the Wilding supporters  —   “Snow!”  —   and I also wouldn’t underestimate the latest formidable female in the story, Little Miss  . Leave it to Davos, the little girl whisperer, to win her over. (I know it came up a few weeks ago but he doesn’t have the whole story of what happened to Shireen, right?) Lyanna Mormont is probably my favorite new character of the season so far, and that’s even before you consider that she oversees a place called Bear Island. How did we not get to see more of Bear Island? Throw us a bone, HBO. Sansa was last seen writing a letter to someone, presumably asking for more help. Any guesses who it was? Littlefinger seems like the obvious choice  —   she appeared pretty joyless about it and we already know he has the knights of the Vale queued up and ready to ride. But what will be his price? Could Sansa (sigh) be in for yet another dispiriting marriage? “Is she a Bolton or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports,” Ms. Mormont said. I do what I have to do, Sansa replied. Would she do it again? Speaking of Lannisters, in King’s Landing, the High Septon has consolidated his power by taking control of the throne, and is now eliminating threats. Last week, he had Jaime sent away. (Yes, Tommen officially did it, but he’s a puppet at this point, right?) This week the Sparrow targeted Lady Olenna. “I only pray your grandmother follows your lead,” he tells Margaery. The Sparrow is loathsome, wrapping in sanctimony the same crass power craving that animates many of the show’s characters. But it’s worth noting how good Jonathan Pryce is at conveying a sense of superficial guilelessness that masks darker undercurrents. A phony man of God (or seven gods) can easily veer into caricature but the Sparrow’s humility    has never wavered, even as his dominion has expanded exponentially. We received confirmation that Margaery is telling the Sparrow and Septa Unella what they want to hear  —   Margaery signaled her loyalty and warned away the Queen of Thorns with a drawing of a rose, the family sigil. The question is: Is she playing into the Sparrow’s hands by sending away her grandmother? Not that Margaery had a choice, with the threats on the table. But I suspect the real point is to remove any possible obstacles for the Sparrow’s control of the royal couple. He already has Cersei ready to face charges  —   the mother of the king is a potentially powerful adversary  —   so if he can clear out Olenna, his hold on the king and queen would be secure. Olenna’s departure also removes yet another former Cersei ally, not that the Olenna has any interest in helping her after their failed coup last week. Still friends? Cersei asks, knowing that without the Tyrells she has little hope of overthrowing the Sparrow. “You’ve lost, Cersei,” Olenna replies, which brings “the only joy I can find in all this misery. ” So that would be a no. Finally, Theon was like the   guy at the fondue party on Sunday, as Yara and friends indulged in some classic    behavior. Yara took a quick break for some tough love, telling her brother that she had no time for his   stress disorder. “I know you’ve had some bad years,” she said, in a riotous bit of understatement before making her point: Get over it or kill yourself. Theon continues to be one of the more interesting characters this season  —   with Alfie Allen giving him a poignant,   quality  —   because we don’t know how he’s going to turn out. His past as a feckless cad obliterated, there’s no going back to what he was, despite Yara’s urging. We received confirmation that the Greyjoys intend to sail to Meereen to offer their services to Dany, as suspected, which is good news for a couple of reasons. One, anything that will expedite a departure from Meereen is welcome. Two, who better than Varys and the Unsullied to help Theon understand that there’s life after  …     well, you know? • Jaime arrived at the mudpit known as Riverrun and Bronn made his first appearance of the season. (It was a big week for beloved, scraggly bearded dudes.) But otherwise it was all fruitless parleys and doofus Freys. The real action starts with Brienne’s arrival next week, promised in the preview, at the tent of her old kingslaying crush. • As discussed in the episode, Lyanna Mormont’s uncle was Jeor Mormont, whom Jon Snow initially served under at Castle Black. But a reminder: Jeor’s son was none other than Jorah Mormont, the same lovelorn knight currently wandering Essos in search of a cure for his greyscale. Forget Bear Island. Can we just get a scene of little Lyanna talking some sense into her cousin over his Dragon Queen obsession? • This just in: Marital relations do “not require desire on a woman’s part,” the High Sparrow tells Margaery. “Only patience. ” Quite the romantic, this guy. • What say you? Is Cersei as doomed as I think she is? What do the gods have planned for the Hound? Who else in this show, besides Septa Unella, could use a good bashing? Please weigh in in the comments.",0

The Vatican includes high-ranking dignitaries, priests, nuns, and guards as well as about 3,000 lay workers who comprise the majority of the work force. The Holy See's diplomatic history began in the fourth century, but the boundaries of the papacy's temporal power have shifted over the centuries. From the 8th century through the middle of the 19th century, the Popes held sway over the Papal States, which included a broad band of territory across central Italy. In 1860, after prolonged civil and regional unrest, Victor Emmanuel's army seized the Papal States, leaving only Rome and surrounding coastal regions under papal control. In 1870, Victor Emmanuel captured Rome itself and declared it the new capital of Italy, ending papal claims to temporal power. Pope Pius IX and his successors disputed the legitimacy of these acts and proclaimed themselves to be ""prisoners"" in the Vatican. Finally, in 1929, the Italian Government and the Holy See signed three agreements resolving the dispute: A treaty recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the Holy See and creating the State of the Vatican City; A concordat defining the relations between the government and the church within Italy; and A financial convention providing the Holy See with compensation for its losses in 1870. A revised concordat, altering the terms of church-state relations, was signed in 1984.",0

11862,College Student Suffers Severe Reaction After Hazing Involving Peanut Butter - The New York Times,"A Michigan college student with a deadly peanut allergy was the victim of a hazing ritual in which he was daubed in the face with peanut butter at an   party, spurring a severe reaction that left him with swollen eyes, officials and the man’s mother said. The police in Mount Pleasant, Mich. said they were investigating the October encounter involving youths who said they were members of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity at Central Michigan University and the student, Andrew Seely, 19. Law enforcement authorities and university officials found out about the hazing this week, after Mr. Seely’s mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about it and posted a photograph of her son’s distorted face on Facebook. “He could have been killed,” she wrote, adding that he carried medicine to counteract accidental exposure to peanuts. “We will be investigating,” Capt. Andy Latham of the Mount Pleasant Police said by telephone. He added that the authorities had not yet spoken to Mr. Seely, who transferred to another school, but that they were contacted on Wednesday by the family’s lawyer. Ms. Seely wrote in the post that her son had a “deadly” peanut allergy and had passed out at the party. When he came to, she said, he discovered that his eyes, nose and lips had ballooned because peanut butter had been rubbed on his face. Ms. Seely said he was treated at a campus clinic. He told his family only this week about the hazing, she said, after which she called the campus police, the Mount Pleasant police and university officials. Ms. Seely could not be reached by telephone on Friday. Heather Smith, a spokeswoman for the university, said the fraternity had not been active on campus since 2011 because of previous hazing. She said campus officials heard about Mr. Seely’s experience through his mother’s social media post. University police do not have jurisdiction over the   party, according to Ms. Smith, but the university could investigate any violations of the student code of conduct if Mr. Seely reached out. “It is a potential criminal matter,” she said. “It is obviously a very concerning situation. ” The national headquarters of Alpha Chi Rho, which said in a statement on Friday that it had revoked the chapter’s charter in 2011 because of hazing, added that the people involved in Mr. Seely’s case “were not members” of the fraternity and “acted independently. ” “Alpha Chi Rho does not condone this type of behavior, or any form of hazing, and it stands in conflict with our mission to cultivate men of character, honor and integrity,” the statement added. The television station WDIV in Detroit quoted an unidentified fraternity member as saying: “We were just trying to be funny, just guys hanging out, and we used peanut butter and put some on his face. We didn’t know he was allergic,” the member said. “We were not trying to harm him in any sense. ” Officials have been trying to stamp out the kind of campus activities and rituals that lead to Mr. Seely’s allergy attack, as university and high school students find disturbingly creative ways to haze others. Students trying to join fraternities, sororities, clubs or athletic teams have been tied up, blindfolded and sexually abused. Others have been forced to binge drink until death, and others have even been fatally beaten. While there are no official government databases on hazing cases and their outcomes, university professors keep their own statistics, and put in place policies to control the practice. According to a chronology of cases kept by Hank Nuwer, a journalism professor at Franklin College in Indiana, there has been at least one hazing death every year from 1969 to 2016 at United States colleges and high schools. “I would say there are thousands of hazings every day, most of which are not reported,” said Susan Lipkins, a psychologist and expert on the practice. “And each year hazing gets worse. A rookie wants to enter the group, and you become a bystander and watch others, and eventually become a perpetrator. ” Dr. Lipkins said that in some cases, members of banned fraternities recolonize   and operate in unofficial,   groups. She said she had no direct knowledge of Mr. Seely’s case, but believed it was most likely that the group had advance knowledge that he had an allergy. “It is not a typical hazing activity,” she said. “Of all the hazing activities, I have not heard of peanut butter on the face. ” In 2012, a    drum major died after a brutal hazing ritual at Florida AM University in which he was pummeled with hands, drumsticks, bass drum mallets, straps and even an orange cone by at least 15 band members on a bus. The cause of death was “hemorrhagic shock caused by   trauma,” the medical examiner said.",0
11863,Reporters Attempt to Smear White House Over Illegal Alien Rape Accusations - Breitbart,"Outraged reporters piled onto Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders Friday during a press conference, demanding to know why the White House had dared mention an alleged rape committed by   suspects after initial charges were dropped. [“I want to ask you about this case out of Maryland,” ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega began, and went on to say:  As you probably know, the prosecutors have dropped the rape charges against the two, undocumented teens [sic] accused of attacking that    classmate. This White House has been —  was vocal on that case from this podium. Sean Spicer said that ‘a big of the reason this president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deed —  deal, is because of tragedies like this.’ Vega then made a   expression and asked: “Did this White House unfairly jump to conclusions in this case?” On Mar. 16, Maryland police arrested two illegal alien suspects,    Guatemalan Henry E. Sanchez Milian and    El Salvadoran Jose Montano, after staff at Rockville High School in Maryland reported an alleged rape of a    freshman who claimed to a police detective she had been raped orally, anally, and vaginally simultaneously by the two suspects after being stripped naked and “bent over a toilet” in the boys’ bathroom. A forensic specialist found blood and bodily fluids in the bathroom after the alleged victim said she was raped.  Prosecutors in the case, which sparked a national uproar, said on Friday they planned to drop the   rape and sex offense charges, citing the “challenges corroborating events the girl described,” according to the Washington Post. The alleged victim had exchanged   text messages and images with at least one of the alleged assailants beforehand. Sanchez Milian will likely face child pornography charges, however. White House press secretary Sean Spicer had expressed indignation at the alleged   of the    freshman. Spicer said at the White House in late March: This is a tragic event, and it is horrendous, and horrible, and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. I can’t possibly imagine. Part of the reason the president has made illegal immigration and [a] crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this. Part of the reason is the tragedy this young girl dealt with, had inflicted upon her, whatever the word is. This is why he’s passionate about this. Because people are victims of these crimes. But since prosecutors dropped some of the charges against the   suspects —  and have decided to pursue others —  leftist reporters thought they had a “gotcha” moment against anyone concerned about illegal immigration. “Look, I think we’re always looking to protect the American people,” Sanders replied. “Sean was speaking about what he knew at the time. And certainly, I haven’t had a chance to dive into the latest on that, but we will, and we’ll get back to you. ” “You wanna retract anything that —  that the White House has said so far?” Vega said. “I’m not gonna retract anything without further information in front of me,” Sanders said. Bizarrely, another CBS reporter wanted to know if the White House regretted speaking about a national scandal that would never have happened had illegal immigration from Central America been stymied, not encouraged, during the Obama years. “Have you talked to Sean and does he have any regrets about what he said?” CBS News’s Chip Reid asked. “I have not talked to Sean,” Sanders said, adding he was on Navy duty. Another reporter asked if “there is a general danger that the White House, through its rhetoric, is animating too many people to jump to conclusions against immigrants [sic] and in the process, diminishing the entire immigrant community [sic] whether they’re   or not?” “Not at all,” Sanders said, adding, “The president has been incredibly outspoken against crime in any form, fashion —  certainly from his joint address, to his speech last week on Holocaust Remembrance Day. Look, this is a    president. He’s focused on restoring law and order. We’ve seen a spike in crime rates, starting in 2015, across the board, not just in any particular sector. I think that’s why he campaigned and talked so much about needing to restore law and order in this country. It’s why he’s focused on securing our border —  stopping drug trafficking, human trafficking. Those are things that have been a priority for him. And I think the reason is, is because he places such a high value on that. And I think to call into question his rhetoric, to be anything other than someone who has condemned hate and violence in all of its forms, is simply a complete misrepresentation. Not only of who the president is, but also what he’s said. ”",0
11864,Hugs and Hard Labor on an Indiana Farm - The New York Times,"My grandmother, F. Helen Hunt, was tough. I learned this when I was 13, the year I moved alone from London to Clinton County, Ind. to live with her on her   farm. I sailed in amid the wreckage of my parents’ marriage. Maybe I should say as part of the wreckage. Upon my arrival, my grandmother took one look at furious, hurt, young me and prescribed hugs  —   she was never stingy with them  —   and what felt to me, lately prowling the streets of South Kensington and St. John’s Wood, like outrageous amounts of manual labor. These weren’t chores: She paid me, not unfairly, for what I did. But it wasn’t quite voluntary either. I hauled wood, I mowed her enormous lawn with a little push mower, I cleared fallen branches, I raked, I burned, I strung and tested electric fences, I dug holes, I ran a rototiller, I pulled weeds, I knocked down derelict buildings with a crowbar and sledgehammer, I washed windows, I worked a scythe. One of my early jobs was learning how to drive my late  ’s temperamental 1951 Farmall Cub tractor so that I could tear out a vineyard, relic of a winemaking project started by my aunt and uncle that had by that time, in the early 1980s, run its course. It turned out the Cub had a functioning mowing element, and when I had finished tearing out the rows of Foch grapevines, I regularly used it to shear the grass and weeds of my grandmother’s east and west woods. Even if from time to time I also found myself detasseling corn in hot fields or baling and stacking hay in even hotter barns for neighboring farmers, the core of what I did was always for my grandmother. And I didn’t do it alone. My grandmother stood a smidgen over five feet tall in her Sunday heels, was a retired teacher of Latin who knew all the declensions and had once interviewed Thomas Wolfe’s brother and traveled the world, but man, could she get to it. After school and church duties were done  —   and there was no monkeying around about either  —   we went out rain or shine, cold or heat. It didn’t matter if I was walking with a limp or had sore muscles from playing football or basketball the night before. If it wasn’t torn or broken, you worked on it. That first year, on a day when we were shifting old    from one spot to another for no clear  —   to me  —   reason in a cold, steady springtime drizzle, I let one I was supposed to be holding steady slip, and it smacked her hard in the mouth. I already stood a foot taller than her and outweighed her by 50 pounds and that blow would have laid me out. But my grandmother just spat, instructed me through her swelling lip to get a tighter grip, and we went back to it, got it done. On those occasions when we worked independently  —   say my grandmother in her greenhouse and me at the woodpile  —   she was never loath to raise a steely eyebrow in the face of my highball estimates about how many chunks of wood I had carried. I’m painting a picture of a    taskmaster here  —   the older   who runs everyone else into the ground  —   but she also remained generous with those hugs. There were kisses too. My grandmother was, in addition, fond of affectionately grabbing and squeezing my forearm. At the end of a big job, or when I’d done something passable at school or on the field, we would link hands, throw our heads back and spin around together. She would also brag about me to anyone, in any context, within earshot, whether she knew them or not. Much as my teenage self rebelled against the one and sometimes only grudgingly tolerated the other, when I look back on it now, it is clear to me that with these sturdy threads of hard work and fierce affection my grandmother was weaving the torn world back together for me. My grandmother’s admirable grit, which she displayed in just about every aspect of her long life (she variously credited these qualities to having been born breach and not breathing or to having come of age during the Great Depression) not only helped see me through my troubled teens and early adulthood, it has become the subject of my life’s work. Indeed, I recently finished my third novel set in and around rural Indiana, featuring strong women as protagonists. These novels, which take place in the deep well of the past, aren’t studies of my grandmother’s life, but they are absolutely and unapologetically inspired by it. Each character is different, each is admirable and flawed in near equal measure, but they all have in common my grandmother’s   inability to quit in the face of challenge and a thundering capacity for love. When I first went to my grandmother’s, the idea was that I would stay in Indiana for a year. I ended up staying five with her, and nine if you count college in Bloomington, a couple of hours away. In the process, in the company of my outsize, diminutive grandmother, I grew to adulthood. And although she has been gone for years, I keep her close both in my characters and in myself. There is no way to pay off a debt like the one I owe her, but I make regular payments in the only kind of currency she would have accepted: dedication to the task at hand and the ability, when it has been merited, to link hands with those close to me and spin with joy.",0
11865,"Michael Chamberlain, Father of Baby Killed by a Dingo in Australia, Dies at 72 - The New York Times","It was a mystery that captivated Australia for years, inspired a Meryl Streep movie and tormented a couple for more than three decades. Now, one of the central figures in the case  —   in which a dingo, a type of wild dog found in Australia, was found to have killed the couple’s    baby girl  —   has died. Michael Chamberlain, a former pastor who fought for decades to prove to the world that the animal was responsible for his daughter’s disappearance, died on Monday, his former wife, Lindy Chamberlain, told The Associated Press. He was 72. The cause was complications of acute leukemia, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. The couple’s ordeal began in 1980, when their daughter, Azaria, disappeared from the family tent while on a trip to the Australian outback. Despite a lack of evidence  —   a body was never found  —   blame for the disappearance soon fell on the couple. Ms. Chamberlain, who said that she had seen a dingo slip out of the tent, was convicted of murder in 1982 and was sentenced to life in prison. Mr. Chamberlain was found guilty of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Three years later, new evidence absolved them both. But the Chamberlains still struggled for years to win over public opinion. They were helped by the book “Evil Angels,” by John Bryson, published in 1985, which offered a scathing review of the prosecution botching forensic evidence, and by the 1988 film “A Cry in the Dark,” which was based on that book and starred Ms. Streep and Sam Neill as the couple. But the movie also turned their misfortunes into a joke in the United States, inspiring material for shows such as “Seinfeld” and “The Simpsons. ” The strain on the family was ultimately too strong. In 1990, Ms. Chamberlain published a book, “Through My Eyes,” which portrayed her husband unkindly, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. A year later, the couple divorced. Michael Leigh Chamberlain was born on Feb. 27, 1944, in Christchurch, New Zealand, to Ivan and Greta Chamberlain, according to the newspaper, and met Lindy in 1968 while studying theology at college in Australia. A year later, he graduated and they married. They had two sons before Azaria was born, and another daughter after. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available. In 1994, Mr. Chamberlain married Ingrid Bergner. Within a few years, he had a daughter with Ms. Bergner, wrote his first book and began working toward the doctorate he earned in 2002 from the University of Newcastle. In 2011, Ms. Bergner had a stroke and Mr. Chamberlain became her   caretaker. The next year, a tearful coroner, Elizabeth Morris, apologized to Michael and Lindy Chamberlain as she brought their   fight to an end: Azaria, she concluded in a fourth inquest, died as a result of being taken by a dingo. “I am here to tell you that you can get justice even when you think that all is lost,’’ Mr. Chamberlain said after the ruling. “But truth must be on your side. ”",0

11867,À la rencontre de la footballeuse russe de la « liste de Messi »,"1 / 2 
Le rêve s’avéra amer : il lui fallut vivre dans des préfabriqués de chantier, ce qui ne la dissuada pas. « Je trouvais ça marrant. Tu ne fais rien à part jouer au football. On m’avait même expliqué qu’on pouvait en vivre. Bien sûr que je reste [décida Nadedja], je suis prête à me laver à l’eau froide et tout » , confie-t-elle. « Si mon père ne m’aidait pas, je crèverais de faim » Июн 6 2016 в 7:49 PDT 

Se faire une place dans le football professionnel s’avéra difficile. Après ses études, le club de l’académie, Rossiyanka, proposa à Nadejda, qui jouait alors déjà dans l’équipe jeunes de Russie, 9 000 roubles (120 euros) par mois. Ce furent les représentants d’un autre club, Zorky, qui la sauvèrent de la misère en la payant trois fois plus cher. Mais cet argent ne suffisait de toute façon pas pour quoi que ce soit. « Je ne peux rien m’acheter avec l’argent que je gagne au football , a raconté Nadjeda dans une interview à Eurosport en 2014. Je peux m’acheter une carte de métro. Si mon père ne m’aidait pas, je crèverais de faim » . 
Durant ces deux ans, Nadedja fait des débuts remarqués dans l’équipe nationale et est en tête des marqueurs du championnat russe 2016 dans l’équipe Chertanovo de Moscou. Cependant, la star du football féminin russe vit toujours modestement, comme tout le football féminin en Russie, qui paie 3 000 roubles (40 euros) de prime pour une victoire, et dont les joueuses en déplacement s’entassent dans les wagons de troisième classe. 
« Les salaires des hommes, on n’en rêve même pas. Je ne veux même pas entendre parler de ces sommes. Qu’est-ce que… je pourrais faire de 50 000 dollars ? Rien de bon… J’irais faire la fête, je perdrais la raison. Il me semble que c’est ce qui arrive à tous ceux qui reçoivent des sommes pareilles » , affirme Nadejda.",0
11868,America gives Grand Piano to horse,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Lucas Wilde America gives Grand Piano to horse 
America has given a grand piano to a horse and is expecting some quality tunes. 
“I’m particularly looking forward to Beethoven’s Ninth,” beamed horse supporter and piano enthusiast, Jay Cooper. 
“A horse has never been given a piano before because, frankly, the establishment wouldn’t allow it. 
“Now, at last, change has come, and America will change for the better. 
“There are a lot of doubters out there, and those doubters will soon be silenced by the graceful notes of Chopin, Mozart and maybe even Little Richard.” 
Horse, Dobbin Williams, said, “I’m not really sure what’s expected of me here. 
“I’m a horse. I am absolutely not qualified to play a piano. 
“I mean… Look at these hooves and the way I am in general. I can’t even sit on the chair properly. 
“Why on earth did anyone think this was a good idea?” 
Cooper grinned, “We did it. We’ve made pianos great again.” 
Democrat, Elizabeth King, said “We wanted to get a pianist of low-to-medium standard for the piano. 
“She wouldn’t have thumped out anything exciting, but it would have been perfectly reasonable background music. 
“But the people have spoken, and the people wanted a horse.

11869,"White House Budget Cuts Entitlements $1.7 Trillion, Slashes EPA 30% - Breitbart","The White House will release its “  budget” on Tuesday, which includes $1. 7 trillion in cuts for entitlement spending and a 30 percent reduction in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) budget. [The Trump budget proposal will balance over the next ten years by cutting both mandatory and discretionary funding for agencies such as the EPA and State Department. The budget proposal assumes that the economy will grow at three percent compared to the 1. 6 percent growth that America experienced in 2016. White House staffers explained that the proposal is a “ ” budget, meaning that the budget assumes that Trump signed the health care overhaul known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and tax reform into law.  The budget proposal will make substantial cuts into four entitlement programs, SNAP (food stamps) CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) and SSDI (Disability Insurance). The Trump budget assumes that the AHCA becomes law, which would roll back Medicaid expansion. White House staffers told Axios that the budget would cut entitlement costs through an “emphasis on work requirements for   people. ” The Washington Post’s Damian Paletta stated, “The White House also will call for giving states more flexibility to impose work requirements for people in different kinds of   programs, people familiar with the budget plan said, potentially leading to a flood of changes in states led by conservative governors. ” Josh Archambault, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability, explained that giving states the flexibility to impose work requirements could to lead to significant changes to programs such as Medicaid or public housing assistance. “One of the encouraging things about putting this in the budget is that states will see if it works,” Archambault said. “States will try it. ” Michael Tanner, a welfare expert at the Cato Institute, admitted that despite the United States spending roughly $700 billion a year on entitlement programs, the country does not experience significant reductions in poverty. Tanner said, “We’re not seeing the type of gains we should be seeing for all that spending, and that would suggest its time to reform the system. ” Although the budget will include cuts to food stamps and disability insurance, President Donald Trump told his budget director Mick Mulvaney that he does not want any cuts to Medicare or Social Security. President Donald Trump’s budget would also cut the EPA’s budget by a third and slash the agency’s operational budget by 35 percent. The budget would reduce environmental grant programs by 35 to 40 percent. The proposed budget for the EPA would limit the EPA’s budget to $5. 7 billion from roughly $8 billion. Trump’s budget cuts for the EPA coincide with the EPA’s $12 million buyout and early retirement plan to reduce the agency’s workforce under the Trump administration. Trump made campaign promises to eliminate the EPA, and has already taken great strides to limit the agency’s workforce. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt dismissed half of the scientists on its Board of Scientific Counselors earlier this month. White House staffers told Axios that the Trump budget proposal will be a victory for conservatives, much to the chagrin of moderates and Democrats. “Conservatives will love it moderates will probably hate it. ”",0
11870,"Oculus Founder, at Center of Legal Battle Over VR, Departs Facebook - The New York Times","SAN FRANCISCO  —   Palmer Luckey, a founder of the   technology company Oculus, has left Facebook three years after the social network acquired his company for close to $3 billion. Mr. Luckey’s departure was announced two months after a trial in federal court over allegations that he and several colleagues had stolen trade secrets from a   publisher, ZeniMax Media, to create the Oculus technology. A jury found Facebook liable for $500 million in damages, in part for Mr. Luckey’s violation of a confidentiality agreement. “Palmer will be dearly missed,” Tera Randall, an Oculus spokeswoman, said in a statement. “His inventive spirit helped   the modern VR revolution and helped build an industry. ” Ms. Randall declined to disclose the terms of Mr. Luckey’s departure. The move adds another twist to Facebook’s bumpy foray into   technology. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has bet big on virtual reality as part of the social network’s future, saying he envisioned social interactions between people will someday exist inside virtual worlds. Oculus, he has said, could be a catalyst for that. But from the start, Oculus has run into problems. Adoption of the Oculus technology and headsets has been slower than Facebook had anticipated. The selection of content made for VR headsets is still small, though growing. “These things end up being more complex than you think upfront,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in January while appearing in court for the ZeniMax trial. “If anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought upfront. ” Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to spending more than $3 billion over the next decade to get virtual reality off the ground and into the mainstream. Mr. Luckey has had other stumbles. In 2016, it became public that he had donated $10, 000 to Nimble America, a   political organization that promoted   memes and slogans on social media sites like Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. He has since apologized for the impact his actions had on Oculus and its partners. Mr. Luckey did not immediately respond to a Facebook message requesting comment. In January, Facebook appointed a new leader, Hugo Barra, to head up the company’s   efforts, including Oculus.",0
11871,E.U. Lawmakers Call for End to Visa-Free Travel for Americans - The New York Times,"BRUSSELS  —   The European Parliament has passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the reintroduction of visa requirements for American citizens, raising the stakes in a   battle over the United States’ refusal to grant   access to citizens of five European Union countries. In the vote on Thursday, European lawmakers played    in their dispute with the United States, demanding restrictions on American travelers unless the Trump administration lifts travel requirements for citizens of Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland and Romania. “You’re talking about citizens from countries, like Poland, with a major diaspora” in the United States, Claude Moraes, the British lawmaker who leads the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in the European Parliament, said in a telephone interview on Friday. “You’re really seeing frustration and anger, and without any timetable, this is becoming increasingly seen as   treatment. ” The resolution, while nonbinding, was an important political signal, and it increases pressure on the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, to confront the new administration in Washington, even though it may prove to be as intransigent on the matter as the Obama administration, if not more. The European Parliament also warned that it could take the further step of bringing the European Commission to court if it continues not to stand up to Washington. “Only when the U. S. fully gets that the European Commission is going to act are we going to get any kind of timetable from the United States,” Mr. Moraes said. “At the moment, the U. S. just believes the commission is not going to act but stick with the pragmatic argument that doing so would create damage that’s just too great. ” He continued, referring to Washington, “There’s no denying heightened concern about the current administration, but that’s more about uncertainty about who’s in charge and how the State Department is working. ” Mr. Moraes said the civil liberties committee could still recommend within two months that a case against the commission’s failure to act be brought to the bloc’s highest tribunal, the Court of Justice of the European Union. “It’s a question of using what options are open to us,” he said, explaining the possible resort to litigation. In the vote on Thursday, the Parliament gave the European Commission two months to take legal measures to impose visas for American travelers to the European Union unless the Americans offered reciprocity to all citizens from the bloc. European officials in Brussels have balked at making travel to Europe more difficult for Americans, saying doing so would have an economic cost and would most likely not even resolve the hurdles facing citizens of the five affected countries. The Parliament’s measure was approved in a show of hands and was not expected to worsen the standoff with the United States. But in the event that the court in Luxembourg were to rule in favor of Parliament, the commission might be forced to impose visa requirements on Americans. The Trump administration, finding itself in a    battle over access, would then almost certainly do the same for travelers from the European Union. In 2014, the European Commission was notified that the United States and four other countries  —   Australia, Brunei, Canada and Japan  —   were failing to provide reciprocal,   travel to citizens of some European Union countries. Australia, Brunei and Japan have resolved differences with the European Union, and an agreement with Canada is expected to take effect in December for all citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, according to a statement from the European Parliament. Margaritis Schinas, the chief spokesman for the commission, appeared to tamp down any expectations that it would impose visa requirements on Americans within two months, as outlined in the Parliament resolution. Instead, he said he advocated “continued engagement and patient diplomatic contacts” with Washington. The commission will issue a progress report on discussions with the United States, he added, but not before the end of June.",0
11872,Democrats Jump on Allies of Donald Trump in Judge Dispute - The New York Times,"Democratic leaders nationwide sought to exact a political price from Republican officials and candidates on Monday for continuing to support Donald J. Trump after his explosive remarks challenging the objectivity of judges with Mexican or Muslim backgrounds. In an unusually coordinated series of attacks leveled from congressional offices and the Senate floor, in state capitols and sidewalk protests, Democrats excoriated Mr. Trump as racist and demanded that Republicans either stand behind his comments or condemn him and even rescind their endorsements of his candidacy. Democrats received unexpected ammunition from Mr. Trump himself, who, in an extraordinary conference call with allies on Monday, urged them to defend his criticisms of a federal judge’s Mexican heritage  —   and then rebuked his campaign staff for having suggested otherwise. Mr. Trump’s doggedness, and his chastisement of his own aides, contributed to a sense of powerlessness among Republicans who said they increasingly saw no way to influence Mr. Trump’s behavior or to convince him that his actions could hurt the party in competitive House, Senate and governor’s races. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has held discussions with Mr. Trump about his attacks on Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of Federal District Court, who is overseeing a suit against the   Trump University, according to a Republican briefed on the talks. But Mr. Priebus has had similar conversations over many months with Mr. Trump, to little avail. And other senior Republicans said there was confusion about whether it was worth approaching any of Mr. Trump’s aides about doing an intervention with him. Republican candidates in tough races this fall were left to fend for themselves. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called on Mr. Trump to retract his comments about Judge Curiel, calling them “offensive and wrong. ” Other candidates lay low. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a former rival of Mr. Trump’s, and Senator Susan Collins of Maine both criticized Mr. Trump, yet neither they nor Ms. Ayotte indicated that they would reject his candidacy. “I continue to hope that Mr. Trump will rethink his position and take back those words and show respect for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in our Constitution,” Ms. Collins said in an interview. “I continue to believe in redemption. ” No prominent elected Republican came to Mr. Trump’s defense unreservedly. And others found themselves wondering aloud what it would take  —   what Mr. Trump would have to say or do  —   for Republicans who have endorsed him to start jumping ship. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, another former primary rival of Mr. Trump’s, urged Republicans who have backed Mr. Trump to rescind their endorsements, citing the remarks about Judge Curiel and Mr. Trump’s expression of doubt on Sunday that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the same lawsuit, given Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim noncitizens entering the country. “This is the most   thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,” Mr. Graham said. “If anybody was looking for an   this is probably it,” he added. “There’ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary. ” Republican hopes that Mr. Trump would tone down his language and heed advice were also undercut after he laced into his own campaign team during a strategy discussion with political surrogates. On the conference call, reported first by the Bloomberg News website and later confirmed by two participants, Mr. Trump argued that talking points sent by his campaign to his allies, directing them not to discuss the Trump University case, were ill advised. “Take that order and throw it the hell out,” Mr. Trump said. He then went further in excoriating his campaign staff: “Are there any other stupid letters that were sent to you folks?” Mr. Trump said, according to the Bloomberg News report. “That’s one of the reasons I want to have this call, because you guys are getting sometimes stupid information from people that aren’t so smart. ” No other modern presidential campaign has unfolded like this, and gleeful Democrats have concluded that one of their best strategies for the general election is to hold Republicans accountable for each new Trump bombshell. In Indiana, state Democratic Party officials held a news conference on Monday to assail Mr. Trump’s remarks about Judge Curiel, who was born in the state and graduated from Indiana University’s law school. But the party’s chairman, John Zody, spent even more time criticizing Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican seeking   this year, and Republican House and Senate candidates in Indiana for being “completely silent on the fact that Donald Trump is questioning the integrity of a Hoosier. ” Only a few Republican officials in the state have criticized Mr. Trump’s comments as inappropriate. Outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, meanwhile, Melissa   the speaker of the New York City Council, and Councilman Carlos Menchaca told reporters that Mr. Trump’s comments about the judge were racist and xenophobic and reflected disrespect for the judiciary system. “He’s quite literally saying Judge Curiel can’t do his job because of his ethnicity. That is the definition of racism,” said Ms.   who is Puerto Rican. “It’s gross, it’s vile, and it is not normal behavior for anyone, let alone someone running to be the president of the United States. ” The Democratic offensive was more systematic and effective than earlier, scattershot attempts to link Republicans to Mr. Trump’s incendiary language and to his refusal to release his tax returns, among other actions. Hillary Clinton’s campaign was quick to act, putting out a video Monday morning that drew attention to Mr. Trump’s remarks and to some critical responses to him by other Republicans. Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, accused Senator Mark Kirk, the Republican she is challenging, of being “complicit” in Mr. Trump’s campaign of “hate and division” and of dodging Mr. Trump’s comments on Judge Curiel Mr. Kirk did not reply to requests for comment. Democrats in Nevada also held a news conference to draw attention to Mr. Trump’s remarks, while others publicized them to reporters in Ohio and Florida. On Capitol Hill, House Democrats held a private conference call to discuss how to apply pressure on the Republican leadership. “Trump’s incendiary comments about Judge Curiel were the final straw,” said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. He added, referring to Speaker Paul D. Ryan, “We’re not going to let Speaker Ryan and House Republicans spend every day criticizing Trump with one hand and endorsing him with the other. ” Texas Democrats are expected to try to hammer Mr. Trump when he visits their state in a week. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is preparing material to guide its candidates in attacking their opponents over Mr. Trump’s positions. It remains very unlikely that ambitious Republicans and those on the ballot this year will publicly break with Mr. Trump until it becomes politically advantageous for them. At the moment, Mr. Trump enjoys wide support from the sort of    Republican voters whom elected officials are loath to antagonize. Mr. Rubio, who has said he would speak at the Republican convention and personally apologized to Mr. Trump for making jokes about the size of his anatomy during the primary, confirmed in a Florida television interview that he would still support Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Trump expressed displeasure at criticism from his allies. In a Monday morning interview on Fox News, he faulted former Speaker Newt Gingrich for saying the Curiel attacks were “inexcusable. ” “I was surprised at Newt  —   I thought it was inappropriate what he said,” Mr. Trump said. The unified Democratic attack on Mr. Trump came on the final day of campaigning before primaries in California, New Jersey and several other states. In California, Mrs. Clinton blasted Mr. Trump as running a “campaign of insults,” and said: “I’m waiting for him to say  —   because of all the bigoted things he has said about women  —   that a woman judge couldn’t preside. ” Senator Bernie Sanders, also in California, insisted that he was still the Democrats’ best hope of defeating Mr. Trump. For other Democrats, though, Mr. Trump’s words were buoying hopes of a November resurgence. In a speech on the Senate floor as Congress returned from a break, the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, sought to yoke Mr. Trump to his counterpart, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  —   and to every Republican running this fall. Mr. Reid pointed out that Mr. McConnell, interviewed on NBC on Sunday, had “repeatedly refused to say Donald Trump’s attacks on Judge Curiel’s ethnicity are racist. ” “This is precisely the type of failure that gave rise to Donald Trump in the first place,” Mr. Reid said. “That’s because the hate emanating from Trump’s mouth reflects the Republican Party’s agenda here in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years. ”",0
11873,"As Double Dutch Wanes in New York, Competition Comes From Abroad - The New York Times","On a rainy night in Queens, Armani Graves leapt into the swirling ropes and started to move her feet. Soon the ropes  —   and her orange knee socks  —   were a blur as she jumped faster and faster in a cavernous gymnasium echoing with her teammates’ encouragement. “Knees up!” “Push!” Armani, 13, and her teammates were practicing competitive double dutch, the schoolyard game that was adopted and perfected by black girls in urban American communities after World War II. In recent decades, double dutch has evolved into a competitive sport, complete with rules, score sheets and tournaments. But it has also fallen out of favor in the neighborhoods where it was born and once flourished. “I’m one of the only kids who does double dutch in my school,” said Armani, a member of Stan’s Pepper Steppers, a   club, who lives in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. But even as double dutch has declined in popularity in New York City and across the United States, its appeal has surged beyond the country’s borders, with the number of teams from abroad soaring and many of them beating American teams at a sport that was invented here. Perhaps nothing illustrates double dutch’s international spread as much as the Double Dutch Holiday Classic, an annual tournament at the Apollo Theater in Harlem that bills itself as the Super Bowl of double dutch and will have its 25th anniversary on Sunday. In addition to teams from Queens, Brooklyn, Connecticut and South Carolina, there will be competitors from France and Japan. “The Double Dutch Classic is a perfect example of what’s happened,” said Kyra Gaunt, a professor of sociology and anthropology at Baruch College and author of “The Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes From   to  . ” “For the last 15 years, almost every freestyle competition has been won by groups that are outside the United States. ” As Stan’s Pepper Steppers were practicing Wednesday night in a community center in Queens, five teams from Japan were aboard a   flight to New York. On Thursday, a Japanese team called Big Up, still   rehearsed in Central Park for this weekend’s tournament, the Midtown skyline looming behind them. While the Queens team is known for its swiftness  —   members hold various speed records  —   Japan’s competitors are renowned for their choreographed,   style. Two of the five members of the coed team Big Up, including Koichiro Sugawa, were trained as dancers. Mr. Sugawa, 21, first tried double dutch when he began college. “I simply thought it was cool,” he said. The organizer of the Japanese trip, Jun Haratake, was a competitor in high school and then at his   university in Tokyo, where the double dutch club had 100 members. Now 36, Mr. Haratake is the director and   of the Japan Double Dutch Association, a nonprofit organization. From 2004 to 2008, Mr. Haratake studied English in New York and worked as a physical education teacher in a Japanese school. He recalls taking the subway to the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and joining teenage girls in   jam sessions  —   akin to a golfer traveling to St. Andrews in Scotland. Double dutch, he said, is still ascendant in Japan. “It’s continuing to grow in popularity,” he said. In New York City, its transformation into a competitive sport started in the 1970s, when a former police sergeant in Harlem, David A. Walker, decided that girls needed a way to channel their athletic skill. He founded the National Double Dutch League, a nonprofit group that sponsors the annual tournament at the Apollo. He also developed rules and worked with the city’s schools to incorporate double dutch into gym classes and intramural programs. “In the 1970s, there were not a lot of programs for girls,” said Lauren Walker, Mr. Walker’s daughter, who assumed leadership of the league after his death in 2008. “Boys had baseball, basketball and football. My father saw some girls jumping double dutch in a schoolyard one day and said, ‘Hey, let’s turn an urban activity into an actual sport. ’” In 2009, the city’s Department of Education made double dutch a varsity sport in nearly a dozen high schools, mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods like   and Harlem. The idea was to increase the number of students, girls in particular, who participate in competitive sports. Yet despite the imprimatur of school officials, and clubs like Stan’s Pepper Steppers, double dutch veterans and observers of black youth say the activity has slowly lost its appeal as a spontaneous form of play. They blame the lure of social media and video games. “Back in the day, there were no computers,” Ms. Walker said. “Kids are just not as physically active anymore. ” Dr. Gaunt, who is an ethnomusicologist and social media researcher, agreed. “Most girls spend most of their time on Instagram or Tumblr, or with games online, rather than outside,” she said. “That’s true across all demographic groups. But double dutch is a street sport. It’s so common now to meet    girls who have never  . That wasn’t the case 20 years ago. ” But in countries from Latin America to Asia, the sport has been embraced as part of a love affair with   culture. (The impresario Malcolm McLaren put it on the map as far back as 1983 with his hit song “Double Dutch. ”) Since the 1980s, double dutch organizations and competitions have emerged across the globe. In the last decade in Europe, championship tournaments have been held in Denmark, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. In Japan, it has spread though clubs in high schools and colleges. Mr. Haratake said that at least half of the members of his university’s double dutch club were studying physical education, adding that they would most likely spread the sport as future teachers. But double dutch still casts a spell on some teenagers in New York  —   mostly girls, but the occasional boy, too. Young competitors say it combines art and athleticism and also improves their performance in other sports. Armani Graves, for example, plays flag football and runs track. “I’m one of the fastest runners in my school because of double dutch,” she said. During practice, Javon Langston, 14, a member of the Pepper Steppers, had just pulled off a series of tricks inside the swirling ropes, including an aerial, a   and a flip, and he did not get tangled. “I like the freestyle the most because it shows your creativity,” he said modestly. His mother, Reneé Langston, nodded her approval. “It keeps him positive and active and off the streets,” she said. “It has definitely made him a better young adult. ” Dr. Gaunt lamented that there weren’t more funds available to allow the city’s double dutch champions to travel to international competitions. “The girls here who jump don’t get to go to Morocco and France and Germany,” she said. “A lot of the teams in Far Rockaway and Brooklyn don’t have that kind of money. So the descendants of the culture from which double dutch emerged do not have the same resources to compete. ”",0
11874,The French Fear Islamization but Do Nothing,"Posted on November 4, 2016 The French Fear Islamization but Do Nothing Guillaume Durocher, American Renaissance, November 2, 2016 Not even the Front National is prepared to act. 
In his classic study Democracy in America , Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about Southerners’ attitudes towards the rapidly expanding population of Blacks: 
In the states of the South, they are quiet; they do not speak about the future to foreigners; they avoid explaining themselves with their friends; everyone is in denial about it even with themselves. There is something more frightening about the silence of the South than the noisy fears of the North. [1] 
Almost two centuries later, there is a similar attitude of denial among French politicians about the steady Afro-Islamization of France. Conservatives are happy to talk about “Islamic totalitarianism,” “secularism,” “burkinis,” etc, but not the underlying problem, which is continued Muslim immigration. Socialists recognize the problem in private, but do nothing either to stop the flood of Africans and Muslims. There is something surreal about the situation. 
The most striking example of awareness combined with inactivity was provided recently by the publication of a book of exclusive interviews with our painfully uncharismatic and ineffectual president, the Socialist François Hollande. Among Mr. Hollande’s statements , one finds: On conservative politician Nadine Morano’s saying that France is “a country of the white race” (quoting Charles de Gaulle): “I am convinced that, when one asks the French, the majority have her position. [. . .] They think: ‘We are for the most part Whites. There are more Whites than others.’ ” On Islamic immigration: “There are at the same time things which work very well and the accumulation of potential bombs linked to a continuous immigration. Because it continues.” On the salience of race in politics: “The Left cannot win on the theme of identity, but it can lose on the theme of identity.” On ethnic segregation and potential civil war: “How can we avoid partition? Because that is really what is happening: partition.” 
Mr. Hollande recognizes that integration, let alone assimilation, is not happening and that “at some point [immigration] will have to stop.” And yet, during his four years as president, he has done nothing to stop it. Instead, his government has radically increased the rate of naturalizations of foreigners , providing the flagging Socialists with thousands of new voters in time for national elections next spring. 
On the Right, we have the conservative party, now called “Les Républicains,” led by former president Nicolas Sarkozy. He knows racial problems well, having made a career from a sort of low-level race-baiting while, as president, actually letting more immigrants settle in France than his Socialist predecessors. Mr. Sarkozy is also well aware of the medium-term existential threat to France. As he said recently at a political meeting: 
The Sahel will in 30 years have 200 million inhabitants. There are 6 to 8 children per family on average in the Sahel. Can we continue family reunification in these conditions? Is the future of the Sahel’s children to end up in our cities’ neighborhoods? Even though we have no jobs, no housing, and we no longer have the means to pay benefits for families who do not pay one cent in taxes. 
Well said! But can Mr. Sarkozy claim to have been unaware of these facts while he was president from 2007 to 2012? The end of family reunification would be welcome, but in the face of the demographic threat to France and all of Europe, this is like fending off a rhinoceros with a water-pistol. Other than this, Mr. Sarkozy has mainly been trying to win the conservative party primaries by complaining about “burkinis” and demanding “assimilation.” However, as a former adviser Patrick Buisson –a Rightist who recently published a book on his disenchantment with Mr. Sarkozy–has said: “He is ready to say what is needed to get elected and to then do nothing.” French police ask a woman to remove some of her clothing to comply with a ban on “burkinis.” 
The gravity of the situation is matched only by the sheer fecklessness of European politicians . According to United Nations statistics, the population of Europe (including a growing proportion of highly-fertile non-Whites) will stagnate and decline this century while that of Africa is set to quadruple to a whopping 4 billion. The most important, tragic, horrifying, ungodly, evil question facing Western Civilization and mankind this century is this: Will Europe turn African ? 
Books warning against Islamization, whether by journalists or second-rate politicians, top the best-seller lists, but most French people care more about welfare and pay checks than long-term considerations. Even on economic issues, they would rather stay in denial, vaguely hoping the problems of a heavily state-run French economy in an inefficient Eurozone monetary union will sort themselves out on their own, rather than ask hard questions. Ethno-religious questions are even more inconceivable. 
It is true that diversity is not yet an unmanageable problem in the daily lives of most Frenchmen, aside from the unpleasant evening news about Muslims shooting up hundreds of people at a rock concert, running down dozens of people with a truck on Bastille Day, or trying to burn policemen to death . Incidentally, the last time France’s religious homogeneity was broken–during the Protestant Reformation–this led to a civil war between Catholics and Protestants. 
We are told that mass government surveillance, abrogation of civil liberties, and mass murder by the fanatics of a Middle Eastern religion are the price we pay for enjoying the fruits of diversity. And if you don’t like it, you will join the scores of European patriots who have been fined and even jailed under anti-free-speech laws for “inciting hatred.” (By the way, France has passed special laws to counter the Islamic terrorism. These same laws have been invoked to spy on thousands of patriots who have been designated as “security threats.”) 
Nonetheless, the current offering for next spring’s presidential elections in France is dismal. Besides Mr. Hollande and Mr. Sarkozy, with whom the French are thoroughly disenchanted, there is the frontrunner in the conservative primaries, Alain Juppé, a felon guilty of misusing public funds, who is proud of France’s “diversity.” He speaks of France’s new “happy identity,” and is being called a “steady,” “serious” candidate–who will change nothing. As mayor of Bordeaux, he noted that 60 percent of the students in some of his schools are “foreign-language speakers,” but appeared to think this was nothing worse than an exciting challenge. 
Then there is the eternal promise of the Front National, a party that has risen to unprecedented heights in polls and secondary elections. But this has come at a significant cost: Marine Le Pen has gone to great lengths to “detoxify” the party and stay within the bounds acceptable to France’s heavily policed and state-dependent mainstream media. The “new FN” talks more about dismantling the European Union and the Euro than about identity and Islam, let alone race. 
Marine Le Pen is breaking no new ground in the fight against political incorrectness, in contrast with the Alternative for Germany’s Frauke Petry on the other side of the Rhine. And yet, a solid two-thirds of French people still strongly oppose Miss Le Pen. She will probably reach the second-round runoff of the presidential elections and then lose in a landslide, though surely with a better score than her father’s 18 percent in 2002. The majority of Frenchmen are likely to be repelled by the prospect of an FN government that represents the working classes and the ethnocentric fringe. The conservatives, for their part, have refused to work with the FN ever since the French branch of the B’nai B’rith asked them to in 1986 . Marine Le Pen 
The most groundbreaking politician in France today is probably the mayor of Béziers, Robert Ménard, who, in a former life as a leftist, founded Reporters Without Borders, but now calls himself a reactionary. He has broken French law by counting the city’s school children by religion–he found that 65 percent were Muslim, judging from their first names. He wants to reinstate the death penalty, opposes homosexual marriage, and he visited a refugee center to tell the occupants they are not welcome in France. Recently he proposed a municipal referendum to reject the imposition of “refugees” on his town. 
Disenchantment is severe among the French: 83 percent think Mr. Hollande is “disqualified” as president due to his failure on unemployment. Two-thirds think Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande were equally bad presidents , and a solid majority, continuously egged on by a hostile media, are “worried” by Marine Le Pen . I am inclined to agree with best-selling author Éric Zemmour , whose latest book is Un Quinquennat Pour Rien (“A Five-Year Term for Nothing”), when he says that the next year’s elections are pointless. 
Why is there such a divide between the aspirations of French voters and the politicians on offer? I believe this can be explained only by the authoritarian cliquishness of the French political system: The parties and the media serve as critical choke points to prevent the penetration of nationalist and identitarian movements that might appeal to a majority of the French people. No Trump-like figure–half independent billionaire half media personality–has emerged to break this stranglehold by uniting the nationalist fringe of the disenfranchised white working class with mainstream conservative voters. 
All this is depressing, but one must not forget that, as the great European historian Dominique Venner said: “History is nothing but a set of strategic surprises.” The presidential elections are in April and May, and six months is a long time in politics. France cannot remain unaffected by the enormous political and cultural gains made in recent years by nationalists across the West. Happy surprises do happen. If Donald Trump were to win, this would set a patriotic and anti-immigration precedent for many Europeans governments. There is a long tradition of opportunistic European politicians slavishly following the American political and cultural lead. 
The mainstream political establishments across Europe are reeling from the economic crisis, the migrant invasion, and–one must not underestimate this–the mainstream media’s own economic and legitimacy crisis due to the rise of alternative media. These establishments are merely trying, in a dull bovine reflex, to keep the ship on course without ever questioning their premises. But this is proving harder and harder. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who for her role in opening the floodgates to Afro-Islamic colonization is an objective enemy of Europe, is facing real problems. Her party, the so-called Christian-Democratic Union, has reached its lowest ever levels of support , falling to less than 30 percent. 
The critical media-political choke points of power in the “democratic” West–particularly in America, Germany, and France–are more open for takeover than ever. If one or two go, particularly America, many of the rest are likely to follow. If we are lucky, a major shift towards national-populist governments could be possible. This would appeal to the great majority of our people and drastically reduce the pace of dispossession. And that could be a prelude for far greater things to come.",0
11875,Fmr Obama Official Reveals Pre-Inauguration Effort to Gather Intel on Incoming Trump Team - Breitbart,"Back on March 2’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of defense under Obama, backed up a March 1 New York Times report revealing an effort to gather as much intelligence on    Donald Trump and his campaign and transition team’s ties to Russia.  “I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,” Farkas, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said. “Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy   …     that the Trump folks  —   if they found out how we knew what we knew about their  —   the Trump staff dealing with Russians  —   that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence. So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill. ” (  Fox News) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
11876,Gun Ownership in LGBT Community Continues Surge Under Trump,"The surge in gun ownership among LGBT community members that began after the June 12, 2016, Orlando Pulse attack has continued and even grown during the first months of the presidency of Donald Trump. [Haaretz reports, “The latest   wave, following the June 2016 mass shooting at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida, has brought a new kind of person to the gun culture  —   young and liberal gay people, many of them  . They’re now standing side by side with straight white conservative men at shooting ranges. ”  The Orlando Pulse nightclub was a   zone and the attack on it was carried out by an Islamist with two guns a rifle and a handgun. He passed background checks for both guns and a   waiting period for the handgun, proving once more that gun control is no hindrance to determined attackers. Many in the LGBT community came away from the attack awakened to this fact and to the reality that they were going to have to take   into their own hands —  literally. Enter the Pink Pistols. Prior to the Orlando Pulse attack “the Pink Pistols Facebook group numbered about 1, 500 people. ” But following the attack “sixteen Pink Pistols branches opened  …     and the Facebook group grew to 9, 000 members. ” Pink Pistols spokesperson Gwendolyn Patton said: We teach queers to shoot so they can be safer from those who would harm them for who and what they are. Then we tell the world we’ve done it, so those who think queer people are helpless targets who can’t fight back and are easy pickings for violence will know that it isn’t necessarily true   …    . We don’t want to have to shoot anyone. We’d much rather they decided it wasn’t worth the risk and went to play pool or something. On June 12, 2016, just hours after the Orlando Pulse occurred, Breitbart News quoted Patton saying, “Let us not reach for the   fruit of blaming the killer’s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human being’s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person’s soul. ” Patton admitted that it is difficult to carry guns in the bars of some states because of   prohibitions. But she suggested this can often be remedied by a selecting designated driver who agrees to forgo any alcohol for the night so that that he can carry a gun with which to protect his companions. Patton said, “It’s sad that we must consider such things, but when there are persons out there who mean us harm, we must find ways to protect ourselves within the law. ” Erin Palette is transgender who lives 60 miles from Orlando and has concealed carry permit. Palette recalled how the LGBT community’s view of owning guns for   appeared to change overnight —  following Orlando Pulse —  and how gun ranges and firearms training facilities across the country were eager to help: I started seeing this wonderful outpouring of support from gun owners who were posting all across social media that if you were LGTBQ and wanted to learn how to defend yourself, these gun owners would teach you shooting for absolutely free. And the sentiment was: ‘I don’t care what your politics are, I don’t care what your sexuality is, I don’t care what you have between your legs  —   you are a human being, you have the inherent right to defend yourself, and if you don’t know how, I will be happy to teach you.’",0
11877,Comment on 11 Things To Let Go Of Before The New Year by 11 Things To Let Go Of Before The New Year – Motivate3.com,"  The new year is almost here and it’s often a time when we all start to think about what we want to change for the next year. I’ve never been much a fan of the whole cliche of changing because of the new year, but why not embrace it as a time where we can make change?   Do a quick reflection right now. Do you feel like you have followed your dreams and passions this past year? Do you feel you got caught up in the stresses of life quite often? Did you feel judgement, negative self talk and anger were a big part of your days? Reflecting on how you’ve felt over your year and being honest with yourself about it gives you the chance to know how to adjust and move forward from this moment forward whether it be the new year or not. I’ve found in my own life that if I don’t pay attention to how I feel, what I create, what’s playing out in my life and take responsibility for it, it doesn’t change. It stays the same, I experience the same emotions or stagnant feelings, and I don’t move forward. But the moment I decide to take it into my own hands, I see how much I’m not a victim to what happens. 11 Things To Let Go of Before the New year 1. Stop all the negative self talk – It’s first because it’s probably one of the most important. The more we talk poorly about ourselves to ourselves or others, the more we disempower ourselves and empower all the things we wish to adjust about ourselves. Observe it, take note of it, and kick it. It’s not helping you. 2. Choose one bad eating habit and kick it! – Taking care of and fuelling your vessel is one of the most important things we can do in life to stay mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy. Pick one of your worst eating habits and aim to cut it out completely in 3 months. Whatever it might be, be honest with yourself and make it happen. Then take on the next bad eating habit in 3 months. 3. Let go of chasing ‘success’– So often we put up goals or plans for ourselves yet have this tiny limited scope of what success is. Next thing you know we bring stress, worry and fear into the equation throughout the whole journey because we may not be totally in line to hit this pin prick point of what success looks like to us. Instead, do your best to take the steps needed to get to where you want to go, but let go of the lure of success and what it looks like and means. There’s no such thing as failure. (more)   4. Kick the idea that you cannot achieve or follow your dreams – So often we have our ideas of what we are excited or passionate about, but let it go because we think we can’t do it or because it’s unrealistic. Instead of believing every word of that, take ONE step. One step towards making your passion or your dreams happen. The one step will lead to the next and the next, but you have to take the first one. Plan out that first step and take it! 5. Let go of the idea that you should run from your problems – We often get into this mentality that we just need to “get over it.” In theory this sounds sorta good, you move on from things that happen in the past or something to that effect. But by just forgetting about it, did we really move on? No, it gets triggered again later or lies dormant as a resented event etc. Instead, let’s face our problems and truly move past them. Journal about it, talk to someone else about it. Put the cards on the table to someone who cares about you and who can help you move past it. Pick someone who will see the bigger picture and be honest with you. You have all it takes to move past what challenges you. 6. Stop comparing yourself to others – This is a big one. So often we are looking at others and using what they have, do or are to compare it against us and make up a story. This whole game can make us sad or feel down about ourselves or it can feed our ego in a big way. Let it go, respect everyone’s journey, including your own and stop the need to compare yourself to others.   7. Stop judging others – Judging other people can become a habit and an addiction. It’s like something we can’t stop doing sometimes! Take a moment the next time you judge someone and observe it. Ask yourself why you did it, how did it make you feel? Etc. Make a conscious effort to stop. (more) 8. Stop the blame game – Blaming and pointing fingers when it comes to our challenges or what happens to us doesn’t allow us to look at and observe how we might have created or aligned with an experience to help make it happen. I’m not saying there’s no such things others can do to hurt you, I’m simply saying take responsibility for how you feel and don’t even point blame, it doesn’t help us. 9. Stop worrying and trying so hard to fit in and be accepted – This is something far too many of us do just to save face and not be “the weird one.” The reality is, it’s more ‘weird’ to be a version of yourself that isn’t genuine or real simply because you want to be accepted by others. It’s a choice you can’t maintain forever and the longer it goes the more uncomfortable you will feel. Be you, accept yourself, be genuine and don’t try to make others do the same when. Let it happen. Trust. 10. Let go of the need to control everything – Sometimes we can’t take a step forward in anything because we don’t know all the answers or all the variables. This is our obsession with control sometimes. Yes, observe a situation and make the best choices available to you, but don’t worry so much about needing to control or know every detail about it. Learn to leave things up to trust and knowing that things will work out as they need to. This doesn’t mean be reckless, just that you don’t need to control every thing, person and detail. 11. Stop procrastinating – This one goes with everything on the list. Stop putting it all off. Whatever it may be. The changes listed above, the hobby you want to, the career you want to explore, or the thing you want to tell to someone important to you. Stop putting it off and just do it!

11878,"Alex Tizon, Journalist Who Wrote of Alienation as Asian-American, Dies at 57 - The New York Times","Alex Tizon, a Pulitzer   reporter whose   2014 memoir documented his insecurities and alienation as a   was found dead on March 23 in his home in Eugene, Ore. He was 57. His wife, Melissa, said that he had died in his sleep and that the cause had not yet been determined. At The Seattle Times, where he shared a Pulitzer in investigative reporting in 1997, and later at The Los Angeles Times, where he was Seattle bureau chief, Mr. Tizon (pronounced  ) was admired as a prose stylist and was known for long, deeply reported articles. He wrote of his own life in “Big Little Man: In Search of My Asian Self. ” In the book, he addressed many of the stereotypes he had internalized as an   having experienced them “as a set of suspicions that seemed corroborated by everyday life. ” “When did this shame inside me begin?” he wrote. “Looking back now, I could say it began with love. Love of the gifted people and their imagined life love of America, the sprawling idea of it, with its gilded tentacles reaching across the Pacific Ocean to wrap around the hearts of small brown people living small brown lives. It was a love bordering on worship, fueled by longing, felt most fervently by those like my parents who grew up with America in their dreams. The love almost killed us. ” Mr. Tizon’s memoir detailed his struggle to find masculine Asian role models in Western popular culture and his childhood attempts to make himself look whiter. He recalled dangling from trees to stretch his vertebrae and pinching his nose with a clothespin to narrow it. “‘Big Little Man’ is an unflinchingly honest, at times beautifully written, often discomforting examination of Tizon’s remarkable, yet thoroughly relatable, life,” Jay Caspian Kang wrote in The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Tizon said in an online interview with The Boston Globe last year that he thought life had grown better for  . “I have nephews who are just worldbeaters,” he said. “They read my book, and yeah, they can relate to some of it. But a sense of inferiority? No. That’s just not there. ” Michele Matassa Flores, the managing editor of The Seattle Times, said in a phone interview that as a reporter Mr. Tizon “focused on the gray” rather than seeing the world in black and white. “The world was not a simple place for Alex,” she added, “and he wanted to convey that to his readers. ” On one assignment Mr. Tizon rode through the streets of Seattle with a gang during a period of growing violence in the city in the late 1980s. He also wrote a series of profiles, “Crossing America: Dispatches From a New Nation,” for which he traveled across the country with the photographer Alan Berner after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Tizon, along with Eric Nalder and Deborah Nelson, won the Pulitzer Prize for articles about problems facing a Department of Housing and Urban Development program to help Native Americans build homes. The articles chronicled dysfunction and incompetence within the department, corruption and nepotism at the tribal level, and misallocation of funds at Indian reservations around the country. In many cases, the articles showed, the result was overcrowded hovels for most and   mansions for a connected few. “It is not much more than a large plywood box, this house Thelma Moses calls home,” one article began. “To stand outside it is to wonder how such dimensions  —   10 feet by 12 feet  —   can enclose a life. ” The series resulted in a congressional investigation and changes in the federal program. Tomas Alexander Tizon was born in Manila on Oct. 30, 1959. His parents, Francisco Tizon and the former Leticia Asuncion, used borrowed money to bring their family to Los Angeles in 1964. The Tizon family lived in Seattle and the South Bronx before settling in Oregon. Alex graduated from high school in Salem, Ore. in 1977 and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Oregon. He received a master’s degree in journalism from Stanford University in 1986, the year he joined The Seattle Times. Mr. Tizon left The Los Angeles Times in 2008, and in 2011 he began teaching at the University of Oregon in Eugene and writing freelance articles for national publications, including The Atlantic.

11880,Media’s Next Challenge: Overcoming the Threat of Fake News - The New York Times,"The last year has turned the United States into a country of information addicts who compulsively check the television, the smartphone and the good   newspaper with a burning question: What fresh twist could our national election drama and its executive producer, Donald J. Trump, possibly have in store for us now? No doubt about it: Campaign 2016 has been a smash hit. And to the news media have gone the spoils. With Mr. Trump providing   TV theatrics, cable news has drawn record audiences. Newspapers have reached online readership highs that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. On Wednesday comes the reckoning. The election news bubble that’s about to pop has blocked from plain view the expanding financial sinkhole at the center of the    branch of the news industry, which has recently seen a print advertising plunge that was “much more precipitous, to be honest with you, than anybody expected a year or so ago,” as The Wall Street Journal editor in chief Gerard Baker told me on Friday. Papers including The Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian, the Gannett publications and others have responded with plans to reorganize, shed staff, kill off whole sections, or all of the above. Taken together, it means another rapid depletion in the nation’s ranks of traditionally trained journalists whose main mission is to root out corruption, hold the powerful accountable and sort fact from fiction for voters. It couldn’t be happening at a worse moment in American public life. The   forces that are eating away at print advertising are enabling a host of   players to pollute the democracy with dangerously fake news items. In the last couple of weeks, Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets have exposed millions of Americans to false stories asserting that: the Clinton campaign’s pollster, Joel Benenson, wrote a secret memo detailing plans to “salvage” Hillary Clinton’s candidacy by launching a radiological attack to halt voting (merrily shared on Twitter by Roger Stone, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign) the Clinton campaign senior strategist John Podesta practiced an occult ritual involving various bodily fluids Mrs. Clinton is paying public pollsters to skew results (shared on Twitter by Donald Trump Jr.) there is a trail of supposedly suspicious deaths of myriad Clinton foes (which The Times’s Frank Bruni heard repeated in a hotel lobby in Ohio). As Mike Cernovich, a Twitter star,   news provocateur and promoter of Clinton health conspiracies, boasted in last week’s New Yorker, “Someone like me is perceived as the new Fourth Estate. ” His content can live alongside that of The Times or The Boston Globe or The Washington Post on the Facebook newsfeed and be just as well read, if not more so. On Saturday he called on a President Trump to disband the White House press corps. He may not have to. All you have to do is look at the effect of the Gannett cuts on its Washington staff, which Politico recently likened to a “blood bath. ” Even before this year’s ad revenue drop, the number of   daily journalists  —   nearly 33, 000 according to the 2015 census conducted by the American Society of News Editors and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Florida International University  —   was on the way to being half what it was in 2000. That contraction in the reporting corps, combined with the success of disinformation this year, is making for some sleepless nights for those in Washington who will have to govern in this bifurcated,     environment. “It’s the biggest crisis facing our democracy, the failing business model of real journalism,” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and a longtime critic of fake news, told me on Saturday. Ms. McCaskill said that “journalism is partly to blame” for being slow to adjust as the internet turned its business model upside down and social media opened the competitive floodgates. “Fake news got way out ahead of them,” she said. It does not augur well for the future. Martin Baron, the Washington Post executive editor, said when we spoke last week, “If you have a society where people can’t agree on basic facts, how do you have a functioning democracy?” The cure for fake journalism is an overwhelming dose of good journalism. And how well the news media gets through its postelection hangover will have a lot to do with how the next chapter in the American political story is told. That’s why the dire financial reports from American newsrooms are so troubling. If the national reporting corps is going to be reduced even more during such an   readership boom, what are things going to look like when the circus leaves town? I surveyed the higher precincts of the industry last week, and what I found wasn’t entirely gloomy there was even some cause for optimism. But there’s going to be a lot of   and some bloodletting on the way to deliverance. It’s pretty much taken as a given that the news audience will largely shrink next year, despite what is expected to be a compelling news environment. “Is anything in 2017, politically speaking, going to be as sexy as it was in 2016? I’m not going to play poker at that table,” Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, told me on Friday. Still, though he’s predicting a ratings fall of 30 percent or perhaps “much more” at MSNBC, he said, “I don’t have financial pressure on my bottom line. ” That’s not only because MSNBC and its competitors earned tens of millions of unexpected   dollars this year, but also because they still draw substantial income from cable subscriber fees. Newspapers are the originators of that   setup. But as lucrative print ads dwindle, and Facebook and Google gobble up more than   of the online advertising market, affecting   outlets, too, newspapers are scrambling to build up their subscriber bases and break their reliance on print ads. Mr. Baker of The Journal said he was confident that newspapers could make the transition but acknowledged a rough interim period that will require cuts and will be even harder to navigate or survive for smaller, regional papers (a practical invitation to municipal corruption). The cause for relative optimism comes from the performance of some of the more ambitious,   newspaper articles of the last year. The Times article revealing Mr. Trump’s nearly $1 billion tax loss in 1995 drew some 5. 5 million page views. That’s huge. The Washington Post doesn’t share its numbers, but behold the more than 13, 000 online comments attached to just one of David A. Fahrenthold’s articles about how Mr. Trump ran his charity in ways that clashed with philanthropic moral conventions. But in this new era, subscriber numbers are more important than    readership. Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, The Times’s newly named deputy publisher, pointed to a bright spot in last week’s earnings report. Mixed in with a   drop in print advertising revenue (!) was a 21 percent increase in digital advertising and, more important, the addition of 116, 000 new   subscriptions. The Times now has nearly 1. 6 million subscribers to its   offerings. “It shows people are willing to pay for great, original, deeply reported and expert journalism,” Mr. Sulzberger said. “That will allow great journalism to thrive. ” It could be Pollyannaish to think so, but maybe this year’s explosion in fake news will serve to raise the value of real news. If so, it will be great journalism that saves journalism. “People will ultimately gravitate toward sources of information that are truly reliable, and have an allegiance to telling the truth,” Mr. Baron said. “People will pay for that because they’ll realize they’ll need to have that in our society. ” As The Times’s national political correspondent Jonathan Martin wrote on Twitter last week, “Folks, subscribe to a paper. Democracy demands it. ” Or don’t. You’ll get what you pay for.",0

Just like we are seeing now, from time-to-time the paper gold market swamps the physical gold market, but amazingly the physical gold market seems to keep edging up and helping the longer-term upward trend of the gold price… IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. 
John Ing continues: “Sure we get these high-frequency trades to the downside every now and then, but it’s becoming more and more difficult to push the price of gold lower. 
Russia Adding To Its Gold Hoard What we are seeing is steady accumulation of physical gold. For example, recently Russia added 13 tonnes of gold to their growing hoard in the month of September. In fact, the Russians have now been purchasing gold for 20 months in a row. 
China’s Relentless Gold Demand Continues We also have China, who continues to be a large buyer. In fact, imports of gold were up 9 percent in the month of September. Eric, the problem is that everybody tends to look at the numbers out of China but they really don’t know how to interpret them. As an example, the most important thing in the recently released figures is the fact that the banks in China across the board continue to be buyers of physical gold. This data is supported by the Shanghai Gold Exchange, which is now the largest physical gold market in the world. 
India’s Gold Demand Soars A Staggering 25 Percent! But despite the shenanigans in the paper gold market, the bears are pushing against the seasonal strength of India and Diwali. In fact, India’s physical gold demand was up a staggering 25 percent! So yes, there has been steady, steady physical gold demand. 
Against this very strong physical gold backdrop there have been a lot fewer physical supplies of gold. We have just seen in the last quarter that there were mixed results for the producers. We have seen many companies encountering production problems. That tells me that even at the higher price of gold, some of these mining companies are still having difficulty. This negatively affects the total annual gold production. In fact, next year I am looking for lower production from a lot of these producers. So that will further tighten an already strained physical market. 
Gold Bears May Get Torched Here In closing, keep in mind what I said in my latest piece (on KWN), that we will see an overnight $100 spike in the price of gold if Donald Trump wins the election. In the event that the bears are caught on the wrong side of that trade, they will experience tremendous pain.”

11884,Trump’s a Businessman. Where’s His Business Backing? - The New York Times,"Should it come as a surprise that not one chief executive among the Fortune 100 has donated money to Donald Trump’s campaign? That was the news reported by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend after tabulating the latest donation disclosures through August. Mr. Trump’s supporters trumpeted, excuse the pun, the lack of donations from the nation’s largest companies as a badge of honor. Big business, they say, has failed the country, so why would their guy want its support? But the logic of this argument is backward. Mr. Trump has campaigned as a successful businessman, a brilliant negotiator and someone, as he said in his own words, who can “get along with people. ” He has contended that his economic policies will unleash   levels of growth  —   as much as 6 percent. He plans to lower corporate taxes, remove regulations and allow companies to repatriate cash held overseas. Together, these policies sound like a C. E. O. ’s dream. And yet here we are: Many of the most successful business people in the country refuse to support him  —   or do business with him, either. This is not an opinion. In case there is any doubt, here is a list of companies that in the last two years have publicly severed or reduced business relationships with Mr. Trump, mostly over his inflammatory rhetoric: Macy’s, Univision, Comcast’s NBCUniversal, Serta, Disney’s ESPN, the PGA Tour, Nascar and Perfumania. Those companies, which have customer bases that include broad swaths of the nation that ostensibly look like the electorate, all said some variation of what Macy’s said: “In light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy’s values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump. ” As this column has noted previously, virtually no big United States banking institution has done new business with Mr. Trump in years, in part because of his history of bankruptcies and his penchant for litigation. During orientation for new employees, Goldman Sachs specifically used to use Mr. Trump as an example of the kind of prospective client to avoid. Still, based on Mr. Trump’s policies, you would think that companies like Apple or Nike, which have railed for lower taxes and are pining to bring tens of billions dollars stashed abroad back to the United States, would be kneeling at the altar of Mr. Trump. (Apple’s and Nike’s chief executives have contributed to Mrs. Clinton.) Granted, there are his views on immigration and trade, which aren’t in sync with United States multinational companies that manufacture products abroad. But then again, Mrs. Clinton opposes the   Partnership too, so that doesn’t provide much of a choice. Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric’s chief executive, who employed Mr. Trump on “The Apprentice” when G. E. owned NBC, was asked by Vanity Fair about him over the summer. “The Donald Trump that I had a chance to work with, I found to be fun to work with,” he said. “The words? I can’t reconcile with anything I believe in, or that I think the country stands for or that the company stands for. ” By the way, this was Mr. Trump’s reply last year to businesses that stopped doing business with him: “Macy’s, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. ” (I should note here that I   “Squawk Box” on CNBC, which is a unit of NBCUniversal.) In fairness, it is worth pointing out that only 11 C. E. O.s of the Fortune 100 donated to Hillary Clinton, according to The Journal. Mr. Trump does have support from some businessmen like Jack Welch, Carl C. Icahn and Wilbur Ross, among others. But for a group that has historically leaned Republican, the absence of contributions is   particularly since at least 19 of them gave to the other Republican candidates in the primaries. There is a good reason, wholly unrelated to political correctness, that the business community has not rallied around Mr. Trump’s economic plans. On its merits, that plan is expected to hurt the economy, according to nonpartisan economists. It is hard to find many serious economists, except a handful mostly advising his campaign, who say otherwise. According to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan think tank that includes a list of luminaries from both sides of the aisle, Mr. Trump’s economic plan would add $5. 3 trillion to our national debt. That compares with $200 billion as a result of Mrs. Clinton’s plan. “Both Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law —   though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more, and Clinton’s plan would slightly reduce deficits if we incorporated unspecified revenue from business tax reform,” the committee wrote. None of this column is meant to suggest that Mrs. Clinton’s economic plan will usher in a new age of stupendous growth. It won’t. It doesn’t fully address the need for corporate tax reform, and it won’t bring many companies out from under the regulatory morass that they suffer. It won’t bring trillions of dollars back from abroad. Her plan is unlikely to pump up the economy much compared with the path that we are currently on. It is very possible some of her policy measures could even slow the economy. And finally  —   again  —   there is the issue of trade. A centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s economic agenda is renegotiating many of the country’s trade agreements. In a new report published by his campaign, Mr. Trump’s advisers suggest he would threaten, for example, to leave the World Trade Organization to get a better deal. “Without the U. S. as a member, there would not be much purpose to the W. T. O. ,” the advisers wrote. There is no question that the country would be improved by better trade pacts, but Mr. Trump’s risky approach could start a trade war that could be disastrous for the country’s largest companies. And the uncertainty of the negotiations themselves could slow the economy and rattle our foreign neighbors just look at the resignation of Mexico’s minister of finance for helping bring Mr. Trump there to    with the Mexican president. Other countries will want to avoid similar situations in which they could look like they are caving in to Mr. Trump. (By the way, for those who say, “Who cares about what happens to big businesses that outsource anyway?” think about all the money in all those 401( k) plans that is invested in them.) The Trump economic report cites the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing big business, and its complaints about regulatory burdens. The suggestion is that big business will back Mr. Trump, since he plans to reduce regulation. Yet it is hardly clear the Business Roundtable supports him. The organization has not endorsed either candidate, and its chief executive, John Engler, told The New York Times over the summer: “We’re just on the opposite side of Trump on trade and immigration. ” Mr. Trump, the   great negotiator, may brush aside the views of the country’s leading business executives  —   but perhaps that is because he hasn’t been able to strike a deal with them.",0
11885,American Jews Divided Over Strain in U.S.-Israel Relations - The New York Times,"For Rabbi Gerald Sussman of Temple   on Staten Island, the Obama administration’s recent confrontation with Israel was a stunning turn for a president who had enjoyed support from many members of his congregation. “The word ‘betrayed’ would not be too strong a word,” he said. But in Los Angeles, Rabbi John L. Rosove of Temple Israel of Hollywood, who is the chairman of the Association of Reform Zionists of America, felt differently. He applauded the speech delivered on Wednesday by Secretary of State John Kerry explaining the decision by the United States not to block a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Rabbi Rosove also suggested that many American Jews were broadly supportive of the Obama administration. “I felt Kerry was exactly right,” he said. “The people who will criticize him will take a leap and say he’s   just as some American Jews are saying Obama is an  . This is ridiculous. They recognize and cherish the state of Israel. ” The relationship between Israel and the United States, historically the Jewish state’s closest ally, has seen periods of strain and tension almost from the day of Israel’s creation in 1948. But rarely has the situation between the two countries been this stressed, with President Obama under attack not only from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but also from   Donald J. Trump. The events of the past few days have renewed a longstanding debate over whether American Jews must always stand with the Israeli government, and under what circumstances should they criticize a friend. “There’s a very clear values clash going on,” said Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the executive director of T’ruah, a rabbinical human rights organization. “On the one hand, we have a small but vocal minority of American Jews who believe that supporting Israel means supporting the   agenda, the current government. And on the other, there is a larger percentage of American Jews who are committed to Israel and committed to democracy and want to see it as a safe place that reflects our values. ” This is a community that is hardly monolithic. For one thing, younger Jews are seen as less likely to identify themselves as religious or supportive of Israel, and do not share memories of the Holocaust or the wars with Israel’s Arab neighbors. American Jews are also overwhelmingly Democratic Jews voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump, 71 percent to 24 percent, according to exit polls. Yet the most influential and vocal organizations that represent Jews in Washington tend to be more conservative and supportive of Mr. Netanyahu, who has had a combative relationship with Mr. Obama, and has made little secret of his happiness over the changing of the guard that is about to take place in Washington. Mr. Trump has signaled that his administration would upend the nation’s policies toward Israel, promoting rather than discouraging settlement construction and moving the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. “These days the right wing has a louder voice in Israel, and, in some ways, it also has a louder voice in America, because the people who are most actively and publicly Jewish, sectarian Jewish, share the right wing point of view, and are very ” said Samuel Heilman, a sociology professor of at Queens College specializing in Jewish life. “But it’s not the mainstream point of view. ” Steven M. Cohen, a research professor at Hebrew Union College and a consultant to a recent Pew study of American Jews, said that Mr. Kerry’s speech represents the viewpoints of most American Jews. “On survey after survey, American Jews are opposed to Jewish settlement expansion. They tend to favor a   solution and their political identities are liberal or moderate,” he said. Some Jews said they thought Mr. Kerry’s speech, even if delivered in harsh terms, actually reaffirmed the best hope for a lasting peace in Israel: a   solution. “This administration has been ” said Paula Greene, 65, a retired nurse in Hollywood, Fla. “Like Kerry said, you can still be friends, still be allies and still have disagreements. ” But for others, even those who support a   solution and object to Israeli settlement policy, the decision by the United States not to shield Israel at the United Nations  —   which is widely viewed among many American Jews as hostile to Israel  —   was a mistake. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, a Democrat with a large Jewish constituency, called the Security Council action unnecessary and inappropriate, adding: “I don’t think you can solve a problem with a friend by flogging them publicly. ” The Security Council’s    vote a week ago condemned Israel’s construction of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as a “flagrant violation under international law” and an obstacle to peace in the region. The United States chose to abstain rather than use its veto, as it has done in the past to quash resolutions it considered  . Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest Jewish movement in North America, said it was “a miscalculation in our minds. I think a majority of American Jews would agree, no matter how one feels about settlements, that the idea that the U. N. is an honest broker when it comes to Israel is laughable. ” For Shira Greenberg, a public school teacher in Florida, Mr. Obama’s rebuke of Mr. Netanyahu confirmed her worst assumptions about the president. “Throughout the whole Obama administration, people were trying to guess where he stood,” she said after morning services at her conservative synagogue on Thursday. “At this point, it’s pretty clear. ” And at Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, a large and politically divided congregation, Rabbi David Wolpe said Mr. Obama had “pulled the rug out from under people who said the president’s intentions toward Israel was positive and strong. ” The public display of rancor is unsettling. “Nobody in the community can be happy when you have this public spat between the prime minister and the president, and the kind of language the prime minister has been using about the president,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, who has served as the United States ambassador to both Israel and Egypt. David Zwiebel, the executive vice president of Agudath Israel of America, which represents   Jews, said that there is a general sense among Orthodox Jews, who tend to be more conservative, “that the outgoing administration is outgoing and should be outgoing, and it’s time for an approach that is more openly supportive of Israel. ” For all the controversy created by the vote, few Jewish leaders think there is any chance that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama might, in the next three weeks, strike the deal that has eluded negotiators for years. That said, some supporters of a   solution applauded Mr. Kerry for trying. “I think it’s a question of legacy,” said Jeremy   the head of J Street, a liberal Jewish lobbying group. “And you have to have the long view on this issue. Donald Trump will be president for X years. And then there will be someone else and the chances are it will go back to where we are today. And Bibi will lose someday,” he said, referring to Mr. Netanyahu. “Someday down the line this is the way it’s got to go. ”",0
11886,Anderson Cooper Absolutely OWNS Kellyanne Conway After FBI Clears Hillary…Again (VIDEO),"  
In case you missed it, on Sunday, FBI Director Comey once again cleared Hillary Clinton of any wrong-doing with regard to her emails — this, after just a couple of weeks ago saying to congress, that emails found in connection to the Anthony Weiner investigation could have something to do with Hillary’s case. By speculating about these mysterious emails, that we now know had absolutely NOTHING to do with Hillary Clinton, Comey may have been in direct violation of the Hatch Act . Let’s hope Director Comey will have to endure his own investigation very soon! 
Speaking of speculation, on a special edition of CNN’s AC360 Sunday night, Anderson Cooper brought up that very thing to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. 
“Is it responsible for someone who might be president of the United States to be, in your words, ‘speculating’ about an active investigation when he has no actual facts?” 
Kellyanne tried to change the attention back to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server, but Anderson wasn’t having it and asks again. 
“Right, you are not answering the question, though. Is it irresponsible for a man who might be president of the United States to speculate about something about which he has no facts?”

11890,Tunis Greets an Ottoman-Era History Long Banished by Its Dictators - The New York Times,"TUNIS  —   Since their revolution in 2011, Tunisians have tussled among themselves to define their new identity after successive dictatorships. Belatedly, they have started reclaiming their history as well. Dictatorships have a way of manipulating historical narratives. So alongside any of the most pressing issues of the day, the past, too, is in play. The struggle to shape the past, and give it new authenticity, can be witnessed all around the Tunisian capital. Last summer, the Tunisian government restored a statue of Habib Bourguiba, the founder and first president of the republic, to its original place on the capital’s main avenue. The famous symbol of Mr. Bourguiba  —   astride his horse, arm aloft rallying Tunisians to independence  —   had been banished to a seaside neighborhood in 1987, after he was ousted by his prime minister, Zine   Ben Ali. (Mr. Ben Ali was himself overthrown decades later during the Arab Spring uprising.) The current president, Beji Caid Essebsi, who served in Mr. Bourguiba’s cabinet, was the main driver behind reinstating the statue, which he said was intended to reinforce his call for national unity and a strong state. Mr. Bourguiba’s statue had replaced a humiliating symbol of colonialism: an image of the colonialist politician Jules Ferry with a Tunisian woman at his feet proffering an olive branch, he reminded Tunisians. “That used to be the symbol of colonialism, and Bourguiba is the symbol of freedom, of independence and of the modern state,” he said at the unveiling. Many Tunisians do indeed respect Mr. Bourguiba as the father of the independent nation, yet he was also a dictator who imprisoned his opponents and clung to power for over 30 years. The young revolutionaries who spearheaded the Arab Spring uprising greeted the return of the statue with a flurry of jokes on social media about the waste of money. Far from cementing his reputation, moving the statue opened a new debate around Mr. Bourguiba’s legacy. “People talk of a ‘new Bourguibism,’ but it does not exist,” Med Dhia Hammami, a journalist and activist, said. “There are no ideas coming out of that. ” With the new freedom gained since their revolution, some of Mr. Bourguiba’s victims are being given a chance to set the record straight at public hearings of the Truth and Dignity Commission. One of them, Hamadi Ghars, 85, a journalist in the independence movement, gave a damning portrayal of Mr. Bourguiba at the commission’s first public hearing. Mr. Ghars described how Mr. Bourguiba had betrayed thousands of his fellow   fighters when he accepted an interim deal with the French government that allowed the colonizers’ security forces to continue controlling the country. “We were happy with independence and were waiting for reconciliation,” Mr. Ghars said. Yet Mr. Bourguiba then ordered them to surrender to the French, who bombed the fighters in the mountains. “They killed hundreds of young Tunisian men,” he recalled. “I don’t doubt that their bodies are still in the mountains and rivers today. ” Mr. Ghars was captured and sentenced by the French to 20 years imprisonment and 10 years hard labor, which he served under Mr. Bourguiba. “They destroyed a dream of unity,” he said. “Usually history is written by the victors, but this is the opposite,” said Adel Maizi, the president for preservation of memory at the commission. “These testimonies will reveal the truth. ” “Dictatorship always tries to keep things secret,” he explained. “These kinds of testimonies are against forgetting. They will preserve memory for the country and serve as a way to guard such things happening in the future. ” Tunisians are discovering other forgotten chapters of their past that the two dictators tried to obscure. Crowds have flocked in recent weeks to an exhibition on the opulent, and at times profligate,   reign of tribal princes when Tunisia was part of the Ottoman Empire. The exhibit is housed in the   Ksar   palace. Once a royal residence, it was used as a barracks and a hospital and has been shuttered since the 1980s, its collection of French paintings and Ottoman magnificence hidden from view. For a year, the Rambourg Foundation has been restoring a part of the palace and its collections to unveil the history of Tunisia between 1830 and 1881, the period when princely rulers known as beys ruled the country before it was colonized by France. Ridha Moumni, a curator of the exhibit, insists it is not political, but a matter of history. Yet he is displaying events that Tunisia’s dictators sought to suppress. “We have a very rich heritage that no one knew about,” Mr. Moumni said. “Our goal was to show that Tunisian modernity did not start with independence or colonization. ” The exhibition offers many Tunisians their first glimpse of the   court through royal portraits and rich costumery. More important, it provides a history lesson on the significant reforms of the era  —   the founding of the army, the drafting of a constitution and development of diplomatic relations  —   that helped forge a nation. Among the original documents on display, one abolished slavery in 1846  —   before the United States did so, Mr. Moumni pointed out. Others include a constitution drafted in 1860 that recognizes the rights of all citizens, including Christian and Jewish minorities, and census registers, in Hebrew and Arabic, belonging to Tunisia’s ancient Jewish community. Students and a university teacher touring the exhibition said it was the first time they had seen images of Tunisian royalty. Another discovery is the diversity of Tunisia’s leaders  —   from the Christian foreign minister, Giuseppe Raffo, to a Circassian general, Kheireddine Pasha, and the former slave Mustapha Khaznadar, who married into the royal family and rose to become the bey himself. One of the most popular displays  —   in the throne room, and beside the very table upon which it was signed  —   is the Treaty of Bardo, under which the beys, facing a crumbling dynasty and mounting debts, surrendered to become a French protectorate. The beys were subsequently blamed for clearing the way for seven decades of French rule and were condemned to obscurity by Mr. Bourguiba after Tunisia’s independence. “He wanted to erase this from the national memory,” Mr. Moumni said.",0

11892,A Positive Outlook May Be Good for Your Health - The New York Times,"“Look on the sunny side of life. ” “Turn your face toward the sun, and the shadows will fall behind you. ” “Every day may not be good, but there is something good in every day. ” “See the glass as   not  . ” Researchers are finding that thoughts like these, the hallmarks of people sometimes called “cockeyed optimists,” can do far more than raise one’s spirits. They may actually improve health and extend life. There is no longer any doubt that what happens in the brain influences what happens in the body. When facing a health crisis, actively cultivating positive emotions can boost the immune system and counter depression. Studies have shown an indisputable link between having a positive outlook and health benefits like lower blood pressure, less heart disease, better weight control and healthier blood sugar levels. Even when faced with an incurable illness, positive feelings and thoughts can greatly improve one’s quality of life. Dr. Wendy Schlessel Harpham, a   author of several books for people facing cancer, including “Happiness in a Storm,” was a practicing internist when she learned she had  ’s lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system, 27 years ago. During the next 15 years of treatments for eight relapses of her cancer, she set the stage for happiness and hope, she says, by such measures as surrounding herself with people who lift her spirits, keeping a daily gratitude journal, doing something good for someone else, and watching funny, uplifting movies. Her cancer has been in remission now for 12 years. “Fostering positive emotions helped make my life the best it could be,” Dr. Harpham said. “They made the tough times easier, even though they didn’t make any difference in my cancer cells. ” While Dr. Harpham may have a natural disposition to see the hopeful side of life even when the outlook is bleak, new research is demonstrating that people can learn skills that help them experience more positive emotions when faced with the severe stress of a   illness. Judith T. Moskowitz, a professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, developed a set of eight skills to help foster positive emotions. In earlier research at the University of California, San Francisco, she and colleagues found that people with new diagnoses of H. I. V. infection who practiced these skills carried a lower load of the virus, were more likely to take their medication correctly, and were less likely to need antidepressants to help them cope with their illness. The researchers studied 159 people who had recently learned they had H. I. V. and randomly assigned them to either a   positive emotions training course or five sessions of general support. Fifteen months past their H. I. V. diagnosis, those trained in the eight skills maintained higher levels of positive feelings and fewer negative thoughts related to their infection. An important goal of the training is to help people feel happy, calm and satisfied in the midst of a health crisis. Improvements in their health and longevity are a bonus. Each participant is encouraged to learn at least three of the eight skills and practice one or more each day. The eight skills are: ■ Recognize a positive event each day. ■ Savor that event and log it in a journal or tell someone about it. ■ Start a daily gratitude journal. ■ List a personal strength and note how you used it. ■ Set an attainable goal and note your progress. ■ Report a relatively minor stress and list ways to reappraise the event positively. ■ Recognize and practice small acts of kindness daily. ■ Practice mindfulness, focusing on the here and now rather than the past or future. Dr. Moskowitz said she was inspired by observations that people with AIDS, Type 2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses lived longer if they demonstrated positive emotions. She explained, “The next step was to see if teaching people skills that foster positive emotions can have an impact on how well they cope with stress and their physical health down the line. ” She listed as the goals improving patients’ quality of life, enhancing adherence to medication, fostering healthy behaviors, and building personal resources that result in increased social support and broader attention to the good things in life. Gregg De Meza, a    architect in San Francisco who learned he was infected with H. I. V. four years ago, told me that learning “positivity” skills turned his life around. He said he felt “stupid and careless” about becoming infected and had initially kept his diagnosis a secret. “When I entered the study, I felt like my entire world was completely unraveling,” he said. “The training reminded me to rely on my social network, and I decided to be honest with my friends. I realized that to show your real strength is to show your weakness. No pun intended, it made me more positive, more compassionate, and I’m now healthier than I’ve ever been. ” In another study among 49 patients with Type 2 diabetes, an online version of the positive emotions skills training course was effective in enhancing positivity and reducing negative emotions and feelings of stress. Prior studies showed that, for people with diabetes, positive feelings were associated with better control of blood sugar, an increase in physical activity and healthy eating, less use of tobacco and a lower risk of dying. In a pilot study of 39 women with advanced breast cancer, Dr. Moskowitz said an online version of the skills training decreased depression among them. The same was true with caregivers of dementia patients. “None of this is rocket science,” Dr. Moskowitz said. “I’m just putting these skills together and testing them in a scientific fashion. ” In a related study of more than 4, 000 people 50 and older published last year in the Journal of Gerontology, Becca Levy and Avni Bavishi at the Yale School of Public Health demonstrated that having a positive view of aging can have a beneficial influence on health outcomes and longevity. Dr. Levy said two possible mechanisms account for the findings. Psychologically, a positive view can enhance belief in one’s abilities, decrease perceived stress and foster healthful behaviors. Physiologically, people with positive views of aging had lower levels of   protein, a marker of   inflammation associated with heart disease and other illnesses, even after accounting for possible influences like age, health status, sex, race and education than those with a negative outlook. They also lived significantly longer.",0
11893,US: 800-900 ISIS ‘Probably’ Killed in Mosul Fighting,"Forces Still Several Kilometers From Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
Adding to the upbeat official assessment of the invasion of Mosul, Centcom chief Gen. Joseph Votel today told the press that he believes the forces involved have “ probably killed about 800-900 ISIS fighters ” in the past week and a half. 
By contrast, Votel insisted that only 57 Iraqi troops were killed, and another 30 Kurdish Peshmerga. Unmentioned was a US soldier also killed in the fighting, embedded with the Peshmerga and killed by a roadside bomb north of Mosul. 
It is difficult to get accurate information on ISIS casualties, and the official figures from Iraqi officials are almost always dramatically overstated in an effort to sell the war as a runaway success. There are reasons to be skeptical about the 800-900 figure, however. 
The main reason is that Iraqi and Kurdish forces are still several kilomters away from the outskirts of Mosul, mostly occupying empty villages, and while ISIS has sent out some forces of skirmishers to slow their advance, it is believed the vast majority of their defensive forces have remained in Mosul, gearing up for the eventual attack and setting assorted traps.

21st Century Wire says… 
You can imagine how nations like China and Russia are now laughing at US students as mass psychological trauma has apparently set-in across liberal America. Schools, universities and political institutions across the country are now offering various services following Republican Donald Trump’s insurgent victory in the US presidential election. 
According to NBC News , Democratic staffers were so distraught over this week’s election that “therapy dogs” had to be brought in to help workers on Capitol Hill cope with their vulnerabilities and hurt feelings. 
— Steve Feldman (@SteveFeldman) November 9, 2016 
Therapy Dogs included two golden doodles, two American Eskimo dogs, and a beagle mix – walked around the offices of the House of Representatives. Students at Cornell University even staged a “cry-in” on campus the day after the election. 
Other US campuses were organizing various theraputic activities like poetry readings, where “healthy snacks will be served.” 
The dogs were organized by NGOs the Human Animal Bond Research Initiative, Pet Partners, the Pet Leadership Council and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council. 
Their press release says that Democratic Party staffers needed, “the help of a non-judgmental, furry, four-legged best friend that enjoys bipartisan support.” 
“Organizers say it was a great way for workers to blow off steam especially for those whose bosses may have lost re-election bids,” NBC added. 
Also,“cry-ins” were staged on the campus of Cornell University, and Yale University even staged a “group scream” in order to help student vent their “internalized stress” the day after the election.

11895,"Baton Rouge, Turkey, U.S. Presidential Race: Your Weekend Briefing - The New York Times","Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. At least three police officers in Baton Rouge, La. were killed, and several others were wounded, in a shooting Sunday morning. A suspect was killed, most likely by police gunfire, a police spokesman said. The violence occurred amid tensions over the death of Alton Sterling, who was fatally shot by the police on July 5. Follow the latest developments here. _____ 2. Turkey’s government is recovering from a stunning coup attempt. Officials said more than 260 people had been killed, thousands of soldiers had been rounded up and thousands of judges purged. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed a former ally living in exile in the U. S. Fethullah Gulen, for the insurrection, but Mr. Gulen denied involvement. Turkey’s military has seized power three times since 1960, and tensions have been deepening under Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarian Islamist leadership. _____ 3. France faces a harsh new reality of persistent terrorism after a Tunisian immigrant with no known radical ties killed 84 people and injured hundreds in the Mediterranean city of Nice. He barreled into holiday crowds with a huge rented truck, turning a mainstay of Western commerce into an instrument of mass death. The Islamic State said he was one of its “soldiers,” but investigators have yet to find any sign that the militant group was in communication with the attacker. _____ 4. Anguish in the United States over gun violence and racial tensions deepened with funerals for two victims of police shootings  —   Philando Castile and Alton Sterling  —   and five Dallas officers killed in a retaliatory ambush.  Divisions over fault and accountability played out at protests and memorials around the country, and some tried to bridge the gap. “Being   doesn’t mean you are   or ” a Black Lives Matter protester said. “We’re about peace, love and equal justice. ” _____ 5. Public service announcement: Given the extraordinary turbulence of this week’s news, we rounded up expert advice on how to keep from being overwhelmed, traumatized or desensitized. Try limiting your news exposure to manageable periods of time, and stay in touch with friends and family. “Listening is curative,” a therapist said. _____ 6. Donald Trump chose Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate just in time: The Republican National Convention opens Monday in Cleveland. Security is already tight. Ohio is an   state, and some of the protesters flooding the city have promised to bring their weapons. Mr. Trump’s showmanship, honed by his years as a reality TV star, will be on display, as will his appeal to frustrated white voters  —   and possibly also what our special report identifies as his tendency to be creative with the truth. _____ 7. Our latest poll shows broad discontent with both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton in a race that has tightened to a dead heat. In fact, more than half of all voters hold unfavorable views of the two, and large majorities say neither is honest and trustworthy. Mrs. Clinton’s week includes speeches at the United Federation of Teachers and the N. A. A. C. P. on Monday, a convention of state, county and municipal employees on Tuesday  —   and picking her own running mate before the Democratic National Convention begins on July 25. _____ 8. Britain managed to keep order during a   political transition. Theresa May, the former home secretary, curtsied before the queen and took up the post of prime minister just two days after her last rival to lead the Conservative Party dropped out. Charged with navigating Britain’s exit from the E. U. she filled crucial cabinet roles with Brexit backers, including Boris Johnson as foreign secretary. Her immediate challenge: placating a restive Scotland. _____ 9. Time for a coffee break. Our new weekly column on food and health, Eat Well, looks at a breakthrough in understanding the effects of caffeine. Scientists found a gene that makes us fast or slow at metabolizing the stimulant, and discovered that the rapid set enjoys far greater health and performance gains from ingesting it. _____ 10. Maybe U. S. lawmakers should order a few more cappuccinos. Congress started a   summer break with little to boast of to constituents back home. Speaker Paul Ryan, above, announced one bill that made it through, to fight the opioid epidemic. “I am disappointed by the dysfunction,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. _____ 11. U. S. stocks shot up, buoyed by    bank earnings and job growth. Our   columnist, the Nobel   economist Paul Krugman, cautions against reading too much into the Dow’s record highs this week. He reasons that investors are not necessarily embracing risk out of confidence with returns on government bonds so low, they simply have too few other opportunities for productive investment. _____ 12. Syrian government forces stepped up their siege of Aleppo as the U. S. and Russia announced a tentative deal to coordinate airstrikes against the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate. But Secretary of State John Kerry would not discuss details of the pact. One analyst said that could mean “whatever was agreed was hard to swallow, and may be hard to implement, especially in light of the attempted coup in Turkey. ” _____ 13. Finally, a stylist from Sierra Leone and a South African photographer reimagine black masculinity in 60 images now on display in London. Their powerful “2026” show forecasts a future free of rigid notions of gender and  . “It’s all the things I long to be, it’s the black man I aspire to be: expressive, confident, not holding back, regardless of sexual orientation, gender or race,” said the stylist, Ibrahim Kamara.

11896,Tennis Announcer Sues ESPN After Fired for ‘Gorilla’ Comment He Says He Never Intended - Breitbart,"During the Australian Open last month, ESPN3 fired Mike Adler from his job calling tennis matches over a comment he made when Venus Williams faced off against Stefanie Voegele. [Adler used the term “guerilla” when referencing a move used by Venus Williams, likening the play to a military maneuver or tactic. However, on social media people reacted angrily, believing Adler had meant to liken Williams to the animal “gorilla. ”  Specifically, Adler said, “You see Venus move in and put the guerrilla effect on   …     charging. ” According to TMZ, Adler says the social media freak out was misguided, “Adler says Twitter freaked out and misunderstood what he was trying to say  —   wrongly interpreting the comment as racist. Instead, Adler says the term is NOT racist, but rather a “frequently used” word in tennis to describe an aggressive style of play. In fact, Adler says Nike ran a tennis campaign back in the ’90s called “Guerrilla Tennis. ” Adler says ESPN understood what he meant but made him apologize anyway, only to fire him a short time later. Adler says he’s screwed professionally because of the way his termination played out in the media, saying, “No one will hire a ‘racist. ’” For the record, Adler says he’s “anything but a racist. ” He’s suing for unspecified damages.

11897,Trump and Pence Keeping Pro-Life Promises in First 100 Days,"President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have steered a course during the administration’s first 100 days that   activists have been dreaming about for decades. [“I think if you looked ten years ago, and you asked the question, ‘Will Planned Parenthood be defunded in the next decade?’ everyone would have said, ‘No,’” Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) President Marjorie Dannenfelser tells Breitbart News. “But the presidency of Donald Trump and the vice presidency of Mike Pence have changed all that. ”  The   base of the Republican Party saw the beginnings of change from the start of Trump’s presidency. Within days of his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the Mexico City Policy, a rule that bans   organizations (NGOs) receiving U. S. funds  —   including International Planned Parenthood  —   from providing or promoting abortions overseas. The administration, however, not only reinstated the policy  —   which other Republican presidents have done  —   but also updated it by directing the secretary of state to expand it across all global health assistance funding, a move that ensures taxpayer funds will not support organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for example, is one such organization, with its long history of supporting China’s   population control program, an agenda that has included forced abortions. Later in January, Trump tweeted his personal support for the March for Life  —   the world’s largest   demonstration  —   which convenes in Washington, DC, each year on the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision: The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching  —   you have my full support!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017,    activists, however, had even more reason to rejoice when Pence, a champion of the movement, became the first vice president to address the March for Life. The vice president will also serve as the keynote speaker of SBA List’s 10th annual gala on May 3. It was Dannenfelser who led the coalition that met with Trump and Pence during the campaign to outline a   agenda for a Trump administration, which included four policy commitments in a letter to   leaders: Trump has already started on the path to fulfilling his promise to nominate   justices to the Supreme Court. National   leaders hailed the newly confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch as “reminiscent” of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who regularly applied an originalist approach to the Constitution. The nomination led some   leaders to praise Trump as a “man of his word. ” Dannenfelser explains that much has changed in the   movement within the past decade because the “horrendous underbelly” of Planned Parenthood has been exposed. “And it wasn’t exposed for decades,” she says. “They were the Teflon organization no one could touch them. President George H. W. Bush was part of the reason for the original funding of Planned Parenthood. ” The national   leader says Planned Parenthood  —   the nation’s largest abortion provider  —   had for decades been likened to “the Red Cross” or a “nurses’ organization administering to suffering people. ” “Nobody wanted to touch that,” she explains. “So, clearly, there has been a turn in the understanding of what this organization is about. It took a lot of brave people who were willing to be slandered to question that. ” Recently, for example, California prosecutors charged the Center for Medical Progress video makers  —   who recorded Planned Parenthood officials allegedly selling the harvested body parts of aborted babies for a profit  —   with 15 felonies. The charges continue a long string of attacks by the abortion giant and its political and media allies against activists exposing its operations. The Trump administration reportedly unofficially informed Planned Parenthood it would have to cease performing abortions to keep its taxpayer funding. House Republican leaders  —   with support from the Trump administration  —   put forward the American Health Care Act (AHCA) legislation that contained a provision to defund Planned Parenthood for a   period. Though conservatives were successful in thwarting the bill because it failed to fully repeal Obamacare, Trump would likely have signed it if Congress had passed it, ending Planned Parenthood’s funding for a year.   leaders now hope Congress will put forward a single reconciliation bill to defund Planned Parenthood. Two weeks ago, Trump also signed a resolution that overturns former President Barack Obama’s rule that forced states to provide family planning grants under Title X to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. The measure passed the House but required Pence as vice president to break the tie vote in the Senate due to the votes against it by Sens. Susan Collins ( ) and Lisa Murkowski ( ). Trump, formerly   acknowledges he has adopted the   view. Some concerns have arisen, however, about the influence his daughter Ivanka  —   an apparent supporter of Planned Parenthood  —   would have on the president’s   agenda. Several weeks ago, a report surfaced that Ivanka held an “  ” meeting with Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards to discuss possible “common ground” on the abortion issue. Asked whether she views Ivanka’s perhaps more conciliatory tone toward Planned Parenthood as a threat to the future of the   agenda, Dannenfelser quickly dismisses the idea. “I really do think this president understands what it is about  —   his commitments, his promises. And he’s got a vice president who knows how to lead the way legislatively,” she says. “I’m not concerned. ”",0
11898,Trump Adopts a Harder Line on Israeli Settlements - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, who presented himself as a staunch supporter of Israel during last year’s campaign, took a harder line on settlements in an interview published on Friday and indicated that he was rethinking his promise to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem. Mr. Trump told an Israeli newspaper that settlements “don’t help the process” and that he did not believe that “going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace. ” He also did not reaffirm his past vow to move the embassy, saying that it “is not an easy decision” and “we will see what happens. ” The comments amounted to a striking recalibration of Mr. Trump’s approach to Israel just five days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit the White House. Mr. Trump and Jared Kushner, his    and senior adviser, have been exploring an   peace initiative that would enlist Arab allies, and a host of Arab leaders have told the new president that provocative   positions would not help. The interview was conducted with Israel Hayom, the newspaper owned by Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and close ally of Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Trump hosted Mr. Adelson and his wife for dinner at the White House on Thursday night, along with Mr. Kushner and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The president’s language in the interview went beyond the carefully written statement issued by the White House last week saying that settlements were not an impediment to peace but they “may not be helpful. ” The statement was seen as a sign that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Netanyahu to hold off contentious moves, at least until their meeting next week. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Netanyahu’s government has announced the construction of 5, 500 new houses in the occupied West Bank, and the prime minister even raised the idea of building the first entirely new settlement in years. Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition pushed through Parliament a new bill retroactively authorizing thousands of houses built on   land that are illegal even under Israeli law. “They don’t help the process,” Mr. Trump said of settlements in the Israel Hayom interview. “I can say that. There is so much land left. And every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left. ” He added: “I am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace. ” Mr. Trump’s statement on the embassy move was also strikingly different than past comments. Arab leaders have warned him that moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim, would lead to angry and possibly violent reactions because it would be seen as prejudging a final settlement between the two sides. The last three presidents refused to move the embassy there for that very reason. Last year, Mr. Trump said he would move the embassy “fairly quickly” after taking office. When approached by Boaz Bismuth of Israel Hayom on the eve of his inauguration last month, he reiterated his commitment by saying, “You know I’m not a person who breaks promises. ” But when Mr. Bismuth asked about it on Thursday, Mr. Trump did not repeat his vow. Instead, he said he was studying it. “The embassy is not an easy decision,” Mr. Trump said. “It has obviously been out there for many, many years and nobody has wanted to make that decision. I’m thinking about it very seriously and we will see what happens. ” Mr. Trump, who last year blistered his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for not being supportive enough of Israel, said he would not publicly criticize it. “I don’t want to condemn Israel,” he said. “Israel has had a long history of condemnation and difficulty. And I don’t want to be condemning Israel. ” But he also said he wanted Israel to compromise to make peace. “I want Israel to be reasonable with respect to peace,” he said. Mr. Trump did not offer support for a   solution, which has been American policy for years. However, he held out the prospect of a regional agreement. “Maybe there is even a chance for a bigger peace than just Israel and the Palestinians,” he said. “I would like to see a level of reasonableness of both parties and I think we have a good chance of doing that. ”",0
11899,Public University Threatened to Punish Student Over His Refusal to Remove Trump Sign from Dorm Window - Breitbart,"A student at the University of South Alabama is taking heat from administrators for failing to remove a Donald Trump sign from the window of his dorm room. [Student William David Meredith has been threatened with disciplinary action by administrators over his refusal to remove a Donald Trump campaign sign from the window of his dorm room.  “I am asking that you remove the sign within 24 hours. I have included your RA, Tiffany, on this email so that she can check to ensure it is gone within 24 hours,” Community Director Dylan Lloyd wrote in an email, to which Meredith replied by simply stating: “1st Amendment. ” Although Lloyd acknowledged that Meredith does have first amendment protections on the public university’s campus, he countered by arguing that federal buildings cannot display endorsements of political candidates. “The policy you’ve quoted pertains to political candidates, which President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are not,” Meredith argued. “Nothing on it says anything about campaigning and his campaign is over, which makes it memorabilia not campaign material. ” “While I understand that, it still shows that the university supports a particular candidate,” Lloyd fired back in response. “While we are not actively in campaign season, Trump will run for reelection in four years. The sign makes it look like the university supports Trump as a candidate. ” Meredith held firmly that no reasonable person would consider a sign in a student’s window to be an institutional endorsement of a political candidate. “No reasonable person would see a sign in a dorm room window and presume that the university is endorsing that message,” Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Travis Barham said in a statement. “The Supreme Court has long recognized that a university does not endorse everything on campus that it fails to censor,” he explained, noting that “in 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that even elementary school students could understand this, saying ‘[t]he proposition that schools do not endorse everything they fail to censor is not complicated’ [Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 250 (1990)]. ” Despite this, administrators maintained that Meredith would be disciplined by the university if he refused to remove the sign from his window. “If you are found responsible for violating policies, administrative sanctions will most likely be determined at the conclusion of the hearing, even if you do not attend,” an email from an administrator stated, asserting that Meredith “will be required to comply with all sanctions administrated [sic] as a result of the findings. ” Ultimately, the school’s Executive Director of Marketing and Communications Michael Haskins confirmed that Meredith would be able to keep his sign up in his window, citing a misunderstanding on the university policy on behalf on the staff members who originally took issue with the sign.

11902,Muted U.S. Response to China’s Seizure of Drone Worries Asian Allies - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   Only a day before a small Chinese boat sidled up to a United States Navy research vessel in waters off the Philippines and audaciously seized an underwater drone from American sailors, the commander of United States military operations in the region told an audience in Australia that America had a winning military formula. “Capability times resolve times signaling equals deterrence,” Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. told a   crowd of diplomats and analysts at the prestigious Lowy Institute in Sydney, the leading city in America’s closest ally in the region. In the eyes of America’s friends in Asia, the brazen maneuver to launch an operation against an American Navy vessel in international waters in the South China Sea about 50 miles from the Philippines, another close American ally, has raised questions about one of the admiral’s crucial words. It was also seen by some as a taunt to   Donald J. Trump, who has challenged the One China policy on Taiwan and has vowed to deal forcefully with Beijing in trade and other issues. “The weak link is the resolve, and the Chinese are testing that, as well as baiting Trump,” said Euan Graham, the director of international security at the Lowy Institute. “Capability, yes. Signaling, yes, with sending   fighter jets to Australia. But the very muted response means the equation falls down on resolve. ” Across Asia, diplomats and analysts said they were perplexed at the inability of the Obama administration to devise a strong response to China’s challenge. It did not even dispatch an American destroyer to the spot near Subic Bay, a former American Navy base that is still frequented by American ships, some noted. After discussions at the National Security Council on how to deal with the issue, the Obama administration demanded the return of the drone. On Saturday, China said it would comply with the request but did not indicate when or how the equipment would be sent back. The end result, analysts said, is that China will be emboldened by having carried out an act that amounted to hybrid warfare, falling just short of provoking conflict, and suffering few noticeable consequences. “Allies and observers will find it hard not to conclude this represents another diminishment of American authority in the region,” said Douglas H. Paal, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Significantly, the Chinese grabbed the drone not only in international waters but outside even the “  line” that China uses as a marker for its claims in the South China Sea. In so doing, analysts said, Beijing was making the point that the entire sea was its preserve, even though it is entirely legal for the United States to conduct military operations in waters within 200 miles of the Philippines, an area known as an exclusive economic zone. In the last dozen years, China has steadily showed off its growing military prowess to the countries around the South China Sea, which carries trillions of dollars of world trade and which China values for its strategic access to the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. As China has built up its navy and its submarine fleet in the last decade, it has also emphasized what it calls its “inherent” right to dominate the regional seas, and to challenge the presence of the United States, its allies and partners in Asia. The drone episode, which occurred on Thursday and was first broadcast by CNN despite efforts by the Obama administration to settle it quietly, was of a different nature and just as disquieting as past confrontations with China that involved bigger ships and more dangerous maneuvers, analysts said. In 2001, soon after President George W. Bush came to office, an American spy aircraft, an   was forced to land on Hainan Island after colliding with a Chinese fighter jet. The Chinese stripped the plane of its assets and returned it broken down to its parts and packed in boxes. In 2009, two months after President Obama took office, Chinese vessels swarmed a United States Navy reconnaissance ship, the Impeccable, in what the Pentagon said were dangerous and unprofessional maneuvers. This time, China chose a more unconventional method to challenge the United States and hastened the timetable, challenging a   rather than a newly installed president as it has in the past. The drone itself, known as an unmanned underwater vehicle, was not a particularly important piece of equipment. Such drones are deployed to gather military oceanographic data and are available over the counter for about $150, 000, the Pentagon said. Data from the drone would no doubt be used to help track China’s growing submarine fleet, naval experts said. More important than the equipment was the principle of freedom of navigation in international waters, and whether China was in the process of imposing its own rules in the South China Sea  —   more than 800 miles away from its coastline, said Alexander Vuving, a specialist on Vietnam at the   Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. “This is China showing that it is in the process of setting the rules in the South China Sea, imposing its own view in the South China Sea and saying the South China Sea should be its own backyard,” Mr. Vuving said. “If China can get away with this incident with impunity,” he added, “this will send a chilling message to countries in the region. ” Some leaders, like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, will feel validated in a pivot away from the United States toward China, Mr. Vuving said. “Others, like the Vietnamese, will have to seriously rethink their regional outlook. ” Vietnam  —   always fearful of China, its neighbor to the north, but also careful not to alienate Beijing  —   has tried in the last few years to draw closer to the United States, while still maintaining a careful distance. In 2011, as China became more assertive in the South China Sea, Vietnam accused China of instructing three   patrol boats to  cut the cables of a Vietnamese oil and gas survey ship. The authoritarian Vietnamese government was so furious that it allowed   demonstrations in Hanoi. In 2014, China moved a   oil rig to waters close to the Paracel Islands that both Vietnam and China claim, and then blasted a flotilla of Vietnamese ships with water cannon. Since then, China has hardened its position, sometimes referring to the South China Sea as a “core interest” in which there is no room for compromise, though others in the region call it bullying by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Under that vision, China would be in control from the waters of Indonesia to Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and up to Japan. In the East China Sea, China and Japan are at odds over an uninhabited island chain, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. In June, China sent a warship for the first time into the waters around the islands, further escalating tensions. Japan has been more outspoken than other Asian countries in its support for the Obama administration’s objections to China’s construction of military facilities on seven artificial islands in the South China Sea. But in Tokyo, the government was watching the outcome of the drone episode with some anxiety. So far, Washington’s restrained response has not been reassuring.",0
11903,"As Peat Bogs Burn, a Climate Threat Rises - The New York Times","RED EARTH CREEK, Alberta  —   Kristyn Housman grabbed the end of a sampling auger, a steel tube that two colleagues had just drilled into a   hummock in a peat bog, and poked through a damp, fibrous plug of partly decomposed peat. Peat has been building up for centuries in this bog, where the spongy moss is interspersed with black spruces and, on a late spring morning, the air is teeming with mosquitoes. The sample, taken from three feet down, is at least several hundred years old, said Ms. Housman, a graduate researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “There’s literally tons of carbon here,” she said, looking around the bog, which covers several acres off a muddy   road amid the vast flatness of northern Alberta. In discussions of how nature regulates carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, forests receive most of the attention for their ability to absorb and store carbon. But peatlands play an important role, too. There are an estimated 1. 6 million square miles of peatlands, or about 3 percent of the earth’s land surface, mostly in northern latitudes in Canada, Alaska, Europe and Russia. Peat is made up of sphagnum and other mosses, which hold a large amount of water and contain compounds that inhibit decomposition. The peat slowly builds up over centuries because the annual growth exceeds the decay. A relatively small amount of peat is mined to burn as fuel, to improve backyard gardens or to add smokiness to Scotch. But most of it stays where it is, and because it accumulates carbon over such a long time, it contains more carbon than is in all the world’s trees and plants, and nearly as much as the atmosphere does. Like forests, peatlands are threatened by climate change. Warming temperatures can dry out bogs, making them more susceptible to fires, and to deeper, more intense burning. A peat fire, which can smolder like a cigarette for months, can release a lot of carbon. “It’s carbon that has accumulated over several thousands of years,” said Mike Waddington, a McMaster professor who has been researching peat in Alberta and elsewhere for more than two decades. “If it were to be released, the global CO2 concentration would be much higher. ” The world has already had vast releases of carbon from peat, in Indonesia. Last year, bogs that had been drained for agriculture, and were drier because of El   warmth, burned for months, creating a haze visible from space and causing widespread health problems. At their peak in September and October, the fires released more carbon per day than was emitted by the European Union. While few people foresee that level of disaster in northern peatlands, concern about fires is growing. A major worry is that as climate change and other disturbances affect peatlands, the intensity of fires will increase, releasing more carbon into the atmosphere. “They take thousands of years to develop,” said Merritt Turetsky, a peat researcher at the University of Guelph in Ontario. “And in five minutes, a wildfire can blow through that area and release five to six hundred years of peat accumulation and change it forever. ” The enormous spring wildfire that destroyed much of Fort McMurray, a city of 90, 000 people 150 miles east of here, burned bogs as well as trees. In June, the trees were no longer on fire outside the town, but crews were overturning peat with backhoes in an effort to extinguish smoldering hot spots. In a large wildfire in May 2011 that burned in and around the town of Slave Lake, about 80 miles south of here, some peat continued to burn through the winter, until spring rains and melting snow finally extinguished it. Peat is generally resistant to burning, because sphagnum moss, which is dominant in a healthy bog, holds a lot of water. “If you have a large amount of this moss in a peatland, you aren’t going to get a very severe fire,” Dr. Waddington said. Typically only the top few inches of the peat will burn. Warming, however, alters the system. Drier peat allows more oxygen to get to the roots of trees and other vegetation. This causes them to grow bigger, which means they use more water, further drying the peat. As trees grow, they also provide more shade, which favors the growth of other mosses that, because they hold less moisture than sphagnum, are less fire resistant. When the bog does catch fire, it may be more severe, with the combustion spreading deeper into the peat. Other disturbances, like draining bogs to grow trees or to produce oil and gas, can also make a fire more severe. Dr. Waddington and others are doing research on how to restore bogs that have been drained, to reduce the risk of carbon loss through fires. Normally a bog recovers slowly after a wildfire, with certain mosses and other vegetation taking over in stages until sphagnum mosses dominate. At the bog where Ms. Housman and her colleagues took samples, a section was deliberately burned last year. It is showing signs of recovery, with clumps of singed sphagnum moss already producing small shoots of regrowth. But an intense fire, or a combination of other factors, can delay or even halt recovery. That is the case at a small bog south of Red Earth Creek that researchers have nicknamed “Scorcho” because it was severely burned in the 2011 Slave Lake fire. As much as four feet of peat was consumed in some parts of the bog. “All that peat, combusted and gone,” said Sophie Wilkinson, a McMaster doctoral student. Five years later, the bog is showing few signs of returning to its old self. “It is definitely on the brink,” Ms. Wilkinson said. “There’s little to no sphagnum recovery, which is very worrying, because if it’s going to return to a   system, which is what you would hope, really, it needs to get that sphagnum back. ” Scorcho may ultimately turn into something other than a bog  —   drier land with leafy trees like birches and aspens replacing the black spruces, with little to no moss and, as a result, less carbon storage. The bog is laced with instruments to measure the water table, the evaporation of water from vegetation and other characteristics, but researchers are still uncertain why it is not recovering. What is clear is that recovery from a fire is a delicate process, one that global warming will complicate. “Climate change will determine the severity and frequency of burns the bog has to be resilient to,” Ms. Housman said. Referring to Scorcho, Ms. Wilkinson said: “Like, if this was to burn again? Who knows, really, what’s going to happen. ”",0
11904,Il Regno Unito riprende l’addestramento degli jihadisti in Siria,"Il Regno Unito riprende l’addestramento degli jihadisti in Siria Rete Voltaire | 2 novembre 2016 français Español Deutsch Português Türkçe Il ministro della Difesa britannico, Michael Fallon, ha annunciato che il Regno Unito riformerà l’Esercito Siriano Libero [ESL]. Il governo inglese riprenderà quindi il programma di addestramento dei cosiddetti combattenti moderati, iniziato nel 2014 da Obama.
L’Esercito Siriano Libero è stato creato dalla Francia nel 2011, intorno al capo libico di al-Qaeda Abdelhakim Belhaj. L’operazione era stata presentata come un aiuto ai disertori siriani guidati dal colonnello Riad el-Asaad. Gradualmente, i membri dell’ESL si sono poi congiunti ad al-Qaeda. Nel 2016, l’etichetta ESL è stata ripescata dalla Turchia per denominare le proprie milizie turcomanne.
A loro volta, gli Stati Uniti avevano speso mezzo miliardo di dollari per l’addestramento dei nuovi “combattenti ribelli”. La totalità dei soldati addestrati oggi però appartiene ad al-Qaeda.
È quindi molto probabile che il nuovo programma britannico mascheri un altro aiuto ad al-Qaeda.

11905,New Ways to Treat Pain Meet Resistance - The New York Times,"A few months ago, Douglas Scott, a property manager in Jacksonville, Fla. was taking large doses of narcotic drugs, or opioids, to deal with the pain of back and spine injuries from two recent car accidents. The pills helped ease his pain, but they also caused him to withdraw from his wife, his two children and social life. “Finally, my wife said, ‘You do something about this or we’re going to have to make some changes around here,’” said Mr. Scott, 43. Today, Mr. Scott is no longer taking narcotics and feels better. Shortly after his wife’s ultimatum, he entered a local clinic where patients are weaned off opioids and spend up to five weeks going through six hours of training each day in alternative pain management techniques such as physical therapy, relaxation exercises and behavior modification. Mr. Scott’s story highlights one patient’s success. Yet it also underscores the difficulties that the Obama administration and public health officials face in reducing the widespread use of painkillers like OxyContin and Percocet. The use and abuse of the drugs has led to a national epidemic of overdose deaths, addiction and poor patient outcomes. In recent months, federal agencies and state health officials have urged doctors to first treat pain without using opioids, and some have announced plans to restrict how many pain pills a doctor can prescribe. But getting the millions of people with chronic pain to turn to alternative treatments is a daunting task, one that must overcome inconsistent insurance coverage as well as some resistance from patients and their doctors, who know the ease and effectiveness of pain medications. “We are all culpable,” said Dr. David Deitz, a former insurance industry executive and a consultant on pain treatment issues. “I don’t care whether you are a doctor, an insurer or a patient. ” Alternative treatments for pain may include chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, meditation, massage, yoga, acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people cope with pain by changing how they think about it. Insurance plans may not cover all of these treatments, which vary widely in cost, or impose strict limits on them. Comprehensive programs such as the one Mr. Scott attended are expensive, charging $20, 000 or more. Many state Medicaid programs for the poor, while eager to reduce opioid use among their members, have only begun to grapple with whether to cover nondrug treatments for pain, or how extensively to do it. One exception is physical therapy, which Medicaid is required to cover for members who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But the generosity of the benefit varies by state. “There are definitely discussions going on about alternative approaches,” said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. However, Mr. Salo added that such benefits were often the first to be eliminated when program budgets are cut because the treatments are considered optional. Evidence about the effectiveness of the treatments varies widely, adding another layer of complication. The proof is limited for acupuncture, for example, but better for cognitive behavioral therapy. The Obama administration recently published a national pain strategy that calls for far more research into alternative pain treatments. A 2008 study by the Mayo Clinic, though, found that patients who were weaned off opioids and undergo a   program such as the one Mr. Scott went through experienced less pain than while on opioids and also significantly improved in function. Other studies have had similar findings. Still, some insurers will not pay for such multifaceted treatment, questioning both their effectiveness and value. In addition, patients often resist nondrug treatments. Taking a pill is simply faster and easier than regularly leaving work for physical therapy. Also, the impulse of many doctors is to write a prescription. The problems started for Mr. Scott in 2015, when a driver   his car. The accident caused back and neck injuries. A pain specialist soon had him on a regimen of two narcotic drugs  —   oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin, and morphine  —   which were gradually increased to control his pain. In February, his car was   again, aggravating the injuries. Before long, he was taking 30 milligrams of morphine and 30 milligrams of oxycodone three times daily, a combined dosage considered high. He said he thought he was doing fine, but he did not want to work and had little interest in interacting with friends, his wife or his children. “At the time, I would not have told you that I was dependent” on the drugs, Mr. Scott said. “Now, I can say I was extremely dependent and addicted. ” His doctor, a pain management specialist, was satisfied that his pain was under control. But after the confrontation with his wife, Mr. Scott agreed to go to a clinic in Jacksonville that specializes in alternative programs. His employer’s insurance paid for the treatment. Initially, Mr. Scott thought the program was a joke. But after he was slowly weaned off opioids during the second week, he began to feel better. “I woke up on a Saturday morning, thinking I have to do my flexibility exercises, do my stretches,” he recalled. In the 1990s, insurers often supported programs like the one in Jacksonville. But they soon fell out of favor because the programs varied in quality and there was little data to show their   value. In addition, opioids appeared to provide a quicker and cheaper solution. “Insurers started saying, ‘What the heck, why are we throwing money at a problem? ’” said Dr. Deitz, the consultant. Virgil Wittmer, a psychologist who directs the program that treated Mr. Scott at Brooks Rehabilitation in Jacksonville, said workers’ compensation plans and some private insurers like Aetna and United Healthcare will cover the program’s costs. But others, like Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, will not. In a statement, Florida Blue said that while it covered some of the alternative techniques like physical therapy used in Dr. Wittmer’s program, it considered other approaches experimental and unproved. State Medicaid plans typically do not cover interdisciplinary programs. But the scope of the opioid epidemic has prompted some states to experiment with alternative approaches. Vermont, for example, recently passed legislation that directs officials there to develop a pilot program to offer acupuncture to Medicaid recipients with chronic pain and determine whether it is as effective as or more effective than opioids. Also, starting next month, Oregon’s Medicaid program will provide acupuncture, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, and cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with chronic back pain if such treatments are deemed appropriate after an initial evaluation. Patients with back pain may also include yoga, massage or supervised exercise therapy. Oregon has “spent a great deal of public money on treatments such as surgery and narcotic medications, without good evidence that they improve patients’ lives,” said Susan Stigers, a spokeswoman for the state’s Medicaid program. Some private insurers and state agencies are also trying to integrate mental health care into their pain care programs. Some people who have   or chronic pain have undergone a previous trauma, such as emotional or physical abuse during childhood, and their pain is unlikely to abate without psychological counseling. “Psychology factors are a major issue,” said Dr. Steven Feinberg, a specialist in physical medicine in Palo Alto, Calif. But workers’ compensation insurers are particularly leery of doing so because adopting such strategies could mean paying for psychological treatment for years, said Dr. Deitz, the former health industry executive. Mr. Scott said that even with his pain under control, he continued to receive psychological counseling. He said that he realized during sessions with Dr. Wittmer that he was taking opioids not only to deal with his pain but also because the effect of the drugs was helping him cope with his underlying history of anxiety. “The opioids were saying to me, ‘Don’t worry about this, I’ve got it,’” he said. “It made me feel that I was in control, when, in fact, I was not. ”",0
11906,Fox News Calls for Special Prosecutor to Investigate Hillary Clinton,"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 7:56 am ""If she gets elected on November 8th, this isn't going away. So what needs to happen, special prosecutor? She can't investigate herself as the president-elect""   
President Barack Obama did not have to do anything wrong for Republicans to want to throw him in jail, or to impeach him. Hillary Clinton doesn’t have to have done anything wrong either, apparently, for Congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected – because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her . 
At least, that and completely ignoring the facts, was the theme on Fox News last night, though to be fair, other mainstream media outlets weren’t much better yesterday. 
Megyn Kelly, fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a face-off with Newt Gingrich, suggested to Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte (R-WV) that given the FBI revelations of a complete lack of evidence that Hillary Clinton has done anything wrong, “what needs to happen” is a special prosecutor. 
MEGYN KELLY : Let me ask you this. If she gets elected on November 8th, this isn’t going away. So what needs to happen, [a] special prosecutor? She can’t investigate herself as the president-elect. BOB GOODLATTE : Well, first of all, we have said from the outset that the House Judiciary Committee would follow the truth wherever it leads, and we have done that throughout the summer, asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the FBI was being conducted. We will continue to do that. We don’t know what’s going to happen now. We don’t know what’s going to happen after the election. So it’s pure speculation what will happen afterwards. A special prosecutor, remember, is appointed by the Attorney General of the United States. So, you have to decide whether that’s going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the FBI under the direction of Director Comey right now. And the Judiciary Committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation. 
Democracy is a fragile thing. It is to Goodlatte’s credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in 2014 and that he cautioned Megyn Kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the House but by the Attorney General. However, the GOP-led House has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy. 
What holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works. Republicans have decided it only works if they’re in charge, and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries, appoint special prosecutors if they win, or vote to impeach them outright, as Trump’s pet snake at CNN, Jeffrey Lord, called for last night : 
Two points, Anderson. One, with 11 days left, this makes Donald Trump’s argument exactly to the point here, you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment, her paranoia and all of the rest. The second thing, Anderson is, and this is the really disturbing thing, let’s just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election, this isn’t going to stop. There will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that Bible. This is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly, I mean that’s something the American people need to consider now. 
It is not difficult to see where this will lead. Hillary Clinton has committed no crimes. Far from being a miscarriage of justice, though it is that as well, this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity. 
This sort of talk is just further evidence that Donald Trump comes from the same vile brew as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the rest of the party. During the McCarthy era, the House took it upon itself to be both judge and jury. Last night, it was Fox News egging the House on for more of the same. 
This sort of talk is deplorable, it is reprehensible, and it is dangerous – and strikes at the very heart of our democracy.",0
11907,Stocks Are Up 5 Percent Under Trump. So How Long Will the Rally Last? - The New York Times,"Stocks have marched higher and higher  —   up 5 percent since President Trump took office six weeks ago  —   and the rally has become one of his favorite boasts. And there is plenty of economic data to justify the ebullience. So why are some hedge fund managers bracing for a  ? It’s all in the details. The economic indicators are certainly heartening, the managers say, and Mr. Trump’s ambitious policy agenda  —   which includes a   triad of top priorities in rolling back regulations on businesses, overhauling corporate taxes and spending $1 trillion in infrastructure projects  —   looks encouraging, too. That is, if the policies come to pass as they have been described. If deep cuts to regulations and a tax overhaul are pushed off to next year, for instance, or if no clear plan emerges anytime soon to rebuild the nation’s physical structures, there is plenty of room for disappointment. “The stock market may be currently expecting a   scenario for policy implementation,” Alan Fournier, the founder of the   hedge fund Pennant Capital Management in Summit, N. J. said in an interview shortly before the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 21, 000 for the first time, on Wednesday. A closer examination of what it would take to put into effect Mr. Trump’s initiatives, like a proposal to impose new import taxes, suggests that market participants might be overly excited, Mr. Fournier added. “A lot more skepticism” exists in currency and bond markets, said Mr. Fournier, who looks at the prices of those assets, rather than at stocks, when he needs a powerful gut check. He declined to discuss his current investments in detail. The market chatter in recent days has been similarly skeptical. In interviews with more than a dozen money managers in the past week, nine senior investment managers or hedge fund executives predicted that a market decline of at least modest size was likely to occur in the near future. Protecting the stocks, bonds and other positions that money managers hold from unexpected market moves in either direction is their business. It is the very essence of hedging and is critical to preserving investor capital. Some of those money managers are using options  —   trades that give their initiator the right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell stocks in the future  —   to bet that the benchmark Standard  Poor’s 500 index will fall 1 to 2 percent in the coming weeks. Such positions can be cheap to build and can lock in favorable prices if the market declines. Others, like the Chicago investment firm Citadel, which is known for its aggressive risk management, are adding the effects of Trump policy implementation to their lists of factors that could create market volatility, company officials say. (One example: a meaningful rollback of the 2010   financial regulation overhaul that would improve the share prices of banks and related companies.) A number of the money managers interviewed are looking at online betting websites that allow participants to place wagers  —   offbeat as they may be  —   on whether Mr. Trump will be impeached before the end of his current term as one indicator of popular perception that could depress stocks in the coming months or years. Ladbrokes, a British gambling company, offers a market for bets that the president will resign or be impeached before the end of his first term. On Sunday, that market implied that the chance of such an outcome was 55 percent. At Paddy Power, an Irish competitor running hundreds of markets related to the Trump presidency, the implied probability of impeachment was 40 percent. Other betting opportunities ranged from the likelihood of a third Trump divorce before the end of his presidency to the chance that Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would share a Nobel Peace Prize. “Our customers are so interested in Trump that we’ve created, basically, a microsite dedicated to him,” said Lee Price, a Paddy Power spokesman. Of course, some are dubious about those markets, too. The idea of using a theoretical Trump impeachment as a reason to hedge investments is “the stupidest theory I’ve ever heard in my life,” said Peter DeCaprio, a founder of the $900 million hedge fund company Crow Point Partners in Hingham, Mass. “because the odds of it happening are next to zero. ” He added: “This is why people hate Wall Street. We’re paid to evaluate risk and make investments in risky markets. That’s it. ” Some funds have made hedging against risk their primary aim. Known as tail risk investment vehicles because they are on the lookout for highly unlikely market moves, they buy instruments like options and other insurance policies that can pay out when prices move in unexpected directions. “Historic valuations and record complacency in today’s markets make them extremely vulnerable to shocks, regardless of who is in office,” Mark Spitznagel, the chief investment officer of the   Universa Investments, one of the   tail risk funds, said in an emailed statement. “The current low cost of protection makes a tail hedge an easy decision for asset holders, who are all exposed to the inevitable and increasingly dangerous unwind. ” Mr. Spitznagel recommended the use of S. P. options known as puts, which are the right to sell that index at a future point in time at previously determined prices. Other investors, like Citadel, are awaiting further details on events, like a possible government crackdown on drug prices that could hurt pharmaceutical stocks or the lifting of portions of   that could help financial stocks, that could affect specific sectors. But without knowing more about how such policy measures will look, many hedge fund managers say it is hard to do more than simply wait until they can read the fine print.",0
11908,"The Modern History of ""Rigged"" US Elections","License DMCA 
The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world's ""gold standard"" that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The ""wise men"" of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens' judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). 
Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation's leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn't vote). - Advertisement - 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy's vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South's heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon's Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. - Advertisement - 
Nixon's ""Treason"" 
So, by 1968, the Democrats' once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn't want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that -- with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided -- President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. President Richard Nixon with his then-National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972. License DMCA 
The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixon's campaign went behind Johnson's back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnson's Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixon's emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.",0
11909,Pinkerton: The Plutocrats vs. the People: Trump’s Paris Climate Decision Exposes the Latest Battle in the Class War,"First of Two Parts  …      1. The Latest Battle in the Class War, Blue Dots vs. Red Heartland, On Thursday, President Trump announced that the U. S. would be withdrawing from the United Nations Framework on Climate Change.  Speaking of the deal, which had been signed by President Obama in 2015 but never submitted to the Senate for ratification, Trump said: The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers . . . and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. At the White House, the audience applauded, and it’s a cinch that across the country, folks in the red states of Trump Nation, too, were pleased. However, elsewhere, especially in the   blue cities along the two coasts, opposition to Trump’s decision flowed, fast and furious. Indeed, the reaction was so strong, and so deeply comprehensive —  cutting across so many sectors of society and the economy —  that one is left to wonder whether or not Trump’s decision will have the stimulative effect in the Heartland that he was hoping for —  and that Heartlanders deserve. That is, it’s possible that   opposition will thwart   efforts to make more use of —  or even to continue to use —  fossil fuels.  We will consider this point more closely later, in Part Two. Yet in the meantime, we can marvel over the totality of   hostility: Just about every headline and press report in the Main Stream Media has been critical, with some going out of their way to   their negativity.  For instance, a writer in Politico declared that Trump’s decision “was about extending a middle finger to the world. ” In a similar vein, there was this headline in The New York Daily News: “Trump to World: Drop Dead. ” Here, some of us   might pause to recall that the Daily News was once the regular read of New York City’s working class, which was always interested in the   questions of jobs and growth.  But now that the paper is owned by a   billionaire, its editorial stance has changed dramatically it no longer reflects Queens and Canarsie, but rather Manhattan and the Hamptons —  and that might help account for its vanishing circulation. As for other elite outposts, the reaction was just as fierce. “Hollywood suffers meltdown over Paris Climate Accord” was the headline for a “greatest hits” roundup on Foxnews. com. Meanwhile, the left end of the political system, too, is reacting fiercely.  Indeed, the left is reacting with such ferocity that it threatens to jolt our constitutional system.  Hence this headline from Roll Call: “New York, California, Washington Form Climate Alliance in Wake of Paris Accord Withdrawal. ”  An “alliance,” really?  How many more states will join?  And how far will this alliance go? In addition, the   forces have injected yet another disruptive element into our constitutional equation —  the idea of dealing directly with foreign powers to undercut U. S. policy.  Here’s a New York Times header: “Bucking Trump, These Cities, States and Companies Commit to Paris Accord. ” The story outlines the efforts of   activists to create their own foreign policy they seek to do so by submitting a climate plan of their own, directly to the United Nations, pledging to meet the requirements of the Paris agreement.  According to the Times, the   unnamed group includes 30 mayors, three governors, more than 80 university presidents, and more than 100 businesses. Moreover, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charity of former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, has committed $14 million to help fund the effort.  Once again, this is strange legal territory the Logan Act, a federal statute since 1799, would seem to specifically forbid this sort of ex parte diplomacy. So why all this fervor for U. S. participation in the Paris agreement?  After all, according to the UN’s own figures, if the U. S. doesn’t participate in the Paris deal, the atmospheric temperature will rise by a mere 0. 3 celsius in the next century (that is, if one trusts these sorts of projections). Many will ask: Is it really worth ripping up the political fabric of the U. S. for such a tiny goal?  Yet the answer that’s coming back, of course, is an emphatic “Yes!” Thus we come to see that the climate change issue is perhaps better to be regarded as a matter of morality or even theology, as opposed to money, or science. Indeed, maybe it’s akin to a religious revival —  that is, a revival for the mostly  .   And so The New York Times’ David Brooks probably spoke for many in his social class when he entitled his June 2 column, “Donald Trump Poisons the World. ” In that piece, Brooks outlined the ultimate rationale for many Trump opponents who have picked up a green hammer (among other kinds of hammers) to wield against the dreaded 45th president: “People yearn for righteousness. They want to feel meaning and purpose in their lives, that their lives are oriented toward the good. ”  Such emotions can be viewed as either righteous or   but either way, they are powerful. By this reckoning, the sacred guideposts of this new worldview include not only the United Nations, but also the European Union.  And so it should come as little surprise that American elites openly side with the UN and the EU that is, they prefer to associate themselves with, say, Angela Merkel of Germany, and never   .  Indeed, in this new world order, Merkel is now routinely  considered to be the world’s most moral political leader. 2. China Plays the Green Card, In their untiring enthusiasm to hammer Trump with everything available, the elites have made some curious choices.  Here’s a revealing headline from the MSM’s marquee name, the Times: “Trump Hands the Chinese a Gift: The Chance for Global Leadership. ” Let’s try to get this straight: China as the global leader, because of climate change?  To many, that will seem like quite a stretch, since, under the terms of the Paris agreement, China must make precisely zero cuts in carbon emissions before “around 2030. ”  In the meantime, China is emitting more carbon dioxide than any other country indeed, even now it emits twice as much as the US. Yet for their part, the Chinese, who seem relentlessly conscious of the strategic goal of   the West, even as they themselves continue to industrialize, seem happy to play along with politically correct green thinking. On June 1, China’s Premier Li Keqiang stood alongside EU leaders, intoning about the “global consensus” on climate change, and declaring the “international responsibility” to do something about it.  Given such   words, nobody seemed to notice that China won’t start doing anything about carbon for another 13 years —  maybe. Why the maybe?   Let’s remember that this is the same People’s Republic of China that is flagrantly defying adjudicated international law on the high seas in order to protect its strategic interests.  Can that same regime really to be trusted to give up its economic interests? To be sure, some American leaders outside of the Trump administration are courageous enough to call out this bizarre process.  One such is Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who last month laid out the stakes to Breitbart News’  Matthew Boyle: About eight billion tons of coal is burned per year in the world.  The United States of America burns less than one billion tons of coal a year, so we’re less than one eighth of the world’s consumption.  That tells you   of all the coal in the world is being burnt somewhere else.  Four billion tons is being burned in just China alone. [emphasis added] In other words, the Chinese burn four times as much coal as we do, and yet we’re judged to be the bad guys.  Sad! 3. The Coming Battle: Plutocrats vs. People, We shouldn’t kid ourselves: The actions of the Trump administration notwithstanding, it’s still possible that green activists —  greatly bolstered, as we have seen, by overall   enthusiasm —  will succeed in stopping fossil fuels in their tracks.  Indeed, if we go to the web page of the same Bloomberg Philanthropies, we see that already, Bloomberg and his allies have succeeded in shutting down 251 coal plants.  So we can ask: Did anything Trump decided on Thursday make it more likely that any one of those plants will  ? In the meantime, we can be sure that all the actors, activists, litigators, and regulators will keep right on going, true to their   righteous mission of  domestic energy shutdowns, freelance international diplomacy —  and anything else they can think of.   Indeed, from their point of view, if bashing coal and fossil fuels means bashing Trump as well —  all the better.   And of course, such   also has a way of becoming   . For instance, Frank Rich, the longtime New York Times theater critic and columnist now writing for the   New York magazine, looks askance at any possible effort,   election, to understand the motivations of Trump supporters.  Rich derides such efforts as “Hillbilly Chic,” adding: For those of us who want to bring down the curtain on the Trump era as quickly as possible, this pandering to his voters raises a more immediate and practical concern: Is it a worthwhile political tactic that will actually help reverse Republican rule?  Or is it another counterproductive detour? In other words, no sympathy for the hillbilly from that New Yorker —  nor from many others. Of course, the idea that city dwellers look down their noses at the “rubes” in the rest of America is nothing new in fact, Manhattanites have been known to proudly proclaim their arrogance. Moreover, it’s no shock that most Democrats —  Manchin is just about by himself in his party on climate change —  are inclined to oppose just about anything that a conservative or a Republican might wish to do.  That is, after all, what partisan politics is often about. However, what might be surprising is the degree to which the very wealthy have turned against one of the historic engines of economic growth, namely, fossil fuels. In fact, we can look back at the last three centuries and see that energy consumption has soared a   since George Washington’s time.  It’s that growth in energy consumption that has fueled, literally, the standard of living that we enjoy today.  And, of course, nobody enjoys it more than the very wealthy. In fact, the environment is, according crucial metrics, vastly better than it was in the old days, when people hunched over unventilated     burning hearths for cooking and for warmth, or else hunted down whales, nearly to extinction, for their blubber, which provided scanty amounts of fuel and tallow. Yet today we find that many of the wealthiest families are now distancing themselves from economic growth.  Or, as they might prefer to say it, they are demanding that we “evolve” beyond fossil fuels.  Of course, it’s never clear  whether or not the world is ready to make such an economic leap of faith. Indeed the reader might ask himself or herself: Is it wise to trust our “betters” when they tell us that the   renewables —  solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy —  can be expanded rapidly enough to protect the   of the average American? In fact, according to the National Academy of Sciences, in 2015 those four renewables made up less than eight percent of total U. S. energy consumption.  So realistically, what are the chances that they could be expanded sufficiently to take the place of the energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear, hydropower) that are now out of fashion in high circles? Or, is it wiser for the ordinary Joe and Jane to conclude that the Al Gore class simply doesn’t care what happens to them?  After all, the last few decades of environmental politicking, which have undercut so many Heartland industries and jobs, would seem to point to that bleak conclusion. Indeed, speaking of haute, perhaps the most astonishing bit of plutocratic   can be seen in the choices made by the Rockefeller Family Fund, which announced in 2016 that, having deemed ExxonMobil to be “morally reprehensible,” because of its ongoing energy production, it was therefore choosing to divest itself of its stock in the company. This is a remarkable turn of events, since ExxonMobil is descended from John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil.  In other words, the fortune that the Rockefellers enjoy to this day comes from fossil fuels. We might note that “divestment” is not the same as “giving the money away. ” That is, the Rockefellers, this branch of the family at least, are simply transferring their wealth from one stock to another.   Meanwhile, the rest of us might observe: If gains are judged to be   they should be renounced, not simply shuffled. Yet in the meantime, these Rockefellers will now be free to join the swelling blue chorus that regards climate change as a greater threat than all the other threats, including —  but certainly not limited to —  terrorism, North Korea, and the Zika virus. Yes, these are curious choices that some, especially in the toniest zip codes, are making.  But as we have seen and will see, they aren’t just making these choices for themselves instead, they seek to make choices for the rest of us. So that’s why should all be paying attention, and seeking appropriate strategies in response.

The emails also include an exchange between Abedin, Clinton personal assistant Lauren Jiloty, and Iris Anaya, the assistant to sugar magnate and Clinton Foundation donor Alfonso Fanjul concerning a request for special access to Clinton. On October 13, 2009, Anaya emailed Abedin seeking to arrange a meeting between Fanjul, the CEO of Florida Crystals, and Clinton. Jiloty responded the next day, asking that Anaya talk with Clinton scheduler Lona Valmoro about “setting up a meeting.” Fanjul donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation and was a Bill Clinton co-chairman in Florida. 
In an October 26, 2009, email exchange, power attorney and Hillary Clinton financial supporter, Charlie Ann Syprett, contacted Doug Band, apparently seeking help in getting around U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) restrictions on U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to Cuba. Syprett ostensibly wanted a waiver from the restrictions to enable people from her organization, SYC Charitable Foundation, to travel to Cuba, noting “we are not asking for something out of the ordinary.” 
The emails also show that Valmoro sent Clinton’s government schedule to the unsecure email addresses of numerous members of the Clinton Foundation staff on October 16, 2009, again on October 18, 2009, and on October 25, 2009. The emails also include discussions of personnel matters and appointments on Clinton’s unsecure account, which may run afoul of federal privacy law.

[“To be clear, my decision had nothing to do with politics, and I would have been proud to again work under a Republican administration open to intelligence analysis,” Price wrote in an   he penned for the Washington Post Monday. He added, “As intelligence professionals, we’re taught to tune out politics” and noted that “Despite working proudly for Republican and Democratic presidents, I reluctantly concluded that I cannot in good faith serve this administration as an intelligence professional. ”  Price suggested his decision emanated from President Trump’s “disturbing” actions. However, public records indicate Price has been listed as a registered Democrat in D. C. since 2008. Further, Federal Election Commission (FEC) records show that Price donated thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

11912,Texas Cop Survives Being Run Over Twice -- Suspect Shot Dead,"An Arlington, Texas, police officer is lucky to be alive after being run over twice by a fleeing suspect. The suspect was fatally shot by another officer during his attempt to flee. [Arlington Police Department Corporal Elise Bowden was released from John Peter Smith Hospital on Super Bowl Sunday following an incident she did not expect to live through. The   police veteran, and mother of eight, was greeted by a cheering crowd of fellow officers, other   friends, and relatives as she was wheeled out of the hospital. “I’m just overwhelmed,” she told the crowd.  She was accompanied by Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson, Sergeant Brad Norman and her husband as she exited the hospital. “Another detective from Dallas who got run over himself came to tell me, ‘You’ll survive this’,” the gutsy police officer told the  . “I know I will. I already did. Everything I have is mendable. ” On February 1, Cpl. Bowden made a routine traffic stop. A records check on the driver,    Tavis Cane, revealed the driver had an outstanding felony warrant from Dallas County. The warrant was for evading arrest. He also had several misdemeanor warrants out of neighboring Grand Prairie, Texas, the Fort Worth   reported. Upon learning about the warrants, Bowden called for  . Two more Arlington police officers quickly responded. The officers approached Crane and ordered him out of the car. Arlington Police Department spokesman Lt. Christopher Cook told reporters, “She was very polite. The suspect was given so many chances to get out of the vehicle that I’d say she was begging him to get out. ” The second officer, Craig Roper, opened the passenger door of the car and began to enter to attempt to force Crane out of the car. Bowden was approaching the rear of Crane’s car when he allegedly put the car in reverse, running over Bowden and crashing into her patrol car. The impact on the patrol car was so sever, it knocked the vehicle out of its   positioning. The suspect then put the car in drive and attempted to drive away. He ran over Bowden again while attempting to flee the scene. Roper then shot Crane from the passenger seat of the vehicle. The car came to a stop before reaching the end of the street. Two other adults and a toddler were inside the vehicle at the time of the incident, the Fort Worth newspaper reported. No one else was injured in the incident. The event was captured on two dash cam videos, Cook stated. “It’s a very difficult and hard video to watch. It shows how close to death she was. ” The department has not yet released the videos. Bowden received several broken bones from being run over two times by the car. On Sunday, a smiling officer was wheeled out of the hospital and sent home where she is expected to make a complete recovery. Bowden is in her 15th year of service to the Arlington community. Officer Roper was placed on administrative leave, as is normal policy for an   shooting, pending the outcome of the investigation. Roper is in his second year of service to the department. Crane was transported to Arlington Memorial Hospital after being shot. He died from his wound early Thursday morning. Officers attempted to provide first aid before he was taken to the hospital.

Hillary is flipping out, Danny Williams Bill Clintons Black son by an Arkansas prostitute is making himself known to the Obsolete Main Stream Media and to the Legitimate news media on the internet. Hillary has lost control of this latest scandal. braindiseasecalledliberalism 
She’s been brain dead for years – now her body is simply playing catch-up! 
Most believe that a potted plant would have a better handle on running this country than the aspiring devil-in-chief! islamroastschildren 
A new close-up discloses a gash on her right cheek….of her face…..possibly from a fall. lloyd Lisco 
This Evil woman is Dying, She is Hooked on and is using so many Dangerous drugs to keep going, She cannot last much longer. In addition to the Coke and Alcohol she consumes she is taking Modafinil, A very powerful form of Speed, She is taking Ativan, Avonex, Eliquis, Warfarin, Moxatag, Tegretol, Reteplase and a long list of other less powerful drugs. This combination of super powerful drugs would kill a horse. This woman is not capable of running this Country, Her supporters want to see her in charge so that they can continue all the rackets they are using to rob the American people. At Hillary’s death she would be replaced by a body double or a clone, An occasional photo would fool the public along with the MSM scripted lies, So that the racketeers could continue stripping America. That is their plan, Hillary must be defeated. islamroastschildren 
Sounds like she can be replaced by an automated PHARMACY. She can’t DIE fast enough to satisfy. westerling 
Hillary needs to make one last step by entering a Mental instutition and forget the election! altogether 
The real truth of Hillary’s medical condition, lies in the eyes of the beholders, such as her current Secret Service handlers, whom could impart a more truthful account of which the MSM is attempting to hide. If this latest episode of HRC’s pooor medical conditon transpired only yesterday, imagine how her condition will appear between now and November 8, 2016. I can only imagine that she will not be campaigning too often between now and then, not after this most recent attach of Parkinson’s disease. Jonathan Brooks 
I think Hitlery needs to drop the pretence, and use a wheelchair and supplementary oxygen, since her flying demoncrat monkeys will steal the election with Soros backed vote fraud, and dead and illegal alien votes. 
Why does she even make the effort to appeal to the voters when she is clearly a sick evil old fraud and the Demoncrats do not care. islamroastschildren 
At THIS stage of her worthless life, it can ONLY be for ‘the Fame’ because she can no longer enjoy most of the fruits of what MONEY can buy, being near DEATH’S DOOR as she is. Jonathan Brooks 
I think Fame is a good pick, but also revenge, because Hill will take out as many of her enemies before Death’s dark Design ends her reign of Evil 
I have noticed that you have used the English word, “DROP,” therefore, to solve the current conundrum involving this worthless effn Com- munist, Hillary Rotten Clinton, she needs to “DROP” dead. Jonathan Brooks 
Remove the mask, maybe? I do not want Hillary dead, but hiding in Dubaii, avoiding extradition, and praying to Allah or Lucifer that all her backers do not hunt her down for taking money and not paying off. Jonathan Brooks

11914,"For Syrian Girl in Need of Medical Care, Trump’s Travel Ban Adds to a Nomadic Tragedy - The New York Times","BARCELONA, Spain  —   President Trump’s travel ban disrupted the plans of hundreds of people around the globe, but perhaps none more vulnerable than Sham Aldaher, a Syrian refugee girl, and her family. Sham, now 1½, was born without an eye and with a seriously disfigured face. Following two complex operations at a Barcelona hospital, Sham is due to receive an eye prosthesis next Wednesday. Her family had then planned to resettle in the United States. They had already completed the required interviews and cleared all security checks before the plans were blocked by  Mr. Trump’s  executive order to bar citizens from Syria and six other   countries seen as threatening to America’s safety. “They were   and they are now barred,” said Jayne Fleming, the head of the human rights team at Reed Smith, an American law firm that has been helping Sham and her family. Ms. Fleming and her team are now scrambling to see whether Britain, Germany or another country could instead welcome the family. “They’re distressed over not knowing what the future holds for them. ” The Aldahers’ story is a nomadic tragedy, telling of the accumulated hardships that have been piled on many Syrian refugees. It is also a small but striking example of the broader crisis highlighted in a United Nations report issued on Tuesday showing that the children most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by Mr. Trump’s order. Sham’s parents left Syria and their jobs as teachers in 2013. They traveled with their three children to Lebanon and then Egypt. But their arrival coincided with the unrest and military coup that removed Mohamed Morsi as Egypt’s president. “We left our home to find safety, but in Egypt there were bombings in the night and the children were very afraid,” said Ali Aldaher, Sham’s father. So the family packed up again to join thousands of other Syrian refugees in Jordan. Sham was born there in July 2015, on the day of the Muslim holiday of Eid  . The coincidence was seen as a blessing by her parents, but it complicated Sham’s birth, as most local hospital workers were on vacation and the family could not find a doctor. Even though a midwife eventually assisted in the birth, Sham’s mother “did not receive the health care she needed and I’m sure all the stress hurt,” Mr. Aldaher recounted. When Sham was born, her father tried to calm his wife by pretending Sham was keeping one eye shut, even though he could see that she had no eyelid and a misshaped face. “Before the birth of Sham, my worries were how would I support my family, without any work in Jordan and without money,” Mr. Aldaher said. “After she was born, we forgot about food, our problems, ourselves and even our other children to start our new journey of suffering for Sham, to see how we could possibly care for this child. ” Sham’s family received assistance from different nongovernmental organizations, including Doctors Without Borders. Lawyers from Reed Smith started searching for a hospital capable of undertaking such advanced surgery, while helping the family apply for resettlement in the United States. The lawyers then delayed the move to America because they could not simultaneously find an American hospital ready to treat Sham at no cost. Instead, the Sant Joan de Déu hospital in Barcelona agreed to help. Entering Spain, however, also proved a struggle. In June 2016, the Spanish government granted Sham’s family permission to travel to Barcelona, shortly after The New York Times published an article about the infant’s plight and Spain’s refusal to grant visas to the whole family. Even before Mr. Trump’s executive order to bar citizens of some countries from entering the United States, on security grounds, many European governments were dragging their feet in meeting their own commitments to welcome more refugees, following a European Union agreement reached in September 2015. By the end of 2016, about 900 refugees had resettled in Spain, out of the quota of 17, 377 agreed on by Spain’s government. Sham underwent two major facial surgeries in Barcelona. In August, doctors reset her facial bones, also to make room for an eye orbit. In December, they fissured her skin into an eyelid and implanted fat taken from Sham’s bottom into the artificial orbit, which was then   with a curved plastic shell. Sham is due to receive her eye prosthesis next Wednesday. Dr. Joan Prat, the chief ophthalmologist at the Sant Joan de Déu hospital, said he used a unique technique to “invent a cavity from zero. ” The eye surgery was not only difficult but also urgent, because Sham’s face will soon reach a level of development that would make the disfigurement permanent. “Either we did something now or it was game over,” Dr. Prat said. The kind of disorder suffered by Sham, known as anophthalmia, occurs “only every few years,” he added. The surgery was a success, but Dr. Prat said Sham should remain under close monitoring, not only because of her face but also because of other health concerns, including her failure to put on weight. Further surgery will be required to correct facial asymmetries as she grows, while her eye prothesis will also need replacement. Sham and her family were granted residency in Spain until late December. They have been housed in a   apartment, a stone’s throw from the Sagrada Família, Barcelona’s emblematic basilica. Ms. Fleming said that the family wanted to live in the United States in large part because Sham could get excellent   medical care there. She acknowledged that the family was now concerned about a backlash against Muslims in America and that “they are distressed by rhetoric that brands them as terrorists. ” In Barcelona, Sham’s family has received support from the city, as well as Caritas and other nongovernmental organizations. Sham’s siblings have joined a local school. On a bookshelf, the family keeps a small Quran that is among the few items that traveled with them from Syria. A prayer mat is also pinned to the wall, but the family normally goes to a Barcelona mosque for Friday Prayer. When the girl was born, her mother gave her an ancient name for Syria, Sham. Wherever the family finally ends up living, she said, “one day Sham will ask me what is the meaning of her name and I will at least be able to tell her that it is your country, it is Syria. ”",0
11915,Cold War Jitters Resurface as U.S. Marines Arrive in Norway - The New York Times,"For Norwegians, the sight of dozens of American Marines traipsing through the snow in military fatigues  —   the first time foreign forces have been posted to their country’s territory since World War II  —   may have brought a welcomed sense of security, but it also harked back to a dark era of the Cold War that many had hoped to forget. A United States military plane on Monday delivered most of the 330 Marines to a garrison in Vaernes, in central Norway, a deployment that Norwegian officials said had been carried out by the United States as part of a bilateral agreement. It was the latest effort by the United States and its European allies to buttress their defenses against a resurgent Russia, which condemned the move. Despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum, the arrival of the Marines from Camp Lejeune, N. C.  —   shown on Norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow  —   also provoked some jitters in Norway. A wealthy   country that is a member of NATO but not the European Union, the Nordic state has long prided itself on its independence. But the deployment recalled a Cold War era in which Russian intrigue grabbed headlines and Norwegians lived in fear of Soviet hegemony. Neuroses about Russia continue to exert influence in Norwegian popular culture. The political television thriller “Okkupert” depicts a future in which Norway is occupied by Russia, and with the backing of the European Union, takes over the country’s oil production. Such fears have been magnified in recent years with murky sightings of submarines across the region that have stoked concern about Russian espionage and military intervention. In October 2014, an unidentified vessel spotted off the Stockholm archipelago spurred Sweden’s largest mobilization since the Cold War and accusations that Russia was spying on the country. The episode, called “The Hunt for Reds in October” in the Swedish news media, included unsubstantiated reports of a man in black spotted wading near the vessel. It deeply unsettled the nation, even as the Kremlin issued strenuous denials and accused Stockholm of scaremongering. Then, in April 2015, the sudden appearance of an underwater vessel in Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, prompted the navy to fire depth charges  —   the first such warning in more than 10 years. And Lithuania on Monday said it plans to use European Union funding to build a fence on the border with Russia’s highly militarised Kaliningrad exclave to increase security and prevent smuggling, according to Agence  . Construction of the   $32 million fence will start this spring and will be finished by the end of the year, said Interior Minister Eimutis Misiunas. “The reasons are both economic to prevent smuggling and geopolitical to strengthen the E. U.’s external border,” Mr. Misiunas said. “It would not stop tanks but it will be difficult to climb over. ” In Moscow, the deployment of United States Marines in Norway has been met with disdain. After plans for the deployment were confirmed in October, Frants Klintsevich, a deputy chairman of Russia’s defense and security committee in the upper chamber of Parliament, was quoted by Russian news media as saying that the Kremlin viewed the Marines as a direct military threat. He also said the deployment made Norway a potential target for Moscow’s powerful arsenal, which includes nuclear weapons. On Monday, the Russian authorities reiterated their discontent. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said in an interview with NRK, the Norwegian public broadcaster, that the move “certainly will not improve relations. ” “The relationship between Norway and Russia is put to a test now,” she said. “Instead of developing economic cooperation, Norway is choosing to deploy United States troops on Norwegian soil. ” The deployment of the Marines, who will be stationed hundreds of miles from the border with Russia, comes as countries across Europe have been reinforcing their defenses out of concern over an increasingly assertive Russia. Last week, a convoy from an American armored brigade crossed the German border into Poland, the first installment of what are expected to be several thousand NATO troops to be based across Eastern Europe. Relations between the West and Russia in the Nordic region and beyond have been tense since that country’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the outbreak of conflict between government forces and   rebels in eastern Ukraine. At the same time,   Donald J. Trump fanned alarm in Europe in the months leading to his election victory when he questioned whether the United States should automatically defend NATO allies if they were attacked, and predicated American support on the willingness of countries in the alliance to pay their fair share for military protection. In Norway, some lamented that the Marines’ arrival stood against the country’s traditions and threatened to make it a target of its much larger neighbor. Morten Harper, a leftist member of the local assembly that governs the area housing the military base, said the Marines’ arrival was ensnaring Norway into the United States’ “power struggle” with Russia. “We see an ever more tense foreign policy situation,” he said. “If there ever was to be a major conflict between the great powers in the future, this makes us a more likely bomb target. ” After World War II, Norway abandoned its neutral stance by joining NATO in 1949 and committing to the alliance’s doctrine of collective defense. But the country, which shares a   northern border with Russia, sought to placate Moscow by pledging that no foreign troops would be allowed to be permanently stationed on its soil. Norway’s defense minister, Ine Eriksen Soreide, said in an interview on Sunday that Russia had no reason to be alarmed by the Marines’ presence. She said that the deployment did not flout the     restriction because the Marines were there on a   trial period that was  . The Marines will take part in military exercises, involving skiing and surviving in Arctic temperatures, to hone their abilities to fight in tough winter conditions. It is part of a bilateral agreement between Oslo and Washington, but Norwegian officials said that, in the case of a conflict, the troops would probably fall under NATO’s command. Hedda B. Langemyr of the Norwegian Peace Council, a group made up of several nongovernmental organizations, said the deployment threatened to aggravate tension between Norway and Russia while breaching Norway’s tradition of not allowing permanent foreign troops on its soil. “It might give the hawks in Moscow arguments for a continued arms race,” she said.",0
11916,Clinton’s Palmieri in 2015 expressed relief GOP is ‘not focused on the classified email’,"Print 
Shortly after the story first broke in March 2015 that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account and homebrew server during her tenure as secretary of state, the Democratic nominee went into damage control. Her first public remarks came in the form of a press avail at the U.N. , where she told reporters: 
[W]hen I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. 
She went on to emphasize that everything she did was above board and according to Hoyle. 
But despite her assurances — and perhaps as a direct consequence of her propensity for lying — the story refused to go away. Questions arose about whether any of the emails transmitted from or to her personal account contained classified information, which she vehemently denied. 
Now, thanks to WikiLeaks, an email written by her campaign’s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri , has emerged that suggests Clinton’s denial may have been less than forthright. The email is dated May 22, 2015 and addresses the candidate’s demeanor at another press event: 
The highlighted portion of the text seems pretty conclusive in its confirmation that her campaign team and Clinton herself knew at that early date that some of the communications in her private account had indeed contained classified data. 
Clinton has still never admitted, despite evidence to the contrary unearthed by the FBI, that she used her email to conduct affairs of state. Perhaps now she will?",0
11917,His Idea for Fighting Terrorism? Funny Plays - The New York Times,"BRUSSELS  —   As the lights go dark in a theater here, gunfire and explosions are heard. Some in the audience gasp, including several women wearing head scarves. Onstage, a Muslim terrorist in an orange prison jumpsuit appears. During the play, we learn that he has killed people at a Jewish school whom, in other circumstances, he might have befriended, we come to understand. The play is “Géhenne,” or “Hell,” the latest by Ismaël Saidi, a comic Belgian playwright and actor, whose work  —   with its comedic touches and visceral understanding of the frustrations of young, underprivileged European Muslims  —   has been used by the French and Belgian governments as a cultural weapon against radicalization. His play “Jihad,” from 2014, was about three hapless Belgian Muslims who travel to Syria but eventually understand that their attempt at holy war is a grave mistake. But with “Géhenne,” the somewhat hopeful message of “Jihad”  —   that terrorists can come back from the dark side  —   has been tempered. Mr. Saidi, a practicing Muslim and former police officer, said that performing “Jihad” in prisons across Belgium and France for the past two years has caused him to doubt whether violent religious zealots can ever really change. If a person doesn’t want to, “you can take this guy to A. A. all your life, but one day he will drink again,” Mr. Saidi said in a recent interview after a performance of “Géhenne” before a packed audience of nearly 1, 000 people at the Théâtre   here. His latest play implicitly argues for prevention, suggesting that teaching young people how to get along in a multicultural society is far better than trying to reform violent criminals. “The only cure I think is like a vaccination that had to be done long before,” he added. Mr. Saidi’s more sober outlook about deradicalization  —   which he said was shaped by conversations with inmates jailed on terrorism charges  —   was echoed by a report released last month by two French senators. They found that France’s approach, especially creating a handful of rehabilitation centers to   violent terrorists, had been ineffective. But even as the centers’ effectiveness is questioned, some are not ready to jettison such efforts. Ouisa Kies, a sociologist who has worked with terrorists in French prisons, said culture was fundamental to programs that help bring jihadists back from violence. “The problem is that France is very late to this,” she said. “The failure is in coordination and evaluation, not in the contents of the programs. ” In the past two years, after a flurry of terrorist attacks, the French government has begun investing in efforts to shape young hearts and minds. It has given money to schools and other venues that host “Jihad,” while the Belgian government has spent 50, 000 euros (about $54, 000) to underwrite tours of the play. “Jihad” has also been included in the French Education Ministry’s school curriculum aimed at preventing radicalization. Muriel Domenach, who leads the French government’s task force on the prevention of radicalization, called Mr. Saidi’s work both funny and important. “It’s a   counternarrative,” she said. It shows “that of course there’s discrimination, lack of prospects” for many young Muslims, “but at the same time it’s everyone’s responsibility, including citizens who are Muslim, to be taking action. ” The play, in which three men tell stories of personal humiliation that led them to militant Islam, was seen as prescient when it debuted in Schaerbeek, an area of Brussels with a large North African immigrant population. That happened just weeks before terrorists attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in Paris in January 2015. (Some of the terrorists involved in the attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, were from Schaerbeek.) Mr. Saidi, who was born in Belgium to parents from Morocco, dislikes being told he was prescient. “What pains me is that this is about things we’ve been living for the past 25 years,” he said of “Jihad” after a performance at a cultural center in    a Paris suburb with a large immigrant population. “Syria is just an excuse,” he added. “My play is about broken identities. ” It’s shot through with a quick,   humor. When the   jihadists meet an Arab named Michel, unaware that he’s Christian, one tells him not to worry, he’s not in Belgium looking for a job so he can use his real name. The “Jihad” performance was well received that night. “We need the kind of humor you find in ‘Jihad’ to talk about this topic,” said Hamza Irfan, 15, who attended with an   program. “It speaks to everyone. It doesn’t feel boring, or depressing, or too light it just feels serious. ” Naghmana Kayani, who runs the   program, said “Jihad” was an important tool in potential prevention. “Every time there’s an attack, it affects us,” she said. Instead of trafficking in stereotypes, she added, “Jihad” helps “fight against obscurantism. ” More than 100, 000 people have seen “Jihad,” and Mr. Saidi holds emotional public conversations with audiences afterward. He still performs in prisons, but not for those convicted of terrorism. “They hate it,” he said, referring to his play. “So it’s bad for them, and bad for me. ” Taking “Jihad” on tour and discussing it with audiences has changed him in other ways, and made him question his faith. “I am still the same, but the way I see things changed,” he said. “I love something that I hated before: I love doubt. ” That doubt comes through in “Géhenne,” in which Mr. Saidi plays Ismaël, who has lost his legs after blowing himself up at the Jewish school. In prison, he imagines a conversation with a Roman Catholic priest who smokes hash with him and says he questions the existence of God, and with a woman he takes a shine to and who he eventually discovers is Jewish  —   the first Jew he has ever met. At the end of the play, we discover the woman and her daughter were victims of his attack, and the conversations are visions of a world that might have been. “He killed her and her kid, and he understands at the end,” Mr. Saidi said. “That’s hell for him. ” He said that doing a benefit performance of “Jihad” for members of 13 Onze 15, an association of survivors and family members of victims of the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, had caused him to revise “Géhenne” so that Ismaël seeks forgiveness after realizing what he’s done. “Everyone was really, really moved,” said Aurelia Gilbert, who survived the attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris. “It gives a life, a name, a story behind those guys. They’re not only the faces you see in the newspaper, and they are dead. ” After the recent performance of “Géhenne” in Brussels, a Belgian woman who gave her name only as Antoinette said that she had come to see the play because her daughter had converted to Islam and had gone to Syria. She had traveled to Syria to bring her daughter back. The play “shows how young people should reflect on what’s going on, on what they’re doing,” Antoinette said. “It’s a really complex problem, for those who go and those who return. ” Mr. Saidi said that his message in “Géhenne” was “that everything begins with ignorance and hate. ” He added, “If somebody had taught Ismaël love for someone else, and not hatred for Jews, nothing would have happened. ”",0
11918,"As Race Tightens, Clinton Campaign Is Counting on Minority Support","David Weigel, Washington Post, October 31, 2016 
{snip} 
Following the latest FBI inquiry, which has dominated news coverage for days and has been described as a potential lifeline for Republican nominee Donald Trump, Clinton’s campaign is counting on its organization more than ever to revive the coalition that twice elected Barack Obama. 
In places such as Michigan, that means turning out minorities in big numbers to overcome Trump’s advantage among white voters. The trend in early-voting returns has been both encouraging and worrying for the Clinton campaign: Enthusiasm among Latinos appears to be up, in some cases considerably, but African Americans are turning out in smaller numbers than they did with Obama on the ticket. 
That’s the picture in Florida. Early returns show a boost in turnout in heavily Latino counties and a decline in largely African American ones. In a state such as Nevada, where Democrats are relying heavily on Latinos, early returns show they are voting in similar numbers as in 2012, boosting Democratic chances. But in battleground states such as Ohio where Democrats are counting on African Americans to put them over the top, they could be in trouble if blacks stay home. 
Polling shows a similar story. Clinton maintains a large lead among nonwhite voters in the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll, but by a smaller margin than Obama did. In polling since Oct. 20, Clinton has led Trump by more than 3 to 1 among all nonwhites (69 percent to 19 percent), compared with President Obama’s margin of 80 percent to 19 percent in 2012. 
Moreover, nonwhite voters are more united by their strong dislike of Trump than positive views of Clinton–only 39 percent have a strongly favorable view of Clinton, while 68 percent have strongly unfavorable views toward Trump. 
{snip} 
In closer states, Trump’s campaign is working to soften enthusiasm for Clinton among young black voters. One TV ad plays a clip of Clinton, then supportive of a new crime bill, referring to a group of young black offenders as “super-predators.” That two-decade-old quote–even after an apology–has dogged Clinton with some Black Lives Matters activists. Trump has also sought to dampen enthusiasm by casting life in black communities as something akin to apocalyptic. 
{snip} In North Carolina, where Democrats and civil rights groups won a high-profile lawsuit against Republican-backed voting restrictions, the early look is mixed. Total black turnout has fallen 17 percent from its 2012 level, but Democrats point to a shrunken number of early-voting locations to claim that they are on track. At the polls, the voters who are showing up said they feel an obligation, if not passion. 
“It’s not like four years ago when we knew we were going for Barack Obama, no ifs, ands and buts,” Sunia Wilson, 38, said after casting a ballot at the Chavis Community Center in Raleigh. “This year it’s like, ‘Hmmm. I don’t know.’ But I’ve got to vote.”

11919,LGBTQ Marchers Protest Vice President-Elect Mike Pence in His Neighborhood,"More than 500 supporters of LGBTQ rights in Washington, D. C. marched, danced, and chanted two miles from the shopping district of Friendship Heights to the Chevy Chase home of Vice   and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Wednesday evening —  two days before he is sworn in as vice president. [“We’re here to send a clear message to Mike Pence that we are here, we are queer, and we are dancing, and we will not tolerate hatred or bigotry in our country,” said Firas Nasr, the founding organizer of WERK for Peace. WERK for Peace describes itself as a “  grassroots movement that uses dance to promote peace. ”  Nasr said when he saw the people watching from the sidewalks, windows, and doorways, he was not surprised by the generous welcome the marchers received. “We are preaching love, and we are here to spread love and   and community —  and so we welcome them in our community. ” The District of Columbia permitted the protest and provided at least five motorcycle police officers to escort the marchers along the route and manage the flow of traffic. A dozen individuals were wearing the green ball caps of the National Lawyers Guild, a   organization of legal professionals who patrol progressive events on behalf of the participants. Carla Aronsohn said Pence has attacked rights for LGBTQ people, as well as programs to provide Americans with housing and health care. “He needs to know that that is why we are in his neighborhood,” she said. “This stuff affects our lives deeply. Literally, it kills us, so we can’t have some relaxed, permitted march in a   space. We need to be in a bigger space. ” Along the route, the protesters stopped at intersections to have   parties behind the gray pickup truck that blared the music. The longest stop was in front of the Chevy Chase Baptist Church, where the revelers formed a large circle in front of the church and danced. When the marchers came to the Roman Catholic Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament, they did not stop. The Secret Service, Metropolitan Police, and U. S. Marshals did not have to tell the protesters not to go farther when they arrived at the intersection of Western and Tennyson Avenues in the city’s northwest quadrant. A spokesman for the Secret Service told Breitbart News that the neighborhood surrounding the Pence residence was a protected site, and only those who resided there, along with their guests, were allowed past the barricades erected across Tennyson. Law enforcement personnel were on the scene, including a   bicycle cops standing behind a neighbor’s hedges. For roughly 45 minutes, the protesters danced to club and dance songs emanating from the truck that had led the march:   Many neighbors came out to support the protest. A man holding a   sign, who identified himself as Godding, told Breitbart News he had no idea there would be a protest through his neighborhood until he heard the drums. As Godding stood quietly off to the side, a small band of protesters surrounded him and gyrated next to him. One of the protesters shouted at him, “We’re here! We’re queer! Don’t fuck with us!” “I just think it is inappropriate in front of his house. That’s what I think,” he said. “I don’t mind people protesting. I don’t mind people having their own opinions, but they don’t need to be doing it in front of his house. It’s just inappropriate. ”  ",0
11920,"As The Super Masculine Guys/Men Wake-Up, Your Roles Change ~ Lisa Transcendence Brown","Posted by Madeline | Oct 26, 2016 | 2016 , Daily Blog | 0 | Thanks Heru! By Lisa Brown, 10/19/2016 I find it interesting to experience/observe. I can see their desire to expose/honor their hearts, yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do. I can see their beauty, magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to BE a MAN and feel all this stuff emerging within them. I can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore, fear of feeling, hurt, failure and losing control, letting anyone in, being let down, abandoned, judged….. which do not occur on NEW Earth. 
It is no different than when we woke up (women and feminine energy men), yet it is, for they’ve lived this life of strength, of being powerful, of being strong and surviving everything. For the really really masculine energy man (or women, but we are talking about men right now), their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability….. which is so totally the opposite, for we must allow ourselves that rawness/that vulnerability in order to truly feel again, to bring the walls of protection down, to not live in the fear of being alone…. 
When our soul awakens, we desire connection, deeply, yet we seek it in others first. Experience after experience activates our unworthiness, feeling of not-good-enough, lack of intimate lasting connection, rejected for not being “enough” in others minds, where they are not in-tune with their own sacred soul. 
WE are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now…. more and more. It’s important to support them, show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time. It’s important to open up and share, to show them it’s safe to be seen. It’s important to not impose, not pressure, not push… just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do. It’s important for the women to support the men now, yet in very different ways than before. 
Those who have opened their hearts KNOW that our relationships are very different here. We do not hold attachments, cords, expectations or needs anymore. All New Earth relationships are powerful, beautiful, freeing, supportive, empowering, inspiring and a co-creative experience of in-service to ourselves, each other and all on earth. They are to usher in the new era, this one now, through unity, peace, respect, support, contribution and Divine Love. 
Many men have been trying to wake up, going through their distortions, shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now. The more human masculine energy, the more safety, protection and survival mechanisms there were. Judgment is huge and it’s scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you don’t have a choice anymore. 
Women, it’s your time to step-up, to BE the one that already understands. To BE the one who holds that space and the STABILITY in place. When the old starts to collapse, crumble, dissolve, when emotions start to surface that you didn’t know were there, when nothing makes sense and you don’t understand why you can’t keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically…. we all know what this is like… we’ve been there. 
We’ve been through the collapse to move into creation of the new. To re-birth ourselves, our own realities and now the men do this too. There are many who were not ready before, yet those times (vibrations) are gone. You will start to see more men awaken, especially the strong ones, and the fear of “how” to deal with this… part of your job as an Ascended BEing, as a Master BEing, as a Light Tower and a Keeper of NEW Earth is to not just hold the space but show them how it’s all not only going to be okay, it’s going to be awesome. 
It doesn’t matter what body we are in, female or male. Men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one, the providers, the one’s that don’t break…. when we know better…. 
When the soul awakens, the human aspect does break/dissolve, and it doesn’t matter what bodies we are in. This process is genderless… We all have human masculine, human feminine and we have Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine too. 
Relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse, end, re-shape or transform, often all of these….. Some go their separate ways while each evolves, awakens, dies/re-births/grows up as Spirit/Soul in physical body form. 
Many women’s/partner’s/friend’s roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up. Just because they struggled before, resisted before, doesn’t mean they still are/will. When you show them (WayShower) that you can handle it, you can be the support, you can even be the provider if need be, then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore. 
As masculine/feminine are re-defined, according to ENERGY and that each can fill all of these roles themselves, then the balance can shift easily, and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles, can support others ready to do this too. 
Financial support is also a part of this, which can be emasculating if viewed through human eyes. When one realizes that money is just energy to support us all, they let go of the mis-perceptions and definitions once held by who did what role. In the old paradigm, Money was associated with power, which was a masculine thing. NOW money is an expression of gratitude, love, respect, contribution and is to support those stepping into/fulfilling their SOUL’s Purposes and Roles here. When the focus is taken off of money and put on what is truly important, the SOUL, then each can flourish, each can receive, each can share, each contributes the ENERGY of what is important to create a whole new reality of UNIFIED EXISTENCE here. 
Strength is through the purely open true warrior heart. Power is the knowledge and wisdom that comes through your own connection AS PURE SOURCE LIGHT within. Abundance is an existence. Divine Sacred Love is what makes the difference here. Union is when Souls come together, to work together, to be together and to bring forth realities consciously together. We all have to/had to do this ourselves so that we could create/anchor/hold the foundation of a whole new/remembered existence here. 
Your SOUL can see the awakening Soul of another. You can expand the space or shut it down/close portals. What’s appropriate will be determined by how conscious, present and open each is…. As a Master, you have the capability to see, understand and do more than you did as a limited and lacking human. Your energy makes the difference…………. They are going to need to pull away, be alone, sleep and have someone to talk to without being judged. The human aspect doesn’t believe it’s safe to open up, without being attacked, judged or imposed upon. It’s up to you to show that it is. Masculine energy believes it when they see it. You prove it by BEing your higher self all of the time. Their soul will emerge as you do. 
Higher Consciousness Existence. I love you.

11921,Hand-Foot-And-Mouth Disease On The Rise: What Parents Need To Know,"Share on Facebook Every parents worries about the infectious childhood illness that sweep through classrooms and after-school programs this time of year. Most kids get their inoculations early on to avoid old-fashioned diseases like mumps and rubella that used to effect huge swathes of children every year. Even better, there's now an annual flu shot for tackling one of the winter's most contagious illnesses — even Ellen knows how important it is to get your flu shot! Still, some diseases are proving harder to tackle than others. One of the most resistant is hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which still affects about 200,000 Americans in the USA every year. This year, experts at the West Central Health District in Georgia warn that it could be a record-breaking year for the disease, which is already causing outbreaks among school kids and college students. Scroll through below to learn more about the disease, and what you can do to head it off. Hnad-foot-and-mouth disease — or HFMD for short — is an incredibly common ailment that affects hundred of thousands of people every single year. Part of the reason it's so very common? It's highly contagious, and can spread easily from contact with saliva or mucus. In other words, you can't get it from simply being in the same room as someone with the infection, but you can get it from a sneeze, a kiss, or a handshake. That's part of the reason it runs rampant in kindergartens and preschools, where the kids tend to be grabby with one another, and are usually a little bit covered in spit and snot. It also spread quickly on college campuses, where food and drinks are shared frequently, and students tend to be overtired and not at peak physical health. Senior citizens or folks with weakened immune systems are also vulnerable, especially if they live communally, like in a nursing home. Of course, even a perfectly healthy adult in the prime of life can get this disease; it all depends on what germs you're exposed to. Fortunately, the symptoms are unpleasant, but usually mild and not life-threatening. They include flu-like symptoms, like fever and sore throat, but HFMD is most characterized by the itchy red spots that appear on — you guessed it — your hands, feet, and mouth. Sores may sometimes also appear on the legs and genitals. The virus looks alarming, especially if you're sporting spots, but fortunately it usually clears up on its own within a week or two. Still, if you suspect you or another member of your family has the disease, go to the doctor straight away. Because it's so contagious, this illness usually requires you to stay home until the virus is fully out of your system, to keep it from spreading to other folks in your community. Though the symptoms of the virus are usually mild, there can be serious side effects, especially in people with weakened immune systems from another illness or from age. In some rare cases, HFMD can lead to serious brain infections like meningitis and encephalitis. More commonly, kids who don't shake the symptoms for a few weeks may lose some of their fingernails or toenails. According to the CDC , outbreaks of HFMD are not common in the USA, but that might be changing this year. A large outbreak has been sweeping through Georgia, and may affect the wider South Eastern US, and could even spread to other regions of the country. If you happen to live in an area affected by this year's HFMD outbreak, it's important to be extremely vigilant about hygiene practices. To keep this illness away from your family, make sure everyone is washing their hands after leaving the bathroom, and before touching any food. If you suspect HFMD, make sure to keep your kiddos home from school until they have been cleared by a doctor. If you or someone you know does contract the illness, the best treatment is rest and plenty of fluids, even if the sores make swallowing a little painful. Watch the video below to learn more about hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and don't forget to SHARE to help prevent the spread of disease this year! Related:",0
11922,"As Donald Trump Calls for Wall on Mexican Border, Smugglers Dig Tunnels - The New York Times","NOGALES, Ariz.  —   On an embankment that runs along a towering steel fence separating this border town from its Mexican sister city, a patch of new concrete with a date carved into it stands out, marking the exit of a tunnel Border Patrol agents sealed in May. Dozens more like it snake around town, part of a vast underground network that Mexican drug cartels have used for years to funnel hundreds of pounds of illicit drugs into the United States. When Border Patrol agents find the tunnels, they dump concrete to seal them and stamp them with the date that they are shut down. But they struggle to stay ahead of the digging. Last Friday, the Border Patrol, in a joint operation with Mexican authorities, discovered an unfinished tunnel that started in a Mexican cemetery. “The clock is ticking as soon as they complete a tunnel,” said Kevin Hecht, a Border Patrol tunneling expert. “They know that we will eventually find them. But if even one load gets through before we find it, they consider it a success. ” While Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has made building a wall at the border a central element of his campaign, the fence here that reaches up to 30 feet has done little to deter enterprising drug smugglers. It has simply helped push them underground. Border Patrol agents cannot hear smugglers digging and do not know how many tunnels there are, a gap in border security that homeland security experts say renders talk of a wall moot. “The Border Patrol has done an incredible job, given its resources,” said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director in the Clinton administration. “But it would be a stretch to say that the border and border communities are secure when the agency lacks a   ability to detect   tunnels. No wall is going to fix that. ” During his immigration speech Wednesday in Arizona, Mr. Trump said his border security plan would use the best technology, including   and   sensors to “find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels. ” But no technology exists to reliably detect the tunnels, and experts say it may be years before such a system is developed. Since the first drug tunnel was discovered in 1990 in Douglas, Ariz. border officials say they have found nearly 200 more along the nearly   Southwest border, mostly in Arizona and California. Tunnels are so numerous in the Nogales area that Border Patrol agents described the ground underneath the city as “Swiss cheese. ” Mr. Hecht said smugglers dig tunnels mostly into the drainage system shared by the two cities. Others are burrowed into the basements of homes on the American side from buildings in Mexico. One tunnel was dug under a heavily guarded port of entry. Technological advances such as ground radar to detect movement, hundreds of   cameras with   lenses and drones flying overhead have drastically transformed border security. These tools have helped federal investigators track and arrest hundreds of smuggling suspects, and seize tons of marijuana, methamphetamines and cocaine.   robots help agents explore tunnels that are too risky for humans to enter. The American government has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into research in hopes of finding a way to detect tunnels, but most of these efforts have ended in disappointment. Most recently, the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security concluded that none of the current methods used to detect underground tunnels were “necessarily suited to Border Patrol agents’ operational needs. ” In the absence of technology to detect tunnels, Border Patrol officials have worked with Mexican authorities to develop informants and patrol the border, including water and sewerage infrastructure, looking for suspicious activity. About half of the Border Patrol agents here have been trained to work underground. “But you don’t know what you don’t know,” said R. Gil Kerlikowske, the United States Customs and Border Protection commissioner, who conceded that many more tunnels might exist. Part of the problem in detecting tunnels, say experts like Paul Bauman, a Canadian geophysicist, is the ground itself. Finding what is under the surface is not as simple as shooting radar or electromagnetic waves into the ground, he said. With underground cracks, water tables, tree roots and caves, it is hard to tell what is and is not a tunnel, he said. Mr. Bauman, who has worked with the Israel Defense Forces in their efforts to find tunnels, said most of the devices used for tunnel detection were developed for industries to find oil or mineral deposits, not drug tunnels. Carey M. Rappaport, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northeastern University in Boston, said the depth of many tunnels also posed a technological challenge. Some can be as deep as 90 feet, beyond the reach of most   devices and sensors. “Soil is very good at keeping secrets,” said Mr. Rappaport, who has also worked with the United States and Israeli governments on   methods. In the 2016 defense authorization bill, Congress provided about $120 million for a joint Defense Department and Israel Defense Forces   project. Israel is among several nations, including Egypt, Jordan and South Korea, that have had major problems with hostile groups using tunnels to stage attacks. American officials hope the technology developed in Israel can aid efforts on the Mexican border. A spokeswoman for the Israeli Defense Ministry declined to comment. The Science and Technology Directorate at Homeland Security is also spending several million dollars a year to fund   research. In San Diego, a task force of agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Border Patrol and the Drug Enforcement Administration has tried a variety of technologies to detect tunnels, much like their colleagues in Nogales have. One of the tools is a   machine that looks like a large lawn mower. The device, which is intended to locate underground utility lines and flaws in road construction, shoots radar waves about 10 feet into the ground. A screen displays various shades that identify anomalies underground that could be tunnels. But that is often not deep enough. “We’ve never found a tunnel using them,” said David Shaw, a special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego. Mr. Shaw said the task force relied mainly on   law enforcement techniques, such as cultivating informants in cartels or getting business owners and residents to report suspicious activities. That’s how the most recent tunnel in San Diego was discovered in April. Its exit was in a   area in the heavily industrial Otay Mesa warehouse district, about 500 yards from the border. According to Wendi Lee, a Border Patrol agent, business owners across the street alerted the agency to what they said was suspicious activity. The tunnel, hidden under a trash bin, was about 800 yards long. The authorities seized about 2, 200 pounds of cocaine and 14, 000 pounds of marijuana. The tunnel was one of about a   discovered in the area in recent years. “Smugglers keep digging them because the tunnels work,” Mr. Shaw said. Still, some law enforcement officials say their efforts appear to be having an effect. Data from Homeland Security shows that fewer tunnels have been discovered in recent years. However, Mr. Hecht of the Border Patrol in Nogales said the number of tunnels discovered should not be used to measure success. “For every tunnel we find, we feel they’re building another one somewhere, and they might get more creative in concealing it,” he said. “Next year, I could find 10. Until there is some device on the market to help us accurately detect them, we just won’t know. ”",0
11923,"Help Wanted, Apply Now!","Written by Peter Van Buren   You may have seen the stories last week — President-elect Donald Trump was shocked to learn he needs to hire over 4,000 political appointees by January 20, or that people in Washington may refuse to work in a Trump administration, or that Trump, as a newcomer to politics, may not know enough people to get down to the business of hiring. I doubt any of those statements are true, and the task is easier than you think.Trump was well aware if he won he would need to do some hiring, and if he was not keeping lists of potential candidates, you can be sure others around him were. Far from some kind of chore, political organizations stretching back to Tammany Hall if not ancient Rome live for this task — handing out jobs is one of the prizes the election winner takes home. And as a businessperson, Trump himself is no stranger to the concept of hiring. The standing bureaucracy Washington oversees these transitions every four to eight years, as do the national party offices. Trump, though he is new to government, is not beginning from a cold start.But when it gets down to the actual work of filling positions, exactly how will Trump do it? I worked in a non-politically appointed position for the State Department for 24 years worth of transitions. Trump will fill positions pretty much the same way as every other modern president before him has.Trump starts with the big jobs, such as transition head Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former chair of the Republican National Committee. Soon after that will come the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and an Attorney General.Those appointees will then fill in below them, the deputy and assistant secretaries, U.S. attorneys and advisors who do most of the work of government. Rudy Giuliani, for example, who has been in politics for some time, will have plenty of people he will want to work for him. Given the number of employees he knows and trusts from his business empire, Trump himself may seed in some mid-level individuals, particularly in agencies like Treasury and Commerce. These positions, give or take, amount to about one-fourth of the jobs that need to be staffed quickly. And of those, maybe fewer than 100 are critical for Day One.One important point: the first few layers of political appointees require Senate confirmation. A good strategy to both ease that process and to locate experienced people quickly is to turn to Senators and Congresspeople for recommendations. They are more than happy to help friends and allies into positions in the White House and, for Congresspeople who have lost their seats, find jobs for their soon-to-be-unemployed staffers.With those Senate confirmation jobs lined up, Trump’s transition team will move to the other positions. These jobs include any number of economic, national security, and other advisers. Many of those will be drawn from the campaign staff, people already advising Trump, or selected out of think tanks, lobbying groups, and academics. The nice thing about those pools of talent is that they are already ideologically vetted based on their association and/or past work. Had Hillary Clinton won, it is likely she would have also drawn staff from the Clinton Foundation.And don’t believe what you might read about people in Washington, including those who criticized Trump during the campaign, refusing to work in his White House. Oh, there will be a few, whose stories will get media attention. But the currency of Washington is power, and members of official Washington will kneel on broken glass before any would turn down a job in the West Wing. Trump (or Clinton, or…) will never lack for candidates. Don’t be surprised if even a few of those high-profile Republican national security officials who signed letters in March and August spring saying they’ll never work for Trump change their minds, “for the good of the country.”The largest category of jobs left to fill include people who do scheduling, subject matter experts, special counsels, and staff assistants. Many will trickle down as associates from the layer of appointees above them, or be pulled from the cadre of campaign volunteers and interns — why do you think someone spent two months sleeping in cheap motels? Just so they could knock on voters’ doors an Iowa winter?The last way Trump will staff up his administration is via application. In fact, you can go right now to President-elect Trump’s “Serve America” web site and complete an online application. Many people will also be submitting applications through their local Republican party office, their Congressional representatives, or just about anyone who knows someone who knows someone. And yes, it is a long shot.One more thing: while it is not common, Trump’s team can ask some current staffers to stick around, especially those in technical positions that are less ideological. And not every job has to be filled by Inauguration Day; there are layers of career civil servants who can fill in as needed, same as when the boss goes on vacation. The president can also appoint a temporary acting head of an agency while awaiting a confirmation hearing. In fact, many administrators don’t complete their first cycle of appointments for months .

11924,Missing from Hillary Clinton’s Email: Saudis Worked with CIA to Create Terror,"KURT NIMMO | OCTOBER 24, 2016 
Hillary Clinton’s email to her current campaign manager John Podesta dated August 17, 2014 implicates Qatar and Saudi Arabia as the main “logistical and financial” supporters of the Islamic State. In the email, Clinton recommended the United States use its “diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia” to put them “in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure.” 
Secretary of State Clinton’s proposal appears to be a reaction to growing awareness of the role Gulf monarchies have played in supporting and funding not only the Islamic State and al-Nusra but a constellation of jihadi groups in the Middle East. Left unmentioned by Clinton is the fact the United States under a number of administrations has worked closely with the Gulf monarchies to spread Sunni Wahhabism across the Muslim world. 
The financial elite in the West played a direct role in the spread of Wahhabism. In 1976 Saudi Prince Mohammed al-Faisal established the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt (FIBE). Several of founding members were leading members of the Muslim Brotherhood, including the “Blind Sheikh,” Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, implicated and in the first World Trade Center bombing in February 1993. The Muslim Brotherhood became an MI6 and later a CIA asset during the covert war and assassination plot against the nationalist pan-Arab leader in Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser. 
FIBE and the rise of Islamic banking following the dramatic increase in oil prices in 1973 are closely associated with neoliberal financial policies and the philosophy of the of the Chicago School of Economics and the monetary prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund. FIBE worked closely with the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), a renegade bank used to fund covert terrorist activity and launder money, sell illegal weapons, and facilitate the international drug trade. After BCCI crashed and burned in 1991, investigators discovered it held $589 million in “unrecorded deposits,” $245 million of which were placed with FIBE. “BCCI consisted of a complex alliance of intelligence agencies, multinational corporations, weapons dealers, drug traffickers, terrorists, global bankers and high-ranking government officials,” writes David DeGraw . 
The Muslim Brotherhood also established the al-Taqwa Bank in 1988. It funded radical Wahabbi groups, including al-Qaeda. The bank was associated with the late Said Ramadan, one of the Muslim Brotherhood’s top leaders. Ramadan was the son-in-law of Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. He also helped the Saudi monarchy establish the Muslim World League in 1962. The organization would later fund al-Qaeda and numerous other terror groups. Declassified Swiss documents from the 1960s reveal Ramadan was an asset of the CIA and British intelligence. 
“It’s no exaggeration to say that Ramadan is the ideological grandfather of Osama bin Laden. But Ramadan, the Muslim Brotherhood, and their Islamist allies might never have been able to plant the seeds that sprouted into al-Qaeda had they not been treated as US allies during the Cold War and had they not received both overt and covert support from Washington,” writes investigative journalist Robert Dreyfuss . 
In addition to funding radical Islamic groups, the Saudis helped establish the so-called Safari Club in 1976. The chief instigator of the group was Alexandre de Marenches, head of the French external intelligence service SDECE. Like the BCCI, the Safari Club funded off-the-books terror operations and worked closely with al-Mukhabarat al-A’amah, the Saudi intelligence organization. Kamal Adham and then his nephew Prince Turki. Adham acted as a channel between Henry Kissinger and Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt and former member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Safari Club was run by Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi of Iran-Contra fame. He also had connections to the BCCI. 
According to author Joe Trento, the Safari Club preferred working with a rogue faction of the CIA made up of agents close to ex-CIA director George Bush Sr. and decorated CIA officer Theodore Shackley. The “private, shadow spy organization within” the CIA, according to Trento, was organized during an effort by the Carter administration to reform the agency following revelations of the Church Committee in the mid-1970s. (See Peter Dale Scott’s The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America .) 
Bush “cemented strong relations with the intelligence services of both Saudi Arabia and the shah of Iran. He worked closely with Kamal Adham, the head of Saudi intelligence, brother-in-law of King Faisal and an early BCCI insider,” Scott writes. 
During a May 1979 meeting of the globalist Bilderberg Group the British historian Bernard Lewis presented a British-American strategy which “endorsed the radical Muslim Brotherhood movement behind [Iran’s] Khomeini, in order to promote balkanization of the entire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines. Lewis argued that the West should encourage autonomous groups such as the Kurds, Armenians, Lebanese Maronites, Ethiopian Copts, Azerbaijani Turks, and so forth. The chaos would spread in what he termed an ‘Arc of Crisis,’ which would spill over into the Muslim regions of the Soviet Union.” (See F. William Engdahl, A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World Order . London: Pluto Press, 2004: page 172.) 
The previous year the CIA began training Islamic militants in Pakistan as part of an effort to destabilize neighboring Afghanistan and draw in the Soviet Union. Robert Gates, who would become CIA director and later secretary of defense under Obama, recalled a meeting held on March 30, 1979 where Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocumbe proposed “sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire.” President Carter formally approved covert aid to the CIA supported Afghan Mujahideen in July. (See Robert Gates, From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider’s Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War . New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007: page 145.) 
“The CIA became the grand coordinator: purchasing or arranging the manufacture of Soviet-style weapons from Egypt, China, Poland, Israel and elsewhere, or supplying their own; arranging for military training by Americans, Egyptians, Chinese and Iranians; hitting up Middle-Eastern countries for donations, notably Saudi Arabia which gave many hundreds of millions of dollars in aid each year, totaling probably more than a billion; pressuring and bribing Pakistan-with whom recent American relations had been very poor-to rent out its country as a military staging area and sanctuary; putting the Pakistani Director of Military Operations, Brigadier Mian Mohammad Afzal, onto the CIA payroll to ensure Pakistani cooperation,” writes Phil Gasper . 
According to Dreyfuss, “America’s alliance with the Afghan Islamists long predated the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and had its roots in CIA activity in Afghanistan in the 1960s and in the early and mid-1970s. The Afghan jihad spawned civil war in Afghanistan in the late 1980s, gave rise to the Taliban, and got Osama bin Laden started on building Al Qaeda.” 
The line between radical Islam in Afghanistan in the 1980s and the Islamic State remains unbroken. There is a direct correlation between al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and the Islamic State in Iraq that originated with Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn, aka al-Qaeda in Iraq. AQI was the subject of a Pentagon black op and propaganda campaign targeting the Iraqi resistance following Bush’s invasion in 2003. 
Hillary Clinton’s email makes it appear the Saudi monarchy is primarily responsible for the ”logistical and financial” support of the Islamic State. In fact, the Islamic State is not the monolithic threat it is portrayed as by the government and its media. It is a loose confederation of jihadi groups sharing a similar ideology based in Saudi Wahhabism. Many of those groups are now receiving direct financial and military support from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United States, and others. 
As secretary of state Clinton spearheaded an effort to arm and train “moderate” Syrian jihadists and overthrow the government of Bashar al-Assad. After Obama authorized the CIA effort to train and arm the jihadists in 2013, the agency used Saudi money to finance the project. 
The New York Times noted in January: “In addition to Saudi Arabia’s vast oil reserves and role as the spiritual anchor of the Sunni Muslim world, the long intelligence relationship helps explain why the United States has been reluctant to openly criticize Saudi Arabia for its human rights abuses, its treatment of women and its support for the extreme strain of Islam, Wahhabism, that has inspired many of the very terrorist groups the United States is fighting.” 
More accurately, the United States is reluctant to criticize its Wahhabi partner and seriously endanger the neocon-spawned “Arc of Crisis” carefully designed to divide and balkanize the Arab and Muslin Middle east. 
Hillary Clinton clarified the objective in an email dated November 30, 2015. “The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton writes . “Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.”

11926,What to Cook This Week - The New York Times,"Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Here’s the plan for the week, not including breakfast because I’m on a farina kick and that’s not to everyone’s taste, and not including lunch because really when it comes to the midday hours you should get out of the office or the house and walk around. If you get something to eat, great, but the most important thing is to be outside where the stories are. There’s nothing happening at your desk but a screen. Anyway! I’m thinking chicken paprikash for dinner tonight, a nod toward the coming fall, served over buttery egg noodles, with green beans on the side. If you have the time, make an apple cake for dessert. On Monday night, it would be great to eat falafel, but that means you’ll need to get and soak some dried chickpeas this evening. Fry them on Monday, and eat cut watermelon for dessert. Then on Tuesday, you could simmer Melissa Clark’s outstanding recipe for a smoky fish chowder into existence, serve it with soda crackers, and offer ice cream for dessert. (You can make your own. We’ve been grooving on Gifford’s recently, for what that’s worth.) Wednesday, maybe try Mark Bittman’s recipe for scrambled tofu with tomatoes, scallions and soy sauce? (In keeping with Tejal Rao’s brilliant idea to pair vegan ranch dressing with grilled lamb, we’re thinking you could add some ground pork to the recipe and be happy indeed.) Dessert:   oranges, sliced into eighths. Thursday night is dealer’s choice: Either make Julia Moskin’s recipe for avocado fattoush with mint vinaigrette or choose one from our collection of recipes for healthy weeknight dinners. And then for dessert, try the chef Seamus Mullen’s recipe for peaches, pistachios, honey and ricotta. Finally, maybe you’re looking to button up your plans for Rosh Hashana, which starts on Oct. 2? It’s never a good idea to cook something for the first time for a holiday. So for Friday night dinner (Shabbat, don’t you know!) perhaps you could give Melissa’s new recipe for chicken with figs a run? Or try David Tanis’s new recipe for baked spinach rice? If those don’t suit you, we have an entire recipe collection devoted to the High Holy Days. Other ideas for what to cook this weekend are on our site and apps. Save the recipes you like to your recipe box and rate them when you’re done cooking. You can and ought to leave notes on recipes if you have a shortcut or substitution to suggest the conversation among us helps us all. If you run into technical trouble, please ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. (If your issues are more metaphysical, or if you have a complaint about tone or content, or if you want to gush or have suggestions about what we might be doing more or less of, you can reach me at foodeditor@nytimes. com.)

11927,Comment on Hillary Clinton is an alcoholic by Jonathan Brooks,"The American Medical Association defines an “alcoholic” as someone who: Has a prolonged period of frequent, heavy alcohol use. Is unable to control drinking once it has begun. Has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol. Needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects. Has a variety of social and/or legal problems arising from alcohol use. 
By that definition, Hillary Clinton is an alcoholic . Exhibit A 
In an email to Hillary’s campaign chairman John Podesta on August 8, 2015, Director of Communications for Hillary’s campaign Jennifer Palmieri wrote, referring to Hillary: 
“I think you should call her and sober her up some.” 
Here’s a screenshot of the email released by WikiLeaks : Exhibit B 
On Feb. 23, 2015, Hillary’s spokesman Nick Merrill sent an email (presumably to Hillary’s campaign staff) with the subject: “HRC Clips” (news clips on Hillary Rodham Clinton). The news clips that day included an article by Benjamin Bell for ABC News titled, “One Thing That Might Surprise You About Hillary Clinton,” which Merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email. 
Bell’s article was an interview with New York Times national political reporter Amy Chozick, on whether Hillary Clinton would announce she’s running for the presidency. One of the questions Bell asked Chozick was: “Covering [Hillary] Clinton, what is one thing that has surprised you about her?” 
Chozick answered: 
“Hmm. She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no.” 
Here’s a composite screenshot of the relevant part of Merrill’s email, from WikiLeaks : Exhibit C 
According to the National Enquirer , “top staffers” of Hillary’s campaign told the Enquirer “they even began this year’s presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for Hillary.” But any rehab therapy “quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign” and “the effort of making a deal over an FBI probe into her e-mail scandal”. 
A source said, “The stress of her political career, the never-ending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a life-threatening booze hell. She turned to drink to drown her fears. Hillary tries to hide her problem, like she lies about so many things.” A “close friend” of Hillary added, “ Hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater Bill. She’s also hit the bottle to cope with other stress, as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was Secretary of State.” 
One “Hillary insider” told the Enquirer that Hillary “has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done ” and that “She’s not fit to be President”. 
Certainly, Hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman (see below) because no sane person in her then position as U.S. Secretary of State would behave like this in public.

11929,“Child refugees” are coming to the UK. Why is the Jewish community so determined to bring them in?,"By Francis Carr Begbie on October 29, 2016 Francis Carr Begbie — Occidental Observer Oct 27, 2016 . The dismantling of the Calais “Jungle” refugee camp has been marked by huge scenes of disorder with rioting, at least one gang rape , and much of the camp going up in flames. But there has been uproar in Britain too since the realisation that most of the thousands of “child refugees” , which the Prime Minister had agreed to accept, were neither children nor refugees. From the moment these healthy, strapping adult male migrants stepped off the bus in London it was obvious that the British people had been subjected to yet another massive immigration deception. Those who enabled and organised this “child refugee” scam are brazening it out, safe in the knowledge there will be no comebacks for them. First they attempted to prevent any more embarrassing pictures by throwing blankets over the arrivals so they resembled state witnesses at a Mafia trial. Then a screened walkway from the bus alighting point to the door of the reception centre was erected overnight for the same purpose. Dental tests to determine the real age of these youths were ruled out as an “invasion of privacy.” And there is no question of having them deported, so nothing can be done now. They’re here. Get over it. But of course, it all works better if there is no clamour from the public. So the powers-that-be have resorted to the tried and tested method of stifling dissent. Anyone who sticks his head above the parapet to raise doubts is subjected to stern lectures about their moral shortcomings. BBC TV presenter Gary Lineker chastised his fellow British for their “shameful” attitudes, while Labour shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbot t attacked those who wanted to carry out dental tests to assess their age as “racist.” Pop singer Lily Allen became a media darling when, on behalf of the people of Britain, she made a tearful apology to the refugees for causing their plight. Let that sink in. Britain caused the plight of the refugees. After voting for Brexit, for ordinary British people, who have seen their schools, hospitals and welfare services strained to breaking point, a fresh influx of immigrants was not exactly what they had been looking forward to. After all, Britain has no legal or moral obligation to take these people. They were supposed to be the responsibility of the first country they arrived at in the EU. And why are they coming to racist Europe anyway? It’s incredibly short-sighted of them. Why not go to some Asian or African country? Or Israel? This fresh burden will be placed squarely on the local authorities that receive the immigrants, and they are going to have to dig deeply. While the government is providing £40,000 ($48,000) per annum for each young refugee, the total annual cost is around £133,000 ($162,000). So tax increases — or reduced services in other areas — are predicted. Naturally little of this will fall on the prosperous London boroughs filled with BBC-watching, morally uplifted Whites. Instead many migrants are being located in far-flung areas such as Devon or poorer northern communities already thronging with refugees, such as Bradford. The tipping point in the long battle to admit these bogus “child refugees” seems to have been a multi-faith initiative in which more than 200 religious leaders led by the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Williams and senior representatives from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faiths — signed a letter urging the Prime Minister to admit 3,000. In a speech at a London synagogue, Lord Williams described the Calais camp as “a stain” on the British conscience. But in fact, this alleged multi-faith support was not what it appeared to be. It was largely organised by dozens of Jewish activists working through an organisation called Citizens UK that organised the casework and poured substantial resources into ensuring that the necessary amendments to the law would make it through Parliament. The Calais “Jungle” crisis has brought the Jewish community together in a unity of purpose rarely seen outside the occasion of Israel’s various wars. From the highest communal levels to the smallest youth groups, it seems everyone Jewish has been mobilised in the cause of getting uneducated, unassimilable Muslim economic migrants into Britain. It is a campaign they have chosen to frame in entirely moral terms. The Jewish community’s loud insistence has been that not only is Britain under a strict moral obligation to take these migrants but that there should be no upper limit. To do otherwise would be to undermine our reputation as a humanitarian country that wishes to describe itself as civilised. Their arguments have been formed around highly emotional anecdotes and images. Time and again we have been treated to stories of children struggling in the squalor at the Calais “Jungle” camp. The iconic photographs of the lifeless body of three-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi washed up on a Turkish beach are frequently invoked. You will notice that nowhere is there any consideration of the stress this is causing on existing British communities, especially those in the poorer areas where refugees are invariably housed. Nor is there any recognition of the profound unfairness this imposes on the native White community who will be required to support these strangers via the welfare system, health and housing services. Such a process is not only unaffordable, it makes a mockery of the basic idea that help from the welfare state is in return from previous tax contributions. There is a largely unspoken reason for this: resentment over Britain’s perceived inadequacy in admitting Jewish refugees before World War II. In fact, Britain admitted many tens of thousands of Jews in the 1930s, but it is an article of faith amongst many Jews that Britain could and should have admitted many more. Typical of this attitude was the speech of Rabbi Herschel Gluck, founder of the Muslim-Jewish Forum. He says he lost over 100 relatives in the Holocaust and implied that Britain’s wartime attitudes to refugees were to blame for this. “I feel obliged to ensure we don’t make the same mistakes,” he said. Numerous references were made to the Kindertransport programme by which Jewish children from Europe were smuggled into Britain. (The TOO has already debunked much of this greatly mythologised episode.) A veteran of that same Kindertransport is the figurehead for the Calais refugee crusade. eighty-four year old Lord Alf Dubs , a veteran Labour politician. He has tirelessly campaigned for mass immigration all his life. A former director of the Refugee Council, he somehow arrived in Britain aged six in 1939 despite Britain’s horrendous attitudes at the time, and was shown much Christian charity. Since then, he has chosen to repay this kindness by devoting his life to opening Britain’s borders to non-Whites from around the globe. According to EU law, refugees should have been processed at the first country they arrived at, so some ruse had to dreamed up whereby Britain could allow their entry. This was done through a device known as the EU’s Dublin III regulation, whereby lone refugee children could be taken to any European country where they have a relative. This was not enough for Lord Dubs. He wanted the “child refugees” in the Calais “Jungle” admitted to Britain without any “family reunion” qualification and pushed his own amendment which would oblige the British government to transfer to the UK any unaccompanied refugee children from Europe. To this end Lord Dubs was able to count on wholesale establishment support. Not just the Archbishop of Canterbury but charities , NGOs and even economists all rallied round. TOO has already shown the hugely disproportionate Jewish influence on a similar letter from senior lawyers. The same disproportionately Jewish influence can be seen in the plea from the 126 economists. One of the signatories was Jonathan Portes, who can be fairly regarded as the architect of Tony Blair’s mass immigration disaster . So it seemed as if the passing of the Dubs amendment to an immigration bill was a foregone conclusion. But then at the vote in the House of Commons there was a problem. For Conservative politicians had not long finished fighting a general election campaign in which their voters had left them in no doubt how they felt about the never-ending waves of mass immigration. In the House of Commons the Dubs amendment was defeated . Jewish campaigners could barely contain their anger. The nagging, scolding words of Dr. Edie Friedman , director of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality, were characteristic. As a result, children across Europe will remain cold, alone and at risk over the coming months. This was an opportunity to stand on the right side of history, to bring relief to just 3,000 of the 95,000 unaccompanied children who applied for asylum in Europe last year. We wake up this morning on the wrong side of history and on the wrong side of compassion.The Immigration Bill has shown the UK at its worst, uncaring about the suffering of children a mere 30 miles away in places like Calais, but it has also shown us (sic!) at our best. Rabbi Harry Jacobi too was beside himself with anger at MPs voting in accordance with their electorate’s wishes. For him loomed the shadow of 1938, when Britain decided to stop the flood of Jewish refugees. Too many MPs with hardened hearts, just like the biblical story of Pharaoh. To close their eyes and hearts to unaccompanied children, to insist that it is alright to detain pregnant women, and that refugees can still be detained indefinitely simply on the say so of an immigration official. These are not the actions of a world-leading moral civilisation. Then, in one of his last acts as Prime Minister, David Cameron did a U-turn and announced he would allow the amendment to go through unopposed. Now Britain could admit the bogus 3,000 “refugee children” unilaterally. Citizens UK’s main task seems to be getting migrants or “refugees” into Britain and dispersed around the country. It describes itself as a “community organiser’s hub,” but is in fact an arm of the state with deep pockets and a nationwide network of affiliated organisations. It has fought many legal battles for refugees and succeeded in getting migrant “child asylum seekers” released from detention centres and housed in the wider community. So how Jewish is it? At letterhead level it seems to be drawn from a cross-section of the community, but at organiser level, the Citizens UK appears to be disproportionately Jewish. (This tactic of recruiting sympathetic non-Jews and giving them highly visible position in Jewish-dominated causes has a very long history, going back at least to immigration battles in the early twentieth century, as recounted in Chapter 6 of SAID [p. 192ff] and Chapter 7 of Culture of Critique [e.g., pp. 249-250].) They include the Citizens UK spokeswoman , Rabbi Janet Darley, who, of course, has a tear-jerking story to tell. She said it was when a 15-year-old migrant fell under the wheels of a truck he was trying to board that she felt that she had to get involved. For me, that was the deal breaker — I knew I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do everything I could to make sure there were no more dead children. … The Torah warns us against the wronging of a stranger. For us, this is core teaching and not an optional extra. Another Jewish Citizens UK activist is senior organiser Charlotte Fischer, who is lobbying for Britain to increase the total number of “Syrian” refugees it has agreed to take from 20,000 to 50,000. “We are doing shamefully compared to Canada” she chides. But the UK is doing awesomely compared to Israel. Doesn’t that count for anything? Citizens UK campaigner Rabbi Danny Rich is co-chair of yet another arm of the refugee industry, the National Refugee Welcome Board. He clearly has the magic touch when it comes to getting access on the BBC. Since the beginning of September he has graced at least half a dozen BBC outlets including the main BBC TV news and the BBC World Service and gets softball kidglove treatment from all of them. He blithely brushed aside the concerns of ordinary British people: “Look at the Kindertransport and the contribution made to Britain over the last 70 years by those who escaped the Nazis. Look at the contributions made today by doctors, nurses and care workers, many of who were not English born.” Anyone doubting the distinctly Jewish flavour of Citizens UK would be advised to look at this promotional video , also featured at the beginning of this article. Of course, no British refugee campaign would be complete without the presence of Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner who can be guaranteed to be at the forefront at any number of “multi faith” immigrant events including a Citizens UK vigil outside the House of Commons. Citizens UK is an umbrella organisation overseeing local grass roots initiatives for refugees all over the country, many of which are Jewish-organised. One of the main ones is called Safe Passage UK . In an article for the Jewish Chronicle, the two Jewish organisers described their work as “fighting injustice.” Apparently a group of synagogues had raised £200,000 for them in just a few weeks. Rabbi Rebecca Birk was recently named by the Evening Standard as one of London’s most influential people for her fund raising for Safe Passage UK. Again, her entire rationale is bound up with her Jewish identity, framed, of course, as a moral imperative stemming from the inherently moral essence of Judaism. She says : The Jewish identity is predicated on being a foreigner, relying on the kindness of strangers, it runs through our own theology really: doing good, mending the world. We talk of three pillars the world stands on — the Torah, divine service, and kind acts. It’s an anathema to be a Jew and only be concerned with oneself. A clear sense of Jewish identity also informed the efforts of the three fashionable north London women who decided to put their media careers on hold to set up the Help Refugees charity in the Calais “Jungle.” The women, two of whom are Jewish, have tapped into a lucrative market indeed, and their outfit was one of the biggest players in Calais. It has been a massive, trendy, profile-raising success. After setting up, they were inundated with corporate contributions, and now they run 26 projects from Israel and on the migrant trail all the way across Europe. Articles about them focus on “child refugees.” And because Hollywood is well-known for its high moralism, it is not surprising that actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch and Lena Dunham have lent their support. Help Refugees even has a mobile kitchen on to the shores of Greece where their volunteers are helping refugees from Turkey from their dinghies and then seeing them off on their long journey across Europe. One of these women, Dani Lawrence, insists her parents fled anti-Semitism in Morocco in the sixties. The Jewish community has an extremely high opinion of its charitable efforts. Their strong Jewish identities and loyalty to their tribe are obvious, and it is wonderful that all that philanthropy makes them feel so good about themselves. But it might be worthwhile for the White British to ask what exactly is in it for them, apart from Kosher certification? It is time to ask some searching questions about the real motives that lie behind all this Jewish selflessness. After all, a charitable disposition towards Muslims is not exactly a characteristic of Jewish life anywhere else and certainly not in the Palestinian territories. And no question is guaranteed to infuriate Jewish activists more than asking why Israel doesn’t admit any refugees from Syria which is, after all, next door? So what do they get out of this sudden influx of unassimilable immigrants who have neither the temperament nor inclination to fit into modern Britain? Sadly, as readers of TOO are all to familiar with (see, e.g., “ Is immigration a Jewish value? “), the motivation is not compassion but veiled ethnic vindictiveness aimed at undermining and dispossessing ordinary British people. One of the questions that British people might also ask themselves is this: If those British people in the 1930s who had admitted waves of Jewish refugees could see the fruits of what they had done, what would they think? If those British people, who were to suffer so much in a war they were told was about “freedom”, if they were to see the streets of Peckham, Newham or any number of London boroughs or cities today overrun by Third-Worlders, what would they think? And if they were to then told, in detail, about the role of Jewish activism, power and “philanthropy” in bringing about this transformation, what would their thoughts be then?Perhaps they would agree with so many of us. That the Jewish invocation to “heal the world” seems to be code-words for eradicating White identity and eradicating the power of Whites to control their own destiny. And perhaps, instead of admitting these “child refugees,” Britain would have been better off remembering the words of another Jewish sage, economist Milton Friedman, who said “You can have a welfare state or you can have open borders, but you cannot have both.”",0
11930,Earning the ‘Woke’ Badge - The New York Times,"There is a strange little cultural feedback loop that’s playing out again and again on social media. It begins with, say, a white American man who becomes interested in taking an outspoken stand against racism or misogyny. Maybe he starts by attending a Black Lives Matter demonstration. Or by reading the novels of Elena Ferrante. At some point, he might be asked to “check his privilege,” to acknowledge the benefits that accrue to him as a white man. At first, it’s humiliating  —   there’s no script for taking responsibility for advantages that he never asked for and that he can’t actually revoke. But soon, his discomfort is followed by an urge to announce his newfound   awareness to the world. He might even want some public recognition, a social affirmation of the work he has done on himself. These days, it has become almost fashionable for people to telegraph just how aware they have become. And this uneasy performance has increasingly been advertised with one word: “woke. ” Think of “woke” as the inverse of “politically correct. ” If “P. C. ” is a taunt from the right, a way of calling out hypersensitivity in political discourse, then “woke” is a   from the left, a way of affirming the sensitive. It means wanting to be considered correct, and wanting everyone to know just how correct you are. In the ’70s, Americans who styled themselves as “radical chic” communicated their social commitments by going to cocktail parties with Black Panthers. Now they photograph themselves reading the right books and tweet   tuned platitudes in an effort to cultivate an image of themselves as politically engaged. Matt McGorry, the actor who plays a sweetly doofy prison guard in “Orange Is the New Black,” is a helpful case study of this phenomenon. McGorry’s Instagram presence was once blithely     —   yacht shots, tank tops, a tribute to coconut water. Then he watched the actress Emma Watson brief the United Nations on the importance of men’s involvement in the feminist movement, and he took it to heart. Now he presents his muscular selfies and butt jokes alongside iconography of feminism and   racism. In one snap, he holds a copy of “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,” in bed, shirtless. In December, BuzzFeed nodded at McGorry with a listicle titled: “Can We Talk About How Woke Matt McGorry Was in 2015?” Earning the “woke” badge is a particularly tantalizing prospect because it implies that you’re down with the historical fight against prejudice. It’s a word that arose from a specific context of black struggle and has recently assumed a new sense of urgency among activists fighting against racial injustices in Ferguson, Sanford, Baltimore and Flint. When Black Lives Matter activists started a website to help recruit volunteers to the cause, they called it StayWoke. org. “Woke” denotes awareness, but it also connotes blackness. It suggests to white allies that if they walk the walk, they get to talk the talk. The most prominent pop touchstone for “stay woke” is Erykah Badu’s 2008 track “Master Teacher,” in which she sings the refrain “I stay woke. ” “Erykah brought it alive in popular culture,” says David Stovall, a professor of   American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “She means not being placated, not being anesthetized. She brought out what her elders and my elders had been saying for hundreds of years. ” In turn, the track has helped shepherd the next generation into its own political consciousness. In an interview with NPR last year, the rapper Earl Sweatshirt described listening to “Master Teacher” in the car with his mother as a teenager. “I was singing the hook, like, ‘I stay woke,’’u2009” he said. His mother turned down the music, and “she was like, ‘No you’re not. ’’u2009” Earl Sweatshirt’s mom was cautioning her son against brandishing a word without understanding its history and power. He got the message years later, he said, and called her up and announced: “I’m grown. ” Such reflectiveness is often absent from the promiscuous spread of “woke” online. The word has now been recycled by people hoping to add splashes of drama to their own inconsequential obsessions, tweeting “Raptors will win it all #STAYWOKE” or “new bio . .. #staywoke. ” The new iteration of radical chic is the guy on Tinder who calls himself a “feminist artist in Brooklyn” and then says he’s “looking for the    in the   ”  —   the performance of “wokeness” is so conspicuous that it breeds distrust. In a 2012 paper about race relations on Twitter, Dr. André Brock, a University of Michigan communications professor, wrote about how the surfacing of popular hashtags and trending topics “brought the activities of   literate blacks to mainstream attention,” creating a space where the expressions of black identity are subject to “intense monitoring” by white people  —   a kind of accelerator for cultural appropriation. When black activists used “stay woke” in their Twitter campaigns against police violence, the term appeared alongside a host of trending hashtags  —   #ICantBreathe, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown  —   and was thus flagged for white people who have never listened to a Badu album or joined the crowd at a rally. Defanged of its political connotations, “stay woke” is the new “plugged in. ” In January, MTV announced “woke” as a trendy new slice of teen slang. As Brock said, “The original cultural meaning of ‘stay woke’ gets lost in the shuffle. ” And so those who try to signal their wokeness by saying “woke” have revealed themselves to be very unwoke indeed. Now black cultural critics have retooled “woke” yet again, adding a third layer that claps back at the appropriators. “Woke” now works as a dig against those who claim to be culturally aware and yet are, sadly, lacking in  . In a sharp essay for The Awl, Maya Binyam coined the term “Woke Olympics,” a “kind of contest” in which white players compete to “name racism when it appears” or condemn “fellow white folk who are lagging behind. ” The latest revolution of “woke” doesn’t roll its eyes at white people who care about racial injustice, but it does narrow them at those who seem overeager to identify with the emblems and vernacular of the struggle. For black activists, there is a certain practicality in publicly naming white allies. Being woke, Stovall says, means being “aware of the real issues” and willing to speak of them “in ways that are uncomfortable for other white folks. ” But identifying allies poses risks, too. “There are times when people have been given the ‘black pass,’ and it hasn’t worked out so well,” Stovall says. “Like Clinton in the ’90s. ” A white person who gains a kind of license to use power on behalf of black people can easily wield that power on behalf of themselves. “Woke” feels a little bit like Macklemore rapping in one of his latest tracks about how his whiteness makes his rap music more acceptable to other white people. The conundrum is built in. When white people aspire to get points for consciousness, they walk right into the cross hairs between allyship and appropriation. These two concepts seem at odds with each other, but they’re inextricable. Being an ally means speaking up on behalf of others  —   but it often means amplifying the ally’s own voice, or centering a white person in a movement created by black activists, or celebrating a man who supports women’s rights when feminists themselves are attacked as  . Wokeness has currency, but it’s all too easy to spend it.",0

11932,Mets Extend Qualifying Offers to Yoenis Cespedes and Neil Walker - The New York Times,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.  —   During the next few days, the Mets and General Manager Sandy Alderson will have to weigh whether Yoenis Cespedes, one of the team’s best players over the past year and a half, gives them the best chance of winning. “From a fan standpoint, from a team standpoint, from a variety of different standpoints, possibly,” Alderson said on Monday, the first day of the annual general managers’ meetings. “But there are always alternatives. ” On Monday, the Mets made the first strategic move in keeping two of their best hitters from last season: They extended to Cespedes and second baseman Neil Walker   $17. 2 million qualifying offers ahead of an evening deadline. Cespedes, a top free agent this winter, and Walker were among 10 players who received qualifying offers for 2017. The list also included Justin Turner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ian Desmond of the Texas Rangers and Edwin Encarnacion and Jose Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays. The players have a week to either accept the offers or reject them and test free agency. Although Major League Baseball and the players’ union have been negotiating a new   agreement because the current one expires next month, the system of qualifying offers was expected to be retained in some form. Under the current system, if a player rejects a qualifying offer and signs elsewhere, his former team receives a draft pick from his new one. Alderson said the Mets were keen on keeping Cespedes and Walker for next season. On Saturday, Cespedes exercised the   clause in the contract he signed with the Mets last   forfeiting $47. 5 million and two years on his deal in the hope that he could land a more lucrative payday. Cespedes, 31, hit . 280 in 2016, with 31 home runs, 86 R. B. I. and an . 884   plus slugging percentage, so he may be able to earn more he was expected to reject the qualifying offer. He was a key force for the Mets not only because he provided power and experience but also because he batted   in a lineup dominated by  . Alderson has been reluctant to hand out large   contracts to free agents, and the Mets have had financial problems during his tenure. But Alderson said the Mets had already had one “very preliminary” conversation with Cespedes’s agent about keeping him in New York. “I wouldn’t have indicated our interest in having him back if we didn’t have the resources to make that possible,” Alderson said. Alderson said Cespedes’s agent had indicated a desire to strike a deal with a team sooner rather than later, and the Mets hoped to resolve the situation one way or the other within the next month. “There are some additional moving pieces that we have to consider, and I’m sure there is the market he has to consider,” Alderson said. With Walker, on the other hand, the Mets know he could accept the qualifying offer. Walker, 31, hit . 282, with 23 home runs and an . 823 O. P. S. but he had   surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back in September. Walker, however, would require a smaller financial commitment than Cespedes. The Mets felt comfortable about Walker’s back when they made the qualifying offer, which players have traditionally rejected. “We may not have made the offer if we weren’t interested in having Neil on a   basis,” Alderson said. “We looked at the possibility of him accepting, and we looked at the possibility of him being with us longer than a year. Both of those possibilities are of interest to us. ” INSIDE PITCH General Manager Sandy Alderson said the Mets were “disappointed and frankly shocked” that the   closer Jeurys Familia was arrested on Oct. 31 on accusations of domestic violence. Alderson said the team did not know more about Familia’s involvement beyond the police report. Alderson said the Mets had been interested in adding relief help before Familia’s arrest.   …     Alderson said the Mets intended to tender first baseman Lucas Duda a contract, even though he played only 47 games because of a back injury. Duda, who is eligible for his final season of arbitration before free agency, made $6. 72 million in 2016. “Right now, he’s our first baseman,” Alderson said.",0
11933,"Anton Yelchin, ‘Star Trek’ Actor, Dies at 27 - The New York Times","Anton Yelchin, who played the young incarnation of Chekov, an excitable officer on the Starship Enterprise, in the rebooted “Star Trek” movie series, died early Sunday morning when he was pinned by his car in his driveway at his home in Los Angeles. He was 27. Officer Jenny Houser of the Los Angeles Police Department said Mr. Yelchin was hit around 1:10 a. m. The car, an SUV, had rolled backward down a steep driveway and trapped him against a brick mailbox pillar and a security fence. Officer Houser said he was found dead by friends who had come to his house, in the Studio City neighborhood, after he did not show up for a rehearsal. (On Monday, The Associated Press reported that the vehicle, a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was one of 1. 1. million vehicles recalled by the manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, in April because their gear shifters had confused drivers, causing the vehicles to roll away, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration records.) Mr. Yelchin was born on March 11, 1989, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) Russia, in what was then the Soviet Union. His parents, Irina Korina and Viktor Yelchin, were superstar figure skaters with the Leningrad Ice Ballet. But the Yelchins, who are Jewish, fled the Soviet Union six months later, facing political and religious oppression and fearing for their son’s safety. They settled in Los Angeles. His parents survive him. “It is a very bad situation over there,” Viktor Yelchin told The Los Angeles Times. “I would get angry, too  —   I’d say, ‘Why should we have to buy things on the black market? Why should we have to stand in line? ’” As a child actor, Anton made memorable appearances on television shows like “ER,” “The Practice” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” on which he played a child magician who frustrates Larry David with a card trick. He also appeared in the films “Charlie Bartlett” (2007) with Robert Downey Jr. in which he played the title role, a talkative student who appoints himself his school’s resident therapist, and “Alpha Dog” (2006) in which he played an innocent boy who becomes an unwitting pawn in a drug war. His breakthrough came in the director J. J. Abrams’s 2009 resuscitation of “Star Trek,” the venerable   adventure franchise. Mr. Yelchin was cast as Pavel Chekov, the   Starfleet officer portrayed by Walter Koenig in the original “Star Trek” television series and movies. As played by Mr. Yelchin, Chekov was endearingly antic, humorously navigating his way through   scenarios and  —   even in the 23rd century  —   having difficulty with the “V” sounds in words like “Victor” and “Vulcan. ” Mr. Yelchin reprised the role in a 2013 sequel, “Star Trek Into Darkness,” and will be seen in a third film, “Star Trek Beyond,” to be released this summer. His other recent roles included the voice of Clumsy Smurf in two “Smurfs” movies and a member of a   band fighting its way out of a   skinhead club in the horror film “Green Room” (2015). His   mourned his death on social media. In an Instagram post, Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock in the new “Star Trek” movies, wrote that Mr. Yelchin was “one of the most open and intellectually curious people I have ever had the pleasure to know. ” In a post on Twitter, John Cho, who plays Sulu in the new movies, called Mr. Yelchin “a true artist  —   curious, beautiful, courageous. ”",0
11934,"Migrants Setting Blood, Faeces Traps for Prison Staff","Language classes and the recruiting of ‘Islam scientists’ are among measures announced by North  ’s (NRW) justice ministry to combat the rising number of ‘disgust attacks’ in prisons by Maghreb migrants. [Across Germany, migrants from North Africa have been setting ‘traps’ for staff in prisons by “greasing” doors handles, floors, and other surfaces that employees are forced to touch and walk over with bodily fluids, mainly faeces and blood.  NRW has acknowledged the problem for some time, but in November the state’s justice minister Thomas Kutschaty was forced to admit the attacks have been growing more frequent.   cases in which “detainees from the Maghreb states have contaminated areas with blood   faeces” were logged in 2016. At prisons in Iserlohn and Cologne, there were even incidents in which staff members were pelted with faeces. Head of Bielefeld Prison, Uwe Nelle Cornelsen, described “restlessness, rioting, rebellion against lawyers, and suicide threats” are typical problems staff have to deal with. He told the Neue Westfälische that prisons “must remain consistent, and refuse to negotiate,” reporting rumours that in some parts of the Maghreb, such tactics encourage centres to release detainees earlier. Along with “security and discipline,” integration centres and language courses form the core of a series of measures recently announced by NRW’s justice ministry to tackle problem prisoners. Integration centres are being set up at each prison to “deal with problems between detainees and prison staff”. So as to “decrease the language barrier” facilities will also expand language courses on offer to prisoners, and hire more interpreters. A programme to provide tablets to staff in NRW jails, enabling them to translate their instructions into Arabic, is also set be rolled out across the state. Bridging the language gap is likely to succeed in preventing grotesque behaviour, according to a report in broadsheet Die Welt. This claimed that many migrants just “wanted to be understood,” and became calmer after conversing with staff in Arabic. The justice ministry hopes that hiring four ‘Islam scientists’ in addition to the two currently employed by the state will also ease tensions. As well as teaching prison staff to spot signs of Islamism in detainees, the ‘Islam scientists’ are also training employees to “deal with emotionally disturbed prisoners” and instructing them in “intercultural competence. ” One final measure announced by Kutschaty, to deal with the growing turmoil in NRW jails, is for faster expulsion of people from the Maghreb, who the justice minister said “have little chance of being granted leave to remain [in Germany]. ” To this end, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) minister called for Germany to recognise North African nations as safe countries of origin, and said “collective charter flights” could be used to deport Maghreb migrants who are causing trouble in prisons.",0
11935,A Veteran Con Man Works a New Crowd With an Old Trick - The New York Times,"The crowd outside the sleek Dream Downtown Hotel in Chelsea is large on Saturday nights, young men and women waiting to get into hot spots like the hotel’s   “a glittering room,” a reviewer wrote, “of celebrities, beautiful women and cresting   bills. ” It was there, shortly after midnight on a recent Sunday, that a relic of old New York arrived. His name, according to the police, was Andrew Jones, 57, and he had turned up in many of New York City’s neighborhoods to perform his trade over the past 35 years. He carried his usual tools: three playing cards and a cardboard box. By the time a police officer saw him at 1:15 a. m. he had drawn an audience: “At least nine people crowded around the cardboard box,” the officer wrote in a criminal complaint, “causing at least 20 people to have to walk off the sidewalk and onto the street to get past. ” Later, after Mr. Jones was arrested, his   lawyer, who was half his age, said she had never come across the particular crime he was accused of. But the officer knew right away what was happening on the sidewalk that night. “‘  monte,’” she wrote. There was a time in New York when   monte dealers, like their distant and forlorn cousins, squeegee men, were a familiar sight on the streets, an annoyance to residents and a powerful lure to tourists and newcomers. The promise of easy money and the best dealers’ witty patter had suckers reaching into wallets for cash they would never see again. The dealers became an endangered species with the steep drops in crime that began in the 1990s. Like lush workers, those denizens of the subways, they have not been passing down their skills to a new generation. But they are not yet extinct, as the arrest of Mr. Jones indicates. “It’s the same guys,” said Sgt. Gerard Caffrey of the Police Department’s grand larceny division. “It’s probably a crew of maybe 50 guys that do this. ” The earliest mentions of   monte in The New York Times date to the 1850s in articles about farmers losing fortunes to “an unfair game. ” Few heeded those words, and the game flourished. In 1992, city officials and local merchants, exasperated, led a   campaign to teach people how the fraud worked in hopes of cutting off demand, handing out fliers in Times Square. “You can’t win, you won’t win, you will never win,” the commissioner of the Department of Business Services said at a news conference. “So don’t play the game. ” This was around the time the magician Penn Jillette, half of Penn  Teller, walked through Times Square every day on his way to perform. He remembered first learning about the swindle in books. “It was like reading about buggy whips and   socials,” he said in an interview last week. “I thought it was something from Melville’s time. ” So he was surprised at what he saw in New York. “I would walk by four games from my apartment to the theater. ” His romantic notions about the game disappeared. “They are just thugs and this is one step from mugging,” he said. The dealers usually work in teams that include lookouts and shills, or plants posing as players who win. Sergeant Caffrey witnessed that sort of team before making an arrest near Herald Square in March. “The dealer always has milk crates and a cardboard box. That’s his little table,” the sergeant said. The dealer has three cards, one of which, often a queen, is the winning card, and he places them facedown on the table and rearranges them. When he is done, the player bets on which one is the queen. In the March arrest, women were with the dealer, “acting like they’re playing the game, jumping up and down, all excited,” Sergeant Caffrey said. “Different ethnicities. It wouldn’t be obvious they’re together. ” When a stranger seeing an easy buck  —   “You think you’re smarter,” Mr. Jillette said  —   approaches to play, he is often allowed to win a hand or two, betting a little and getting twice as much in return. The stakes rise quickly  —   “five dollars to 50, right away,” the sergeant said  —   with the dealer then subtly changing the order in which he throws down the three cards. What the player believes to be the queen is not, and the bet is lost. “It doesn’t take much practice,” Mr. Jillette said. “About an hour. ” Mr. Jones has been at it much, much longer than that, the police said. He has a long criminal history that includes charges of robbery and larceny. Mostly, though, he has been arrested on charges of running   monte games  —   at least 17 times since Nov. 28, 1981, in Times Square, his first arrest, the police said. He pleaded guilty to the crime committed outside the hotel in Chelsea, was sentenced to time served and was released. The location of his most recent appearance was strategic, with a   crowd of waiting clubgoers. “People that would have 20s in their pockets, ready to go,” Mr. Jillette said. “People not at their most frugal, not at their most clear thinking. ” People too young to know what those fliers warned in 1992: You can’t win.",0
11936,Geert Wilders to boycott his ‘hate speech’ trial next week,"Print 
[Ed. – Don’t know if Dutch law can/will compel his attendance. Most nations’ laws provide for being tried in absentia, but in Western nations, it’s not usually because the defendant refuses to be there.] 
Defiant Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders said Friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week, dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for 2017 elections. 
The trial opens on Monday before a three-judge bench with the far-right politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about Moroccans living in the Netherlands. 
“It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country,” Wilders said in a statement Friday, dubbing the case “a political trial, in which I refuse to cooperate”. 
It comes as opinion polls have shown his far-right Freedom Party (PVV) doing well ahead of March elections. … 
Set to last until November 25, the trial focuses on a comment made at a March 2014 rally when Wilders asked supporters if they wanted “fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands?” 
When the crowd shouted back “Fewer! Fewer!” Wilders answered: “We’re going to organise that.”",0
11937,"On Labor Day, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Begin a Final Sprint - The New York Times","CLEVELAND  —   Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump ran virtually parallel campaigns on Monday as they geared up for the final stretch of the presidential race. She made nice with the news media by opening up her campaign plane and chatting with reporters. He followed suit, inviting a smaller group of reporters onto his plane and answering questions during the   flight. She took along her running mate, and so did he, as both focused on Ohio and nearly crossed paths in Cleveland. Their motorcades all but passed each other, and all four candidates’ planes ended up on the tarmac at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport at the same time. Mrs. Clinton moved on several fronts on Monday to confront nagging doubts about her candidacy, despite her comfortable lead in many   polls. Courting labor supporters, she met with union leaders in Cleveland while her husband, Bill Clinton, appeared at a Labor Day parade in Detroit. Seeking the backing of progressive voters, she enlisted her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who made his first solo appearance on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf at a rally in New Hampshire. And her outreach to reporters included her most extensive    session with them in months. She expressed alarm “about the credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections” through hacking, saying, “We’ve never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process. ” Not to be outdone, Mr. Trump used his airborne meeting with reporters to clarify his views on immigration, saying he opposed any path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. But he did not explicitly rule out a   path to legal status if the nation’s immigration system is overhauled. “We’re going to make that decision into the future,” Mr. Trump said. But, he added, “to become a citizen, you are going to have to go out and come back in through the process. You’re going to have to go out and get in line. This isn’t touchback. You have to get in line. ” On the plane, Mr. Trump also told reporters that, “as of this moment,” he planned to attend all three debates, and that only a “natural disaster” could make him change his mind. He added that, while he was preparing, he was not holding mock debate sessions. Labor Day is traditionally the beginning of a   sprint to Election Day, in which candidates try to seize voters’ attention as summer fades and debates loom. Monday was no exception. The visits to Ohio by Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton  —   along with their respective running mates, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia  —   highlighted the importance of a state that Republicans believe Mr. Trump must win to have any shot of reaching the White House. “Labor Day comes, and it’s kind of like a recalibration,” said Beth Myers, who managed Mitt Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign and served as his senior adviser in 2012. “You see the finish line, you see that there’s not too many   events left, and most campaigns take a measure of where you are on Labor Day. ” This cycle, however, both candidates have eschewed traditional campaigning, albeit in divergent ways. Normally, they would already have been circling each other in swing states. But Mrs. Clinton has spent most of the summer away from the campaign trail, focusing on   in places like the Hamptons and Beverly Hills with celebrities like Jimmy Buffett and Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Trump has also kept a languid pace, favoring large rallies, often in the evening, over several daily stops. Mr. Trump, a political novice, and Mrs. Clinton, a veteran politician, are confronting historically low approval ratings among voters for whom they are   commodities. “Labor Day used to be this big, important marker in the campaign season,” said Amy Walter, the national editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “A kickoff, if you will. Today, it feels like the start of the third quarter instead of the kickoff. ” “The candidates are   the ads have been running for months and TVs have been saturated with talking heads,” she added. Mr. Trump tried to burnish his image as a statesman last week with a hastily arranged trip to Mexico City. He has also tried to increase his outreach to minorities, from a promised “softening” on immigration that concluded with a fiery, nativist speech in Phoenix, to a stop at a black church in Detroit. That approach was also on display on Monday. At a diner in Cleveland, Mr. Trump met Maria Hernandez, a   who said she was supporting him. “  supports Trump,” he said. “It’s so nice. ” Then he turned to the nearby reporters to emphasize his focus group of one: “Make a note of it, guys,” he said. Earlier, speaking to a dozen white men and a lone white woman at an American Legion post here, Mr. Trump criticized China’s treatment of President Obama: When the president landed in Hangzhou for the Group of 20 summit meeting, the host country forced him to disembark from the plane’s belly. Mr. Trump said he would not have gotten off the plane, but instead would have urged his crew to “get out of here. ” Mrs. Clinton’s appearance in Cleveland was meant as a show of labor support during a campaign in which many    union members were drawn to Mr. Sanders’s promise to take on income inequality. At a Labor Day festival here, she and Mr. Kaine were joined by the A. F. L. . I. O. ’s president, Richard L. Trumka Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the first unions to endorse Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton’s surrogates were also out in force. In Pittsburgh, Mr. Kaine and the man he hopes to succeed, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke at a rally before the city’s Labor Day parade. Mr. Kaine assailed Mr. Trump for refusing to release his tax returns, then turned the stage over to Mr. Biden. “My name is Joe Biden, and I work for Hillary Clinton and whatever the hell this guy’s name is,” he said. Mr. Sanders, at a rally in Lebanon, N. H. praised Mrs. Clinton for supporting a host of progressive positions. “I would hope and ask you all, very much, that we have got to do everything we can to make sure that Hillary Clinton is elected president,” he said. “But two days after the election, we have got to continue the pressure. ” Addressing an issue that has dogged the campaign, Mr. Clinton defended the Clinton Foundation. And he criticized Mr. Trump over his own foundation, referring to a Washington Post report that found that his charitable organization paid the Internal Revenue Service a $2, 500 penalty this year after improperly giving a political contribution to a campaign group with ties to the attorney general of Florida, Pam Bondi. Mr. Trump discussed the issue in his talk with reporters aboard his plane. He denied any impropriety on either his part or Ms. Bondi’s concerning the $25, 000 donation. At the time of the donation in 2013, Ms. Bondi was considering whether to investigate Trump University for fraud. In the end, she did not do so. “I never spoke to her, first of all, she’s a fine person beyond reproach,” he said when asked about the controversy. “I never even spoke to her about it at all. She’s a fine person. Never spoken to her about it. Never. ” Many attorneys general besides Ms. Bondi, he said, decided against pursuing any action regarding Trump University. “I’ll win that case in court,” he said. “Many turned that down. ” “I never spoke to her,” he added, again referring to Ms. Bondi. When asked what he expected to get out of the donation, he would only say: “I’ve just known Pam Bondi for years. I have a lot of respect for her. Never spoke to her about that at all. I just have a lot of respect for her, and she’s very popular. ”",0
11938,"Jack Greenberg, a Courthouse Pillar of the Civil Rights Movement, Dies at 91 - The New York Times","Jack Greenberg, a lawyer who became one of the nation’s most effective champions of the civil rights struggle, leading the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. for 23 years and using the law as a weapon in its fight for racial justice before the United States Supreme Court, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91. His wife, Deborah Cole Greenberg, confirmed his death. She said he had been treated for Parkinson’s disease for decades. Mr. Greenberg was part of a legendary civil rights legal team assembled by Thurgood Marshall, the founding   of the legal defense fund and later the first   Supreme Court justice. When Mr. Marshall hired him as an assistant counsel in 1949, Mr. Greenberg was just 24 and the civil rights movement, too, was taking wing. A son of Jewish immigrants and a product of New York City, he had developed an abiding intolerance of injustice  —   some of it witnessed in the Navy  —   that propelled him into law and into Mr. Marshall’s sights. Mr. Greenberg joined a team that, like him, was idealistic yet pragmatic, deliberate yet unafraid. Besides Mr. Marshall there were Robert L. Carter, Constance Baker Motley, Spottswood W. Robinson III and others. Mr. Greenberg was neither the first white nor the first Jew to work for the civil rights of blacks. But he was one of the most powerful white figures in the movement in the 1960s and ’70s, a distinction that led to friction with both blacks and Jews. Still, Mr. Greenberg helped achieve through the courts what the political system had denied Southern blacks: voting rights, equal pay for equal work, impartial juries, equal access to medical care, equal access to schools and other benefits of citizenship broadly enjoyed by whites. The genius of his legal team, Mr. Greenberg told The New York Times in 2014, was “the ability to be creative in matters of legal and social justice. ” At 27, he helped argue two of the five cases that led to the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which declared an end to the “separate but equal” system of racial segregation in the public schools. “I was a kid,” Mr. Greenberg said in the interview. “Seven lawyers argued the cases. I was one of them. Now I’m the only one still alive. ” In all, he was involved in more than 40 civil rights cases before the Supreme Court. One was Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, in which the court, ruling in 1969, hastened the integration of schools by declaring that a standard of “all deliberate speed,” established in a second Brown case, had become an excuse for delays in Mississippi and should no longer apply anywhere. Another case was Griggs v. Duke Power Company, which led to a 1971 decision offering protections against job discrimination on the basis of race. And in Furman v. Georgia, in 1972, the court effectively placed a moratorium on executions nationwide that would last four years. Mr. Greenberg helped represent the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 when Dr. King was jailed in Birmingham, Ala. after leading a march there against segregationist laws. The episode led Dr. King to write his influential “Letter From Birmingham Jail. ” In the 1960s, Mr. Greenberg established a law project to help the poor fight for their rights under federal programs. He campaigned against the death penalty as racially discriminatory. Under his leadership, the fund supported civil rights efforts on behalf of women,   and   and gay men and lesbians. And he helped found the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. When Mr. Marshall joined the federal bench in 1961, he named Mr. Greenberg to succeed him as   of the defense fund, passing over Mr. Carter and other blacks on the staff and incurring their resentment. Tensions with blacks surfaced soon after Mr. Greenberg took over the fund. The New York Amsterdam News said the appointment could just as well have gone to a black lawyer. Some thought that the day had passed in which a black civil rights organization needed the leadership of whites, no matter how well intended. Mr. Greenberg played down the friction, telling the journalist Louis Lomax that “civil rights is not a Negro cause it is a human cause. ” Speaking in 2014, he insisted that the transition was smooth. “There was no controversy,” he said. “Thurgood was no dummy. He spoke to everyone on the board. They all agreed that it was the right decision to make. I would run the place but carry out what I thought were his wishes. ” But in 1974, Mr. Carter, by then a Federal District Court judge, wrote a letter to Mr. Greenberg in which he asserted that the legal defense fund under Mr. Greenberg had tried to limit the participation of black lawyers in an observance of the 20th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Publicity about the event, Judge Carter wrote, had tended “to give the impression that the strategy, planning and preparation that went into Brown” had been “culled from the brains of white lawyers. ” Mr. Greenberg, he wrote, had played “at best a secondary role” in Brown. In response, Mr. Greenberg called the letter “an unfortunate mischaracterization. ” Judge Carter died in 2012. Roy Wilkins, who led the N. A. A. C. P. in 1974 and who was regarded as a voice of moderation, also complained that Mr. Greenberg and the Legal Defense Fund had tried to take all the credit for the 1954 case. The fund was founded in 1939 as the legal arm of the N. A. A. C. P. but separated from its parent group in 1957. The groups’ uneasy relationship was further strained later in the ’70s when delegates to an N. A. A. C. P. convention in Louisville resolved to withdraw permission to the defense fund to use the initials in its name. Mr. Greenberg refused to alter the name. A painful episode for Mr. Greenberg came in 1982, at Harvard Law School, when the Harvard Black Law Students Association and others objected to his teaching a civil rights course jointly, on a visiting basis, with Julius L. Chambers, a black lawyer and educator. The group called on students to boycott the course, which had previously been taught by Derrick Bell. Mr. Chambers and Mr. Greenberg taught the course anyway, and many prominent blacks came to Mr. Greenberg’s defense. “The objection that Mr. Greenberg is white is nothing more than blatant racism,” Bayard Rustin, chairman of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a civil rights group, wrote in a letter to The Times. But Mr. Bell, who supported the boycott, later wrote that “black students boycotted the course not because Greenberg was white, as some media pundits charged, but because students felt the visiting post should go to someone who could be considered for a permanent position. ” Mr. Greenberg’s friction with Jewish groups centered on his support for affirmative action. Leaders of the   League thought he had gone too far in embracing the policy as a remedy for racial discrimination in the job market. They saw it as discrimination against whites and believed it would lead to a system of racial quotas. When Mr. Greenberg left the legal defense fund in 1984, its staff had grown to 25 lawyers from its original handful, and its annual budget had more than tripled, to $1. 9 million ($4. 4 million in today’s dollars). That same year he drafted a landmark New York City law (Local Law 63) that denies tax exemptions to men’s clubs and other private clubs that discriminate on the basis of gender or race. The Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1988. Mr. Greenberg left the legal defense fund in 1984 to become a professor of law at Columbia University, where he had been an adjunct professor since 1970. In 1989 he was named dean of Columbia College. He stepped down as dean in 1993 in a university   but remained a professor at the law school until retiring last year. At Columbia he became particularly engaged with the plight of the Roma, a traditionally nomadic ethnic group often reviled in Europe, concluding in a 2010 report that they continued to be segregated from other students in the schools. “No European or national judicial or administrative organ has ordered the cessation of segregation in any school,” he wrote, “nor have they addressed the principal means of evasion, white flight. ” Jack Greenberg was born on Dec. 22, 1924, the son of Max Greenberg, who was born in Poland and became a certified public accountant without finishing college, and the former Bertha Rosenberg, who was born in Romania. The family lived in Brooklyn and the Bronx while Jack was growing up and, he wrote, instilled in him “an abiding concern for those who are disadvantaged. ” In his 1994 book, “Crusaders in the Courts: How a Dedicated Band of Lawyers Fought for the Civil Rights Revolution,” Mr. Greenberg recounted joining other children in throwing rocks at a Chinese man and forever feeling shame for what he had done. Mr. Greenberg served in the Pacific with the Navy during World War II and went ashore in a landing ship tank in the invasion of Iwo Jima. In the Navy, he wrote, it upset him that all the officers were white and all the stewards who served them were black. He received a bachelor’s degree from Columbia and a law degree from Columbia Law School, where a professor, Walter Gellhorn, encouraged him to pursue his interest in civil liberties and recommended him to Mr. Marshall. Mr. Greenberg’s marriage to Sema Ann Tanzer ended in divorce in 1970. She died in 2013. He married Deborah Cole in 1970. Besides his wife, who is the founding director of the Columbia Law School’s AIDS Law Clinic, he is survived by three children from his first marriage, David, Sarah and Ezra Greenberg (a fourth child, Josiah, died in 2011) his wife’s two children, Suzanne Greenberg and William Cole, whom Mr. Greenberg adopted a brother, Daniel and five grandchildren. Mr. Greenberg was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001 by President Bill Clinton. He remained committed to the idea of an integrated society while acknowledging that full equality had not yet been achieved  —   “that in many ways the lives of blacks are not as good as that of whites,” as he wrote in a 2005 memoir of the Brown case. But that case, he said, should always give Americans reason to take heart. “Brown continues to stand for Americans’ determination to live up to the ideals of their Constitution,” he wrote, “and for the proposition that our Supreme Court can be a catalyst for fundamental change. ”",0
