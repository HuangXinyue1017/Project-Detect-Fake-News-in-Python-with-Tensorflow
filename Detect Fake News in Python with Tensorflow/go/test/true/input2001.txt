24616,"CNN Contributor Blames Breitbart, White House for London Attack - Breitbart","CNN contributor Dean Obeidallah told CNN during Sunday evening’s live coverage of the apparent terror attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park in London that Breitbart News was to blame for inciting the attack. [Obeidallah, a former attorney and   comedian, was asked about what the media can to do “  the animosity” in society. He answered:  You see it on Fox News, you see on the Breitbarts out there, really demonizing Muslims, portraying us as threats to America. You have people in the White House now like Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka. You had Michael Flynn  —   who is no longer part of the administration, who was on the board of directors for ACT for America, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls the biggest   group in America. You have Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, got an award last year from ACT for America. So you have a direct line from the White House to   bigotry. I really hope as a nation we can take a step back and stop   hate. We saw a horrific attack this week on a member of Congress. Other members of Congress could have been hurt. It’s part and parcel of the same thing. It’s demonizing, ginning up fear, irrationally ginning up fear, and people responding in the worst way possible. So, I’m concerned. Last year, Obeidallah falsely blamed a “  activist” for a    attack against a Muslim woman in Belgium. When confronted about his error, he tweeted: “go f*ck urself. ” On Sunday evening, he took to Twitter to defend his commentary on CNN against someone who complained: look a trump supporter wants me off tv because I dared give facts that linked TRump and his admin with   bigotry https:  .   —   (((DeanObeidallah))) (@Deanofcomedy) June 19, 2017, While suggesting that Breitbart News and the White Houseare responsible for   violence, Obeidallah has pushed back recently on the idea that liberal media inspired the mass shooting at a Republican baseball practice last week. In an essay on CNN, he argued that Trump supporters were hypocrites for criticizing a production of Julius Caesar in New York City’s Central Park that featured a President Trump lookalike being assassinated, because past productions elsewhere featured Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton lookalikes in the title role.

24618,Talent Agency UTA Trades Oscar Party for Refugee Rally,"United Talent Agency, one of the   major talent agencies in Hollywood, has canceled its annual Oscar party and will instead host a rally in support of refugees at its Los Angeles office, according to a report. [According to the Hollywood Reporter, UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer informed agency staff of the change in a letter this week.  The company  —   home to   clients like Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey, Toby Keith and dozens of others  —   also plans to donate $250, 000 to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has worked to oppose President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily prohibiting immigration from seven countries, and to the International Rescue Committee. “This is a moment that demands our generosity, awareness and restlessness,” Zimmer reportedly wrote to his staff. “Our world is a better place for the free exchange of artists, ideas and creative expression. If our nation ceases to be the place where artists the world over can come to express themselves freely, then we cease, in my opinion, to be America. ” The move to cancel the glitzy annual Oscars party comes as Hollywood has become increasingly vocal about Trump’s policy proposals and executive actions, particularly his action on immigration. At the Screen Actors Guild Awards last month, several film and television stars used their acceptance speeches to speak out against Trump’s order actress Sarah Paulson specifically called for donations to the ACLU. THR further reported that Ari Emanuel,   of   and UTA competitor   sent an email to staff Wednesday notifying them that the company would be forming a political action committee, though it wasn’t immediately clear on what the PAC would focus. “This company’s greatest asset is the diversity of our backgrounds and beliefs,” Emanuel wrote to the agency. “Please know that we will do everything in our power to support and protect this diversity now and in the months and years ahead. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

24623,"Millions of Lives Endangered by 55,000 Gallon Pipeline Spill","Millions of Lives Endangered by 55,000 Gallon Pipeline Spill report this ad 
A pipeline owned by the same company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline has endangered the lives of six million people by leaking 55,000 gallons of gasoline into a major river in Pennsylvania. report this ad 

After heavy rainfall, the pipeline, owned by Sunoco Logistics, burst on Thursday, October 20th. The spill leaked 55,000 gallons of gas into Wallis Run, a tributary of the Loyalsock Creek that drains into the Susquehanna River. Once the leak was detected, the pipeline was shut down but as stormy weather continued, the actual break in the pipeline remained unidentified for almost a week. After the spill, Pennsylvania water authorities warned customers to refrain from using water from the river. More than half of Lancaster City’s water comes from this river. Although officials are now declaring the water safe to drink, residents affected by the leak are wary. 

Previously, the Susquehanna was declared the third most endangered river in the U.S. by the NGO American Rivers. The river has come under threat because of development of the natural gas industry, particularly fracking. Fracking has endangered many U.S. rivers because of the “Cheney’s loophole” which exempts natural gas companies from the vast majority of U.S. environmental regulations. American Rivers believes that fracking poses one of the greatest dangers to U.S. rivers and could have a detrimental effect on our country’s clean drinking water. report this ad 

Though the spill has been blamed on recent floods, many are bringing into question Sunoco’s extensive history of poor pipeline management. Pipelines managed by Sunoco Logistics spill far more frequently than others, with more than 200 recorded leaks since 2010. In 2008, an improperly installed valve “blew out” a pipeline in Murrysville, Pennsylvania. The Department of Environmental Protection stated that the area affected by the spill may never completely recover. 

Sunoco is also a subsidary of Energy Transfer Partners Limited. This is the company that owns the controversial Dakota Access pipeline . This access pipeline has become a major protest site due to the controversial placement of the pipeline right by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s water supply and sacred sites. 

While Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are major advocated for fracking and pipeline construction, the public is standing up to this construction because of the major environmental and social damage it could have. 

This recent spill is just another example of the many things that can go wrong when pipelines are built so close to water supplies and communities.

24625,EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Gitmo Warden ‘Disgusted’ Obama Released More Detainees,"Col. Michael Bumgarner, the former commander of the guard force at the U. S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stated in an interview on Sunday that he is “disgusted” by President Obama’s continued effort to empty out Gitmo. [Bumgarner charged Obama with attempting to use Gitmo to ensure his legacy at the expense of national security. He served from April 2005  —   June 2006 as commander of the Joint Detention Group, the guard force component of the Joint Task Force at the U. S. prison in Guantanamo.  The Pentagon announced last Thursday that four detainees had been released to Saudi Arabia, where they will purportedly participate in a rehabilitation program.  From the 535 detainees in Gitmo during Bumgarner’s work there, the population is now down to 55, and 19 of those have reportedly been cleared for release. There is speculation Obama may release more detainees in his final days in office. “It has nothing to do with national security reasons,” stated Bumgarner. He was speaking on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM. Listen to the interview here: Continued Bumgarner: His whole motivation has nothing to do with national security. In my mind, it is clearly a legacy issue for Obama who signed on, you know, day one of his presidency, ‘I am going to close Guantanamo.’ I knew then   …     that would never happen. It is just impossible. He had no clue what he had just signed. And he has found out how hard that is. So, the argument always is that they (the terrorists) make this a propaganda matter to recruit more people. You and I both follow this pretty closely. I don’t ever see it out there that Guantanamo is your call to battle, you know. I never see that. You and I both know what drives this fight. It has nothing to do with national security. Again, it’s a legacy issue for Obama. And I’m ashamed that it is occurring. Embarrassed. Disgusted. I don’t know how it to make it stronger. Asked whether he had any advice regarding Gitmo for   Donald Trump, Bumgarner replied: One, it certainly should not be closed. And two, increase its population. And by that it’s just not that we want to stack up Guantanamo Bay. But the whole purpose is  —   this may strike people as funny  —   but rather than kill the terrorists on the battlefield when we engage with the ISIS fighters, bring them in for the intelligence value that they can provide.   …     Use the intelligence value. The great capacity and capability of Guantanamo. Let’s fill it up with people and let the intelligence world go to work and develop the human intelligence that we so badly need. Fox News last week cited statistics from U. S. officials saying 30 percent of previously released Gitmo detainees are suspected of returning to terrorist activity. Bumgarner commented, “And you know Aaron when we talk about these numbers   …     let’s just think about that.   …     Think about the destruction that just one man carried out in Berlin. That fellow in France. So, if you can stop one, you saved numerous lives. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

24636,BREAKING BOMBSHELL: FBI re-opens Clinton email probe,"FBI re-opens investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server after new evidence is discovered. 
Elad Benari 
The FBI will re-open its investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she served as Secretary of State, NBC News reported Friday. 
FBI director James Comey made the announcement in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the network. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation … I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” he wrote. 
In July, Comey announced that he did not recommend charging Clinton with willfully mishandling classified information. 
In September, the FBI chief defended his agency’s decision to not press criminal charges in the investigation. Documents related to the case were released just before the Labor Day weekend and included a summary of Clinton’s

There are very difficult negotiations in process. Moreover, the US wants to pass a bill to declare certain orbits exclusively American."" | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A United Launch Alliance Delta IV lifts off from Space Launch Complex-37 with the Air Force’s Global Positioning System (GPS) IIF-5 satellite. Recently, the Russian space agency Roscosmos kicked off tenders for three GLONASS satellites to be launched in 2017-2018. The company is expected to spend over one billion rubles ($16 million) on the program. 
The first launch is scheduled for December 25, 2017, the other two – for November 25, 2018. The satellite will be carried by a Soyuz-2.1b rocket from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome spaceport. 
In February and May 2016, two Glonass-M satellites were added to the GLONASS system. Currently, the system involves 27 satellites, 23 of which are in operation, two are put in orbital reserve, one is undergoing flight tests, and the last is undergoing maintenance. 
In the event of a military conflict, communication satellites would be an important target, military expert and observer Viktor Baranets said. “The current situation in space is that no satellites are protected, no matter at what orbits they are. The reason is that alongside with development of space systems, the US is running on all cylinders developing space weapons,” Baranets told Radio Sputnik. Moreover, China already joined the game, with an anti-satellite missile test in 2007. 
“Russia has its own plans too. I think that if Washington keeps ignoring Russia’s calls for the demilitarization of space, the so-called ‘combat cosmonautics’ would become reality,” Baranets pointed out. 
His words were echoed by Russian defense expert Vasily Kashin. In an interview with Sputnik China , Kashin said that modern satellites are almost devoid of any opportunity to protect themselves from the impact of interceptor missiles. 
In 2008, the Russian and Chinese governments proposed an international agreement to prevent the deployment of weapons in outer space but the US government under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama has consistently rejected launching negotiations to conclude such a treaty. 
Before Barack Obama became president, during his presidential campaign, he called for talks with Russia on anti-satellite weapons which started back in the 1970s but then was terminated by Washington. However, no progress has been made on the issue. 
Baranets said it could not be ruled out that in the future space might be militarized which would pose a threat to the entire world. “Mankind will have to decide whether to militarize space or not. There are very difficult negotiations in process. Moreover, the US wants to pass a bill to declare certain orbits exclusively American,” Baranets said. 
According to him, the defense industries of both Russia and the US are working to develope space combat systems. If the process is not stopped “space wars may be possible.” 
The expert stressed that the 1967 Outer Space Treaty between the US, the USSR and Britain should be revised. The document represents the legal framework of international space law, including prohibition of weapons of mass destruction in orbit. 
“The treaty should be revised as soon as possible. This will prevent militarization of space. Now, space is becoming a place for effective strikes against the enemy,” the expert concluded. 
In turn, Kashin assumed that anti-satellite weaponry is a new reality that should be considered while planning a possible military operation. In this new reality, Russia, China, the US, as well as India and Iran will most likely possess domestically-made sophisticated anti-satellite weapons, according to him.",0

24644,Iraq bans alcohol,"Iraq bans alcohol Voltaire Network | 27 October 2016 français Español italiano Deutsch عربي On 22 October 2016, the Iraqi Parliament surreptitiously adopted an amendment to its laws affecting communes which bans the sale, the import and the production of alcohol.
The prohibition was adopted in order to satisfy the Islamists on the day before the liberation of Daesh-occupied Mosul.
The law sets fines of between $8,000 and $20,000 per offence.
Considering that the law is prejudicial to them, the Christians of Iraq (who use wine in the celebration of Mass) have decided to take legal action against the law before a federal tribunal.

Oktober 2016 Rufschädigung: Brauerei verbietet EU-Kommissar, den Namen Oettinger zu verwenden Oettingen (dpo) - Die Brauerei Oettinger aus Bayern sieht ihren guten Ruf durch den deutschen EU-Kommissar Günther Oettinger beschmutzt. Nun ging der Bierhersteller juristisch gegen den Politiker vor und untersagt ihm, öffentlich den Namen ""Oettinger"" zu verwenden. Das Fass zum Überlaufen brachten jüngst bekannt gewordene Äußerungen des CDU-Politikers auf einer Tagung in Hamburg. Günther Oettinger bezeichnete dort unter anderem Chinesen als ""Schlitzaugen"", Wallonen als ""Kommunisten"" und warnte eindringlich vor einer ""Pflicht-Homo-Ehe"". ""Jahrelang haben wir dem Treiben dieses Mannes zugesehen und uns geärgert, dass er unseren guten Namen in den Dreck zieht"", sagte ein Unternehmenssprecher. ""Jetzt hat es uns endgültig gereicht. Auch eine preisgünstige Biermarke wie Oettinger hat ihren Stolz!"" Wegen Günther Oettinger hat dieses edle Bier nun einen faden Beigeschmack. Immerhin werde das Bier der Brauerei international und von allen Bevölkerungsgruppen gleichermaßen getrunken, so der Sprecher. ""Selbst mit sechs Oettinger intus merkt noch jeder, dass dieser Politiker sich selbst und damit unseren Namen europaweit der Lächerlichkeit preisgibt. Die Grässlichkeit von Oettinger ist inzwischen schon fast sprichwörtlich. Also von dem Politiker Oettinger jetzt."" Inzwischen konnte die Brauerei beim Amtsgericht Nördlichen eine einstweilige Verfügung erwirken, die dem Politiker verbietet, den Namen Oettinger weiterhin zu führen, öffentlich zu verwenden und damit zu unterschreiben. Dabei schloss sich der Richter der Argumentation der Brauerei an, dass das Ansehen des seit 1731 bestehenden Betriebes durch die erst wenige Jahrzehnte dauernden politischen Aktivitäten eines Einzelnen dauerhaft beschädigt wird. Der derzeitige Digital- und künftige Haushaltskommissar der EU darf nun öffentlich nur noch seinen Vornamen Günther benutzen. ""Wenn er möchte, kann er sich ja gerne in Günther Warsteiner, Günther Hacker-Pschorr oder meinetwegen Günther Pflugbier Hörvelsingen nennen"", so der Sprecher, der den juristischen Sieg vor dem nördlinger Amtsgericht zusammen mit der Chefetage mit mehreren Flaschen Beck's feierte.",0
24646,U.S. Special Forces Join Fight For Mosul,"We Are Change 

Fierce battle for the city of Mosul continues to shock Iraq and the whole Middle East with no significant results. The leading role belongs to the assault of the Iraqi army and Kurdish Self-Defense Forces—which still lack experience and skills—to capture the city in the shortest time.
However, 500 elite commandos of the U.S. Special Forces, which had been transferred this week at Mosul should give new impetus to the assault. U.S. combatants are supported by Apache and Chinook helicopters.
According to the Inside Syria Media Center , the U.S. Special Forces are located at the forefront of Iraqi and Kurdish combat formations. Military experts believe these combat conditions are atypical for the special operation forces which are aimed to carry out reconnaissance and other specific tasks.
Elite combatants in Mosul actually perform the functions of infantry soldiers, resulting in inevitable great losses, which are going to be covered up and silenced by the Washington officials in the usual manner.
Although the U.S. officials have repeatedly stated Mosul should be liberated from terrorists to eliminate the Islamic State, the decision to use U.S. Special Forces looks unjustified at first glance. However, the protracted nature of the assault on the city is forcing the Pentagon to take extreme measures to complete the operation before the U.S. presidential election. Therefore, the White House uses this situation, first of all, as a large-scale PR-campaign to support the candidate of the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton.
In this context, it becomes clear why the U.S. Government refrained from active struggle against terrorists for so long choosing an opportune moment strangely coincided with the end of the presidential elections in the United States.
Liberation of Mosul should also demonstrate to the world community the importance and crucial role of the American nation in the fight against the Islamic State. It is even more regrettable in the light of the recent Wikileaks’ revelations, which confirmed the United States and American tycoons’ role in the creation and funding of the Islamic State terrorists.

24649,Tillerson: ‘Steps Are Under Way’ to Remove Assad From Power in Syria - Breitbart,"On Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said “steps are under way” to form an international coalition to remove the president of Syria Bashar   after Tuesday’s chemical bombings in Syria.  Partial transcript as follows: TILLERSON: Well obviously, the events that have occurred in Syria with the chemical weapons attack here in the past day I think have just horrified all of us and brought to the front pages and to our television screens as well the tragedy that is part of the Syrian conflict. There is no doubt in our mind and the information we have supports that Syria, the Syrian regime under the leadership of Bashar   are responsible for this attack and I think further it’s very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime. REPORTER: Does Assad have to go? TILLERSON: Assad’s role in the future is uncertain and with the acts that he has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people. REPORTER: And what steps is the United States prepared to take in order to remove him from power? TILLERSON: The process by which Assad would leave I think requires an international community effort, both to first defeat ISIS within Syria, to stabilize the Syrian country, to avoid further civil war and then to work collectively with our partners around the world through a political process that would lead to Assad leaving. REPORTER: So will you and President Trump organize an international coalition to remove Assad? TILLERSON: Those steps are under way. REPORTER: Has President Trump been talking about that with other leaders. TILLERSON:  We are considering an appropriate response which violates all previous U. N. resolutions, violates international norms and   agreements between parties including the Syrian regime, the Russian government and all other members of the U. N. Security Council. It’s a serious matter. It requires a serious response. Thank you. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
24650,Potential Homeowner in Detroit Finds Mummified Body in Garage,"A potential homeowner in Detroit found an unexpected surprise when he walked into the garage of the house he was considering purchasing. [What he discovered was a grisly scene: a mummified, decomposed body in the back seat of a car.  The discovery occurred around 1 p. m. Thursday afternoon. As the potential home buyer was inspecting the garage of a home in the 19900 block of Spencer, he found the mummified body, the Detroit News reported. Authorities said the body was found in the back of a 1990 or 1991 Plymouth Acclaim. Lloyd Jackson, a spokesman for Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office, said officials estimate that the body had been there for “years” and said “the body is brown”  meaning it is well past the decomposition stage. Jackson said medical examiners “inspected” the body but are waiting for an anthropologist from the University of Michigan that partners with the county to conduct special tests, such as those that will determine the body’s gender. Jackson told the Detroit Free Press that the body was found lying down in the back seat dressed in a shirt and pants. Detroit Police spokesman Dan Donakowski said officers were dispatched to the scene after the man discovered the body. “We talked to the current tenants of that location and they were told that the actual homeowners had said basically don’t go in the garage, don’t put anything in the garage,” said Donakowski, who also stated that the investigation is ongoing. This is not the first time a mummified body has been discovered in Michigan. Investigators also found a mummified body in Pontiac, Michigan, five years after its death in 2014.",0

24653,Rid Your Soil of Harmful Chemicals With This Grass,"by ARIANA MARISOL 
With pollution everywhere, it has become hard to find healthy soil that can support a good, healthy garden. This can be especially hard if you live in an urban area. Growing this grass will remove nearly half of all PCB contamination from your soil in only six months. 
Switchgrass, otherwise knowns as Panicum virgatum, is a perennial warm season bunchgrass native to North America. The prairies of the Midwestern United States were once covered with vast swaths of this grass, bringing nutrition to the soil. A versatile and adaptable plant, switchgrass can grow and thrive in many different weather conditions and soil types. It can grow in soil that is considered to be too erodible, too sandy, or even gravelly for most other crops. 
A study that was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program and the University of Iowa found Switchgrass to be a highly effective soil detoxifier. 

Results Polychlorinated biphenyls, also known as PCB’s, are highly toxic chemicals that were once widely used for industrial development. They are classified as persistent organic pollutants, meaning they are very hard to break down and have a tendency to accumulate in the bodies of living creatures. Even though the U.S. Congress banned these chemicals in 1979, PCB contamination is still a rampant issue.This contamination is the reason why residents are advised not to eat too much fish from regions of the Great Lakes. 
To test the effectiveness of switchgrass to clean soil, researchers took clean soil and contaminated it with dangerously high amounts of PCB, concentrations that are regularly found in soils throughout the U.S. In order to make sure the PCB fully leached into the soil, they sealed the soil in tubs and let them sit for two months at 77 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). 
Researchers then placed this soil into plastic containers and switchgrass seeds were planted. For comparison, another container was filled with contaminated soil and left unplanted. Researchers also planted switchgrass seeds in a container of healthy soil. All soils were analyzed after 12 and 24 weeks. 
After 24 weeks, the PCB levels in the switchgrass-planted containers had dropped by 40 percent. When researchers added PCB-oxidizing microorganisms to the soil, PCB levels fell to 47 percent. Researchers also found that this good bacteria had a easier time surviving in switchgrass-planted containers than in bare soil. 
Detox Your Soil 
This study helps to prove that we can use natural techniques to rid our soil or harmful toxins. PCB can have detrimental health effects on the people who consume food from the soil it has contaminated. Planting switchgrass can help your soil rid itself from these harmful chemicals and bring you healthy food that is safe for consumption. It can also work as a natural ground cover, companion plant, and erosion preventer. Switchgrass is extremely easy to grow and gives us hope to move towards a healthier future.

24658,NASA Space Camera Footage Shows UFO,"  Edmondo Burr in Weird // 0 Comments NASA’s space cameras have accidentally filmed another unidentified flying object ( UFO ) travelling out of earth’s atmosphere. 
The question is why did the space agency not turn off the live feed or try to cover up, as it usually does with UFOs and aliens? 
A disk-shaped UFO appears in the video giving support to the theory that extraterrestrial beings and their crafts are continuously visiting earth. 
Ancient Code reports: 
Ever since the footage was uploaded to YouTube, it generated great controversy both among those who support the idea that it might be an extraterrestrial object, as among those who are completely skeptical of the subject, and as a joke suggest that “UFO’s that are planning on entering our air space should be registered and pay taxes.” 
The truth is that on many occasions only fragments of videos in which these mystery objects are visible are released. 
However, the fact that NASA interrupts its live feed transmissions is what arouses more suspicion among those who are eager to find new evidence of the existence of alien life, UFO’s and how we are all part of a massive conspiracy. 
One user wrote on YouTube: 
“The question isn’t “ is this an alien spacecraft? ”, but actually “Why NASA didn’t cut or blur this video as they always do with other strange sights?” 
According to many people, in today’s era, it isn’t a question anymore whether or not UFO’s are real. 
In fact, if we look back into the past we will see numerous fascinating statements made by former astronauts, military officials and scientists about Alien life and the existence of UFOs. 
Here are only a few: 
“Intelligent beings from other star systems have been and are visiting our planet Earth. They are variously referred to as Visitors, Others, Star People, Et’s, etc…They are visiting Earth now; this is not a matter of conjecture or wistful thinking.” – Theodor C. Loder III, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University of New Hampshire. 
We cannot address the UFO phenomena without mentioning Dr. Edgar Mitchel, one of the best-known Apollo astronauts and the sixth man to walk on the moon; a retired Captain in the US Navy, aeronautical engineer and founder of the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) who had much to say about Alien life: “I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real…Yes, there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. We are not alone in the universe; they have been coming here for a long time.” 
Franklin Story Musgrave, an American Physician, retired NASA astronaut who worked on the design and development of the Skylab Program and the only astronaut to have flown missions on all five Space Shuttles had very interesting things to say about life elsewhere in the cosmos: “Statistically it’s a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence, life forms out there. I believe they’re so advanced that they’re even doing interstellar travel. I believe it’s possible that they even came here. It’s logical to presume the universe must have other life in it and by virtue of association that we could be visited at some point.”",0

Hodgkinson, 66, targeted Republican Members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game, in a shooting that left Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) and three members of the Capitol Hill Police severely wounded, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the House floor. [“I pray for Donald Trump, that his presidency will be successful and that his family will be safe,” Pelosi said of President Donald Trump.  “I have been probably the target of more, political target of probably more threats than anyone perhaps other than the President of the United States Barack Obama.

On Monday, Pelosi predicted that Trump would “ . ” But now, just a few days later, she is throwing her support behind the president in the wake of this tragedy in Alexandria. Earlier in her speech on the House floor on Wednesday, Pelosi said that “we speak for each other in saying, we send our thoughts and prayers to our colleague, Steve Scalise. ” She continued: Personally we have our   connection so as soon as I heard his name, I was filled with concern, as I would be for anyone here. But we had that special connection, and so our hopes and prayers  —   and as I said to the Speaker [Paul Ryan] I’ll be asking you every five minutes, ‘How is Steve coming along?’ Pelosi added that she prays “frequently, and certainly every Sunday. ” She added: When this team was on the field practicing with such brotherhood  —   I don’t know if you have any sisters on your team we have two on our team  —   for this person to take this action was so cowardly, so cowardly. We cannot let that be a victory for the assailant or anyone who would think that way. We will use this occasion as one that brings us together and not separates us further. Before taking the House floor Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi tweeted: On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our thoughts for the wounded. https:  .   —   Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) June 14, 2017,  However, for Hodgkinson  —   a staunch Bernie Sanders ( ) supporter who hated President Donald Trump  —   Republicans were his target. Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) was also present at Wednesday’s baseball practice. He said Hodgkinson had approached him and Rep. Jeff Duncan ( ) to ask which political party was practicing. “There was a guy that walked up to us that was asking whether there was Republicans or Democrats out there. And it was just a little odd  …     so we told the police that,” DeSantis said. In addition to his affiliation with a number of   groups, Hodgkinson belonged to one named “Terminate The Republican Party. ” Hodgkinson has since died, President Trump confirmed in his remarks, as a result of gunfire exchange between him and the Capitol Hill Police. The Capitol Hill Police officers were present because Scalise is a member of GOP leadership. Some members of Congress said that had it not been for Scalise’s security detail, the shooting could have turned into a massacre.

24663,Trick-Or-Treaters Get Their Socks Rocked By BADASS Hillary Pumpkin Outside,"Trick-Or-Treaters Get Their Socks Rocked By BADASS Hillary Pumpkin Outside Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This 
An incredible video is being shared on social media after someone wanted to go political with their jack-o-lantern carving this year. Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton, this badass pumpkin seemed to center around her – and it will surely knock the socks right off any trick-or-treater headed to their house tonight. 
Halloween is a fun time for many people – especially families with younger ones. However, it seems that a few homeowners decided to try and entertain the adults that may cross their path. Proving just that is a video shared to the Facebook page called “ Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children ,” which shows how one person went political with theirs. 
As can be seen in the short clip , the jack-o-lantern was emptied and carved to look like a set of jail bars. Making it just that much better, the person responsible for carving the pumpkin actually stuffed a picture of Hillary in there to make it appear as though she is in prison – where she belongs. 
Within just a few short days, the video has already been seen over 3 million times with that number on the rise. However, if you think people on social media are ramped up over the ingenious carving, you can imagine the reactions that thing will get from trick-or-treaters tonight. 
As it turns out, the cool idea actually sparked a bit of a movement with several other people doing the same. In fact, in order to make it crystal clear, others even wrote the words “Hillary 4 Prison” on their creations as well:",0
24664,Trump: We’ve Exceeded ’Most Bullish Predictions’ for Progress on Border Security - Breitbart,"During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated that on border security, “we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. ”  Transcript as Follows: “My Fellow Americans, We’re only 11 weeks in, but already my administration has achieved historic progress for the American people  —   in fact, 93% of our domestic manufacturers have expressed optimism in the future, a record. The confidence we are seeing in our Nation is about jobs and opportunity  —   but it’s also about safety and security. Security begins at the border  —   as a candidate, I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border, and that is exactly what I have done. We inherited a   border crisis  —   it was a disaster. Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64% reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border. At the same time, we are conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society  —   and they’ll be gone. In just the last few days our Nation’s ICE officers have arrested 153 criminal aliens in south Texas, 84 criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest, and 31 criminal aliens in Long Island, New York  —   these arrests include aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing, and many more. Much work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington  —   but, with time, dedication, and effort, we will get the job done, and save countless lives in the process. Providing security for the American People also means restoring America’s standing in the world. From the very start of my Presidency, I have worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe. This week, I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now, I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the Southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples. In our dealings with other nations, our conversations have been candid, open, and grounded in mutual respect. I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me, and so important to our people  —   one of the reasons, certainly, that I got elected. And I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens. In matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world  —   that is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people. Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals  —   and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences. A future of peace, safety, and prosperity  —   that is our guiding light, and always will be. Together, we will bring about this future for the land we love, and for the people who call it home.

24668,Kurds Worried Turkey Will Stab Them in the Back as They Fight ISIS,"Kurds Worried Turkey Will Stab Them in the Back as They Fight ISIS Turkey publicly opposes ISIS while supporting them behind the scenes Image Credits: Kurdish YPG fighters: Kurdishstruggle . 
Two months after being purged from the border town of Jarablus in northern Syria by a Turkish-led force — and just days after being targeted by Turkish airstrikes near al-Bab — Syrian Kurds now fear a “stab in the back” from Turkey’s military as plans for a U.S.-led push to clear ISIS fighters from Raqqa are carried out. 
“It is very important Raqqa is liberated,” a chief political leader of the main Syrian Kurdish party, the PYD, told Reuters . “But one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back.” 
At the end of August, Turkish forces took part in a U.S.-led operation to eject ISIS from the northern border of Syria. Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces — leading Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels — took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. 
The issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.-supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains : 
“Kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. 
“However, Turkey’s intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF.” 
The problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey who’ve been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. 
So regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, it’s taking a much more proactive stance than that. 
Last Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were “the heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria,” Turkey targeted three Kurdish-controlled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out “26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia” and “had killed between 160 and 200 combatants.” 
Turkey’s major concern is that Kurdish-controlled enclaves will physically unite, “thereby creating a de facto Kurdish mini-state along the Turkish border.” As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. 
This tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.-led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently — even if somewhat grudgingly — bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. 
“From now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us,” Erdogan said from his palace last week. “Let them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly: they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.” NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

24670,Almost 500 specialists to serve as judges at 3rd Military World Winter Games in Sochi - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site Rosa Khutor alpine ski resort in Sochi 
© ITAR-TASS/Artur Lebedev 
MOSCOW, November 15. /TASS/. Almost 500 specialists will serve as judges at the 3rd CISM Military World Winter Games that will be held on February 22-28 in Sochi, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. 
“The main sports event of 2017 will start in 100 days. The program of competitions and schemes of sports tracks were officially coordinated with national sports federations. Federations also preliminarily approved judging teams in different disciplines and the order of their arrival. The total number of specialists who will judge at the Games will stand at 488 people,” the defense ministry said. 
The defense ministry noted that the Organizing Committee already agreed on facilities that will be used at the Games. “Competitions will be held in coastal and mountain clusters: Laura biathlon and ski complex (biathlon, cross country skiing, ski orienteering), Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort (Alpine skiing, ski mountaineering), Iceberg Skating Palace (short track) and Bolshoy Ice Dome (rock climbing),” the ministry added. 
The ministry noted that preparations for the Games proceed in accordance with the schedule. “Our team synchronously develops several spheres in order to hold the most successful World Winter Games in the history of their existence,” the ministry quoted Chief of the Central Sports Army Club Mikhail Baryshev as saying. 
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, who heads the Organizing Committee, put forward the idea to hold the Games at Olympic facilities in Sochi. 
Around 2,000 athletes from 40 countries are expected to take part in the Games. Forty-four sets of medals will be up for grabs in individual and team disciplines. The opening ceremony of the 3rd CISM Military World Winter Games will be held on 23 February 2017.

24672,UNESCO passes anti-Israel resolution despite Tel Aviv brickbats,"Palestine The file photo shows a view of al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. 
UNESCO's 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday's secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris. 
Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. 
The resolution expresses UNESCO’s deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. 
Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
“Through an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem,” Erekat said. 
He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges “respecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.” 
Earlier this month, UNESCO’s 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. 
Wednesday’s vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regime’s ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel Shama-Hacohen, had been recalled for consultations. 
""We will decide what the next steps will be,” Netanyahu said in a statement. 
Elias Sanbar, Palestine’s UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were “politicizing religion and this is very dangerous."" 
Makram Mustafa Queisi, Jordan’s ambassador to UNESCO, also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a “technical point of view” while many parties were politicizing it. Palestinian Ambassador to UNESCO Elias Sanbar (L) and Jordanian envoy Makram Mustafa Queisi address the media after an anti-Israel resolution was passed by secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris, France, October 26, 2016.

Palestine became the 195th full member of UNESCO in October 2011, triggering a cut in Tel Aviv’s funding to the agency. 
The occupied territories have already been the scene of increased tensions ever since the Israeli regime imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015. 
More than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. Loading ...",0
24677,"Jim Harbaugh, Gridiron Ambassador in Europe, Can’t Explain the ’Foot’ in Football - Breitbart","Nothing says “ugly American” quite like getting kicked out of a posh Italian mall for playing catch with a pigskin. [Perhaps Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh could have worn a bolo tie, or blasted Rick Derringer’s “Real American,” while accomplishing all that on Monday. But his behavior did enough to offend the Old World cultural sensibilities.  Europeans don’t understand football. Neither do many Americans, including, apparently, the successor to Fielding Yost and Bo Schembechler, who, during his European junket, pleaded ignorance to an African man asking why they call his sport football and not throwball. The foot, not the arm, mattered most in early football, a game, as its name implies, that borrowed heavily from European football only to take it in a very North American direction.   collegiate seasons passed before the rules allowed for a forward pass. Throwball would have struck observers as oddly back then as football does to us today. Players competed with a round soccer ball rather than a prolate spheroid in the early days. The two games, soccer (a truncated name for association football) and American football exhibited a similarity in the size of the field, the number of players, and even the names of certain positions. Football used a goal identical to the soccer goal. The Americans imagined it a greater feat to kick the ball above rather than beneath the goal post. So, they erected uprights, which changed an “n” goal into the “H” goalpost that many high schools still favor over the slingshot goalpost. Once upon a time, Sebastian Janikowski mattered a whole lot more than Tom Brady. The conversion, as its name implies, represented the means by which a team converted a touchdown into points. “No good” meant no points. The early rules favored field goals over touchdowns. The team with more field goals but fewer touchdowns, for instance, won the first two meetings of  . If played under today’s rules, the losing team would have won in both cases. “A match shall be decided by a majority of touchdowns a goal shall be equal to four touchdowns but in case of a tie a goal kicked from a touchdown shall take precedence over four touchdowns,” read an early rulebook. For football’s first 35 seasons, field goals brought more points than touchdowns. In 1897, touchdowns garnered five points. Seven years later, field goals shrank to four points from five. Not until 1912 did the game adopt the scoring system, more or less, that we see today. The ball gradually getting longer and harder (easier to throw, harder to kick) the movement of the goalpost to the end of the end zone, the pushing up of kickoffs, and the elimination of the fair   kick at certain levels (the NFL still retains this quirky rule) all further marginalized kicking. Just as guards no longer guard the hoop and forwards no longer focus on the frontcourt in basketball, football’s name no longer resembles its game. That one of the sport’s greatest coaches appears at a loss to explain his game’s name indicates the totality of, and how much we take for granted, the football’s transformation. Daniel J. Flynn is the author of The War on Football: Saving America’s Game (Regnery, 2013).",0
24679,Drone Racing Becomes ESPN’s Newest Televised Sport - The New York Times,"First there was poker. Then there was the spelling bee, Scrabble and the recent emergence of  . Now ESPN is betting that speeding drones will be the next noncontact “sport” to find a mass audience. The Drone Racing League announced on Wednesday that it had signed deals to broadcast a   season on ESPN and ESPN2, along with the European stations Sky Sports Mix and 7Sports. The schedule begins with an introduction to drone racing on Thursday at 11 p. m. on ESPN2. Competition will begin on Oct. 23. ESPN2 will broadcast episodes on Thursday and Saturday nights, and ESPN will show the final episodes, including the   championship on Nov. 20. Drone . .. racing? It would be fair to wonder what that is. The technology to race drones is just a few years old, as is the technology to compellingly film them racing. The league’s officials say the drones will zip through   courses at up to 80 miles per hour, piloted by six stationary humans wearing something akin to a virtual reality headset. Tiny cameras mounted on the drones offer the pilots a   view, and they steer using joysticks similar to what you’d find on an Xbox controller. “It’s an exciting,   experience mixed with   dynamics,” said Nicholas Horbaczewski, the chief executive and founder of the league. “These races are short sprints. It has that thrill of a   dash or horse racing. ” The races are prerecorded, so viewers will see an edited mix of drone footage and set cameras during the races. It won’t be difficult to follow the action, Mr. Horbaczewski said. Taking a cue from ESPN’s other nonathletic programming, the series is expected to focus on turning the pilots into characters you can root for. Cameras followed several of the pilots to their homes, interviewing them about their lives and what brought them to the activity, Mr. Horbaczewski said. MGM Television, with Mark Burnett as executive producer, is onboard to create unscripted shows around the pilots and the technology behind the races. Each of the 25 pilots will use an identical drone measured down to the ounce, Mr. Horbaczewski said. They will be quadcoptors “stripped down to the bare minimum” and outfitted with colored LED lights. The pilots will navigate obstacle courses in the corridors of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, an abandoned mall in Los Angeles, a laboratory in New York, a paper mill in Hamilton, Ohio, and an auto plant in Detroit. The winner will get a salaried contract to race in the 2017 season. It’s the biggest move yet into the mainstream for an activity that started just recently. It bloomed quickly from hobbyists gawking in parking lots into a competitive industry. A variety of organizations have emerged to put on drone races, including the Drone Sports Association, which had its championship streamed live on ESPN’s digital properties in August. An edited,   version is scheduled for Sept. 18 on ESPN2. Matthew Volk, the director of programming and acquisitions for ESPN, said drone racing fit in with other recent shows ESPN had broadcast, including CrossFit and BattleFrog. “We think that they are emerging sports with emerging audiences because they’re the kind of activities that any fan can go out and do,” said Mr. Volk. The Drone Racing League races will be simulcast on Sky Sports Mix, a new channel for the United Kingdom and Ireland created in August, at the same time they are shown on ESPN, but because that’s 4 a. m. local time they will be repeated at 5 p. m. said Emma Lloyd the director for corporate development, partnerships and investments at Sky. Sky is among the early investors in the league in addition to the TV deal, the league also announced it had closed an investment round of more than $12 million, led by RSE Ventures and Lux Capital. “It’s an area that could become very important for our customers,” Ms. Lloyd said.",0
24680,Comment on Former US Attorney for DC: New Hillary Email Probe Was Result of ‘Revolt’ Inside FBI by Tonya Parnell,"Former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova suggested Friday James Comey’s reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails was the product of a “revolt” inside the FBI. 
While speaking with WMAL’s Larry O’Connor , diGenova was asked what Comey meant by saying newly discovered Clinton emails from Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s devices “appear to be pertinent” to the FBI’s prior investigation. 
“It tells me that the original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation,” diGenova said, “otherwise they would have discovered this — and I’ll tell you why.” 
“These were found on the phone that was used by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin,” he said. “Why was that phone not looked at originally?” 
“There could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright, and if she did, she’s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there’s nothing he can do about it.” 
diGenova continued: “And why this letter was sent today was very simple: the agents came to Comey yesterday, they told him about the evidence, and he said oh ‘S’, and realized that his goose was cooked, that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent, and he knew that the agents running the Weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress.” 
“And I’ve also been told something very significant, it’s been reported that those laptops [belonging to Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson] were destroyed, they were not, and the reason is the FBI agents refused to do it.” 
diGenova went on to say he believes “there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now.” 
“He sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau,” he said. “Comey sent this letter today because he had to. He has no moral authority inside the agency right now, he’s a joke, he’s a laughingstock of the agency, and among former FBI agents, he has become an anathema.”

24688,Mike Pence Is Fine With Trump Sexual Assault But Offended By Voter Suppression,"By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 12:08 pm Donald Trump's Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he's offended by, but it's not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. Nope. Pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
“That’s offensive to me, that kind of language. It’s not our operation,” Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBC’s Morning Joe . 
Yes, Donald Trump’s Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he’s offended by, but it’s not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. 
Nope. 
Did Pence read the story? No. But he’s offended. So offended. Because that kind of language is offensive. Not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because it’s not “our operation.” 
Watch here via MSNBC’s Morning Joe : 
Twice saying he hasn’t read the article, Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadn’t read, “That’s offensive to me, that kind of language. It’s not our operation,” Pence denied. 
“Donald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. And that’s our message, is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them. That we can have government as good as our people again, but it’s going to take all of us.” 
“And you saw Donald Trump … say that people who haven’t traditionally voted Republican, we’ve got an agenda to bring our cities back…” 
Pence is twice offended, so super offended: 
“I’ve never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. Frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because that’s just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign. It’s not the approach we’re taking. We’re reaching out to every American.” 
Pence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump. In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying, “It’s time for Republicans to come home” because Trump won the primary. 
Mike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because “It’s just not what I see out there.” 
Trump also loves to cite what he “sees” and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist – like videos he claims to have watched. 
This explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together. It turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the Republican establishment’s efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. Both Pence and Trump don’t care a whit about facts. This is more than typical campaign spin, it’s appalling in context. 
The context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a woman’s “p*ssy” without her permission, but he is publicly saying he’s offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
Pence didn’t even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesn’t care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. But why would he? 
Pence didn’t care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted – not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
Like Trump, Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.

24700,Incredible smoke haze seen outside NDTV office after Arnab quits; bursting of firecrackers suspected,"Incredible smoke haze seen outside NDTV office after Arnab quits; bursting of firecrackers suspected Posted on Tweet (Image via shutterstock.com) 
An incredible smoke haze was spotted seen outside the NDTV office on Tuesday. Onlookers claimed that the reason was and uninhibited bursting of firecrackers by people in the building. 
One onlooker claimed he also heard loud firecrackers-like noise near the NDTV office area followed by fumes curling up to form a V-sign. 
Experts say it will be difficult to ascertain the source of the emission. A leading pollution expert opined, “These days such peculiar fumes can be due to firecrackers during the Diwali season or because of pure human emotions giving rise to intense celebrations, revelry, etc.” 
This incident, according to the onlooker, happened on Tuesday evening, minutes after the news of journalist Arnab Goswami quitting Times Now surfaced. 
The UnReal Times could not verify whether the two events were correlated as the onlooker tried to imply. 
A few onlookers however insisted the fumes could be a smokescreen to hide some kind of celebrations inside the office. The UnReal Times could not even verify whether there was pun intended in this claim. 
Similar incidents of smoke over other media houses were reported too. 
Outside the CNN IBN office, one could see similar fumes rising, triggering alarm bells among onlookers. Again, firecrackers could have been behind the smoke, according to the observers. 
Outside the India Today office, not only was smoke seen rising in the air but a grey-haired man was seen enthusiastically distributing sweets among strangers. 
When asked, what was he celebrating the man replied, “Should we celebrate Diwali only during Diwali? Why not a day later? Does that mean we have become anti-national?” 
When asked if the celebration had anything to do with the Arnab Goswami resignation, the man replied with a grin, “Shubhratri. Good night!” 
Strangely, outside the Times Now office, no smoke was detected. Tweet About Amrut Thobbi

Biden Jr. performs his last constitutional act by presiding over the joint session of Congress Friday in the House chamber for the official acceptance of the Electoral College results from the states. [The Constitution directs Biden to break the seal on the results from the Electoral College votes held Dec. 19 in the state capitals and then tally the results to determine if a candidate has a majority of the electors. If no candidate has an absolute majority of electors, then    top three candidates are put up for a new election by the House of Representatives.  For the vote in the House, each state delegation votes among themselves and the winner inside the delegation is awarded the state’s single vote. Given that the Republicans hold the majority of 36 delegations, the Democrats hold 13 and Maine is a   tie, if the vote goes to the House, Trump wins in a huge landslide. The Electoral College is also determined by state, except Nebraska and Maine, which allow congressional districts to vote separately, regardless of the statewide vote. Voters are actually voting for a slate of electors chosen by the presidential candidate’s party to participate in the real election that happened in November. When Americans voted Nov. 8, Republican Donald J. Trump beat Democrat Hillary R. Clinton    when that vote was translated into the Electoral College. But in keeping with the constitutional plan, electors are free to vote for whomever they please, though some states have laws meant to bind them. After the vote Dec. 19, Trump led Clinton   . It is the    tally that Biden will verify Friday to be approved by the House and the Senate. There could be a challenge. First, a congressman makes a motion to challenge the tally, followed by a second congressman and one senator to   the challenge. In 2000, members of the Congressional Black Caucus challenged the results of an election that was marred by irregularities in Florida and one where the recount there was stopped by the Supreme Court just before the Electoral College met. The challenge did not go far because, despite the pleading of the congressmen, nary a senator would join the challenge. For that spectacle, Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. was the third man to preside over the final tally of his own defeat  —   Biden becomes the fourth. Four   have presided over their own victory: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, and George H. W. Bush. In 2004, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D. .) joined House Democrats in their challenge based on results in Ohio, which forced both chambers to separate and to debate the challenge for two hours.",0

[For those who fight at Standing Rock] 

Those sublime songs of Dakota 
Rushing hooves of wild buffalo 
Calloused tears and fragile fears 
When we held ourselves as each other’s dears 

When dancing water met with bovine oil 
And siblings from afar came across the hill 
We dug our heels deep in weary soil 
One people who would not be still 

Into these fields we staggered blue 
As their tanks and rubber bullets slowed our paces 
Phallic batons took their dreadful cue 
From hooded men with hidden faces 

They ordered us back and put up wires 
They said they had come to make all things better 
With jobs and dollars and ivory spires 
The old promises of the wounded tinkerer 

Black Snake must make his way, they said 
Our lands were dead and mute 
Their machines purred and thrummed and fed 
On the very music they sought to refute 

We knelt in stinging tears and cried 
As yellow cranes sliced our mother red 
A surgical operation to make abide 
That which was never even dead 

Their cameras turned away – our stories postponed 
The dogs were set on us – our honour dethroned 
The skies coughed with smoke – our visions abused 
Our bodies were tallied – our power refused 

So we poured a libation of limbs 
And danced and laughed and swayed 
We became like water, flowing defiant hymns 
Unstable ghosts, form delayed 
We could not be killed; we could not be set straight 
We were a murmuration of unholy stirring 
We were thick; we were many, and downright apostate 
Every gesture was a perverse gathering 

We were there to bleed, to shed old hides 
To tell the tales of stone, prairie and Sioux 
Our skins were a wordless prayer, a choir of haunting guides 
When they struck our bodies we melted through 

Their victory lay with utterly containing us, 
In tired halos of their own making 
But we held on to our kin, the open plains unctuous 
A victory nobler than winning 

We knew the pollination songs of bees 
We knew the sacredness of a handful of soil 
We knew the nobility of water and trees 
We knew their own eyes did not weep oil 

Hand in hand we stood on the rock 
Drunken children of returning water 
We stood for daughters and sons not yet flocked 
Their own happily ever after 

Never forget, we urged ourselves as many suns set 
Never forget! – our wounds yelled this anthem 
Never forget this day when each other we met 
To remember is to overcome 

And we remember, we remember 
Those sublime songs of Dakota 
Rushing hooves of wild buffalo 
Calloused tears and fragile fears 
When we held ourselves as each other’s dears 

When dancing water met with bovine oil 
And siblings from afar came across the hill 
We dug our heels deep in weary soil 
One people who would not be still",0

24712,Geert Wilders Will Not Be Prosecuted For 2015 Austrian Speech,"Dutch prosecutors have announced they will not be pursuing charges against firebrand Dutch politician Geert Wilders for a speech he made in Austria in 2015. [Prosecutors rejected an appeal from an Austrian Muslim association to prosecute the populist politician for incitement after he made a strong   speech in Vienna in 2015. The Dutch prosecutors said the content of Mr. Wilders’ speech was not punishable by Dutch law and that they will not pursue the matter any further, NU. nl reports.  Wilders was invited by the   migration Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in 2015 to give a speech on Islamisation at the Hofburg palace. During the speech, Wilders said: “Islam calls on people to become terrorists  —   the Quran leaves no doubt about it. ” He also stated: “Islam is an ideology of war and hatred. ” Wilders wrote a reply to the allegations saying that the charges were a “legal jihad” and “while the elites are to blame for the existential crisis we are currently in, with their open   and unprecedented love for Islam and their cultural relativism, they sell us out completely and put our freedom and security at stake. ” The Dutch prosecutor explained their decision saying: “Only if a statement focuses on a group characterised by a belief may be punishable. ” “Wilders spoke on this occasion about Islam, not about Muslims, a group characterised by their Islamic faith. This falls under criticism in Dutch law and is not as insulting a group of people. ” Wilders reacted to the decision on Twitter writing: “Beautiful. The only right decision. The truth must be said and can be correct about Islam!” Mooi. De enige juiste beslissing. De waarheid moet gezegd kunnen worden, juist over de islam! https:  .   —   Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) June 7, 2017,  The attempt to have Wilders brought to court for hate speech charges is not the first time the Party for Freedom (PVV) leader has been charged with incitement. Earlier this year, he was found guilty and fined 5, 000 euros for a speech he made in 2011 talking about the crime rates of Morrocan migrants in the Netherlands. Wilders’ PVV made substantial gains in the Dutch national elections earlier this year becoming the second largest party in the country. As the coalition talks stall, Wilders has said the PVV is “fully available” to take part in a new coalition government. Current Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has consistently said that he would not work with the PVV, as have other parties. If coalition talks continue to break down, the Netherlands could face the option of calling another election.",0

24714,Floyd Mayweather Next Fight: Should 'Money' Chase The 50th Win Of His Career? - Morning News USA,"Comment 
Floyd Mayweather Jr. has so far been mum on whether he will don boxing gloves once again despite call-outs from Manny Pacquiao and Conor McGregor. Pacquiao is coming off an impressive win over Jesse Vargas while “The Notorious” was responding to Mayweather’s jabs. 
Of the two, a rematch with Pacquiao is seen as a logical move as Mayweather eyes a 50-0 record. It would allow “Money” to break the tie though nothing has been set for now. Floyd Mayweather Sr. believes son should go for it 
Floyd Mayweather Sr. has had his share of do’s and don’ts and the recent dish adds yet another angle to Floyd Jr.’s plans. According to him, Floyd Jr. should consider fighting at least one more time to break the tie believing it will take years before anyone can break it, Fighthype.com reported. 
Also read : Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao Rematch Will Be A Disappointment, To Be Staged Just For Money? Floyd Sr. sends stern warning to Conor McGregor 
Similar to his son, Floyd Sr. believes Conor McGregor should slow down and keep quiet. He is confident that McGregor could be in for a beating, World Boxing News reported. As most know, this fantasy match is nowhere near of happening so perhaps it would be best to leave it as it is – a dream. 
On the serious side, a rematch with Pacquiao should be the perfect setting. The Filipino may do the necessary adjustments but it is still the logical and lucrative one. The revenue may not be similar to the first encounter but is nevertheless expected to be millions. 
Any boxing return eventually falls on the hands of Floyd Mayweather Jr. He seems content living out his retirement though the urge to go for 50-0 is still in the air. His father believes he should go for it, same with boxing aficionados. At the end of the day, it all depends on whether “Money” is willing to enter the ring for one last fight.

France’s interior minister has ordered the closure of four mosques that allegedly espoused a ‘radical ideology,’ the latest such shutdowns among dozens since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks nearly a year ago. 
A state of emergency in France allows for the closing of places of worship where the preaching risks provoking hate, violence or acts of terrorism.

24716,Trump Spokesman Is ‘Very Confident’ Wiretapping Evidence Will Emerge - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In the latest verbal acrobatics over President Trump’s allegation that President Barack Obama spied on him during the 2016 campaign, the White House spokesman said on Tuesday that he was confident Mr. Trump’s claim would eventually be found to be true. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he was “very confident” that the Justice Department would submit data to the House Intelligence Committee after it missed a Monday deadline to produce evidence of Mr. Trump’s claim. The House committee is investigating Russian interference in the presidential election. Mr. Trump is “extremely confident” that there will be evidence to support his accusation, Mr. Spicer said on Tuesday. “There is significant reporting about surveillance techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election. I’ll leave it to them to issue their report, but I think he feels very confident that what will ultimately come of this will vindicate him. ” Mr. Spicer also said that Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump who suggested in an interview that the surveillance could have included a microwave oven, made the comment as a joke. “The microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone, and I think that has been cleaned up,” Mr. Spicer said. “It was made in jest, so I think we can put that to rest. ” Ms. Conway said on Monday that she had not been referring to Mr. Obama’s surveillance against Mr. Trump when she mentioned a microwave, although she made the remark in response to a question about that topic. Mr. Spicer’s comments on Tuesday were the latest in a series of shifting explanations and deflections as Mr. Trump’s inner circle has tried to adhere to his extraordinary Twitter posts two weekends ago about his predecessor. After Mr. Trump posted statements claiming that Mr. Obama had tapped Mr. Trump’s phones at Trump Tower, White House officials said they had referred the matter to the House and Senate intelligence panels and would have no further comment until those findings were complete. But that posture has been difficult to maintain in the face of mounting questions from lawmakers and others about what Mr. Trump meant and where he got his information, with calls for him to publicly explain himself. On Monday, Mr. Spicer said that the president had not meant to imply that Mr. Obama had tapped his telephone, but that he was referring in general to surveillance that had been well documented, including articles by The New York Times, during the presidential race. But The Times did not report that Mr. Trump was the target of any surveillance, even though that notion has gained currency on   websites, including some that traffic in conspiracy theories. Mr. Spicer’s assertion on Tuesday that the allegation would ultimately be proved correct suggested either that the president believes there was enough evidence for himself to be implicated in a serious crime or as an agent of a foreign power, or that the Obama administration had flouted the law to spy on him. Asked directly whether Mr. Trump believed that microwave ovens or televisions had been used to spy on him, Mr. Spicer said: “I would just say that the president has tweeted about this. He’s pretty clear that he believes that there was surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election. ”",0
24717,AUDIO: Wayne Allen Root Shocks Trump On Air With Revelation About DNC Lies,"Obamacare Architect Admits on Live TV That This Is How Obamacare Was DESIGNED 
The various revelations from WikiLeaks were also a topic of discussion, with Root bringing up a message he had seen from Democrat National Committee head Donna Brazile to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta about just how terrible the economy really was, despite all of the glowing reports and reassurances to the general public from the administration and liberal media. 
Trump was actually somewhat shocked by the news, having not seen that particularly incriminating email yet, and begged Root to send him a copy or link to it so he could familiarize himself with the details and use it on the campaign trail. 
The topic of voter fraud also came up in the conversation, though the ever-optimistic Root insisted that Trump’s supporters would be capable of overcoming with a massive turnout whatever tricks might be in store. Root even jested that Trump would actually win the race by 10 points but be declared a winner by only two due to widespread fraud and irregularities.   
You can listen to the entire interview right here, with the interesting bit regarding Brazile’s email to Podesta about the economy coming shortly after the eight-minute mark. 
While the discussion was quite encouraging for Trump, it was also rather enlightening, as Root revealed more of the duplicitous nature of the Clinton campaign that Trump had not yet been made aware of. 
Hopefully Trump will follow the advice given him by Root and others and keep a focus on Obamacare over the remainder of the race, as that issue hits home with virtually all voters and most certainly doesn’t help Clinton at all.  ",0
24721,Brits Warned To Expect ’Indiscriminate Attacks on Innocent Civilians’,"Britain’s new terrorism watchdog Max Hill has expressed “enormous concern” about returning jihadis, warning that Islamic terrorists have UK cities in their sights for future attacks. [Mr Hill, who was unveiled last week as the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the Sunday Telegraph that there was an “enormous ongoing risk which none of us can ignore”.  One of Britain’s leading prosecutors, he said the risk of terror in Britain is at its highest since the 1970s. He cautioned that “it would be wrong to draw a simple comparison between Irish republicanism and the ideology of   Islamic State. “But in terms of the threat that’s represented, I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning  —   with a view to indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour in metropolitan areas  —   represents an enormous   risk that none of us can ignore. ” Mr Hill, whose appointment follows a 30 year legal career, also expressed concern over the imminent return to Britain of hundreds of jihadis who have been fighting with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “It’s an enormous concern that large numbers  —   we know this means at least hundreds of British citizens who have left this country in order to fight  —   are now returning or may be about to return,” Mr Hill said. “Of course the imminent fall of Mosul and perhaps the prospective retaking of Raqqa are both bound to lead to a higher instance of returning fighters. Does that mean that the British public need to be immediately alarmed at a spike in terrorist activity within this country? “The answer to that is, I don’t know, but it doesn’t follow as a matter of fact that those who chose to go to live or fight abroad will bring that fight back to this country. ” Mr Hill further cautioned that British teenagers are being “radicalised by hate speech online”. But he defended ministers who approved the reported £1 million payout to Ronald Fiddler  —   the former Guantanamo detainee who this month carried out a suicide bomb attack. Figures disclosed by the Home Office in May last year showed that just one in eight jihadis who fought in the Middle East for extremist groups had been successfully prosecuted. Earlier this week a National Front member was sentenced to five years jail after making a series of offensive posts online, and distributing racist stickers and posters near his house. “We are as committed to apprehending and prosecuting far right extremists who commit terrorist offences and promote hatred as we are those who support and promote Islamic State. Both are intent on destroying communities and pose a real risk if they are allowed to continue” said Dean Haydon of the Counter Terrorism Command following the verdict.",0

24724,Politico Scoop: Lara Trump Supports Beagle Rescue Org with Felon in Leadership - Breitbart,"Politico Senior White House Reporter Darren Samuelsohn kicked off Memorial Day 2017 by hawking a hot investigative scoop: Lara Trump, wife to President Donald Trump’s son Eric, supports a beagle adoption advocacy group where one top executive once served time in prison for encouraging activists to torment animal researchers. [Lara Trump’s animal rights partner did 6 y in fed prison 4 harassing  stalking researchers. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Darren Samuelsohn (@dsamuelsohn) May 29, 2017,   “Eric Trump’s wife has publicly aligned with a controversial animal rights group,” Samuelsohn writes, “the Beagle Freedom Project, whose leadership includes a felon who served a   sentence in federal prison for harassing and stalking researchers. ” The connection, he asserts, “brings political risk. ” Said felon, Kevin Chase (née Kjonaas) was sentenced in 2006 and released from prison in 2011. And while there is no defending the acts which led to Chase’s conviction, Samuelsohn employs little more than innuendo to link them to BFP. “Lara Trump’s support for the Beagle Freedom Project has alarmed researchers and leaders from the pharmaceutical industry,” Samuelsohn writes, “as well as other animal rights organizations who say studies involving dogs and cats are well regulated by the federal government. ” BFP advocates for state laws forcing animal testing facilities to put research animals up for adoption instead of euthanizing them and performing more tissue tests  —   as well as encouraging individuals to rescue said animals. The group has partnered with celebrities such as Maria Menounos, Whitney Cummings, Corey Feldman, Amy Smart, Sia Furler, and Miley Cyrus in the past. Samuelsohn acknowledges that the only controversial element of BFP is Chase’s criminal history. “The Beagle Freedom Project’s stated goals are more mainstream” than his past groups, the Animal Liberation Front and Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, he writes. He also notes that the org received a $500, 000 contest reward from Microsoft  —   even after critics brought up Chase’s past. Samuelsohn did not answer an email asking if it was his idea or an editor’s assignment to veer from his White House beat to cover the loose association between a   activist and a New     to the President.",0
24725,China Tries to Censor AI Victory Over Go Champion - Breitbart,"The Chinese government attempted to prevent its citizens from watching Google’s AlphaGo AI defeat the world’s best player. [Ke Jie’s “horrible experience” against Google’s latest AI experiment was withheld from live broadcast by state censors. As reported by the China Digital Times, the censorship notice dictates that “Regarding the go match between Ke Jie and AlphaGo, no website, without exception, may carry a livestream. ” If a livestream had been announced in advance, the notice demanded that the announcement be immediately withdrawn.  Go is a    pastime that has remained largely unchanged from its earliest historic iterations. Competence in playing has been considered a sort of status symbol for countless generations, and the potential for a computer to unseat Ke Jie seems to have been enough to unsettle Chinese censors. The Go champion was himself put off by AlphaGo’s uncanny prowess, saying “I feel like his game is more and more like the ‘Go god. ’” He vowed never to play against AlphaGo again  —   a stark contrast to the bravado of his “Bring it on!” enthusiasm following AlphaGo’s   victory against South Korean Grandmaster Lee Sedol. Regardless of the government’s wishes, sites like bilibili. com skirted the ban by recreating the game, move by move, on their own Go boards. Meanwhile, Google’s DeepMind YouTube channel has the matches available for interested viewers outside of China. AlphaGo is part of the DeepMind AI project acquired by Google in 2014. It is partially   having played millions of games against itself in order to master the strategic complexity of the ancient game.

24731,Baghdad Car Bomb Kills Scores in Shiite Neighborhood - The New York Times,"ERBIL, Iraq  —   A car bomb exploded in a crowded Shiite Muslim neighborhood in Baghdad late Thursday afternoon, the latest terror attack in the capital claimed by the Islamic State, security officials reported. At least 54 people were killed and at least 63 more wounded in the bombing, making it the deadliest in Baghdad in at least a month. The attack came as Iraqi security forces, backed by American military advisers and Special Operations forces, prepared to assault an Islamic State stronghold in Mosul, Iraq’s   city, about 225 miles north of Baghdad. The country has been consumed by news from Mosul, where Iraqi forces have been mounting the country’s largest military operation since the United States invasion in 2003, driving Islamic State fighters from eastern Mosul over the last month Security officials said the bomb in Baghdad went off in a parked pickup truck. Ambulances responding to the scene quickly filled to capacity, so the police and civilians helped transport other victims to hospitals, according to Abu Jafar, a police commissioner. Mr. Jafar said the morgue at Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad was overflowing with bodies of the dead, and the hospital’s emergency room was filled to capacity with seriously injured people. The Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, posted a statement online claiming responsibility for the attack, and said that it was aimed at Shiite Muslims, whom many fundamentalist Sunnis consider to be nonbelievers. Shiites are a majority in Iraq and dominate the national government. Prime Minister Haider   convened an emergency meeting with top military and security officials Thursday night to discuss efforts to combat terrorist attacks. A witness to the bombing, Amir Abas, 35, said he was standing about 150 yards from the pickup truck when it exploded. “I saw a lot of burned bodies, and injured people and burned cars everywhere,” he said. The bombing took place in the Baya neighborhood of southern Baghdad, where there are a number of parking lots in which people gather to buy and sell used cars, attracting large crowds on weekday afternoons. Civilians in Shiite neighborhoods have often been the targets of attacks claimed by the Islamic State. Shiite militias, known as popular mobilization forces, are expected to take part in the military assault in western Mosul and particularly in the neighboring city of Tal Afar to the west. On   television channels in Iraq, news reports from Mosul are shown with a standing logo that says in Arabic and English, “Nineveh, We Are Coming. ” Mosul, the last major city in Iraq where the Islamic State still maintains significant control, is the capital of Nineveh Province. Baghdad has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks recently. At least 11 people were killed Wednesday by a bombing in another   lot at the edge of Sadr City, a large Shiite neighborhood. A suicide bombing in January in Sadr City killed more than 30 people. Hakim   a legislator who heads the security and defense committee in Parliament, criticized intelligence and security officials for failing to anticipate the attack on Thursday. Mr. Zamili has been a frequent critic of the security establishment. “This explosion indicates the weakness of the intelligence network in Baghdad,” he said in a telephone interview on Thursday night. Islamic State terrorists are able to carry out attacks “at any time and anywhere” in the capital, he said.",0

24733,"House Freedom Caucus Saved GOP Majority from Ryancare Disaster, Says Voter Study - Breitbart","A sophisticated analysis of polling data shows that the House Freedom Caucus saved the GOP’s House majority from a huge electoral backlash by helping to defeat the House Speaker Paul Ryan’s alternative to Obamacare, says Chris Wilson, head of WPA Research. [The “House Freedom Caucus members held the line, and the data show that is precisely what their constituents wanted,” he wrote in a report, titled “Analytics shows HFC saved GOP on Health Care. ”  On Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert predicted any approval of Ryan’s healthcare overhaul would wreck the GOP’s House majority in 2018. “This bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority   …     [and] If we pass a bill that doesn’t bring down premiums and give the American people hope, and not give more power to the government   …     then we will deserve to be voted out,” he said in a speech on the House floor, according to TheHill.   “While full repeal and replace of Obamacare has overwhelming support in these districts, even keeping Obamacare intact was more popular than the AHCA, often by more than a    margin,” said Wilson, who managed Sen. Ted Cruz’s voter analysis and tracking efforts in 2016.   The same analysis was applied to 2018 Senate races and concluded that “the House Freedom Caucus did   …     Republicans’ hopes of expanding their Senate majority, a great service in stopping the [Ryancare] bill before it made it across the Capitol,” Wilson wrote.  But Wilson’s analysis also shows strong public support for an alternative    “plan that allows for the sale of insurance across state lines, expands Health Savings Accounts, incentivizes states to create   pools, block grants Medicaid, and is portable so it can be taken from job to job. ” Wilson’s analysis is based a huge national survey, which allows his group to understand the preference of each population subgroup. For example, voters are asked three questions about each issue, he said. Typically, one question is skewed from a   perspective, one question is skewed from the right, and the third question is intended to be unbiased, he said. In turn, the team then used three   models to predict preferences among each politicians’ particular subgroups of voters. In this survey, the models were used to gauge each district’s’ voters preference for three healthcare options  —   continuing Obamacare, establishing Ryan’s “Ryancare” replacement, and the third option, “Repeal and replace. ” Subsequently, the analysts spend much time check and rechecking the accuracy of the   models in each district, he said, adding “you’ve got to spend time ” Politicians are increasingly using this style of voter analysis to understand their constituents, amid constant pressure from lobbyists and donors, he said.  In the healthcare analysis, Wilson said he didn’t try to gauge why the voters approved or rejected each of the three policy options. “I don’t have the ability to discern or divine the reason why the voters answered as they did  …     that’s the next stage” of development, he added.

24734,Comment on New USDA Rules Eliminate Junk Food in Schools by conflictedhealth,"Apparently Michelle hasn’t ruined the kids’ lunches enough already. An example of Michelle Obama’s mandated school lunches 
From Yahoo : Students might notice some changes in the cafeteria when they go back to school in a few weeks. The USDA will announce rules today that require schools to get rid of unhealthy snacks and eliminate students’ exposure to junk food , ABC News has exclusively learned. 
The biggest difference this year will be what students see around the school. If a snack, food item or beverage is not healthy enough for a school to sell or serve, it can’t be advertised either. That means no more pictures of soda on vending machines or in the cafeteria. 
Katie Wilson, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said many schools requested these changes. “Education and wellness and advertising to kids about healthier choices [and] that all has to be part of the school environment just like making sure they have pencils and paper and computers,” Wilson said. 
One study found that 70 percent of elementary and middle school students see ads for junk food at school and research published earlier this month showed that kids tend to eat more after seeing ads for unhealthy food. Another lovely school lunch 
Snacks can’t have too many calories or too much sodium, fat or sugar, according to the guidelines for schools . Foods that are “whole grain-rich” or mostly made up of fruits or vegetables are emphasized, and schools are recommended to sell only water, low-fat milk or milk alternatives, or 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice. 
Wilson said 98 percent of schools around the country already meet these standards. Now that the rules are finalized, she said the USDA will continue its efforts to educate parents, communities and school staff about better nutritional food choices. 
Healthier food in schools is nothing new. Guidelines about healthy school lunches and snacks have been rolling out for several years and are part of First Lady Michelle Obama ’s “Let’s Move” campaign launched in 2010 to fight childhood obesity .

24735,World’s tallest church being eroded by urinating revellers,"World’s tallest church being eroded by urinating revellers  14 Get short URL The church is the tallest in the world. © akinchelow / Instagram The 162m tall Ulm Minster church in Germany isn’t just attracting people answering the call of God but also those answering the call of nature and it’s now contributing to the erosion of its sandstone base. 
Increased patrols and fines have failed to stop those who use the landmark as a meeting point and to urinate on the base of the church. The urine’s acid and salts has contributed to the erosion of its sandstone base, according to the Südwest Presse . A photo posted by Zara :] (@osnapitszara) on Oct 15, 2012 at 5:50pm PDT There are 768 steps to the top of the Ulm Minister, but the views from above are worth the climb! #GermanTownTuesday pic.twitter.com/Hn6DUutcun — German Embassy (@GermanyinUSA) June 21, 2016 
""I've been keeping an eye on it for half a year now and, once again, it's coated with urine and vomit"" the church’s head of maintenance Michael Hilbert told the Presse. Hilbert said he does not want to be known as the “pee police” but that the issue “is about preserving law and order."" 
Fines for public urination have doubled to €100 but this has done little to stem the practice. 
Located at the popular Münsterplatz, the church will probably see an increase in those needing to relieve themselves next month as a wine festival and Christmas markets land on its doorstep. Hilbert said free toilets are needed in the area to help prevent further deterioration of the church's base because of the urination on the church. 
During the town’s holiday of Schwörmontag this year, the southern part of the church was closed off to the public in an effort to prevent the offence, but this failed to make much of an impact according to one city spokeswoman. 
“As long as there are people” the problem will persist, she told the Presse, admitting that public urinators had proved elusive,with virtually none of the perpetrators caught in the act. 
The Lutheran church is the tallest church in the world and the fourth tallest structure built prior to the 20th century, making it one very large tree to pee on.",0
24736,Those Threats Are Real,"Christopher Manion https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/threats-real/ 
Back in the 1980s, I was involved in Senate hearings that exposed some of the corruption in the Mexican government, business elites, police, and the military. 
We were only touching the tip of the iceberg, of course, but the State Department vehemently opposed us nonetheless (yes, there were neocons there then as well). 
The hearings were ignored in the States, but they raised Hell in Mexico, and that meant that it raised Hell in the coven of apparatchiks at State as well. They did their best to retaliate, and, fortunately, the leader of the pack pleaded years later to federal charges of lying to Congress (“Hey, doesn’t everybody???!!”) on another matter (Sometimes the chickens do come home to roost.). 
But the Mexican corruptos were a different breed. Nobody was going to bring them to justice – the ruling PRI (then and now) was seamlessly coordinating and cooperating with the drug gangs, the military killers, and the corrupt elites. 
Several years later, I planned to attend a conference in Mexico City – where I used to live, but had not visited since our hearings. Then, out of nowhere, at a social function, a diplomat from the Embassy of Mexico in Washington approached me and said, “I hear you’re going to Mexico.” (How did she know?) 
“Go nowhere alone,” she said sternly. “Stay in your hotel after dark. Travel only with the other conferees on the bus (she knew everything about this very non-political conference). And NEVER hail a cab!” 
So there I was. I couldn’t go to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe. I couldn’t go visit old friends in their homes. I couldn’t even go look at the house in Colonia Polanco where Stalin’s secret agent from Barcelona killed Leon Trotsky with a pickaxe. 
So I asked this generous woman, who was probably risking her career, why she was telling me this. 
“They have long memories. They have a kill list. I’ve seen it,” she said. 
Period. 
The (im)moral of the story: Death threats are real. So this recent headline caught my attention: 
Dave Schippers, who served as the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee’s probe into whether Bill Clinton committed impeachable offenses, is “terrified by Hillary Clinton.” 
Read it . He wanted to investigate everything, including the corruption, the cattle futures, the murders – not only Vince Foster’s, but all those folks in Arkansas But he was waved off. He read every single document that had been collected on the breadth and depth of the Clinton Corruption Machine, but he was stiffed by unidentified higher-ups. 
Ever since, he’s watched his back. I’m sure that he can’t walk around alone at night, or hail a cab on a busy street, or take his kids to the park. 
Why? Because death threats are real. Ignore them and you die.",0

Obvious political double standards
When it comes to scandal-plagued and utterly dishonest Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch clandestinely meets on the tarmac of Sky Harbor airport for a tête-à-tête with Hill’s husband Bill aboard a private jet — ostensibly to discuss grandchildren.
And, though FBI Director James Comey found compelling evidence of concerning issues in Hillary Clinton’s use of multiple private email servers, he concluded that he would not recommend charges against her, though he conceded Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” in handling classified information. Comey refused to recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton, despite “evidence” she violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, jeopardizing U.S. national security. These breaches occurred during her term as Secretary of State. “There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information,” Comey acknowledged.
Additionally, Comey noted that other individuals in a similar situation would not necessarily be let off the hook with no charges, and would probably face penalties. “But that’s not what we’re deciding now,” he glibly fed us, the sheeple. “We are expressing to Justice our view that no charges be made in this case.”
“Justice,” of course, is U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the tarmac meeting fame. Addressing the people of the United States, the FBI director actually said that “no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear” on the investigation. He neglected to mention the inappropriate meeting between former president Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch aboard a private jet.
Hillary Clinton is free to run for the U.S. Presidency, guaranteeing Obama’s third term.
Here in Arizona, we have what clearly appears to be a personal vendetta carried out by a federal judge timed to coincide with the General Election in which popular Sheriff Joe Arpaio is on the ballot running for a seventh term. He was formally charged Tuesday with criminal contempt of court for ignoring U.S. District Judge Murray Snow’s order in a three-year old racial-profiling case. Arpaio acknowledged violating Snow’s order but insists the breach wasn’t intentional
Arpaio’s challenger in the race is once again rough ‘er up Democrat Paul Penzone, funded by multi-billionaire Socialist George Soros, who is contemptuous of national borders. Soros also funds Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
If convicted, Sheriff Arpaio could face up to six months in jail. A misdemeanor conviction would not bar Arpaio from serving as sheriff.

24741,Study Finds 88 Percent of Media Coverage is Anti-Trump,"A new study finds that 88 percent of coverage of President Donald Trump and his administration is negative. [The study by the Media Research Center (MRC) found that the evening newscasts on the “Big Three” TV networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, were overwhelmingly hostile to Trump.  In its study, the MRC found that over the president’s first 30 days in office, the networks dedicated 16 hours of coverage to President Trump, 54 percent of its total news coverage. MRC found up to 674 negative statements aimed at Trump while only a tiny 88 statements were deemed positive. “Our measure of media tone excludes soundbites from identified partisans, focusing instead on tallying the evaluative statements made by reporters and the   talking heads (experts and average citizens) included in their stories,” MRC noted. “In their coverage of Trump’s first month, the networks crowded their stories with quotes from citizens angry about many of his policies, while providing relatively little airtime to Trump supporters. The MRC also noted that “anchors and reporters often injected their own   editorial tone into the coverage. ” The study also noted that the president’s call for a temporary moratorium on travel from seven   nations drew the most negative coverage. Other negative coverage centered on Trump’s border policies, his economic plans, the battle over his cabinet picks, as well as Trump’s “complicated relationship” with Russia. “Further highlighting the hostile tone of these newscasts, nearly an hour of coverage (56 minutes) was given over to   protests on various topics, with nearly   (82 out of 442) of the Trump stories or briefs aired during these 30 days including at least some discussion of an   protest,” the MRC concluded.

24746,Poland Establishing New Territorial Defense Force to Fight ‘Russian Threat’,"Politics Poland Establishing New Territorial Defense Force to Fight ‘Russian Threat’ 
Poland's right-wing government is creating a new military arm to counter the supposed Russian threat, as well as planning to double the size of Poland's armed forces Originally appeared at Sputnik 
The Polish government has given a final go-ahead to the planned creation of a territorial defense force, which local media were quick to call the “personal army” of Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz. Sputnik Poland discussed the issue with Polish politician and commentator Mariusz Olszewski. 
“ Macierewicz is a very efficient politician and defense minister and his ability to place [the territorial defense force] under his personal command, rather that the president’s is nothing short of a political masterpiece, ” Mariusz Olszewski told Sputnik Poland. 
He added that the new force was obviously meant for use inside the country against the so-called “death squads” trying to destabilize the political situation in the country. 
“If this is really what is happening, then the government’s fears are fully justified,” Olszewski chuckled. 
In the event of an armed conflict the territorial defense units will be called up to secure their designated areas, stamp out attempts to stoke up ethnic and religious conflicts and attempts to destabilize the country. 
When asked whether it means that the Territorial Defense Force (TDF) would serve as a kind of “personal police” for the ruling Law and Justice party, Mariusz Olszewski said that it would rather serve the national security minister. 
“The very list of threats the TDF is supposed to deal with looks a bit strange though as we have no internal threats, neither have we any regional or ethnic minorities here,” Olszewski said, adding that the real threat to the powers-that-be came from people who “use Western money to destabilize the country through media ‘death squads’ and challenge the constitutional order in Poland.” 
“I am also worried by Ukrainian media saying that it could take the Polish army just five days to reach the border of the Second Polish Republic [prior to 1939 — Ed.]. This is exactly the kind of misinformation Western propaganda was spreading about Russian troops needing just 24 hours to reach Warsaw. Someone is trying to pit Eastern European countries against each other, to make people believe that war is imminent,” Mariusz Olszewski warned. 
While admitting that security was something no country should ignore, he added that a country the size of Poland might need a territorial defense force, but only as a backup to the regular forces, “not as the mainstay of national defense as our defense ministry wants us to believe. This is either someone’s mistake or just a PR stunt.” 
“Poland needs ground forces, an Air Force and, to a lesser extent, a Navy. As for territorial defense, it is just a smokescreen meant to hide what is really happening in our army,” Mariusz Olszewski emphasized . 
The Territorial Defense Force (TDF) is a planned military reserve component of the Polish armed forces which is currently being formed. 
Plans call for the force, once fully active, to consist of 35,000 part-time volunteers. Poland plans to deploy the new territorial defense units on its eastern border and to transfer the acting brigades there with an eye to becoming one of the largest NATO armies in Europe. 
Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said that the deployment was aimed against Russia, describing it as a ""measured, proportionate"" response to ""the prospect of aggressive Russian action."" 
He also supports the idea of significantly boosting the Polish armed forces, from the current 80,000 servicemen to some 150,000.  ",0
24747,Popcast: The Best Albums of 2016 - The New York Times,"One of the unexpected byproducts of the streaming era is how a certain tier of artists  —   already famous, prone to eccentricity  —   have doubled down on albums. These blocks of work demand to be consumed as a whole, and serve as an enemy of the ephemerality of music consumption. This year, artists like Beyoncé, Bon Iver, Kanye West, Sturgill Simpson and Frank Ocean delivered albums that were meant to be taken in all at once, and pushed aesthetic boundaries while doing so. All of their albums appear on     lists from the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times  —   some on more than one. On this week’s Popcast, I speak with Jon Pareles, the chief pop music critic, and Joe Coscarelli, the pop music reporter, about the year’s best albums, the ones widely agreed on and the ones with more specific, narrow appeal.

New Wikileaks documents show that Hillary Clinton, in association with the mainstream media, was given debate questions ahead of time. What’s more, as you’ll see below, Hillary, who claims she was merely taking notes, was actually reading directly off of the podium , almost as if someone was feeding her answers and bullet points… 

From Mac Slavo, SHTFPlan : 
New Wikileaks documents show that Hillary Clinton, in association with the mainstream media, was given debate questions ahead of time. It’s also been rumored that the former First Lady may have used an ear piece at one of the debates, giving her a significant advantage. 
Last week footage of the final Presidential debate begain circling the internet and showed that Clinton may have been using some sort of screen at her podium. While many dismissed this as a lighting effect, an investigation by Piper McGowin at The Daily Sheeple suggests thatHillary may have actually been using some sort of tablet device. 
The following video will leave little doubt that something just wasn’t right at the last debate. As you’ll see, Hillary, who claims she was merely taking notes, was actually reading directly off of the podium, almost as if someone was feeding her answers and bullet points. 
Moreover, and quite damning, the notes Hillary was supposedly taking were were being written down with a pen that didn’t have a tip on it . So, either she wasn’t taking notes, or, she was using a stylus on an electronic device.

24749,"Fire Tears Through Manila Slum, Leaving 15,000 Homeless - The New York Times","MANILA  —   A fire raced through a squalid Manila shantytown teeming with people on Tuesday night, as residents armed only with buckets of water tried to fight the inferno. As day broke on Wednesday, more than 15, 000 people found themselves homeless, bereft of their few worldly possessions and forced to sleep on the Philippine capital’s streets. “It spread fast across the neighboring homes made of light materials,” said Wilberto Tiu, Manila’s fire chief. “Firemen had trouble reaching the area because of small alleyways,” Mr. Tiu said of the warren of closely built homes, some constructed of no more than plywood and scrap metal. He said the alleys between homes were too narrow for fire trucks. Residents tried to outrun the blaze, grabbing whatever they could carry: pots and pans, family pets, washing machines and electric fans. Dozens of people were injured in the stampede, but miraculously, officials said, no one was killed. The blaze had been brought under control by Wednesday morning. Fires in the country’s slums are a regular occurrence. About 1, 200 families were left without homes in January after a fire in Navotas, a suburb of Manila. Residents of shantytowns are at particular risk in the months of February and March, as the weather warms and the rains stop, officials said. In March 2015, more than 7, 000 families were left homeless when a blaze tore through the same slum, Parola Compound, near the capital’s main port. In 2014, the homes of at least 2, 500 families in the slum were destroyed in a predawn blaze. Investigators said they believed Tuesday’s blaze was caused by faulty electrical wiring or a malfunctioning gas stove. By Wednesday morning, hundreds of families were left to sleep on the street, some at a makeshift shelter at a covered basketball court, disaster officials said. Television footage showed children sleeping on sidewalks along streets near the slum, as health workers distributed food and other supplies.",0

[The rape survivor, Emma, told Katie Hopkins on LBC radio on Sunday: “I actually reported my abuse 14 years ago. I went to the authorities, my parents did. I sat and gave video interviews with the police, I was willing to work with them.  “But as soon as I said the names, I was made to feel as though I was racist and I was the one who had the problem. ” “I was specifically told not to comment on the ethnicity of the perpetrators,” Emma said, adding she was told “numerous times” by police and social workers not to mention race. “I knew I wasn’t racist, but I felt like that was used as a way to silence me. ” Asked by Ms. Hopkins how that made her feel at the time, Emma said: “My perpetrators made me feel like I was in the wrong and they [police and social workers] fed into that. And I felt like: ‘Maybe my perpetrators are right. Maybe it’s not them that’s got the problem, maybe it’s me’. ” Groomed from 12, Emma told LBC listeners she was a virgin when she was raped at age 13. Detailing that the rapes happened regularly, she described one occasion where she was locked in a property and sexually assaulted by multiple men. The Muslim grooming gang then began blackmailing the young teen, and threatened to gang rape her mother if she told her parents. “That was my life,” she said. The rapes continued after she reported it to police, as authorities told her it was “[her] word against his”. The police had also lost the clothes she had been raped in, leaving her with no evidence for a prosecution. Let down by authorities, she found herself being further abused by other rape gangs. She reported rape again at the age of 14, but police said there was not enough evidence. Eventually, her parents moved her out of the country. “Nobody wanted to stop it, and that was the only way they could stop it,” Emma said. Ms. Hopkins told Emma that other parents of victims of Muslim grooming gangs had moved their daughters abroad, saying moving girls to different parts of the country was ineffective as the rape gangs are “networked between cities”. The Rotherham child sex abuse scandal is the biggest child protection scandal in Britain’s history, where, since the late 1980s, police and social services failed to protect girls from predatory grooming gangs made up of Muslim men for fear of being labelled racist, leading to institutional  .

24761,Comment on Fury as German primary school ‘forces’ children to chant ‘Allahu Akbar’ in Muslim prayer by Dr. Eowyn,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by DCG | 2 Comments 
Ain’t multiculturalism grand? 
From Daily Express : The father of the pupil at the girl’s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. 
He claimed she had been “forced” by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. 
The handout read: “Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.” 
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in “ethics” at the Bavarian school. 
Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. 
The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children’s nursery was refusing to acknowledge “Christmas rituals” to accommodate the “diverse cultures” of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils were Christian. 
A spokesman for Kassel explained: “There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.” 
Migrants now outnumber native children at many schools in Germany as the country has been inundated with migrants in recent years. More than one million migrants are estimated to have arrived in Germany during the last year alone. 
The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees estimates that another 200,000 people will apply for asylum in 2017.

24764,How We Put Together Our 52 Places to Go List - The New York Times,"For the 12th straight year, the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue. You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? What’s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes. ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017.  What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country?  Canada has it all (O. K. maybe not tropical beaches). It’s a world unto itself, with Vancouver Island surf breaks, culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal, and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And, let’s face it, clichés of Mounties and hockey aside, Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. It’s a great time to correct that, as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you’ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. “Travel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place,” said Maureen Towey, the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. “We ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle, a   balloon or a ski lift, we say yes every time. ” On a computer, you’ll also notice a stunning drone video, shot in Tofino, on the western coast of Vancouver Island. “After many wet days, there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better,” said Josh Haner, a staff photographer who shot the footage. “As my drone’s batteries were running out, I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes. ” And print readers will notice something new as well: a special   presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall). How do you start the process? We ask our regular contributors, many of whom live overseas or roam the globe, for ideas. We get hundreds of them. What are you looking for in those ideas? First, why now? That is, why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both   and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots even though cities like London, Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting, they didn’t make this year’s list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A   meeting, in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didn’t make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are, of course, just the start. There are thousands of wonderful destinations to consider. We’d love to hear your suggestions  —   use the #52Places2017 hashtag on Instagram to suggest yours.",0
24769,Rick Perry Accuses Texas A&ampM of Disqualifying Student Government Election Winner in ’Name of Diversity’ - Breitbart,"Rick Perry has accused administrators at Texas AM of disqualifying a student who was elected to serve as student body president “in the name of ‘diversity. ’”[Robert McIntosh, the son of a prominent Republican fundraiser who supported President Trump in his bid for the White House, was disqualified after winning an election for Texas AM’s student body president by over 700 votes. The position of student body president was awarded to the   finisher, Bobby Brooks, a junior who became Texas AM’s first openly gay student body president.  McIntosh was initially disqualified over claims that he may have engaged in voter intimidation tactics. The concern was quickly dismissed by Texas AM’s Judicial Court, which The Washington Post calls “the university’s version of a student supreme court. ” But McIntosh’s disqualification was upheld, with the reason given that he “failed to disclose financial information for glow sticks briefly featured in a campaign video. ” Secretary of Energy and former Governor of Texas Rick Perry, who is an alumnus of Texas AM, wrote a column for The Houston Chronicle citing his concerns over the decision to take the position away from McIntosh over the purchase of glow sticks that appeared in his campaign video. “As Texas’ first Aggie governor and as someone who was twice elected Yell Leader of Texas AM University, I am deeply troubled by the recent conduct of AM’s administration and Student Government Association (SGA) during the Aggie   president elections for ” he began. Mainstream media outlets like The Washington Post were quick to question the motivations behind Secretary Perry’s criticisms, running the headline “Rick Perry accuses Texas AM’s first gay student body president of stealing election” on their Facebook page. ”I viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character”  —   Rick Perry on election of gay student. Does this headline suggest that? pic. twitter.   —   Tommy (@tciccotta) March 23, 2017,  Perry argued that the student body’s support of Brooks as an openly gay student was a “testament to the Aggie character. ” “When I first read that our student body had elected an openly gay man, Bobby Brooks, for president of the student body, I viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character. I was proud of our students because the election appeared to demonstrate a commitment to treating every student equally, judging on character rather than on personal characteristics,” he wrote. Despite The Washington Post‘s suggestion, Perry’s criticism wasn’t pointed at Brooks it was pointed at the administrators responsible for disqualifying McIntosh on a technicality. “In its opinion, the Judicial Court admitted that the charges were minor and technical, but, incredibly, chose to uphold the disqualification, with no consideration given to whether the punishment fit the crime. The desire of the electorate is overturned, and thousands of student votes are disqualified because of free glow sticks that appeared for 11 seconds of a   campaign. Apparently, glow sticks merit the same punishment as voter intimidation,” he argued. Perry claimed that McIntosh received the glow sticks for participating in a charity event before the campaign and also that the other candidates weren’t asked to itemize the expenses of props used in their campaign videos. “Now, Brooks’ presidency is being treated as a victory for ‘diversity.’ It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for ‘diversity’ is the real reason the election outcome was overturned,” Perry argued. “Does the principle of ‘diversity’ override and supersede all other values of our Aggie Honor Code? “Honestly, we were just surprised to see that the secretary of energy would take the time to weigh in in detail,” Amy Smith, the school’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, told the Texas Tribune, “and we respectfully disagree with his assessment of what happened. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

24770,"WATCH: Diamond And Silk Slam Obama, Kerry For ’Stabbing Israel In The Back’ - Breitbart","TEL AVIV  —   The YouTube sensations known as Diamond and Silk released a new video slamming President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry for “stabbing Israel in the back. ”[The hilarious duo, sisters with the real names of Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, rose to fame when they shot videos in ardent support of   Donald Trump during his bid for the Republican nomination.   Their latest video, entitled “We Stand With Israel: Kerry and Obama don’t know where they stand,” lambasts Kerry for his address last week on the   conflict. In apparent reference to Kerry’s wife Teresa Heinz, Hardaway said, “Kerry must be slipping in all of that Heinz Ketchup —  ’cause he trippin’!” Hardaway continues by attacking Obama for not having Israel’s back and for being “out of touch. ” “Let me tell you something: Israel is our ally, so that means we have to have their backs! I don’t care if their back is small, and our backs are big, we still got to have their backs  —   period. ” “[Obama] was out of touch with this election. He was out of touch with the American people. And now he is out of touch with Israel,” she says. “And if he’s not careful, somebody will end up stabbing Israel in the back,” she cries, as Richardson animatedly demonstrates the    action. “And we can’t let that happen!” To end, the two sisters declare in unison: “Guess what  —   We stand with Israel!

24771,Ronald Reagan: ’Those Who Seek to Inflict Harm Are Not Fazed by Gun Control Laws’ - Breitbart,"During his 1983 speech to the NRA Annual Meetings in Phoenix, Arizona, Ronald Reagan noted that “those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws. ”[Reagan stood before an applauding NRA crowd and reminded them that he, too, was a member of the NRA. He praised the NRA for the work it was doing to defend the right to keep and bear arms and pointed out that a large portion of the group’s two and a half million members had rallied to defeat gun control in California in November 1982.  He then said, “It’s a nasty truth, but those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws. ” He added, “I happen to know this from personal experience,” referencing the assassination attempt on his own life in March 30, 1981. Reagan then said, “I’ve always felt a special bond with the members of your group. You live by Lincoln’s words, ‘Important principles may and must be inflexible. ’” He added: [The NRA’s] philosophy put its trust in people, so you insist [that] individuals be held responsible for their actions.  The NRA believes that America’s laws were made to be obeyed and that our constitutional liberties are just as important today as 200 years ago. And by the way, the constitution does not say that government shall decree the right to keep and bear arms. The constitution says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Reagan gave his NRA speech in 1983 and no president followed suit until President Donald Trump. The NRA announced that Trump will speak at the Annual Meetings on April 28, 2017, in Atlanta. NRATV is celebrating Trump’s coming speech in a video that features snippets of Reagan’s 1983 speech, then segues to candidate Trump speaking at the Annual Meetings in 2016, when the NRA endorsed him.

24772,Former NFL Player Aaron Hernandez’s Body Found with Bible Verse Written on His Forehead - Breitbart,"Authorities are now reporting that Aaron Hernandez had a verse from the Bible written on his forehead when he was found hanged with a bed sheet in his prison cell on Wednesday. [The    former New England Patriots star was found dead in his jail cell only days after being pronounced not guilty in a second murder trial, the AP reported.  Officials now say that Hernandez had written a portion of John 3:16 across his forehead, the New York Daily News said. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,” the verse in question reads. Prison officials also noted that the troubled player’s Bible was lying near his body and opened to the same verse. Sources told the paper that an investigation had been launched to find out if Hernandez had somehow gotten hold of a synthetic marijuana called K2 on Tuesday night. Even as Hernandez’s death was labeled a suicide, some of the   player’s family and friends insisted that he would never have done such a thing to himself. On Wednesday, his former lawyer, a sports agent, at least one of his former teammates, and his family all expressed doubts over the claim that Hernandez committed suicide. Some even speculated that he may have been murdered. Despite being acquitted in his most recent murder case, Hernandez was serving a life sentence for the 2015 murder of Odin Lloyd.

24778,More Asylum Requests in Germany than Rest of EU Combined,"Germany received more asylum requests in 2016 than the rest of the European Union (EU) combined. In response to the report, the Bundestag   warned Germany’s migrant crisis was not over. [According to the European Commission’s statistical office Eurostat, of the 988, 000 applications for asylum made in the EU in the first nine months of 2016 approximately   were made in Germany, reports Deutsche Welle.  The exact figure, however, cannot be agreed upon by Commission and German agencies with Eurostat putting the number at 612, 000, while the Federal Interior Ministry puts it at 658, 000. Of the actual number of asylum requests processed,  756, 000 were processed in the EU between January and September 2016, 55 per cent of which were handled in Germany. Speaking to Die Welt, German Bundestag   Johannes Singhammer said the figures “[make] it clear that the refugee crisis in Germany has not been overcome. ” Die Welt said a number of those reported may already have been in the country prior to January 2016. Since Chancellor Angela Merkel’s invitation to over a million people to migrate en masse in September 2015, government systems were overwhelmed with many unable to make asylum applications for some months. The German newspaper reports in the first nine months of 2016, more than a quarter of a million, 272, 000, new migrants were registered on the nation’s systems. However, Denmark saw a sharp decrease in the number of asylum applications, falling from roughly 21, 000 in 2015 to 5, 300.  Denmark’s strict migrant legislation may account for this drop which includes shortening the duration of residence permits and limiting the number of family reunifications. The Danes have also enacted the ‘Jewellery Act’ whereby cash and valuables can be confiscated from migrants to offset the cost of their care in an effort to relieve the burden on Danish taxpayers. In December, Mr. Singhammer, member of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) the coalition partner of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) stated his fear that the number of Syrian migrants in Germany could double due to family reunification alone. He added, “The burden of family members’ immigration could be higher in the immediate future than the burden of newly arriving Syrian refugees. ”",0

Son Paul Hobbs said: “Come to think of it, dad has seemed a bit pissed off since a few years after I was born. “Maybe something happened near the start of the 20th century that annoyed him. “I suppose we could ask him but that might just make it worse.

Muallem went on to give the same account of the incident that Russia has insisted upon, claiming that Syrian warplanes “attacked an arms depot belonging to   Front,” which is  ’s affiliate in Syria. The Foreign Minister claimed the Nusra Front, ISIS, and other organizations “continue to store chemical weapons in urban and residential areas. ” He dismissed calls for an international investigation by saying Syria’s previous experience with “politicized” investigations was “not encouraging” because “they come out of Damascus with certain indications which then change at their headquarters. ” Walid also went out of his way to slam Turkey, evidently in response to Turkish denunciation of the attack in Idlib, and Turkey’s treatment of victims from the chemical weapons deployment.

It includes undeclared drone war begun post-9/11, Obama continuing what George Bush began, civilians harmed most of all. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia and other regional rogue states, backed by America and its NATO partners, began terror-bombing Houthi forces, falsely called terrorists. Casualties are multiples higher than officially reported, civilians ruthlessly slaughtered – war in Yemen another bonanza for US, UK, French and German weapons makers, along with war-profiteers from other countries. Earlier in October, Saudi warplanes terror-bombed a Sanaa Houthi funeral ceremony, killing and wounding hundreds of civilians – the single deadliest incident in over 18 months of fighting so far. Washington bears full responsibility. Riyadh shares it. Conflict continues raging, the Pentagon selecting targets for Saudi warplanes to terror-bomb. Over the weekend, a Saudi-led “coalition” airstrike targeted a prison and nearby administration buildings in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah, destroying facilities struck, massacring dozens, wounding many more victims, separately hitting Hodeidah’s port. Saudi military spokesman General Ahmed Asiri lied, claiming facilities struck were used as “a command and control center for (Houthi) operations.” Hours before the Hodeidah terror-bombing, Saudi warplanes massacred at least 18 civilians in Taiz, including 11 members of one family. Throughout months of fighting, Saudi warplanes terror-bombed schools, hospitals, residential areas, commercial marketplaces and other nonmilitary targets. Conflict resolution efforts failed because Washington, Riyadh and their rogue partners want war, not peace – holding an entire nation hostage to their viciousness, a severe humanitarian crisis taking unknown numbers of lives. Separately, on October 28, Saudi Arabia was overwhelmingly reelected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), a body infested with major human rights abusers. Heavy US pressure got General Assembly members to vote Russia off the HRC. Genocidal war on Yemen continues, the body failing to condemn the slaughter. It doesn’t promote human rights. It supports horrendous abuses committed by Washington and its imperial allies. Submit your review",0

By Fred Lucas 
Veterans must be given preference in securing federal jobs, according to long-standing laws, but hiring hasn’t always worked out in their favor. A federal audit found that on numerous occasions, agencies placed Obama administration political appointees into career government jobs with civil service protections—bypassing veterans. 
Much of the federal bureaucracy has turned against men and women who served the country in the military, said Darin Selnick, a retired Air Force captain and former official at the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
“There is a clear bias against veterans. They think veterans should start at the bottom like everyone else,” Selnick told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.

The state Duma will not pass a bill on fines for “superiority” machines — that is summer tires in the winter and Vice versa: according to our information, on 1 November, the Duma Council decided to establish an ad hoc working group on the revision of the initiative.

Originally planned to be introduced in 2014 by a group of senators and MPs at the meeting of 21 October, but the agenda was very intense, and until this subject is not reached. 
Then attracted great attention of the public document it was proposed to include in the agenda of the meeting on 2 November. But now his fate will be decided by the ad hoc working group. 
As reported by “MK” sources familiar with the situation, even at the last Duma Council the question arose about why the bill on amendments to the Code of administrative offences went through the Committee on transportation and construction and not through the profile for all of the bills offering to rule of the administrative code, the Committee on state construction and legislation. 
And here, according to another source, “MK”, November 1, the Council of the Duma the head of the Committee on transport and construction Yevgeny moskvichyov ( United Russia ) has proposed to establish a joint working group of representatives of the two committees, and to discuss again all disputed issues. 
We recall that the bill was discussed on amendment of the administrative code, which promised to be fine in 2 thousand rubles for violation of requirements of operation of tires and wheels. 
The Committee on transport and construction, proposing to support the project in the first reading, said that from 1 January 2015 entered into force the technical regulations of the Customs Union “On safety of wheeled vehicles”, one of which forbids to operate vehicles without winter tires in winter. But the timing of the entry into force of this regulation “was determined based on the training of owners of vehicles (especially large trucking companies) to the introduction of these rules, and also taking into account the possibility of domestic industrial enterprises to ensure that all vehicles operated on the roads of our country, winter tires”. 
The disadvantage of the bill, noted in the Committee ’s opinion, is the absence in it of provisions concerning the right of subjects of Federation to change the terms of the prohibition of winter tyres and tyres with spikes of snow. ",0

Why don’t we see if every night  —   and twice in the afternoon for 12 weeks  —   if a piece of theater could raise enough of a ruckus to discombobulate a man sitting in the Oval Office?”  “I don’t know, but I’d like to find out.

The      also assured that his show will include a message that will appeal to Republicans and middle America. “I have found that Republicans or conservatives often will come to my films in part because I speak the language of the Midwest the people who voted for Trump are my neighbors,” Moore said. “I’m always excited to talk to them. I’ve noticed since the election that people who voted for Trump will stop and talk to me on the street because before the election, I was the only liberal who said he was gonna win.

24798,Silicon Valley Techies Complain About ’Scraping By’ on Six-Figure Salaries - Breitbart,"Several Silicon Valley employees, including a software engineer for Twitter who made a $160, 000 salary, were mocked online after complaining about their living standards in an article for The Guardian. [In the article, entitled “Scraping by on six figures? Tech workers feel poor in Silicon Valley’s wealth bubble,” the employee complained that his   salary was “pretty bad” for the area.  “I didn’t become a software engineer to be trying to make ends meet,” proclaimed the employee. “Families are priced out of the market. ” “The biggest cost is his $3, 000 rent  —   which he said was ‘ultra cheap’ for the area  —   for a   house in San Francisco, where he lives with his wife and two kids,” reported The Guardian sympathetically. “He’d like a slightly bigger property, but finds himself competing with groups of twentysomethings happy to share accommodation while paying up to $2, 000 for a single room. ” “The prohibitive costs have displaced teachers, city workers, firefighters and other members of the middle class, not to mention   residents,” they continued. “Now techies, many of whom are among the highest 1% of earners, are complaining that they, too, are being priced out. ” The Guardian also covered other Silicon Valley employees in the piece who were earning “between $100, 000 and $700, 000 a year” but still allegedly had trouble “making ends meet. ” “One Apple employee was recently living in a Santa Cruz garage, using a compost bucket as a toilet. Another tech worker, enrolled in a coding bootcamp, described how he lived with 12 other engineers in a   apartment rented via Airbnb,” The Guardian reported. “It was $1, 100 for a fucking bunk bed and five people in the same room. One guy was living in a closet, paying $1, 400 for a ‘private room,’” one man complained, while a female employee added, “We make over $1m between us, but we can’t afford a house  …     This is part of where the American dream is not working out here. ” Several San Francisco residents mocked the employees for their complaints. “Scraping by in the Bay Area on a   salary sure must be difficult!” joked San Francisco Chronicle reporter Lizzie Johnson.

24799,Theresa May refuses to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia,"Foreign Policy During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia’s place at the UN Human Rights Council despite the regime’s atrocities in Yemen. 
During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
""The issues are being investigated… We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen,"" May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. 
Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK government’s contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. 
Corbyn also questioned May’s support for Saudi Arabia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will take place later this month. A Yemeni man stands on October 24, 2016 at the site of an air raid on a funeral ceremony that killed 140 people and wounded 525 on October 5. (Photo by AFP) 
London has repeatedly been blamed by human rights groups, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, for fueling the Yemeni war by supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons. 
Since the conflict began last year, the British government has approved more than £3 billion ($3.7 billion) in arms sales to the Saudis and military contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline. 
Yemen has been under almost daily airstrikes by Saudi Arabia since March 2015. International sources put the death toll from the aggression at almost 10,000. 
Rights groups have also condemned the Kingdom’s crackdown on dissent and prosecution of pro-reform activists. Loading ...",0

BRIDGEPORT, CT—Thinking back on how happy and untroubled he had been during that time and how different he feels in the present day, local man Jason Moulton, 52, reportedly paused Wednesday and nostalgically recalled the simpler era of 20 hours ago. “Everything seemed so much brighter back then before 9 p.m. last night—nothing like the way things are now,” said Moulton, wistfully reflecting on how, back before yesterday evening, things had seemed to make sense and the future appeared to hold endless promise. “America was a different place all those hours ago. Things were safer then, and the economy was strong—it was just a better time. But it’s all gone downhill ever since. We just don’t have the same values anymore.” Moulton then reportedly shook his head and said that while he would love for the country to get back to the good old days of November 8 and earlier, realistically he knew that would never happen.

24808,Reductress » This Little Girl’s Mind-Blowing Protest Speech Is Everything Her Mother Told Her to Say,"This Little Girl’s Mind-Blowing Protest Speech Is Everything Her Mother Told Her to Say Womanspiration - Nov 3, 2016 By: Editor SHARE: 
Seven-year-old Candace Bailey wowed everyone in the room when she gave a mind-blowing protest speech about climate change, just like her mother coached her to do. 

Little Candace addressed the New Mexico state legislature with an impassioned speech about the need for clean energy and a collective effort to reduce the effects of human consumption on the planet. Good job Candace—and good job, Candace’s mom, for telling her exactly what to say! 

Witnesses were impressed by the maturity of the local second grader and her ability to sound out big words. 


“I couldn’t believe she was able to memorize all that,” witness Anna Hines says. “It didn’t really change my mind, but she was so adorable up there on that podium!” 

Candace reportedly spoke about her own challenges, like turning the water off while she’s brushing her teeth, as well as the future world she hopes to live in. 

“When I grow up, I hope to live in a world where we can reduce carbon emissions and be a model for the rest of the world,” the seven-year-old said, inspiring the room with the beautiful words her mother wrote for her. 

“Her speech gave us all a lot to think about,” one state representative says. “Namely, how hard the mother must have worked to make this all happen.” 

“Does this kid even understand what a carbon emission is?” she added. Probably not! 

“I could see her mother sort of mouthing along the words as Candace was speaking,” friend of the family June Gordon says. “I don’t know why Breanne didn’t just speak herself. It would have been less jarring, that’s for sure.” 

Though Candace’s mother’s involvement is clear, the young girl is proud about standing up in public about climate change. 

“I hope the state legislature will listen to me, since I am the future,” Candace says. “Mom, did I say that right?” SHARE: ",0

24812,Here’s Proof That The Iowa Cop Killer Is A Trump Supporter,"Comments 
Many people have been wondering whether or not a white man known for waving Confederate flags at black teenagers and just murdered two cops is a Trump supporter. 
Grant Rodgers, a journalist for the Des Moines Register , did some investigating and found some pretty undeniable evidence that yes, Michael Greene Scott supported the Republican nominee for President. 
The house is Greene’s last listed address, which he shares with his mother. 
Greene turned himself into earlier today and is in custody after allegedly firing thirty or more shots into a parked patrol car, killing two police officers in Des Moines, Iowa. It is the second act of domestic terrorism to take place in the United States in the past day, coming just two hours after Trump supporters in Mississippi set a historically African-American church on fire and spray-painted “VOTE TRUMP” on it. 
Donald Trump has begun a movement, indeed – a movement of hatred and violence that has now lead to multiple deaths, thousands of dollars in property damage, and unquantifiable emotional trauma across the nation as Latinos, blacks, Muslims, and sexual assault survivors are forced to bear the brunt of the gaslit firestorm that Trump ignites with his bullying and his dog-whistles.

24820,BOOM: The “Clinton Double Standard” Brutally Exposed,"Pinterest 
From Sierra Marlee : Laws for thee, but not for me. 
The FBI’s Hillary Clinton decision may just make it impossible to prosecute anyone caught in wrongful possession of classified information. 
For instance, let us look at the case of Petty Officer First Class Kristian Saucier, who was discovered to have taken pictures of the inside of a classified U.S. nuclear submarine. He is making a plea for leniency based on the fact that former-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn’t see any jail time for getting caught in a similar situation. 
The 29-year-old man is to be sentenced Friday on the felony charge of “retaining national defense information without permission,” according to Politico . 
While it is clear that being in violation of this law calls for a sentence of 63-78 months, Saucier’s defense attorney claims that his client should only receive probation, based on precedent created by the FBI’s decision to not indict Hillary Clinton, despite acknowledging that she was in possession of classified emails on her home server. 
“In our case, Mr. Saucier possessed six (6) photographs classified as ‘confidential/restricted,’ far less than Clinton’s 110 emails,” Hogan wrote. “It will be unjust and unfair for Mr. Saucier to receive any sentence other than probation for a crime those more powerful than him will likely avoid.” 
There are distinctions in the two cases – for instance, Saucier plead guilty to the charge, admitting that he knew his actions were illegal, and destroying evidence after being confronted about his possession of the classified photos. However, it is clear that his will not be the last case to cite Hillary Clinton’s lack of jail-time as a reason for a criminal to go free. The FBI and federal government as a whole have opened up a can of worms that will potentially put all of America at risk. 
Will America be able to punish any federal employee or member of the military for gathering classified information, or with the FBI be forced to re-open the investigation into the Clinton server and recommend indictment of Hillary? 
This young man should absolutely go to jail for what he did, because he knew it was against the law, and I’m holding all federal employees to the same standard. There is no way one can become Secretary of State and not be told what the parameters and limitations are when exchanging classified information. 
If they choose to jail this man, but excuse the actions of the Clintons, there are going to be a lot of angry Americans come November, and it could potentially lead to a Trump presidency.

24821,Congressman Backs Libertarian Presidential Candidate in Campaign First - The New York Times,"Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia says he plans to vote for the Libertarian Party’s presidential ticket, becoming the first member of Congress to express support for Gary Johnson’s   campaign. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Rigell, a Republican, said he had settled on Mr. Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, as the best option available. “I’ve always said I will not vote for Donald Trump and I will not vote for Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Rigell said. “I’m going to vote for the Libertarian candidate. ” Mr. Rigell is the second Republican member of Congress this week to back a candidate other than Mr. Trump in the presidential race the other, Representative Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Both Mr. Rigell and Mr. Hanna are retiring from Congress at the end of their current terms. But Mr. Rigell’s support for the Libertarian ticket may be more portentous: Mr. Johnson and his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, have been seeking to woo disaffected Republicans who view Mr. Trump as unacceptable. Should additional Republican officeholders follow Mr. Rigell in backing the   ticket, it could help Mr. Johnson gain credibility as an alternative choice. A former car dealer who represents a moderate district on the Virginia coast, Mr. Rigell said he expected more congressional Republicans and local Republican officials to break openly with the party’s presidential candidate as the election draws nearer. Many Republican candidates have asked him for advice, Mr. Rigell said, about separating themselves from Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Rigell has been saying since the winter that he could not support Mr. Trump. “When their own conscience is seared by some statement that Trump has made, I have encouraged them to be direct and also, in a timely manner, repudiate what he said,” Mr. Rigell said. “People will respect it if you have a reason and you put it out there. ” Mr. Rigell said he still considered himself a Republican. But that would change, he said, if the Republican Party were to become synonymous with Mr. Trump and his ideas in a lasting way. “Then I’m done,” Mr. Rigell said, “and I’ll be an independent. ”",0
24822,BREAKING: Trump Was RIGHT,"Pinterest 
GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been proven right once again. This time it has to do with a prediction he made about Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. 
On Friday, the FBI announced in a letter to Congress that they were reopening the Clinton email investigation in light of emails unearthed in their investigation of disgraced former New York Democrat Congressman Anthony Weiner’s sexting an underage girl. 
On Aug. 29, not long after top Clinton aide Huma Abedin announced that she and Weiner were separating, Trump released a statement. “Huma is making a very wise decision,” Trump said. 
“I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” he added. “Who knows what he learned and who he told?” Trump, in July: ""I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.” https://t.co/qICt22PfzM

— Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) October 28, 2016 
The Washington Examiner reported : 
After the bombshell report about the FBI’s reopened investigation first emerged Friday afternoon, the New York Times reported that the “new emails” that have led investigators to take a second look at the case were discovered on devices seized from Abedin and Weiner’s home during a separate investigation into Weiner’s alleged sexting with a minor. 
Comey, in a letter to eight Republican congressional committee chairs, did not clarify what emails led him to revisit the Clinton case. He said only that investigators had recently briefed him on “the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” 
“And I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information,” Comey wrote. 
Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire on Friday he hopes the FBI will “right the ship” after the agency declined to indict Clinton in July, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent. 
Trump has been proven right to the point that the mainstream media even had to admit how right he was. That’s saying something. 
It will be very interesting to see what the FBI has found/will find in their investigation. The FBI certainly could be reopening the investigation to somehow help Clinton — perhaps there’s an angle that makes this the better option — or maybe there is something so potentially damning that even they couldn’t figure out a good way to bury it. That seems fairly unlikely, but it’s hard to say. 
Once again, Trump has been proven right and that’s largely because he gets it. Trump has called himself a “common sense conservative” and the many times he’s been proven right on the campaign trail, along with the many policy positions he’s taken that show that he is in touch with Americans and has common sense, prove this label correct.",0

MUNICH — World War II marked a crucial turning point for U.S. empire building and the growth of global capitalism, according to the historical analysis of noted political philosopher and scholar Noam Chomsky.
Chomsky examined U.S. domination of world affairs in “ Who Owns The World? ,” a speech he delivered at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2012. In May, he published a book, “Who Rules The World?,” which examines similar themes.
Watch ‘ Noam Chomsky: Who Owns the World? Resistance and Ways Forward ‘ :
He revisited the topic in a recent conversation with Zain Raza, a senior editor at the independent media outlet acTVism Munich. An excerpt from that conversation was published on Tuesday as part of acTVism Munich’s “Reexamining History” series .
Much of the U.S. government’s global strategy both during and after World War II was based on a plan proposed by the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations , which Chomsky describes as the “major, non-governmental institution concerned with foreign affairs” whose membership “draws from a wide range of elite elements, business, politics, academics, and so on.”
Between 1939 and 1945, the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations held regular strategy meetings to develop a post-war economic plan. These meetings led to proposal under which the United States would dominate a vast swath of the globe that came to be known as the “Grand Area,” Chomsky said. Explaining that the “Grand Area” would include “the Western Hemisphere,” Chomsky said:
“It included the former British Empire, which the U.S. was intending to largely take over, maybe Britain would be a junior partner. And as much of Europe, the commercial and industrial center of Europe, as much of that as possible. Certainly Western Europe, its industrial, technological, commercial center.”
Within the “Grand Area,” Chomsky continued, “the United States would have pretty much complete economic and political control.”
With the collapse of the German economy after the war, and amid the beginnings of the Cold War with Russia and China, the United States was in a unique position to implement this plan. Chomsky said:
“The war was very beneficial to the U.S. economy. Its industrial production virtually quadrupled, wartime spending ended the Depression, which had not been ended before — enormous stimulus to the economy. The technology that was developed just laid the basis for post-war growth. In that context ‘Grand Area’ planning of the kind I described was by no means unrealistic.”
Far from a Pentagon pipedream, the “Grand Area” became concrete U.S. foreign policy, and its effects linger to this day.
“If you look at the policies implemented and developed in the early post-war period, they follow these prescriptions pretty closely,” Chomsky said.
As Chomsky and other historians have observed, Washington’s plans to dominate the “Grand Area” led directly to the Vietnam War. They were also crucial in the development of the International Monetary Fund , which continues to disrupt global economies for the benefit of multinational corporations and the military-industrial complex.

24829,Bronx Assemblyman Files Complaint Against the Police - The New York Times,"A New York State assemblyman from the Bronx has filed a formal complaint against the police, claiming he was roughly handled by an officer after asking about police activity in his district. The assemblyman, Michael Blake, said that while he was attending a family event at the Gouverneur Morris Houses at East 169th Street and Washington Avenue, he saw a woman in handcuffs and approached the officers involved to discuss the situation. Moments later, Mr. Blake said, an argument broke out behind him. In a phone interview on Sunday, Mr. Blake said that as he rushed toward the confrontation a uniformed officer   him, lifted him off the ground and “slammed” him against a gate outside the housing complex. “It was not a pleasant interaction,” said Mr. Blake, 33, a freshman Democrat who represents part of the South Bronx. The Police Department confirmed that a sergeant and an officer were responding to an argument between neighbors shortly after 3:30 p. m. on Saturday. The police said that the assemblyman approached the sergeant from behind, without identifying himself, and “grabbed” his shoulder. A police spokeswoman said the officer, perceiving “a possible threat to the sergeant,” moved Mr. Blake about five feet and put him against a fence. Then, a captain from the Police Service Area patrolling the complex intervened after recognizing Mr. Blake as an elected official, the police said. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Police Department said that it “has been made aware of Mr. Blake’s allegations and will be conducting a review of the incident. ” Mr. Blake said he did not have time to identify himself as an elected official before he was grabbed, but confirmed that more senior officers intervened immediately and told the officer to let him go. The officer released him and was urged to apologize by superiors, the assemblyman said. And while the officer did offer an apology, Mr. Blake said, it fell short of an acknowledgment of fault. Mr. Blake said the officer claimed to be in “a protective mode” over his partner and added that “if the situation presented itself, he would do the same thing again. ” The assemblyman said that he did not recall touching the sergeant but that even if he had done so, “in the heat of the second, that didn’t justify what happened. ” Mr. Blake filed a formal notice Saturday night with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, claiming excessive force, something he thought may have been related to his race. “I can appreciate from the officer’s perspective that if they perceive someone is a threat to their fellow officer, regardless of race, they would act out in some way,” Mr. Blake said. “But I do believe that the level of response was far heightened because I’m a black man  —   no question. ” The use of excessive force by the police, particularly in relation to   has been a pressing local and national issue, highlighted by a series of   episodes across the country. Mr. Blake, said that he chose to make the complaint public because, “too often, people are quiet when these things happen” and “leaders have a responsibility to communicate to the community about how to take positive action. ” “I know that the only way that this is going to get better is if we are transparent and we talk about what we experience and what we learn, and how changes need to occur on all sides,” Mr. Blake said.",0

24834,"Former Cowboy Tony Romo: Now Lining Up Behind the Golf Ball, Fails in US Open Bid - Breitbart","Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo will be on his couch watching the U. S. Open next month along with millions of other golf fans, after failing to qualify for America’s most prestigious golf championship by shooting a   par 75, six strokes above the cut line. [The pride of the Dallas Cowboys didn’t even come close. Romo tied for 40th place out of 107 entrants in a regional qualifier at Split Rail Links and Golf Club in Aledo, Texas.   The        passer, joined about 9500 other golfers in their bid to    at Erin Hills, the site of the 2017 U. S. Open to be played June   in Wisconsin. It is the first time the tournament will be played at the gorgeous and demanding venue, and a first time for the state of Wisconsin to hold the Open. The golfers will be weaned down to about 70 players when the tournament commences. Romo has long prided himself on his golf, and plays to about a plus 3. 3 handicap, which is competitive with the majority of professional golfers. In 2009, Golf Digest ranked Romo as the number one golfer of professional athletes who doesn’t make their living playing golf. Nevertheless, it appears his game needs a bit of work if he plans on going pro. Jordan Spieth, a good friend of Romo’s, in 2015 claimed he was spotting the     a side and stuffing his wallet with Romo’s cash. In 2015 when sports commentator Jim Rome asked the 2015 U. S. Open winner how much he’s won from Romo, Spieth remarked: “I don’t know. I can’t even count that high. He’s a good friend and a great competitor so we have fun out there. ” Romo wouldn’t be the first NFL quarterback to join the ranks of professional golfers if he were to sharpen his skills enough to qualify as a professional tour player. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and 1970 NFL MVP, John Brodie, played on the Champions Tour from  . Brodie, who once threw for 30 touchdowns in one season, won the 1991 Security Pacific Senior Classic and captured 12   finishes during his golfing campaign. Brodie once said about the sport that many ridicule as not really being a sport, but a game:  Some critics claim golf is only a walk in the park and cannot be called an athletic event  …    . I think golf is the most demanding sport of them all in asking coordination from mind and body. It involves more qualities than any other game. Football is repetition. After many hours of work with teammates, you react by reflex and instinct. There are so many factors depending on more than one person.   …     I learned a lot on the tour. Possibly most important, I learned a lot about myself. NBC Sports reported that in 2010 Romo made it to the sectional qualifying, but had to pull out due to his obligations with the Cowboys. Also, in 2005 he qualified as an alternate for sectional qualifying. ",0

In response to concerns over the US sending 300+ Marines to the Russian border, in response to the UK sending 800 troops to the Russian border, in response to all the NATO countries sending small contingents of troops and equipment to the Russian borders we've heard one narrative consistently: ""Oh, that's not enough troops to indicate there's anything serious happening."" My how 2 year's passage of time has changed the narrative. A top Ukrainian army officer said a ""full-scale invasion"" of his country was under way Thursday, as a U.S. official said up to 1,000 Russian troops had crossed Ukraine's southern border to fight alongside pro-Russian rebels. Russia's military actions in eastern Ukraine ""must cease immediately,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday. ""I'm extremely concerned by mounting evidence that Russian troops have made large-scale incursions into South Eastern Ukraine, completely disregarding the sovereignty of a neighbor,"" Cameron said. ""The international community has already warned Russia that such provocative actions would be completely unacceptable and illegal."" Yet another example of the west's never ending ""NATO good, Russia evil"" narrative. When Russia involves 1,000 troops in assisting a region which requested their help (Crimea, or more recently Syria) the western leaders come unglued... but when the west does the same, it's ""exercises"" and ""no cause for any concern.""

24836,Marrying couple installs Gift Envelope Scanner at wedding hall door to check for ₹500 & ₹1000 notes,"Marrying couple installs Gift Envelope Scanner at wedding hall door to check for ₹500 & ₹1000 notes Posted on Tweet 
Chiranjeevi and Soubhagyavati, a couple who will be entering wedlock tomorrow, have undertaken a first-of-its-kind, unique feat – the bride and groom have installed an X-ray scanning device at the entrance of their wedding hall, to scan guests’ gift envelopes for the recently discontinued ₹500 & ₹1000 notes. (Image via Ephemera Studio) 
“With great difficulty, we’ve had to put all the wedding preparations on hold, stand in queues to deposit old currency for new legal tender and without even a day’s break, resume the preparations and planning. All thanks to demonetization. At the end of it all, the last thing we want is another set of old currency notes which we’ve to take to the banks for another exchange stint. We don’t want to be loitering around banks when should be honeymooning in exotic locations. In order to prevent this, we wish to inform all our guests that we have installed an envelope scanning device right at the entrance. You will be asked to pass your envelope through the scanner. If your envelopes are found to contain old currency, they will be handed right back to you. We’d rather you congratulate us without any gifts, than give us invalid currency,” Soubhagyavati, the bride-to-be told The UnReal Times . 
While the move has already reduced the anticipated guest number by the hundreds, the couple is determined to stand by their idea. “A lot of people have already informed us about ‘urgent meetings,’‘spouses unwell,’ and other things right after we announced this development. That’s still okay. We’re not yet done though. We’re also thinking of setting up an online transfer kiosk – so that people can swipe their credit cards and transfer money to us electronically, on the spot, if they really wish to gift us money,” an animated groom-to-be, Chiranjeevi added. 
The couple’s move won praise from across the border. “What a great idea! Pity I didn’t do this even in one of my weddings. The next time I marry, I surely should emulate this,” an amazed PTI chief and former world-cup winning Pakistani cricket captain Imran Khan exclaimed. Bollywood actor Kamaal R Khan, however, was indifferent. “Makes no difference to me, I anyway put only ₹2 coins in all envelopes whenever I attend weddings,” the Deshdrohi actor chuckled. MNS Chief Raj Thackeray lauded the move, while also suggesting that those caught gifting such notes be made to gift an equal amount to the Indian army, by cheque. 
While many other wedding couples have been scampering all over the country in search of scanners, some have urged banks to grant them permission to conduct the weddings in their own offices. “It’s extremely efficient this way – the moment we get old currency, we exchange it then and there. No loss of time. Plus it’s booming business for the banks too,” one such groom said. Tweet About Ashwin Kumar

Be sure to vote today if you haven’t already! Even if you dislike the Presidential choices, downticket races are important. 
And an overdue note: Thanks SO much to those of you who came out to meet me in Dallas last week. We had a group of 30-35 attend, including someone from Iowa and a libertarian who declared that NC was one of only three non-libertarian sites that he reads. We have a lively discussion and I think everyone had a good time. 
The organizer of the evening, Steve in Dallas, circulated a list for people who wanted to be on a Dallas Meetup listserv. Some participants had already left by then, so if you missed the opportunity to sign up and would like to be included or missed this meetup but want to be kept in the loop, please ping me at yves_at_nakedcapitalism.com and I’ll send your coordinates to Steve. Please put “Dallas Meetup” in the subject line. 
At the end of the evening, Steve raised an important issue: he’s tried getting friends and family members to read NC and other independent media, with much less success than he’d like. I volunteered that most people don’t want to question authority, and that going outside the mainstream media was tantamount to admitting that the traditional press was wrong, or doing a superficial job. 
This chart might help get traditional media loyalists to consider that reporting isn’t what it used to be

24839,Should The Royal Monarchy Be Abolished? UK Taxpayers Think So,"Should The Royal Monarchy Be Abolished? UK Taxpayers Think So Nov 20, 2016 1 0 
The first few questions we should ask ourselves is “what point is there to even having a monarchy?” Additionally, “what good do they provide for the people of the UK and world? What is their purpose?” 
United Kingdom taxpayers are asking themselves these questions and more amid fresh calls for the monarchy to be dissolved. Personal wealth estimated at over £300m, yet they want taxpayers to pay for the building? 
The Independent reports that Buckingham Palace is in need of repair, which is projected to be a 10 year project and will cost around £400 million-all from taxpayer money. The British government agreed to the increase in taxpayer funding, which is set to increase by 66%. 
Those fighting for the abolishment of the monarchy are upset that the Royal Crown wants the public to pay for the renovation, all the while the Crown has an estimated worth of over £300 million, and owning land around the world estimated at a worth of over £7 billion. 
Graham Smith, who is the chief executive of the Anti-Monarch Group Republic said: 
This is an absolute disgrace. An indictment of the Queen’s scandalous mismanagement of royal finances over six decades. MPs have repeatedly called on the Palace to fund repairs by opening up to tourists all year round and they’ve refused. If the royals can’t look after the buildings and raise their own revenue to fund maintenance, it’s time to give them up. 
The royals cost the taxpayer over £334 million per year and that keeps going up. We need independent inquiry and full disclosure of their spending. The monarchy’s costs need to be stripped right back, put the institution on a proper budgetary footing and allow parliament to approve the budget each year.” 
Smith is right. Why is the cost to fund the royal family going up each year when they are worth over billions of pounds already? Additionally, we must ask why the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Keeper of the Privy Purse continue to agree to this increase in funding. 
Again, this is yet another example of how governments and the people who really run them, do not have any interest in bettering the world for all, but only for themselves. 
Furthermore, it is well known throughout the world how the Crown still owns the United States and that the IRS is nothing but a royal corporation, where U.S. taxpayer money conveniently works it way back to the top. 
The world also knows about the massive, pedophilia ring that the elites in London have been and continue to be involved in, thanks to 60 Minutes Australia (a mainstream source that did an incredible job investigating the still unsolved story). 
Lastly, we must all continue to declare our sovereignty from such oppressive, cunning and secretive cults. We are living human beings and no longer need rulers, especially those who continue to rule with such a dark agenda. 
While this story is still developing and the Crown will likely not go quietly into the night, humanity is waking up quickly and we can expect more people throughout the UK, as well as the world, to reclaim financial and social freedom. Perhaps Brexit was just the beginning.",0
24840,Uncollected Pallet Wondering What It Did Wrong,"0 Add Comment 
A NEGLECTED wooden pallet is said to be suffering from severe self esteem issues after it failed to be selected for a nearby bonfire by local youths, WWN understands. 
The pallet, left unattended for weeks behind a Lidl was not one of 70 pallets chosen to form part of a structurally suspect bonfire pile on a field in the Waterford area of Europe, prompting the pallet to spiral into an existential spiral which saw it question its own self worth. 
“I don’t know what I did wrong, but… I’m obviously hideous,” the pallet shared, which until last month had a family of 400 cans of Polish beer living on top of it. 
“You see the lads coming, pulling shapes and you think finally, I’ll feel special, feel wanted, but they never chose me. I just wanted to be doused in petrol and consumed by a raging hot fire, like any other of my kind,” added the pallet, who admitted at least a third of him was moderately soggy after being discarded in a puddle. 
“Ugh, what’s the point anymore, it’s going to rain so much between now and next Halloween, I’ll be rotten and unlovable by then,” the pallet concluded, full of anguish. 
There is some hope for the pallet, however, as a local hipster restaurant which has just opened in the city needs something to serve its food on that isn’t a plate.",0

24842,Thousands Of Buffalo Appear At Site Of Standing Rock Protest [Watch],"By Amanda Froelich at trueactivist.com
During a standoff between riot police and peaceful protesters, a herd of buffalo appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp.
Yesterday, tensions between law enforcement workers and peaceful protestors with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe escalated. A series of standoffs resulted in “protectors” being maced, shot with rubber bullets, tasered, and even attacked with sound and concussion cannons. Ultimately, 117 people were arrested in the plight to stop the four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from being constructed.
After months of similar struggle to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri river, opposers of the DAPL were blessed today when a herd of buffalo appeared from nowhere. While mass arrests, macing, and beatings from batons took place, a stampede of bison appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. Reportedly, a cry of joy erupted from the crowd, as protectors have been praying for help from the American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate) during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen.
As UsUncut relays , the Native American culture honors the Tatanka Oyate as a symbol of sacrifice. Its appearance is reportedly being hailed as a gift from the Great Spirit.
Despite impressive attention being given to the protesting of the Dakota Access Pipeline by alternative media sites , activists on the frontlines, and even celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Shailene Woodley , little is being done in Washington D.C. The tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and to stop the mistreatment of the indigenous who assert their ownership of the land due to a 1881 treaty.",0

24849,Washington Recruit Al Qaeda To Help Oust Assad From Syria,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in Middle East , News // 0 Comments 
Washington has authorised a CIA program of training and arming Al Qaeda in order to help them oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
According to various reports, a huge new effort to supply weapons to so-called ‘moderate opposition’ groups in Syria is underway, as the U.S. finds themselves unable to defend themselves against Russian and Syrian air power and artillery. Recommended 
The US have announced a strategic partnership with al-Qaeda in order to overthrow the Syrian government and oust President Assad. (2 hours ago) 
Southfront.org reports: 
The secret CIA program of training and arming ‘moderate terrorists’ has been the core of American strategy, aiming to overthrow Assad and set a puppet government in Syria, since the start of the war. Nonetheless, the Obama administration is likely set to postponed the resumption and expansion of this program and to pass the need to make a decision to next president. T 
he US leadership is not ready to make the decision now because the recent military developments have shown that despite all money spending, supplies and CIA efforts, Washington still cannot rely on the moderate terrorists as a clearly pro-US force on the ground. Every US attempt to separate secular militant groups from jihadi factions, at least for PR needs, have failed. 
And the recently created New Syrian Army (NSyA) has shown an impotence in clashes with ISIS. The US propaganda campaign to discredit Russian-Syrian-Iranian operations to liberate Aleppo faced a significant problem – massive civilian casualties during the Mosul offensive, supported by the US-led coalition. 
In this case, open and massive supplies of arms and munitions to the terrorist groups in Syria could lead to significant loses for Washington in political and PR terms and will hardly lead to strengthening of the US influence on the Syrian conflict. Recommended Pentagon Announce They Are Arming Al Qaeda To Oust Assad 
The Pentagon has announced that it is protecting and arming Al Qaeda/Al Nusra jihadists in Syria, in a last gasp effort to overthrow Assad. You read that correctly - the U.S. is now in coalition with Al Qaeda in a foreign war. (2 hours ago) 
If the US administration avoids to do this, Moscow, Damascus and Tehran will fully take the initiative in the war that would also lead to negative effects to the US influence in the Middle East. 
So, most likely, Washington will make a compromise decision to allow its regional allies – Saudi Arabia or Qatar – to supply limited numbers of man-portable air-defense systems to the so-called ‘opposition’, even if this opposition is al-Nusra Front. 
At the same time, the US-controlled media and diplomats will continue to put pressure on Syria, Russia and Iran over alleged civilian casualties in Aleppo city and ignore the humanitarian situation in Iraq. 
It will not allow the terrorists to re-take the initiative in the war but will buy time until the new US president comes into the office and start to impellent own strategy in the region.",0

24859,"Aleksei Navalny, Putin Critic, Says He’ll Run for President of Russia - The New York Times","MOSCOW  —   Aleksei A. Navalny, the most vocal critic of the Kremlin, announced on Tuesday his intention to run for president of Russia, though he is facing a court trial that could make him ineligible to participate in the campaign. “There have been no true elections in Russia since 1996, and this is one of the reasons of our plight,” Mr. Navalny said in a video statement, posted on his new campaign website. “I will participate in the election, and I will fight for victory. ” Apart from Mr. Navalny, only Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal party Yabloko, has declared his intention to run for the post. President Vladimir V. Putin has deflected questions about his own candidacy, saying it is too early to talk about it. But he is widely expected to run and, in light of his soaring approval ratings and control over the news media, is expected to win. The vote is scheduled to take place in March 2018. A lawyer by training, Mr. Navalny, 40, emerged as Russia’s most prominent opposition politician on the wave of public protests that followed parliamentary elections in 2011, seen by many as flawed. But as Mr. Navalny’s popularity was surging, Russian investigators got busy, filing a number of criminal cases that rights advocates have dismissed as politically motivated. In 2013, a court in the provincial Russian town of Kirov convicted Mr. Navalny on charges of embezzling timber worth $500, 000 from a   company and sentenced him to five years in prison. A few months later, the sentence was suspended but the criminal conviction barred Mr. Navalny from running for office  —   the outcome that Mr. Navalny and others say was the government’s goal from the beginning. In the meantime, Mr. Navalny garnered more than 27 percent of the vote in a race for mayor of Moscow, a better result than any other open critic of the Kremlin in a major election since Mr. Putin assumed office in 1999. That Mr. Navalny was even allowed to run was seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to make the election look more legitimate. In November, Russia’s Supreme Court overturned Mr. Navalny’s criminal conviction after the European Court of Human Rights ruled in February that Russian courts had violated his right to a fair trial. While Mr. Navalny is free for the moment to campaign, the criminal case will be retried by a court in Kirov, which could reinstate the conviction and again bar him from office. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told RBC, a Russian news website, that the Kremlin had no comment on Mr. Navalny’s announcement. Over the years, Mr. Navalny has repeatedly accused Mr. Putin and members of his inner circle of rampant corruption, and has been tolerated as long as he does not seem to pose a serious threat. In his statement, Mr. Navalny promised to raise the issue of official corruption during the campaign. “The Kremlin and the government are only worried about solving their own financial issues,” Mr. Navalny said in the video. “I will discuss what everybody is silent about, but what has to be said for a long time. ”",0

26 Oct, 2016 26  
During a radio interview, comic legend and political pundit Jackie Mason joked that the only time Hillary Clinton is not lying “is when her mouth is not moving.” “And even then, she is probably lying because she’s probably sitting there thinking of the next lie she is going to tell,” he added.
 
Mason claimed that Clinton is so untrustworthy that she likely couldn’t land a job as an “attendant in the ladies’ room because they would be afraid that she would steal the towels or the napkins. Even the toilet paper wouldn’t be safe from her.”
Mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.
Listen to the interview here: 

He continued:
Do you think that if she went for any other job besides the presidency that anyone would hire her anywhere? If you saw her resume which is a resume of accomplishing nothing and running from the police three-quarters of her life. She is always either indicted or almost indicted or about to be indicted. Her whole life spent fleeing from the Justice Departments of different countries. Now, this yenta, do you think she would be able to get any other job? …
Would you think they would hire her as a chambermaid? Do you know what all those sheets and pillowcases are worth? Do you think they would trust her with it? After they found out the history of her life. Let’s be honest about it, if you went on a vacation would you let her watch your house while you went on vacation? Would you expect to come back and find anything still there?

24867,"500,000 People Sign Petition Asking Electoral College to Pick Clinton as President Instead of Trump","  500,000 People Sign Petition Asking Electoral College to Pick Clinton as President Instead of Trump The petition, launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to “ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.” Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation’s popular vote.   11, 2016 A petition on Change.org calling for the Electoral College to elect Hillary Clinton as President has earned over half of the signatures needed for it to be sent to the governing body. EDITOR’S NOTE: As stupid as this seems on the surface, at this point, I am not taking anything for granted. Donald Trump voters across America need to be made aware of this, and even now be working against it. Remember that with the Clintons, it’s never over. Ever. And as Christopher Stevens and Vince Foster will tell you, these people will stop at nothing. And please be forewarned, while this petition strategy is far-fetched, it is not impossible. The petition , launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to “ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.” Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation’s popular vote . The Electoral College – which was first introduced in 1804 – is comprised of 538 electors. Each state’s number of electors is decided by its number of members in Congress, which is dependent on the state’s population. So, when American citizens cast their ballots, they aren’t directly voting for president – they’re voting for electors. This year, Trump took 279, to Clinton’s 228. Petition circulates for Clinton presidency: Most states use a “winner-take-all” system when it comes to electoral votes, although there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote a certain way. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., do, however, “bind” their electors to vote for the promised candidate on Dec. 19 – in this case, Trump. In many cases, “faithless electors” are forced to pay a fine if they vote against the popular choice. Understanding what a “Faithless Elector” is: 
In order for Hillary’s supporters to be successful, they will need to sway a significant number of the Electoral College to become “faithless electors”. This video will make it clear what exactly that is and how the process works. Maine and Nebraska follow a different method , called the congressional district method, which allots two electoral votes to the popular vote winner, and additional votes for each congressional district won by the candidates. Crying Hillary Voters Compilation: Faithless electors have not ever reversed the presidency. The Change.org petition, which was at over 500,000 signatures on Thursday afternoon, said that Clinton supporters would be happy to pay any fees accrued by those who choose to be faithless electors. “Mr. Trump is unfit to serve,” the petition claimed. “His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.” source  ",0
24868,Trump bored now,"09-11-16 DONALD Trump is bored of politics and wants to do something else now. The 70-year-old president-elect spent almost 20 minutes pretending to listen to a security briefing from the CIA, before telling the US Army to build a golf course on the moon. He said: “I get it, I’m the boss. Sure, Congress, whatever. But when do I get an eagle to perch on my arm? “Anyway, I want create the most beautiful golf course the moon has ever seen. Beautiful, just beautiful. You won’t believe it.” Drumming his fingers on his desk, he added: “Okay, what else? Can I pass a law today? Maybe annex some territory? “Hey, imagine how impressed Putin would be if I defeated Isis this afternoon. “Let’s do that. Yeah, we’re going to do that. We are going to do that.”",0
24871,BREAKING: FBI Director Comey Is Now Under Federal Investigation For Hillary Smear,"Comments 
It is almost certain that the United States Office Of Special Counsel (OSC) has opened an investigation into FBI Director James Comey over his questionable decision to reignite the Hillary Clinton email scandal just a week before the election. 
The OSC is a permanent independent federal investigative and prosecution agency that acts as an internal watchdog for federal employees. While the OSC refuses to confirm the truth, they always look in to inquiries. 
“It’s OSC’s longstanding policy not to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation In general, OSC opens a case after receiving a complaint.” The complaint was made by Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer. 
“The F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election” he wrote in the New York Times. 
If found guilty, OSC investigations usually lead to a rapid loss of employment. 
Director Comey certainly deserves to lose his job after throwing a wrench into the election, bowing to pressure from House Republicans and releasing an unnecessary and extremely misleading “update” on the new emails discovered in Anthony Weiner’s cellphone that have nothing to do Hillary Clinton, her email server, or the election at large – all the while refusing to release the results of their likely inquiries into Republican nominee Donald Trump’s relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.",0
24872,Erdogan Warns Europeans on Their Safety as Tensions Rise With West - The New York Times,"KASTAMONU, Turkey  —   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey warned Europeans on Wednesday that they would no longer be able to walk safely in the street if Western politicians continued with perceived provocations against Turkish leaders. Mr. Erdogan’s warning turned out to be awkwardly timed, coming hours before a deadly attack outside the British Parliament. In a Twitter post written in English, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, quickly condemned the assault in London, noting that Turkey had “suffered similar attacks many times. ” Mr. Erdogan’s comments were a response to restrictions placed on his surrogates in European countries including Germany and the Netherlands, where they have been barred from holding political rallies in support of a referendum in which Turks will decide whether to expand their president’s powers. “If you go on behaving like that, tomorrow nowhere in the world, none of the Europeans, Westerners will be able to walk in the streets in peace, safely,” Mr. Erdogan said at a meeting in Ankara, the capital. The outburst was his latest attempt to rally nationalist voters before the tightly contested referendum. In Germany alone, 1. 4 million residents have the right to vote in the referendum on April 16. Amid fears he might lose, Mr. Erdogan and his allies have issued   diatribes against European countries, a tactic that they hope will play well among swing voters. In previous days, he has frequently accused German and Dutch politicians of Nazism. He has also suggested that he might scrap the accord that restricted the passage of migrants through Turkey and send a new wave of migrants to Europe. Western news organizations have been quick to report on these provocations, which are then read and condemned by European leaders  —   creating a feedback loop that in turn gives Mr. Erdogan more excuses to criticize Europe and to begin the cycle afresh. The tactic appeals to some Turkish voters, including many of those who attended a rally on Wednesday in Kastamonu in northern Turkey, where Mr. Erdogan headed immediately after speaking in Ankara. “He defends our country against the whole world,” said Hasan Birgun, 59, a retired salesman in Kastamonu. “Until Erdogan, our leaders were just standing meekly in the outside world. ” Hopes that the dispute would ease were raised on Tuesday, after Mr. Erdogan’s party canceled plans to send more lawmakers to campaign in Germany. But the president’s inflammatory comments on Wednesday suggested those hopes were premature. In Turkey on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the Norwegian ambassador after Norway granted refuge to four Turkish asylum seekers accused by Turkey of being involved in the  coup attempt in July, Reuters reported.",0
24874,Poll: 50% of Russians fear US-Syria-Russia standoff could spark WW3,"Videos Poll: 50% of Russians fear US-Syria-Russia standoff could spark WW3 Just over half – 52 percent – of Russians said they approve of their country’s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Be Sociable, Share! 
Almost half of all respondents in a recent Russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West caused by the ongoing crisis in Syria could develop into a global military conflict. 
The share of those who see the probability of World War Three in the near future as high or very high is now at 48 percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise 42 percent of society, the privately-owned public opinion research center Levada reported on Monday. The remaining 10 percent of respondents said they couldn’t give a simple answer to the question. 
When researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that Russia and the West would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis, 35 percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely. Thirty-nine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and 26 percent said that they couldn’t answer the question. 
Just over half – 52 percent – of Russians said they approve of their country’s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Just under a quarter – 23 percent – couldn’t answer the question about their personal view on the subject. Those who thought that Russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided 49 percent against 28 percent respectively, with 24 percent finding the question too difficult to answer. 
The level of awareness about the situation in Syria and the Russian Air Force operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists there remained fairly high. Eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in Syria and 64 percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue. Just under a fifth – 17 percent – said that they were not interested in news about Syria. 
A similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent Levada Center showed that over 70 percent of Russian citizens supported the air operations against IS terrorists in Syria, and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for Russia to support the government of Syria’s democratically-elected President Bashar Assad. 
A different poll conducted earlier this month by the state-run research center VTSIOM showed that 73 percent of Russians believed that Western criticism of the air force’s counter-terrorism operation in Aleppo, Syria, was ungrounded and prejudiced. Only 6 percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Russian military have some basis in reality. 
Russia first deployed an air force contingent in Syria in 2015, after receiving a request for military help from the Syrian government, which is currently battling Islamic State and affiliated groups. Russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in Syria on September 30, 2015. Their work has aided the Syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country.

24882,ISIS Claims Responsibility for Killing of French Police Officer - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   A police captain was fatally stabbed and his companion was also killed at their home in a small town northwest of Paris on Monday evening, and within hours the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the murders. The police captain, who was not otherwise identified, was outside his home in Magnanville when he was stabbed by an unidentified assailant, who appeared to have then entered the house and took the captain’s companion and    son hostage, according to a statement on the website of the French Interior Ministry and a statement from President François Hollande. Members of an elite French police unit arrived and raided the home. They fatally shot the attacker, found the woman dead and rescued the boy. The statement added that the woman was an employee of the Interior Ministry. A statement issued in Arabic by the Amaq News Agency, which is linked to the Islamic State, said: “Islamic State fighter kills deputy chief of the police station in the city of Les Mureaux and his wife with blade weapons,” according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist websites. It is the second attack during Ramadan this year that has been tied to the Islamic State. The first was the shooting on Sunday in Orlando, Fla. in which 49 died, making it the worst mass shooting in American history. Before he was killed by the police, the gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims dedicated to fasting and prayer, has historically been a time when both Al Qaeda and now the Islamic State have escalated attacks. In his annual   speech, an Islamic State spokesman, Abu Muhammad    —   who had not issued a statement in approximately seven months  —     to call on the group’s followers to carry out assaults in Europe and America. “The smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us,” Mr. Adnani declared in the audio speech, which was uploaded to Telegram and Twitter on May 21. Mr. Hollande called the attack “a cowardly murder” in a statement issued late Monday, saying he would be briefed on the case early Tuesday and that the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, would travel on Tuesday morning to the area where the killings took place. Magnanville is about 35 miles from central Paris. With the Euro 2016 soccer tournament underway in France and multiple warnings of the possibility of terrorist attacks during the monthlong event, the authorities have been on alert for possible attacks. Extraordinary measures have been put in place to ensure that the crowds of visitors at the soccer matches will be safe. Much of the public focus has been on avoiding a repeat of the sort of attacks that killed 130 people in and near Paris on Nov. 13. In that case, a network of former Islamic State fighters from Belgium and France staged the attacks along with a few people who expressed loyalty to the extremist group but had not traveled abroad to fight. However, perhaps the risk that is harder to protect against are the   attacks encouraged by the Islamic State. Such   jihadists are harder for the authorities to detect. A similar case arose in June 2015 when an employee at a small trucking company beheaded his boss and attempted to set off an explosion at an   chemical and gas factory near Lyon. The man, Yassine Salhi, appears to have had a friend who had gone to Syria to join the Islamic State, and Mr. Salhi sent him pictures of the beheading. Mr. Salhi killed himself in prison in December while awaiting trial. The beheading, like the stabbing on Monday evening, took place during Ramadan.",0

24885,Tests Confirm Mosquitoes in Miami Beach Are Carrying Zika Virus - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Florida announced on Thursday that, for the first time, mosquitoes in Miami Beach had tested positive for the Zika virus, a disappointing confirmation that the virus is still active in the area. The Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads Zika is famously difficult to fight, and experts often say that testing the bugs to find the virus is like looking for a needle in a haystack. The three samples that tested positive all came from a 1.   area in Miami Beach where locally acquired cases of Zika had been confirmed. The significance of the results depends on where the mosquitoes were collected, said Scott C. Weaver, the director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch. If they are from in or around the houses of people with active infections, the chances of the bugs’ being infected are higher. If the virus was found in mosquitoes in a more distant location, that could point to a bigger infection area than thought. A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said state law prevented the disclosure of the traps’ location. The department said in a statement that since May, it had tested more than 2, 470 mosquito samples, consisting of more than 40, 000 mosquitoes. The three samples that the department announced on Thursday were the first to test positive. Zika causes mild symptoms  —   rashes and joint pain  —   for most people, but it can cause severe brain damage in the fetuses of pregnant women who are infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tracking more than 1, 500 pregnant women who have been infected with Zika. So far, at least 16 babies have been born with birth defects. Florida is the only place in the continental United States where Zika is actively circulating, but the virus is spreading. The first cluster of cases was in a Miami neighborhood called Wynwood. The outbreak in that area seems to have subsided, but health officials discovered a new cluster in Miami Beach on Aug. 18, and the C. D. C. warned pregnant women not to travel there. Zika is not expected to spread explosively in the United States as it has in Latin America and the Caribbean, because Americans live in less crowded conditions and usually have window screens and air conditioning, which block infected mosquitoes from spreading the virus. In all, Florida has more than 45 homegrown cases, nearly all in   County. The first were announced in July. “The good news is the weekly number of new cases isn’t changing much,” Dr. Weaver said. “If we were seeing at first five cases a week, then 10, then 20 and then 100, we’d be very concerned. ” Even so, the mosquito has proved a stubborn foe, particularly in Miami Beach. Aerial spraying, which has been effective in Wynwood, has not happened in Miami Beach, in part because its high buildings make spraying complicated, but also because some residents oppose it. But experts say aerial spraying there is possible, and on Thursday, Gov. Rick Scott said the C. D. C. had recommended that Miami Beach be sprayed using helicopters. He said the state had made funds available “to immediately conduct aerial spraying in Miami Beach. ” But it was not clear when that might happen. When asked about aerial spraying in a telephone interview, Michael Grieco, a Miami Beach city commissioner, said: “No determination has been made. It’s not really practical with all the geography. ”",0
24886,Republicans Clash Over Obamacare Taxes - Breitbart,"Republicans continue to clash over Obamacare taxes as Congress plans to draft a repeal package. [Conservatives worry that a tax credit included in the Ryan plan would cost too much and might create an expensive new entitlement program. Congressman Mark Walker ( ) chairman of the Republican Study Committee says, “I want to make sure that we’re not getting to a place where we’re providing this   benefit that enables people. ”  House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows ( ) said refundable tax credits could be a “new entitlement program. ” He doubts that House leaders possess the votes necessary to pass refundable tax credits. Other conservatives object to taxing   health insurance plans. Rep. Pete Session ( ) chairman of the House Rules Committee, told reporters that this would amount to “a Republican tax on Cadillac plans. ” Committees will meet in early March to draft Obamacare’s repeal, although House Republicans remain disunified on the details. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) assured his fellow Republicans, arguing that a tax credit offers immediate help. Brady said, “It covers more people, because it applies to those who don’t have a tax liability, and it’s advanceable, so it’s available today. ” Some    Republicans want to keep Obamacare’s taxes to provide revenue for Obamacare’s replacement. Brady, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has significant power to draft Obamacare’ replacement. He argued that Obamacare’s taxes are bad for economic growth. He said, “I’ll just tell you, I don’t want Americans to suffer under the Obamacare taxes. They’re   they drive the prices of healthcare up I just think they’re bad all around. ” Republicans continue to battle over Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.   states expanded Medicaid, and Congress continues to debate over how to scale back Medicaid expansion. The conservative House Freedom Caucus, along with Senator Rand Paul ( ) unveiled their Obamacare repeal bill that repeals Medicaid expansion entirely. The Ryan plan lowers the federal government’s match rate for Medicaid spending back its traditional level. Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn ( ) told Breitbart News, “There is wide agreement amongst the governors, Republicans and Democrat alike, that they would like us to send Medicaid to the states. ” Blackburn believes that   Medicaid to the states will, “get rid of some of the constraints from the federal government and offer a better product at a more affordable cost and help more people. ” Chairman Brady remarked that tax breaks in Obamacare’s replacement would benefit all Americans, not just the few. He said, “I’m not interested in raising taxes anywhere else, and so I think unlocking and redesigning the current tax break so not just a few Americans can use it, but all Americans can use it, I think that’s where we ought to focus our thought, make sure we design it right and get it right. ”",0

For centuries, the Catholic Church had locked up the Bible and kept it out of reach of the common man. As a result, when the Protestant Reformation ended the Dark Ages and removed the Bible from its Vatican shackles, it was a book that remained quite a mystery to most people. Out of all of its 66 books, the most misunderstood, most debated over and most feared book is, ironically and undoubtedly, the book of Revelation. 
On this episode of Rightly Dividing , we apply Paul’s command to “rightly divide” to the book of Revelation, and in the process of doing so remove much of the mystery in the process.

24894,Canadian Victim in London Attack Died in her Fiance’s Arms,"TORONTO (AP)  —   Canadian social worker Christine Archibald is being remembered as a “bright light” for her profession as those who loved her launch an online campaign of compassionate acts after she was struck by a van of terrorists on London Bridge and died in her fiance’s arms. [The    from Calgary, Alberta, had recently moved to the Netherlands to be with her fiance Tyler Ferguson, his sister Cassie Ferguson Rowe said. The couple was engaged three months ago.  Ferguson had been walking a few steps ahead of his fiancee on the bridge, and then held her as she died, said Ferguson Rowe. “My baby brother lost the love of his life on the London bridge. In a split second, his entire life was ripped away from him,” Ferguson Rowe said. Born and raised in Castlegar, British Columbia, Archibald had later lived in Calgary, where she worked at a homeless shelter before moving to Europe to be with Ferguson. Her family in Castlegar said in a statement that Archibald “would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death. ” “She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected,” the family statement said. Kathy Christiansen, executive director of Alpha House in Calgary, said Archibald had worked at the shelter for homeless people addicted to drugs and alcohol until recently. She called Archibald a talented social worker and exceptional human being who inspired all who worked with her. “Chrissy was a bright light,” she said. Before that, Archibald was an   social work student from Calgary’s Mount Royal University. Peter Choate, an assistant professor of social work, said his former student “fit the profession. ” “She was very caring but at the same time very professional. She understood that she wasn’t in charge of the lives of her clients. She was able to offer her clients opportunities to do things with their lives,” Choate said. “She got it. The family should be very proud of the young woman, the social worker that she was. As a profession for us it is a loss. ” The Archibald family asked that people honor her memory by making the community a better place. “Volunteer your time and labor or donate to a homeless shelter,” the statement said. “Tell them Chrissy sent you. ” The hashtag #Chrissysentme was being used on Twitter to express sadness for the family’s loss. Inspired by the call for meaningful action, some people pledged to make donations to shelters, soup kitchens and other community groups. Ferguson Rowe said she hoped the use of the hashtag would “urge people to not let her death be in vain, to do good in their community. ” “It’s what she would have wanted,” Ferguson Rowe said.",0
24895,President Elect Trump Promises to Help with #CalExit,"Thursday, 10 November 2016 President Elect Donald Trump This Morning at the White House 
WASHINGTON DC - Taking questions from the media this morning before his meeting with President Barack Obama - President Elect Donald Trump was asked about the YesCalifornia Independence Campaign. YesCalifornia or #Calexit is a referendum for California Independence from the United States of America. In the Spring of 2019, Californians will go to the polls in a historic vote to decide by referendum if California should exit the Union. 
""I think it is a great idea"" President Elect Trump answered, ""I've met a lot of fantastic wonderful people in California and not all of them agree with me. The most incredible thing about this great and wonderful fantastic country we live in is we have the ability to choose our own path and vote on it as a wonderful collection of great and incredible people. 
""I honestly do not want to keep anyone in this country that does not want to be in this country. My primary job as president will to be fix the economy. If the incredible wonderful fantastic people of California want to operate as an independent sovereign nation, I would love to help these wonderful people. Getting rid of California will help the economy greatly. 
""I have talked with advisers and we are checking the constitution. I have a transition team talking with incredible clerks in the Supreme Court to see if I can fast track the process. As long as I am constitutionally able to do so, I will sign an executive order to remove the State of California from the United States. I know they are having trouble with their economy and water, but they obviously have plans on how to fix this as an independent nation. 
""I will also take request from any other wonderful beautiful states who want to follow the same course. My aim is to make America great again. Removing the chaff from the wheat will help us in obtaining this goal. 
When President Elect Trump was asked about the future fifty-five electoral votes the state has he responded, ""oh I never thought about that. I guess that would [suck] for Democrats."" 
He also was jokingly asked if Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to the morning presidential briefings President Elect Trump is now part of, Trump replied, ""Of course not, but I'll update him on Twitter.""

24896,"WaPo Admits Single-Payer Health Care Would be ""Astonishingly"" Expensive","The Washington Post dealt a blow to a liberal pipe dream Sunday when the outlet’s editorial board highlighted the problems with   health care   —   arguing that it would be “astonishingly” expensive unless doctors are paid less and Americans are prepared to “accept different standards of access and comfort. ”[The piece, called “  health care would have an astonishingly high price tag” comes days after California’s Senate approved a   system for the state earlier this week, without having specified how it will pay for the estimated $400 billion price tag.    health care systems, such as those seen in Europe and Canada, have always been popular with the liberal wing of American politics, with top liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders ( ) and Elizabeth Warren ( ) calling for such systems in America. President Barack Obama also publicly supported   when he was a senator. The Post editorial is certainly sympathetic to those aspirations, arguing that such models are simpler for patients and employers. However, it says “the government’s price tag would be astonishing. ” When Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) proposed a “Medicare for all” health plan in his presidential campaign, the nonpartisan Urban Institute figured that it would raise government spending by $32 trillion over 10 years, requiring a tax increase so huge that even the democratic socialist Mr. Sanders did not propose anything close to it. Countering the argument of   advocates that   systems tend to be more   than the American system, the Post says the reason for that is political, blaming Republicans for framing ObamaCare’s Medicare cuts as attacks on the program instead of reform. The Post argues that a   system would face the same political barriers and that consequently, the only way to make such a plan affordable would be to get medical employees to be paid less, and to get Americans to accept lower quality of care: A     system would face all of these political barriers to   reform and more. To realize the   dream of coverage for all and big savings, medical industry players, including doctors, would likely have to get paid less and patients would have to accept different standards of access and comfort. There is little evidence most Americans are willing to accept such tradeoffs. The Post reiterates that “the goal must be universal coverage and cost restraint” but that liberals should be directing their energy to goals other than a complete government takeover of America’s healthcare system. There are many options short of a disruptive takeover: the government can change how care is delivered, determine which treatments should be covered, control quality at hospitals, drive down drug costs and discourage     plans even while making the Obamacare system better at filling coverage gaps.

24897,"Crystal Clear Agreements: Enduring subordination, by Manlio Dinucci","“The Art of War”
Crystal Clear Agreements: Enduring subordination by Manlio Dinucci Voltaire Network | Rome (Italy) | 27 October 2016 français italiano First, President Obama called upon the Italians to vote “yes” in the referendum, thus interfering in our national politics with the silent complicity of the parliamentary opposition. Then he went on to confirm to his “good friend Matteo” that the US has “clear agreements, long friendship” with Italy.
Noone would question that these agreements were crystal clear, especially the Atlantic Treaty that places Italy in a position of subordination to the U.S.A. The US President always appoints the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and all the other key commands are in US hands.
When the disintegration of the USSR brought the Cold War to an end, Washington declared the “fundamental importance of preserving Nato as a channel of influence and US participation in European Affairs so as to prevent the creation of exclusively European structures that would threaten the Alliance’s chain of command”, that is the US command. An idea reiterated by the NATO Secretary Stoltenberg during the recent round table on the “Big Idea for Europe”:
“We must ensure that building up Europe’s defense does not duplicate Nato’s defence and [Europe] does not become another Nato”.
Stoltenberg’s idea is guaranteed by the fact that 22 of the 28 EU member states (21 of 27 following Great Britain’s departure) are part of the US-led Nato, which is recognized by the European Union as “the foundation of collective defense”.
Thus the EU foreign and military policy is fundamentally subordinated to the US strategy and the European powers have aligned themselves to it. Their conflicting interests are ironed out when their fundamental interest is at stake: maintaining Western predominance, increasingly faltering when confronted by the emergence of new state and non-state subjects. All we need to do is to recall to our minds that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, created through a strategic China-Russia agreement, pools resources that makes it the biggest integrated economic area in the world.
In the context of the US/Nato strategy – reports the White House – Italy stands out as a “steadfast and active ally of the United States”. This is demonstrated by the fact that “Italy hosts more than 30,000 soldiers and civil officers of the US Defence Department in military establishments positioned all over the country”.
At the same time, Italy is “a US partner for global security”, supplying military forces and funding for a wide range of “challenges”: in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Baltic and elsewhere, that is, wherever the USA/Nato war machine has been and is deployed.
A final fact to confirm the nature of the US-Italian relationship – scheduled to arrive at the Amendola base (Puglia), probably on 8 November, are the first two of the 90 fighter planes supplied by Lockheed Martin (a US company), that Italy has undertaken to purchase.
The cost of Italy’s participation in the F-35 programme as a second-tier partner is officially calculated in the Stability Law of 2016: 12 billion 356 million euro of public money, plus additional costs for the continual updates to the fighter plane that still is not fully operative and will require constant modernization. Despite this – confirms Analisi Difesa – Italy will have “limited sovereignty” over the F-35 planes that form part of its own Air Force. A US law prohibits that “mission information” (software for managing the fighting systems of the fighter planes) is communicated to others. Thus the US will control the Italian F-35 which have been fitted out to use the new nuclear bombs B61-12 that the Pentagon will deploy against Russia, substituting them for the existing B-61, on our “national” territory.

According to Rai al-Youm newspaper , a Bedouin Jordanian poet has expressed his willingness to marry the daughter of Donald Trump , the US president-elect.
Falih Al-Jabour wrote in a poem that Jordanian officials are on their way to the white house to ask for the hand of Tiffany Trump, the president’s youngest daughter. He hoped the offer wouldn’t be turned down.
Al-Jabour proposed to Tiffany in his strange and humorous poem and even offered to pay a substantial price for the bride including 50 camels, 200 thoroughbred horses and a 15.5-acre field.
This Jordanian poet published his poem in social networks and asked the bride’s family not to reject him.
Falih Al-Jabour’s only condition for the marriage is that after marrying him and going to his home land, the bride has to wear burka, because she’s “so beautiful”, otherwise there will be a chaos in the tribe.

24901,‘The Daily’: President Trump’s Foreign Policy Muse - The New York Times,"Back on the campaign trail,   Donald J. Trump argued that the United States faced a threat  —   radical Islamic terrorism  —   on par with fascism, Nazism and communism.

24902,The War on UNESCO,"0 38 
Did Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, actually read the full text of the UNESCO resolution on Palestine and Israel, before he raved with anger? 
“I think this is a mistaken, inconceivable resolution,” he said. 
“It is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the UN and UNESCO that aim to attack Israel. It is shocking and I have ordered that we stop taking this position (his country’s abstention) even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of Europe,” he added. 
Renzi, who became Prime Minister in 2014 at the relatively young age of 39 knows exactly how the game is played. In order to win favor with Washington, he must first please Tel Aviv. 
His country has abstained from the October 12 vote on a resolution that condemns Israel’s violations of the cultural and legal status of Occupied East Jerusalem. This decision has ignited the ire of Israeli Ambassador to Rome, Ofer Zaks , who riled up the Jewish community in Italy to protest the abstention. Renzi, in turn, was converted into a champion of the ‘Temple Mount’, the name Israel uses to describe the Palestinian Muslim holy site. 
Renzi cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the resolution, which merely condemned Israel’s obvious violations of international law, and only calls for Israel to respect the status of Palestinian culture in the occupied city.

24903,News: Shattering The Glass Ceiling: It Is Finally Acceptable For Women To Cry At Work,"Email 
It’s no secret that workplaces in our country are still deeply misogynistic environments, but with her 2016 bid for the president of the United States, Hillary Clinton worked tirelessly to not just be elected but to also break down barriers for women everywhere. Today marks a big win for gender equality, because the glass ceiling has been shattered, and it is finally acceptable for women to cry at work! 
That’s right, ladies. It’s time to iron those pantsuits and put on those heels, because the day has finally come when it’s totally fine to sob openly in your office, and there’s nothing men can do to stop you! 
For far too long, women have been marginalized, written off, and told that there are certain things they can never achieve. But today, that all ends, because women are coming into work and crying at several unpredictable intervals throughout the entire day with absolutely zero negative consequences. As of now, it seems like anything is possible, because from the boardroom to the lab, women across the country are stepping up and owning their shit, skulking around their offices with puffy eyes and tears streaming down their faces, no ducking into the stairwell necessary. 
It’s 2016, baby, so if you have two X chromosomes, you better lean the hell in! This news has got us like: 
Considering that just a short while ago, most women were expected to be homemakers, it’s incredible to think that our nation has gotten to the point where not one, but all women can come to work and cry loudly in and around their workplaces, no questions asked. Just 100 years ago, women couldn’t even attend college, but now it is not only acceptable, but even expected that this morning, women went straight to the bathroom and cried uncontrollably out of anger or fear or downright despair! 
Y s, queen! 
Thankfully, today will go down as a huge victory for women, because we can show our daughters and our granddaughters that right now, it’s fine for their mothers to break down and spray a pool of mascara-soaked tears all over their desks. At this historic moment, the glass ceiling is totally shattered, and there’s absolutely no way it’s going back up!",0

24907,’Deport Me!’ Czech Child Abuser Begs the British Authorities,"A Czech child abuser has claimed that the UK has failed to deport him to a prison in his home country, in spite of a transfer request by the Czech authorities and his own willingness to go. [In a letter to the Sunday Times, Desan Juran details how both he and his home nation have repeatedly requested the British authorities deport him to serve out his sentence, but have been ignored for over a year.  Juran was working as a nanny in Bradford when he was arrested in connection with a child abuse in his home country. The police later discovered he had shared over 30, 000 indecent images of children online. It is not clear why Juran, who plead guilty to 19 offences involving the sexual abuse of a young boy in the Czech Republic, was not sent home to serve his sentence in the first place. He claims the Czechs have asked the British authorities for more information so they can help to facilitate a transfer, which the Rye Hill inmate requested last June, but “as of now, half a year later, British authorities still have not provided it”. “I am more than willing to go” said Juran. “I know that the British prison system is overcrowded and in crisis, and I believe that getting rid of foreign national prisoners would help solve the problem, and the government wants us to believe that it is its priority. “It is in [the] best interest of [everyone] for me to be repatriated   …     British taxpayers pay tens of thousands of pounds per year for keeping me here. Those six months of waiting   …     have already cost Britain over £15, 000, and I am just one person. There are hundreds, or possibly even thousands of people like me, and if something was done about the inefficiency of British bureaucracy, it would save the taxpayers millions of pounds every year. ” The Telegraph reported that there were more than 4, 000 European Union (EU) nationals in British prisons last September. Only 102 have been transferred to their home countries, despite the introduction of a prisoner transfer directive eight years ago. The number of EU nationals in English and Welsh prisons rose by 240 per cent between 2002 and 2014, costing UK taxpayers around £150m. In June 2016 the BBC reported on an admission by the Parliamentary   of State at the Ministry of Justice  —   removed from office by Theresa May following the Brexit referendum  —   that EU laws “prohibit [the] UK from sending foreign criminals home” even after they have served their sentences. Examples include Romanian rapist Mircea Gheorghiu, whose abusive history was uncovered by the Home Office after a   conviction in the UK. Gheorghiu, who entered the country illegally in 2002, was initially removed under a   deportation scheme, but returned after   judge Sir Nicholas Blake ruled that he was not a sufficiently serious threat and “should be reunited with his family as quickly as possible”.",0

B ritain’s economy expanded by 0.5pc in the three months following the EU referendum, slowing down a touch from the 0.7pc growth recorded in the previous quarter but defying the most pessimistic predictions made by the Remain campaign. 
The country’s economic performance was stronger than the 0.3pc predicted by economists, and in line with the official forecasts made before the referendum took place – in March the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted third quarter growth of 0.5pc. It also disproves the Treasury’s referendum campaign claim that a vote to leave the EU would r esult in 0.1pc fall in GDP in the third quarter that would herald the start of a recession. The Treasury’s worst-case “severe shock” scenario was even more pessimistic, predicting a 1pc fall in the three-month period. 
S terling rallied on the initial estimates from the Office for National Statistics, and economists said the unexpectedly strong numbers made it less likely that the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) would cut interest rates at next month’s monetary policy committee meeting.

The student activists claim there are “many incidents where students of color and historically marginalized communities are treated differently by police officers. ” They cite the Black Lives Matter platform as the blueprint for their draft of the legislation: “The Black Lives Matter platform calls on [sic] community control of the police because current policing practices  …    demonstrate a lack of voices for communities of color. ” The resolution, entitled“UWPD Accountability and Community Control of the Police,” passed by a unanimous vote in the student council and will now be passed on to the faculty senate for confirmation. The resolution argues that “the treatment and characterization of people of color by UWPD raises questions about their implicit bias and discriminatory policing procedures. ”  In response to the allegations of discrimination, the resolution demands that UWM “implement a community accountability board to review the policies and procedures that discriminate against people of color. ” The University of Wisconsin Police Department claims that the resolution is “irrelevant” to the department’s goal of carrying out their job in a way that maintains order and safety for all students on campus.

It goes about 300 million euros, which Arianespace was supposed to pay to Roscosmos, but the funds were frozen by the Court of Arbitration in The Hague in the case of former Yukos shareholders . Previously, Roscosmos had won a case in France about the arrest of accounts of the state corporation in the Yukos case. ""They acknowledged that our arguments were correct, but we will continue defending our interests,"" director of communications at Roscosmos, Igor Burenkov said. On April 11, France arrested $700 million of Roskosmos and Space Communications money in connection with a judicial decision on the case of Yukos.

24914,News: Disgrace: The CEO Of Beans Has Stepped Down Amid Reports That There Can’t Be A CEO Of Beans,"Email 
Oh, how the mighty have fallen. 
It’s always an embarrassing moment when a high-powered executive suffers a scandal that forces him or her to resign, but it looks like yet another head honcho is about to step into that humiliating spotlight: After nearly a decade on the job, the CEO of beans has officially stepped down following reports that there cannot be a CEO of beans. 
Yikes. Talk about a fall from grace. 
Patrick Buckley was an ambitious leader as the CEO of beans, often telling people that he was in charge of every single bean that came out of the dirt, and even going so far as to print up business cards with “CEO of beans” listed right on the front. With beans being such a common staple of diets worldwide, a man in Mr. Buckley’s position may have seemed poised to become one of the most powerful people in the food industry. But in the blink of an eye, everything the executive had been working for came crashing down before him, as reports began to circulate late last week that while bean manufacturers may have CEOs, it’s impossible for beans in general to have a CEO of their own. 
“After a wonderful career at the helm of beans, it has become apparent that there is no such thing as my job,” the scandalized CEO wrote in a brief statement to the press. “In light of this news that my position, and my former role as director of garbanzo, do not exist, it seems prudent that I step down immediately. I am proud of the work I have done for beans during my tenure, and I look forward to continuing to prepare and eat beans in the future.” 
As of this morning, the board of directors of beans has accepted Mr. Buckley’s resignation, and then the members promptly stepped down themselves amidst reports that beans cannot have a board of directors, either. 
Making matters worse, the entire corporate structure of beans now finds itself crumbling from the top all the way down, as an onslaught of new allegations indicate that beans, as a relatively loose category of foods, has never been and cannot be a staffable organization. 
Wow. It’s hard to imagine how Mr. Buckley will ever bounce back from such a disgrace, but hopefully he learns an important lesson from all this. CEOs, take note: Your mistakes will always come back to haunt you.",0
24917,Donald Trump to Be First President Since Reagan to Speak at NRA Annual Meetings - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump will be the first President to speak at the NRA Annual Meetings since Ronald Reagan did it in 1983. [He will speak to the NRA’s 2017 Leadership Forum in Atlanta on April 28.  Breitbart News reported that the NRA endorsed Trump on May 20, 2016, during the 2016 Annual Meetings in Louisville, Kentucky. Thereafter, the NRA campaigned for Trump, and Trump reminded voters again and again that he would work with the NRA to save the Second Amendment if elected. Trump will now return to speak to the gun rights group that cheered him to victory last year. Bloomberg reports that this will make him “the first U. S. president to address the   group since Ronald Reagan in 1983. ” Trump’s speech to the NRA will occur two months to the day after he signed a repeal of Barack Obama’s Social Security gun ban which would have allowed the Social Security Administration to strip beneficiaries of the Second Amendment rights without due process. The speech also comes nearly two months after his Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, ended an   ban against using lead ammunition on federal lands. On April 13, 2017, Breitbart News reported that the Trump administration has been quietly rolling back other   gun controls behind the scenes. McClatchy reported that federal agencies have “narrowed the definition of ‘fugitive,’” thereby limiting the number of people prohibited from gun possession because they are included in a fugitive database. Trump “officials have also signaled that they may no longer defend the Army Corps of Engineers’ ban on carrying loaded firearms and ammunition on federal lands. ” Trump’s greatest   Amendment accomplishment was nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and securing his confirmation. Trump had promised to use SCOTUS to save the Second Amendment from “people like Hillary Clinton,” and Gorsuch is widely viewed as a fulfillment of that promise.

And yes, be prepared to have a showdown. Be prepared to have a showdown and the competencies and the articulation as a Republican party that controls all that damn elected branches in Washington D. C. Time to make that case to the American people. That it is the despicable snake oil salesman Chuck Schumer and the despicable failure Nancy Pelosi who are destroying this economy, who are driving up the debt. And we have a president who wants to do something about both. We have a president who was elected to fund border security. It was always preposterous when he said that Mexico was going to do it. And I told you that. And I don’t care about that. Build the damn wall. You got the House. You got the Senate. You got the presidency. You got the bureaucracy. The art of the deal, screw the art of the deal. It should be the art of victory. The art of victory. It’s time to roll Schumer.

24923,UNAUTHORIZED VIDEO Of Hillary and Huma Leaks – Watch Before It’s Removed | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print Hillary Clinton got the shock of her life on Friday when the FBI reopened their investigation into her use of a personal email server during her time as Secretary of State. The investigation was reopened due to incriminating emails found on the server of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin. Days later, The Political Insider is reporting that the hacker group Anonymous has released a damning video exposing Abedin’s shady pass. The footage reveals Abedin’s extensive personal ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and that her mother is a member of the group’s counterpart organization for women. When she began interning for Clinton at the age of 20, Abedin was also working for a Jihadist legal publication which endorsed Sharia law. In addition, Abedin’s family has links to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Anonymous also released a video detailing Clinton’s own criminal past.

24924,Hafiz Saeed and Geelani to dress up as mime artists on Ravish Kumar’s show in solidarity with NDTV,"Hafiz Saeed and Geelani to dress up as mime artists on Ravish Kumar’s show in solidarity with NDTV Posted on Tweet 
Notwithstanding the I&B ministry’s decision to stay its decision to black out NDTV for a day for revealing sensitive information during counter-terror operations in Pathankot (and Kargil and 26/11), fans of NDTV continue to emerge in support of the channel. 
Following journalist Ravish Kumar creative show featuring mime artists, presumably representing a silent protest against the government’s decision, NDTV found two unlikely but perhaps not so unlikely allies in Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Hafiz Saeed. The separatist and the terrorist have announced their decision to participate in Ravish Kumar’s show as mime artists. 
“Nobody has done more for the Kashmir freedom struggle than Barkha Dutt ji,” raved Geelani to our correspondent. “I know that I am recognized as the leader of Kashmiri freedom, but truth be told, my commitment to the cause pales in comparison to Barkha ji’s. She used her brilliance and blamed terrorism in the valley on the rise of hindutva in India! She has highlighted a plan of blaming the burning of schools on Diwali crackers. She is a true Kashmiri patriot. Just as Jinnah is the Father of the Nation in Pakistan, we hope to make Barkha ji the Mother of the Nation when we’ll get our freedom. The least I can do is show solidarity with NDTV. I will dress as a mime artist on Ravish’s next show,” said Geelani before excusing himself to practice miming for the show. 
Hafiz Saeed was harder to track down. But our stringers in Pakistan reported that the 26/11 mastermind had been inconsolable ever since the government announced its decision to ban NDTV for a day and had spent an entire day binge watching ‘The Buck Stops Here’ with teary eyes. When the tears dried up, he sprang to his feet, yelled “Yeh sab RAW ne kiya hai!” and decided to join the battle for Freedom Of Expression by joining Ravish’s show as a mime artist. 
In other news, Arun Jaitley was spotted creating several Bot accounts on Twitter and retweeting Barkha Dutt’s tweets.

24926,Trump Sets GOP Fundraising Milestone In Small-Donor Contributions," 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other GOP candidate has before.
He has amassed the largest small-donor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the Republican Party.
Zac Moffatt, an online fundraising expert, said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate.
 
Related Stories Newt Gingrich Defends Donald Trump Against ‘Sexual Predator’ Accusations Donald Trump’s Star On Hollywood Walk Of Fame Vandalized Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio “The people who donate are your core believers,” said Moffatt, who was digital director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign.
Romney and Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than Trump has in total contributions.
However, Trump’s campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as $200 or less.
 
In this category, Trump has raised more than $78.6 million thus far, based on data from the Federal Election Commission.
In comparison, McCain raised $65.5 million and Romney raised $44.8 million by this point in their election races.
While McCain and Romney had significant income contributions from other sources, Trump’s small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.
According to OpenSecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below $200 mark the campaigns aren’t legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds $200 the campaign must give the donor’s name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias “You could make an argument that he is the best candidate to refresh the RNC’s online fundraising database because of the different kind of donor that he’s gotten,” said Vincent Harris, a GOP digital strategist who did private digital work for Trump’s campaign.
As of Oct. 19, the Trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the party’s get-out-the-vote effort, electing instead to have Trump focus on getting across his final message to voters.
“We’ve kind of wound down,” said Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s national finance chairman. “But the online fundraising continues to be strong.”
“We have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],” Mnuchin continued. “Unlike [Democratic nominee] Hillary [Clinton], who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.”
This decision has been questioned by some given that Clinton’s campaign has raised $445.4 million, according to OpenSecrets, which is $226.6 million more than the $218.8 million Trump has raised.
Clinton has 41 events lined up before Nov. 4.

24928,Man imprisoned for failing to provide an Amazon review,"November 7, 2016 
‘We must have sent him four emails asking for a review, but he just ignored them,’ said an Amazon spokesman today. ‘He hadn’t marked the product as a gift, so there was no reason to not provide a review,’ he added. 
Judge Roberts commented when sentencing Billy Askew (24) from Winsford to three months in gaol that: ‘it was every on-line shopper’s civic duty to provide a review, even if it’s clearly horseshit’. Billy was clearly shaken by the sentence: ‘it was just a set of toe-nail clippers,’ he pointed out as he was escorted from the dock. ‘They cut my toe-nails, what more is there to say?’ he asked, narrowly avoiding having his fingers trapped in the cell door. 
The Amazon spokesman defended referring Billy to the authorities: ‘Everybody provides reviews these days, even HMRC gave our tax return a review. One star, a bit harsh,’ he added, while confirming that if Billy had been an Amazon Prime member. ‘We’d probably have written the review for him’. 
Billy has clearly seen the error of his ways, as he posted a review of his cell on TripAdvisor. ‘Smaller than advertised, has an all pervading smell of wee and can you believe it – no spare keys!’ Share this story...

24931,MILO’s Book ’Dangerous’ To Be Released In June Will Now Include Berkeley Riots - Breitbart,"The release date of MILO’s upcoming book “DANGEROUS” has been moved to early June in order to include material about the   riots that took place at UC Davis, UW Seattle, and UC Berkeley in the final weeks of the “Dangerous Faggot Tour,” he has confirmed. [In a Facebook post, MILO said that he had been granted more time from his publisher, Simon  Schuster, to submit a manuscript of the book in order to “include material about the craziness and rioting at UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UW Seattle. ”  “It would be absurd for me to publish a book without some discussion of the insanity of the last few weeks,” he continued. Violent protests outside all three universities saw unprecedented   violence, attracting shock around the world. Rioters vandalized university buildings, started several fires, and beat and pepper sprayed journalists and Trump supporters. One individual was taken to hospital in critical condition from a gunshot wound. The $250, 000 book deal, which was announced in December, caused widespread outrage from   activists who argued Simon  Schuster should not publish “hate speech. ” For example, the Chicago Review of Books confirmed they would boycott reviews of any books published by Simon and Schuster in 2017, whilst women’s lifestyle magazine ELLE published a column claiming it would “endanger human lives. ” Meanwhile, “Bad Feminist” author Roxane Gay confirmed she was canceling her own book deal with the publishers in protest at MILO’s own book deal. As a result of the backlash, the book has twice reached the top of the Amazon bestseller list and is one of the most anticipated books of 2017. The book will now be released June 13th, rather than the original date of March 14th. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!  You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
24932,Soros Group Gave $100K for Illegal Aliens’ Legal Fees - Breitbart,"George Soros is helping foot the bill for illegal immigrants’ legal services in Baltimore, Maryland. [Soros’ Open Society Foundation has donated $100, 000 to a Baltimore legal fund, created by a number of open borders groups, to pay for lawyers for illegal immigrants as they try to avoid deportation.  The Southeast Baltimore Open Society Foundation’s Director Diana Morris said illegal immigrants feel as though they are “under attack” by President Donald Trump’s administration, according to the Baltimore Sun, failing to mention that the vast majority of illegal immigrants deported from the U. S. had committed crimes. “We see children afraid to go to school,” Morris said during a press conference in front of a Catholic parish. “Parents afraid to drop their children off at school. ” So far, Soros’ Open Society Foundation is one of the biggest funders of the Baltimore illegal alien fund, with another $100, 000 coming from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and $25, 000 pouring in from Baltimore Community Foundation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions reiterated the Trump Administration’s commitment to prioritizing the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants, while also making clear that any individual living in the U. S. illegally is eligible for deportation. “Everybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported, so people come here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not subject to being deported  —   well, they are,” Sessions said in an interview. Soros has been made famous due to his support for liberal leaders like former President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Soros has previously blasted strong, national borders as an “obstacle” for illegal immigrants and foreign refugees trying to enter the Western world, Breitbart London reported.

There has been a surge of immigrants illegally crossing into the United States leading up to next month’s presidential election. 
CBS News reports dozens of immigrants have been streaming through the streets of McAllen, Texas, on a daily basis. They have been taken to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where they were released by Border Patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum. 


Moms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. Feds: 275,000 born to illegals in one year, would fill city the size of Orlando 
“In 2014, about 275,000 babies were born to unauthorized-immigrant parents in the U.S., accounting for about 7 percent of all U.S. births, and 32 percent of all U.S. births to foreign-born mothers,” said Pew’s newly released report. Border Patrol Agent: Admin Treats Illegal Crossings ‘Like a Traffic Ticket’ Chris Cabrera says the administration is actively trying to ‘circumvent their own laws’ 
U.S. Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera said that the federal government is “trying to circumvent their own laws” by preventing the agents from securing the border and curbing illegal immigration during an interview Wednesday on “The Laura Ingraham Show.” 
During an interview with CBS News Tuesday, Cabrera said the impending presidential election was one of the main causes of recent “mass spikes” in illegal crossings. Saying that the immigrants have been told that if Hillary Clinton is elected there will be “some sort of amnesty,” Cabrera added that they’ve been told if Donald Trump is elected, “there’s going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.” 
Cabrera told Ingraham the federal government is impeding the agents’ efforts to contain the rush on the border. 
“And you know, we’re just doing what the law says and what our job is,” Cabrera told Ingraham. “Apparently, they’re trying to circumvent their own laws, and we just want to do our jobs the way we know how to do it and the way we were trained to do it.”",0
24937,CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS WARNED THAT TURKEY’S ERDOGAN WAS ATTEMPTING TO BUY FAVOR,"Home › POLITICS › CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS WARNED THAT TURKEY’S ERDOGAN WAS ATTEMPTING TO BUY FAVOR CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS WARNED THAT TURKEY’S ERDOGAN WAS ATTEMPTING TO BUY FAVOR 4 SHARES 
[11/1/16] Top Hillary Clinton campaign officials were warned last summer that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would make contributions to the campaign through American proxies to gain favor, but chose to take money from one of the people they were warned about nonetheless. 
The warning came last August in an email to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Michael Werz, an expert on Turkey who used to work for Podesta’s Center for American Progress, told Podesta that the “Erdogan faction” was making investments in Democratic candidates such as Clinton. 
“Am told that the Erdogan crew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates, including yours,” Werz told Podesta. “Two names that you should be aware of are Mehmet Celebi and Ali Cinar.” 
Werz, who did not respond to a request for comment, wrote that the “Erdogan faction is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gülenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG.” 
Podesta forwarded the email to Dennis Cheng , who runs the campaign’s fundraising operation. 
The email was posted online by Wikileaks. The U.S. director of national intelligence and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security have accused “Russia’s senior-most officials” of hacking and leaking the emails to influence the 2016 election. 
Ali Cinar, one of the men Werz warned about, had already given Clinton $2,700 three months earlier in May. This year, Cinar gave an additional $2,000 to Clinton this August and $500 more in September. 
Cinar has also given $1,080 to the Democratic National Committee this cycle. 
The Clinton campaign would not answer questions on the donations from Cinar. 
Cinar is currently president of the Turkish Heritage Organization, a recognized non-profit based in the United States that was recently probed by the FBI after hacked emails from the Erdogan administration revealed that the group was lobbying on behalf of the Turkish presidency in the United States.

24940,Hastert Accuser Sues for $1.8 Million in Compensation - The New York Times,"CHICAGO  —   A man who says J. Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House, molested him decades ago when the man was 14 filed a lawsuit against Mr. Hastert on Monday, saying he was owed $1. 8 million of the money he had been promised as compensation for the abuse. The suit, for breach of contract, says that Mr. Hastert promised to pay him $3. 5 million for the pain and suffering that the abuse had caused, but failed to pay the full amount after being charged last year with federal crimes. The name of the man was not made public in the lawsuit. The suit was filed in Kendall County, Ill. on the edge of Chicago’s suburbs, where Mr. Hastert worked as a high school wrestling coach in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, and where at least four members of the wrestling team have said he sexually abused them. The suit adds to a mounting set of legal problems for Mr. Hastert, 74, who is expected to be sentenced on Wednesday in federal court here after pleading guilty to a banking violation tied to the abuse. The man who sued on Monday  —   known in his own lawsuit as James Doe and in the federal case against Mr. Hastert as Individual A  —   was molested when Mr. Hastert asked him to stay alone with him in a motel room during a wrestling camp trip, his lawsuit says. “For many years to follow, Plaintiff suffered severe panic attacks which led to periods of unemployment, career changes, bouts of depression, hospitalization and   psychiatric treatment,” the suit says, noting that the plaintiff’s family had known and trusted Mr. Hastert for years. In 2008, the lawsuit says, the plaintiff learned that Mr. Hastert had abused someone else as well and met with Mr. Hastert to confront him. “During their discussions, Hastert acknowledged the lifelong pain and suffering he caused Plaintiff,” the lawsuit says. A lawyer for Mr. Hastert declined to comment on the suit on Monday. It was the large payments from Mr. Hastert to Individual A starting around 2010 that led the authorities to begin investigating Mr. Hastert. As they investigated the sums and whether they violated bank reporting requirements, the claims of abuse emerged. At one point, a lawyer for Mr. Hastert told the authorities that his client was being extorted by Individual A over a false claim of abuse, a court filing by prosecutors says. Eventually, after recording conversations between Mr. Hastert and Individual A, the investigators dismissed the notion that it was a case of extortion, or that it was a false claim. Mr. Hastert was not charged with sexual abuse in the episodes, for which the statutes of limitation have passed. He pleaded guilty in October to illegally structuring bank withdrawals, and prosecutors said he had been using the funds to pay “hush money” for misconduct from years past. The lawsuit filed on Monday said the plaintiff was still owed $1. 8 million of the “settlement agreement,” plus interest. Individual A is not expected to testify at Mr. Hastert’s sentencing hearing on Wednesday, though another victim is expected to, as is the sister of a man, now deceased, who told her he had been abused by Mr. Hastert. Prosecutors have said they believe Mr. Hastert should face as little as no prison time or as much as six months in prison, as suggested under federal guidelines. Defense lawyers have requested probation for Mr. Hastert, who has had a stroke and other medical problems in recent months. Dozens of people have sent letters to the court on behalf of Mr. Hastert, including his wife, children and brother.",0
24942,Turkey: US Arms Shipments to Syrian Kurds Endanger ’All Humanity’,"Following Turkish media reports last week, the U. S. military has confirmed that it has begun shipping weapons to the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units ( ) to prepare for the battle to liberate Raqqa, Syria, from the Islamic State. [The YPG  —   the military wing of the Syrian People’s Democratic Unit (PYD)  —   is widely considered to be the most effective militia against ISIS on the ground in Syria and cooperates with both the United States and Russia. The government of Turkey objects to supporting them, however, having designated the YPG a terrorist group for its ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its alleged aim of establishing a sovereign Kurdistan. While America supports the YPG, it has officially designated the Marxist PKK a terrorist organization.  The YPG is the largest faction in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a     State coalition. “The U. S.  coalition has begun issuing arms and equipment to Kurdish elements of the S. D. F. ,” the New York Times quotes Col. Ryan S. Dillon, a military spokesman in Baghdad, stating via email Tuesday. He specified that the equipment included “small arms, ammunition, heavy machine guns   …     [and equipment to protect from] heavily armored   I. E. D. s. ” “Wherever possible, our advisers will monitor the use of the weapons and supplies we give the Kurdish elements of the S. D. F. ensuring use only against ISIS. Any alleged misuse or diversion of U. S. support will be taken seriously and lead to the possible curtailment of support, if verified,” he added. The Kurdish outlet Kurdistan24 published confirmations that the shipments had arrived from the leaders of both the PYD,   Salih Muslim, and YPJ spokeswoman Nisreen Abdalla. (The YPJ is the   counterpart of the YPG.) “We consider this decision a historical step, and we highly appreciate it,” Abdalla said while Muslim heralded the “mutual trust” between the United States and the YPG forces. The Trump administration announced that it would arm the YPG in May. “The SDF, partnered with enabling support from U. S. and coalition forces, are the only force on the ground that can successfully seize Raqqa in the near future,” Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said in a statement at the time. “We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey. We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the U. S. is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our NATO ally. ” Last week, the Turkish newspapers Hurriyet and Milliyet reported that American troops had begun shipping the weapons in question to the YPG. Hurriyet estimated the size of the convoy carrying the shipment to be about one hundred military vehicles, and Milliyet published images the newspaper claimed were of the vehicles in question. The former predicted the shipment included “fuel oil, military armored vehicles, heavy construction equipment and ammunition. ” Turkey’s National Security Council (MGK) issued a stern condemnation of the move on Wednesday. “It has been emphasized that the implementation of a policy to support the    terrorist organization in the guise of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) ignoring Turkey’s expectations, does not befit a friendship and alliance,” the MGK said in a statement.",0

24945,"FBI Ignore Intel Showing Location Of Missing 33,000 Clinton Emails","Posted on October 27, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in News , US // 0 Comments 
FBI bosses are deliberately choosing to ignore the contents of the ‘missing’ 33,000 Clinton emails after officials were told their location. 
Investigative journalist Paul Sperry says that newly released FBI documents prove that federal agents know the whereabouts of the missing emails – claiming that they exist in several locations and can be easily recovered. 
Breitbart.com reports: 
The emails were created during Clinton’s use of a home-built and largely unprotected email system for her personal and government emails, and also for her management of the scandal-wracked, foreign-funded foundation while she was working as Secretary of State. 
Clinton insists she’s handed over all of the government emails — which actually belong to the taxpayer — and insists she didn’t break the law by mixing personal and government business or by storing and swapping classified information on her own email network. The hidden 33,000 emails are just emails about her personal life, she says. 
Top Democrats have quietly slammed Clinton for her recklessness and ethical short-cuts, but the FBI leadership decided that she should not be charged with crimes in the run-up to the 2016 election. 
Since that decision was announced, there’s been growing evidence that the FBI and the Department of Justice handcuffed the FBI investigators and granted favorable treatment to Clinton’s staff. 
Now Sperry shows how Justice Department and FBI officials have also declined multiple opportunities to find copies of the missing 33,000 emails that would provide more evidence about whether Clinton was obeying or violating many federal laws: In a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton’s private server revealed that an underling didn’t bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton’s aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress. The Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta “created a ‘vehicle’ to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the ‘vehicle,’ but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.” Unless one of Clinton’s aides had the capability to log in to the PRN server as an administrator and remove a mailbox, her archived mailboxes more than likely still reside somewhere in that system. And they may also materialize on an internal “shared drive” that PRN created to control access to the Clinton email accounts among PRN employees. PRN has been under FBI order to preserve all emails and other evidence since the start of its investigation last year. Clinton’s missing “personal” emails may also be captured on a Google server. According to FBI notes, Combetta “transferred all of the Clinton email content to a personal Google email address he created.” Only the FBI never subpoenaed Google to find out. The FBI documents also reveal that Hillary’s server was mirrored on a cloud server in Pennsylvania maintained by Datto Inc., a tech firm that performs cloud-to-cloud data protection. When PRN contracted with Datto, it requested that Hillary’s server be backed up locally and privately. But the techs forgot to order the private node, and they sent the server backup data “remotely to Datto’s secure cloud and not to a local private node.” The FBI never subpoenaed Datto’s server, either.

Two US soldiers and four Afghan special forces were killed, and three other US soldiers wounded in heavy fighting with the Taliban this morning, as the Taliban attempted to surge into an area around the northern city of Kunduz. As they usually do, the troops called in airstrikes to “break the siege.” 
Instead of breaking the siege, the US warplanes pounded the village of Bouz Kandahari, destroying a number of houses and killing at least 30 civilians . 25 further civilians were wounded in the attack, fueling protests outside the governor’s office in Kunduz. 
NATO conceded immediately that the coalition was behind the airstrikes, but appeared relatively unrepentant about it, insisting all the civilian deaths were because the Taliban were using the houses for “cover,” which of course is not a legal justification for bombing the houses. 
US commander Gen. John Nicholson issued a statement after the incidents, offering condolences to the families of the two US soldiers who were slain. Defense Secretary Ash Carter also said he was “saddened” by the deaths of the US troops, but neither offered much of anything in comments on the dozens of dead civilians.

24953,Limbaugh: ’Women’s March’ at Trump Inauguration Will Be Nothing More Than a ’Golden Shower’ - Breitbart,"Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh dismissed the notion that   Donald Trump’s inauguration would be interfered with because of those there protesting the proceedings.  “That is going to peter out,” Limbaugh replied to the question from a caller. “That’s going to be nothing more than a golden shower.

24956,November 8th: American Spring reaches zenith with Donald Trump Presidency,"Font Size are they doing humankind? Elsewhere, the U.S. State Department operatives were busy little bees. Again through NGO involvement the warmongers set their sights on Ukraine. The bigger prize though was Russia. By launching the Maidan Color Revolution chicken hawks in the U.S. Congress hoped to establish a bridgehead on Russia's very borders; the duplicitous MSM reported this intervention in terms of their own bias; it was vital to stop to 'Russian aggression'. Each step of every day the Kiev coup murderers continued to vilify Russian President Vladimir Putin. Wise to the U.S. 'end game strategy', Crimea, home to the Russian Black Sea Naval fleet at Sevastopol, voted to accede to Russia. East Ukraine was not as fortunate. To this day, despite signing the Minsk II roadmap for peace agreement the Nazi Kiev hordes continue to terrorize Russian speakers in the Donbass region; innocent civilians are killed and maimed each day by prohibited artillery bombardment from Ukraine. Of course, the junta blames Russia for the hostilities. The Obama Administration goes further: it tries to lure President Putin into the fray. The Pentagon crazies chomp at the bit to engage Russia on an open but foreign battlefront. Several new war fronts. It will continue The Establishment was not done yet. With help from the usual suspect NGO's, NATO opened several new war fronts in the Middle East. Syria and its democratically elected President Assad are in their gun sights; tiny Yemen is another potential military target to be exploited by Washington; but the Houthi militia has put up a fierce resistance. Oddly enough ISIS or Daesh is never on America's military radar screens; but when Russia fights the Islamic Terrorists it is headline news. Since a desperate Clinton invoked the Big Daddy, err, Baghdadi name at the third debate, the Mosul Campaign in Northern Iraq has commenced. The biased MSM deny coincidence. No one buys it. Given the chaotic and disjointed foreign policy 'objectives' of this current U.S. Administration and its crooked backers, Republican candidate, Donald Trump was compelled to act; he stepped in. The Donald entered the breach. Using clear logic Donald Trump has enunciated to Americans what needs to be done: change course; turn 180 degrees. Moreover, Trump has identified and charged as incompetent the real culprits behind this disastrous policy. Chief amongst those is Democrat challenger Hillary Clinton. Clinton was the sole advocate for these failed foreign misadventures. And people are going to vote for her? As a former Secretary State, Clinton was the sole advocate for these failed foreign misadventures in the Middle East. While under oath she lied to Congress as to her real motivation: broker arms to 'moderate' rebel groups in Syria. She continues to lie to the American people about Benghazi. During the Commander-in-chief forum, Clinton claimed no Americans were lost in Libya. Clinton though was remiss to mention the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three others. Those four were murdered on her watch. With his legions of supporters massed around the country, Donald Trump is now poised to march on Washington, DC. All of the Establishment stooges are broken. Although they tried mightily the complicit media could not put Humpty-Dumpty-Frumpy candidate Hillary Clinton back together again. She is too far gone; with the help of Wikileaks, the electorate will soon learn more about her scandals and wanton corruption that she keeps hidden. Her feckless campaign is lost. Yes indeed; the one per centers got more than they bargained for; much to their angst. Contempt.... Scorn.... Slight regard.... Defiance! Come Election Day that is 'the movement's' message to the Establishment. American patriots are going for the knockout on November 8th. With President elect Donald Trump's help they will take their country back; make it great again! Montresor",0
24959,Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin Try to Create World Peace,"The Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin said that the political figures vowed to work together to improve U.S.-Russian relations and try to create world peace.
The statement issued by the Kremlin also stated that Trump and Putin discussed settling the crisis in Syria, and combating terrorism. They also agreed that their aides will work together to schedule a direct meeting.
Trump’s office declared in a statement that the Russian leader offered his congratulations before they discussed a range of issues. The numerous items included challenges and threats facing the U.S. and Russia. Strategic economic matters and the U.S.-Russia relationship that began over 200 years ago were also discussed.
After Trump’s triumph last week, the president-elect has received congratulatory calls from an enormous amount of foreign leaders. Putin sent the president-elect a statement concerning his desire to have a discussion based on a clear respect for each other’s political viewpoints.
Trump applauded Putin as an as a robust leader during his campaign. He also said that the two world leaders should collaborate to combat terrorists. The president-elect chiefly mentioned the Islamic State in Syria. He stated that closer relations with Russia would try to create world peace.
The Washington Post reported that the president-elect seemed to dismiss Russia’s responsibility for their annexation of Crimea and their intervention in the Ukraine. The future leader of the U.S. also questioned the relevance of NATO.
Trump and Putin agreed to share a common view in an attempt to ease tension between the U.S. and Russia. They want to unite their efforts against the common enemy and then fight international terrorism and extremism. The Kremlin declared that the two discussed ways to settle the Syrian crisis and create world peace.
The Kremlin added that they talked about ways to build commerce and induce constructive cooperation between the two nations. Next year, the U.S. and Russia will celebrate the 210-year-anniversary of the start of diplomatic relations. Russian officials stated that the date might encourage the progress of a relationship that would satisfy the interest of both countries.
Putin’s government said that Trump is looking forward to having a long-term and resilient relationship with Russia and the nation’s people. Putin stated that he is ready to have a discussion with Washington that it will be based on mutual respect. There will also be no intervention into each other’s affairs.
There will be no intervention into each other’s affairs. The Russian government believes that creating a solid root for bilateral ties is important. This was especially stressed by the rising trade-economic component.
The Kremlin stated that the two nations should return to a state of equally valuable cooperation. Putin said they will attempt to address the concern and try to ease the tension between the two nations and create world peace.

UK Telegraph Cardinal Vincent Nichols said immigrants had been enduring a worsening “atmosphere of fear” in the months since the EU referendum with the members of the public casually voicing hatred in a “self-indulgent” way. (Self-indulgent? I wonder what this French priest would have to say about that?) H e accused politicians of “trading in fear” and said media stories constantly portraying immigration in a negative light were proving “corrosive of our best nature”. In an interview with the BBC , he insisted that increasingly secular British society could learn much from the faith of new arrivals whether Muslims or followers of other religions. “Of course what we have to learn too is from the vibrancy of the Muslim faith that comes here. H e added: “I think the immigration crisis is real and it needs concerted effort to address it,” he said. “It needs to be addressed realistically with resources and proper legislation, but it’s almost impossible to do that in an atmosphere in which fear and hatred are the dominant features. “It does nobody any good, this somewhat self-indulgent way in which people have begun to express themselves and their distaste and their hatred of people who they see as different. “And that is creating a culture of fear among people who have been welcomed here.”",0
24964,Insane Ohio State Fan Blames Kicker for 31-Point Loss to Clemson - Breitbart,"Fans notoriously blame weird and bizarre things for the demise of their favorite sports teams, normally based on superstition or some kind of jinx. [Normally, normal people do not blame the person with the least impact on the game when their team gets blown out by 31 points. Then there’s this particular Ohio State fan.  After Ohio State got shut out in a bowl game on New Year’s Eve, for the first time since 1920, this fan found an unlikely culprit for his team’s blowout loss. He blamed Ohio State’s field goal kicker Tyler Durbin: Stay classy pic. twitter.   —   OSU Specialists (@BuckSpecialists) January 1, 2017,  To recap, Tyler Durbin missed two field goals. Had he made them, they would have resulted in exactly six points. Six points, in a game that Ohio State lost by 31. So how in the world can he be singled out and made responsible for the Buckeye’s loss? Meanwhile, Ohio State Quarterback J. T. Barrett had a QBR of 12. 7 on Saturday night, the Buckeye offensive line consistently gave up sacks when Clemson would only rush three or four players, and, let’s not forget, the Ohio State defense that allowed 470 yards and couldn’t get off the field. Any one of those factors would have had a far greater impact than Durbin, who would have had to kick and make eleven field goals in order to win the game for Ohio State. That’s asking a bit much.

24966,TRUMP CALLS FOR TEACHING ‘PATRIOTISM’ IN SCHOOLS,"Email 

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED THURSDAY PLANS TO SEEK NATIONWIDE CHANGES TO SCHOOL CURRICULA WITH THE GOAL OF “PROMOTING AMERICAN PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM IN AMERICA’S SCHOOLS.” 
“In a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America’s children,” Trump said, speaking at the American Legion’s annual convention in Cincinnati. 
“We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America’s history, its institutions and its heroes, many of whom are with us today,” he told the veterans group. 
The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law“We will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,” Trump said. 
Last year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. 
That sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. 
Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding. 
Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising “any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.”",0
24968,Capitol Police Officer Henry Cabrera Who Stopped Alexandria Shooter Is an Army Veteran,"Special Agent Henry Cabrera, a third Capitol Police officer who helped stop the massacre of GOP congressmen and their staff during baseball practice in Alexandria, VA, on Wednesday, went mostly overlooked. [Media attention primarily focused on hero Capitol Police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were wounded as they fired back at the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson.  But a third police officer, Henry Cabrera, who was also there at the time to protect House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) also helped take down the shooter, but was not wounded. Cabrera appears to be a U. S. Army veteran, according to his Facebook page. His page features a picture of himself in fatigues, and another of an Army platoon at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on Sept. 12, 1994. The unit is the 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment. Asked to confirm whether he is a veteran, Capitol Police Spokeswoman Eva Malecki responded, “We can’t comment any further on an ongoing investigation. ” However, a relative of Cabrera confirmed to Breitbart News that he is a veteran. Cabrera’s name became known to the public after Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa thanked him, Griner, and Bailey at a press conference on Wednesday. “I want to commend Special Agents Crystal Griner, David Bailey, and Henry Cabrera for their heroic and appropriate response in protecting the Members and others today during their practice for the Congressional baseball game,” he said. Cabrera posted on Facebook on Wednesday after the shooting: “Yesterday was   NUTS! !!! Many thanks to those who reached out to me yesterday. I’m proud of my TEAMMATES David Bailey and Crystal Griner. They took care of business! !!!! Prayers for Mr Scalise and his family. ” Supportive comments poured into Cabrera’s page and on Twitter. “Dont sell yourself short man. You are one of the heroes too!” a friend posted. There was a third officer there who should also be recognized. He just wasn’t wounded. Special Agent Henry Cabrera.  —   BAJ (@BarbAnnJ) June 15, 2017,  Why did CBS @CBSThisMorning NOT mention HENRY CABRERA from the Capital Police for his heroic actions??  —   teslaire (@teslaire) June 15, 2017,  Although details are scant, eyewitnesses say the officers took down Hodgkinson, 66, after he opened fire on Republican congressmen and their staff, critically wounding Scalise and lobbyist and former congressional staffer Matt Mika. Bailey, Griner, and an aide to Rep. Roger Williams ( ) Zach Barth, was also wounded. Those who were on the field that day credited the officers for saving their lives. Eyewitnesses said the officers stepped forward, towards the shooter, and saved everyone’s lives. “It could have easily been 25 deaths or more,” Williams said. “The thin blue line held today. And Americans everywhere should be thankful that it’s still the kind of country that produces these heroes. ” “Without the Capitol Police, who literally took a step forward   …     they saved all of us out there. There is no question about it. We had no arms, all we had were bats. And the shooter,” he added. Rep. Brad Wenstrup ( ) an Iraq veteran, said that after Hodgkinson fired at them with a rifle, he came out from behind a building with a pistol. “That’s when security detail was able to take him down,” he told ABC News. “You never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did,” Wenstrup tweeted later. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) who was also there at the scene, said it would have been a “massacre” without the Capitol Police. “I can tell you, that I think with absolute certainty, nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill Police. They saved everybody’s life,” he said. “It would have been a massacre without them. ”",0

24973,NATO Buildup On Russian Border Largest Since Cold War,"Videos NATO Buildup On Russian Border Largest Since Cold War The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A Romanian soldier secures the perimeter around Romanian Air Force F16 fighter jets parked on the runway of the Air Base 86, in Borcea, southern Romania, Friday, Oct. 7, 2016. 
In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. 
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. 
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia’s border. 
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia’s borders as part of a huge military deployment. 
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia’s borders since the Cold War. 
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. 
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. 
“This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday — ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. 
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‘prevent conflict.’ 
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else’s lands. 
“This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia’s) security posture,” Lute said. 
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. 
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. 
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.",0
24976,3 Brit judges attempt to thwart Brexit because their wigs will become too expensive!,"Saturday, 5 November 2016 He is the weirdest wig-wearing, hypocritical wanker since Prince John! 
In an unprecedented, unexpected move to thwart Brexit negotiations and hindering Mrs May triggering article 50, 3 British judges have found a massive loophole! 
It seems as though a hidden law found in the Magna Carta does not allow the British upper-class, royals and members of the legal fraternity wig wearers to purchase their wigs outside of Europe because of the fear of lice and other undesirable bugs hiding in the wigs! 
Prince John, a wig wearer and total nutter, demanded that wigs could only be purchased from renowned German wig-making company, Dummkopf & Co, founded by Herr Dummkopf (logical), whose portfolio of clients includes Nutty King Ludwig, Martin Luther (the white one), Wagner (The Nazi) Goring (He was one too), Mozart, Beethoven, etc, etc! 
The judges have been called ""enemies of the people"" by tabloids spreading their normal, slanderous, scandalous reports. However, the 3 judges are demanding that this ancient law must be implemented otherwise the price of their wigs will become too expensive because of import duty and German rascals pumping up the prices in Euro's as the GB Pound sinks out of trace! 
They are demanding that parliament must stop Brexit negotiations immediately! They have also asked the Scots and Northern Irish to organise referendums so they can eventually purchase their wigs via Edinburgh or Belfast because Scots are determined to stay in Europe even if they have to rebuild Hadrian's Wall! 
Nigel Farage's wig is wearing out rapidly, and being the mega-hypocrite that he is, ordered a new set of wigs from Herr Dummkopf, Made in Germany, before Mrs May eventually plunges the UK into an abyss that they will never get out of! Working class wig wearers don't give a wank because they wear cheap imitations from China and are only interested in cheap booze drying up in Calais! Make Jaggedone's  ",0

24982,New O’Keefe Video: Leftists Planning Stink Bombs at ’Deploraball’,"A new video released Monday by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas shows   activists allegedly planning to use butyric acid bombs  —   commonly known as “stink bombs”  —   to disrupt an event scheduled for the week of Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th President of the United States. [The leftists captured on film were allegedly targeting the Deploraball, a   event being held on Thursday at the National Press Club “to celebrate and honor   …     the passionate citizens who worked social media, knocked on doors, and endured harassement to support” Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.  On Friday, several news outlets reported that a group of   activists from the “D. C.   Coalition,” part of a broader effort called “#DisruptJ20” (for January 20th, the date of the inauguration) had been captured on tape discussing plans to crash the Deplorable, disrupt the parade at the inauguration, and target specific individuals. Now, Project Veritas reveals just how the   #DisruptJ20 activists may have been prepared to go. According to the video, they allegedly planned to place explosive “stink bomb” devices at the party and, if those failed, to trigger the fire sprinkler system, forcing attendees to evacuate outside in cold weather conditions.  One activist is also heard on the video to threaten the city government of Washington, D. C. and the police: The message has to be, we do not recognize the city government either. If you try to close us down we will look for your house, we will burn it. We will physically fight the police if they try to steal one of our places. We will go to war and you will lose. During the campaign, O’Keefe and Project Veritas exposed efforts by the   activists contracted to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to stage protests at Republican events, and to incite violence at Donald Trump’s events in particular. Their goal was to create, in their words, a sense of “anarchy” around the candidate. Now, O’Keefe has apparently revealed further plans to create anarchy and disorder around Trump’s inauguration. And, as he points out in the video, the actions planned by the activists could run afoul of   laws. O’Keefe and Project Veritas say that they shared the results of their investigation with the FBI, the Secret Service, and the D. C. Metro Police. In commenting on the video, O’Keefe concludes: “Just to be clear, we don’t have a problem with people protesting peacefully or voicing their First Amendment rights, that’s protected by the Constitution. But in this case, Disrupt J20 says openly that their plan is to shut down the inauguration. The question is where do these people draw the line. ” The video released Monday is Part One of a continued investigation by Project Veritas, which plans to release other videos later in the week.

Their members also include at least two police officers, though it remains unclear whether they are still on the force.
“The low membership numbers cannot discount the danger that emanates from such organizations,” Left Party politician Monika Renner told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. 
Germany is currently seeing a surge in hate crimes following the acceptance of an estimated one million refugees last year. The Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), Germany’s intelligence agency, recorded 990 hate crimes in 2014, and 1,408 in 2015. 
The BfV also recorded 75 arson attacks on refugee centers in 2015. There were just five such attacks in 2014. © AFP 2016/ Sven Hoppe “One thing is clear – a state under the rule of law can never accept racist violence. We need to do everything we can to quickly catch the perpetrators and rigorously punish them,” German Justice Minister Heiko Maas stated.
Amnesty International has stated that their researchers observed an 87 percent increase in hate crimes between 2013-2015. “With hate crimes on the rise in Germany, long-standing and well-documented shortcomings in the response of law enforcement agencies to racist violence must be addressed,” Marco Perolini, Amnesty International’s European Union researcher, stated . “There are many factors that point to the existence of institutional racism with German law enforcement agencies. This question needs to asked, and it needs to be answered… This is not a time for complacency, but for law enforcement agencies to take a long, hard look in the mirror.” 
The nation has also seen a rise in sexual assault, theft, and rape, especially by people with refugee status. There has been a noticeable uptick since the mass attacks on New Year’s Eve in Cologne. ...",0

24991,Fox News Dropping ’Fair and Balanced’ Slogan - Breitbart,"Fox News is no longer “Fair and Balanced. ”[The cable news channel is reportedly set to drop its    marketing slogan in an effort to distance itself from its former chief Roger Ailes, who invented it when he launched the network in 1996, according to New York magazine.  Instead, staffers at Fox have reportedly been asked to use its other,    slogan: “Most Watched. Most Trusted. ” A source at the network reportedly told New York that the switch “won’t affect programming or editorial decisions. ” The news comes as Fox News continues to move away from the Ailes era under the guidance of Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan. Ailes, the principal architect of Fox who changed the cable news business forever,  resigned from the network last year under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations and died in May at age 77. The network has undergone significant changes in recent weeks following the departure of longtime star anchor Bill O’Reilly, whose O’Reilly Factor was the   cable news program for more than a decade. O’Reilly left the network this year after the New York Times reported that he had paid millions of dollars to settle multiple sexual harassment claims. In his place, Fox News brought on former Crossfire host Tucker Carlson to anchor the 8 p. m. hour and moved its panel show The Five into the 9 p. m. slot. Sean Hannity remained on at 10 p. m. The network remains the   on television, but has come under increasing pressure as MSNBC and its star anchor, Rachel Maddow, have benefitted from critical coverage of President Donald Trump. During one week in May, Fox News dropped to third place in the key demo in primetime behind MSNBC and CNN, the first time that had happened in 17 years.

The United Nations has a long history of insulting, disparaging and attacking Israel. It’s press corps now seems to want to selectively remove Israel from its records. 
On October 16, 2015, the UN Security Council met to discuss the violence in the Middle East. US Ambassador Samantha Power delivered her remarks about her “ deep concern… about the current situation. ” She specifically condemned the violence in “ Jerusalem, the West Bank, Israel and the Gaza Strip. ” However, when the UN media center summarized her remarks, it stated that the US condemned the violence in “ Jerusalem, West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere .” “Elsewhere”? Really? Was writing “Israel” too difficult? Was acknowledging the stabbings and attacks in Israel too controversial? 
When the Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs at the UN, Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, gave an update on the situation, he described the violence in “ the West Bank, Jerusalem and East Jerusalem ,” but the press corps just mentioned a “ deadly week in the West Bank ” removing any mention of Jerusalem. 
Most alarmingly, the Assistant Secretary General welcomed “ Prime Minister Netanyahu’s repeated assurances that Israel has no intentions of changing the historic status quo at the holy sites ,” but the UN media completely omitted the statement in its coverage. As the Temple Mount rumor was the rallying cry for Palestinian extremists to engage in violence, shouldn’t that have been prominently highlighted, not ignored?

24994,PICS: Rioting Continues in France Over Alleged Police Rape,"BOBIGNY (FRANCE) (AFP)  —   Police fired tear gas after clashes erupted in the suburbs of Paris as demonstrators protested over the assault of a young black man who was allegedly anally raped with a truncheon while being arrested. [Surrounded by a heavy police contingent, about 2, 000 protesters, some carrying placards saying “Police rape” and “Police kill innocent people,” gathered in Bobigny, northeast of the French capital, to demand “Justice for Theo”.  Theo, a    black youth worker, required surgery after his arrest on February 2 in the “3, 000” estate in the gritty suburb of    when he claims a police officer sodomised him with a baton. Projectiles were thrown at police on a footbridge with several vehicles torched and windows smashed on the sidelines of the protest, police said. “Several hundred violent and very mobile individuals” committed various “acts of violence and damage,” said the Paris police prefecture. In a statement it listed projectiles thrown against public buildings, four vehicles torched, two shops and a bus station damaged and several bins burned. “The police had to intervene to rescue a young child in a burning vehicle,” the police said, adding however that no injuries had been reported so far during the protest. Two media vehicles were also attacked, with no casualties reported. The demonstration ended in the evening after police fired tear gas. Theo, who is still in hospital, and his family have appealed for calm after several days of protests over the alleged assault. Rape charges have been filed against the officer and all four police involved in Theo’s    have been suspended pending an investigation. With a presidential election this year, the incident has become highly politicised. It has also underscored the breakdown in trust between young people and the authorities in French suburbs. “All the time, we get checks, we get assaulted, they talk trash to us, we say, ‘Shut up’  …     We are given little slaps,” a young man of about 20 named Kenzo told AFP. “I didn’t think it still exists,” said    Anissa. ”How can they say it’s an accident?” Rallies took place in other French cities, including Rouen where some 200 people demonstrated, while around 250 gathered in Toulouse and more than 300 in Nantes.",0
24999,Militarized Police Brutalize and Arrest Peaceful Protesters at Dakota Access Pipeline #NoDAPL,"
As of October 29, there have been at least 141 arrests of peaceful protesters at the Standing Rock Reservation who are attempting to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which poses a major threat to the drinking water of all people at Standing Rock.
Paid for by Energy Transfer Partners , parent company to Dakota Access LLC, the DAPL is set to be embedded in a sacred burial ground at Standing Rock. This is the same area where DAPL security used attack dogs on peaceful people to intimidate protesters. Police snipers were seen peaking out of armored vehicles, aiming directly at unarmed protesters.
These water protectors have been brutalized by officers who are using the color of law to help Dakota Access LLC trample on the the 1851 treaty between the US and the Cheyenne, Sioux, Arapaho, Crow, Assiniboine, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara nations.

Protesters who were arrested had handcuffs or zipties placed fixed to their wrists, they were stuffed into cages made for dogs and over-crowded cells, and they had numbers written on their arms, many of them having been brutally assaulted, tazed or even maced. Women were strip-searched in front of male officers. According to protesters, an elderly woman who had diabetes had blood sugar level of 488, which is dangerously high, and she was given no medical attention; they merely released her to deal with whatever health complications she had completely on her own.
Zip ties were used to bind people’s hands, and a number of protesters reported that these zip ties were tied so tightly around protester’s wrists that their hands were turning purple as a result of reduced blood circulation.
Cars in the area were impounded. Officers had accessed the vehicles, allegedly to search them, but protesters are concerned that officers would be able to plant contraband in order to expand the charges against protesters.
Over the weekend, an anonymous donor gave $173,000 to bail out protesters from jail.

25003,"Internet Mogul Kim Dotcom: More Leaks Coming, “Clinton Is in Serious Trouble”","
The brilliant Internet mogul Kim Dotcom – founder of the file-sharing website Megaupload – said on Monday that there are more Clinton emails that will be published, and the results will be devastating for the Democratic candidate.
There's unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble.
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) November 1, 2016 

There is speculation that Dotcom is referring to the 33,000 missing Clinton emails…and that someone has them (possibly WikiLeaks) and will be releasing them soon.
From The New Zealand Herald :
Dotcom has previously hinted that Wikileaks is in possession of the missing emails, which Clinton acknowledged erasing rather than turning over to the State Department upon her retirement, claiming they were not work-related.
Dotcom last week made a joking reference to the BleachBit software Clinton used to delete the emails, writing “Bleachbit(ch) can’t bleach it.”
Shortly after, he then tweeted directly at Wikileaks writing “Oh no!” with a video of him reacting to audio saying “You’ve got mail.”
And days before on October 27, he wrote that he knew where the deleted emails are and how to get them legally.
“I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump. 100% true. Retweet,” he wrote.
Dotcom pointed out something many have wondered about…
“They are all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah. Congress or Senate can request the emails from the NSA.”
William Binney, architect of NSA mass surveillance system has confirmed that the NSA must have the deleted Clinton emails, by design. @FBI 
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 30, 2016 

I think the FBI has found Clintons deleted emails in NSA spy cloud and now use Wiener laptop as a front to protect NSA secrets. Fine by me 
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 31, 2016 

Last year, Dotcom – who has a long-standing relationship with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange – said that Assange would be Clinton’s worst nightmare in 2016 because he “has access to information.”
The FBI is currently searching a laptop that belonged to Anthony Weiner, Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s estranged husband, for any emails from Clinton’s private server.
Dotcom just might be the most fascinating person on Twitter. Take a look at some other things he’s had to say lately…
Hillary, who signed my extradition request, will get busted by the same mass surveillance system the US Govt used to spy on me unlawfully.

The US Govt keeps underestimating the strength of oppressed people who'll fight for what's right even if it results in their crucifixion.

25008,"Betrügt Ritter Sport? Fleisch in ""Einhorn-Schokolade"" offenbar nur vom Pegasus","Donnerstag, 3. November 2016 Betrügt Ritter Sport? Fleisch in ""Einhorn-Schokolade"" offenbar nur vom Pegasus Waldenbuch (dpo) - Droht uns der nächste große Lebensmittelskandal? Offenbar enthält die derzeit euphorisch bejubelte ""Einhorn-Schokolade"" von Ritter Sport statt echtem Einhorn lediglich billiges Pegasus-Fleisch. Das fand ein Labor für Lebensmittelanalyse in Hamburg heraus. ""Ich war sofort skeptisch, als ich hörte, dass die Firma Ritter Sport Einhorn-Schokolade anbietet"", erklärt Lebensmittelchemiker Udo Wörne. ""Jeder weiß doch, dass Einhörner unglaublich selten sind und Schokolade mit Einhornfleisch wohl kaum für 1,99 Euro pro Tafel angeboten werden kann."" Und tatsächlich: Laboranalysen ergaben, dass in der vermeintlichen Einhorn-Schokolade noch nicht einmal Spuren von Einhorn enthalten sind. Stattdessen besteht das Produkt aus Milchschokolade und mit Lebensmittelfarbe bunt eingefärbtem Pegasusfleisch. Bis auf Kopf, Schweif und Hufe werden fast alle Teile eines Pegasusses verarbeitet. Udo Wörne wundert das wenig: ""Weil Einhorn mit Preisen von bis zu 5.000 Euro pro Kilogramm kaum bezahlbar ist, greifen viele Hersteller auf wesentlich günstigeres Pegasusfleisch zurück."" Die geflügelten Pferde werden meist ähnlich wie Schweine oder Geflügel massenhaft in großen Hallen gehalten, wobei ihnen in regelmäßigen Abständen die Schwungfedern gestutzt werden, um Fluchtversuche zu unterbinden. Einhörner dagegen gelten als äußerst empfindlich und verenden in Gefangenschaft in der Regel innerhalb weniger Wochen jämmerlich. In Produkten, die tatsächlich echtes Einhorn enthalten, sind daher fast immer wilde Einhörner verarbeitet. Diese werden mit Netzen gefangen und dann mit einem sogenannten Einhornhaken aus Metall ausgeweidet. Geschmacklich unterscheiden sich Pegasus und Einhorn gravierend. ""Einhornfleisch ist sehr zart und hat einen leichten Nachgeschmack nach Regenbogen. Pegasus hingegen ist faserig und erinnert geschmacklich an eine Mischung aus Maulesel und Pute."" ssi, dan, fed; Foto oben: Shutterstock/Hersteller, Foto unten: Shutterstock Artikel teilen:",0

25010,Putin: Russia Is Not Going to Attack Anyone,"Claims of Russian Threats 'Simply Stupid' by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
Complaining about Western “hysteria” surrounding repeated predictions of Russian military attacks on NATO member nations, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to resolve two solid years of predictions to that effect with a straightforward assurance that “Russia is not going to attack anyone .” 
Putin accused Western nations of having “mythical, dreamt-up problems,” and insisted the idea that Russia was going to attack the West was “ simply stupid and unrealistic .” He added that he believes the idea is being played up to justify bigger military spending. 
The Russian president also sought to dismiss allegations that he is plotting to rig the US elections to his own benefit, noting that the US is a great power and not some banana republic with an easily manipulated political system. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots. 
NATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border, with ever-growing numbers announced all the time. Such predictions started after the ouster of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine led to a civil war in that country’s east, with NATO military leaders repeatedly predicting Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine into NATO countries.

Gelobeter has since been blocked indefinitely from Wikipedia.  A course description for Gelobter’s course on environmental justice activism at UC Berkeley posted on Wikipedia argued that the first few months of the Trump administration have been uniquely “  sexist, and racist. ” This semester represents a unique moment in history  …    the first few months of a historically unique U. S. President whose agenda has been explicitly   sexist, and racist. This course will use this moment in two ways: • First, as a learning opportunity for students to engage with critical issues as they emerge on the social, economic, policy, and political landscape • Second, to be of service by documenting key developments and creating a neutral source of information about them. The post was ultimately removed, as Wikipedia prevents unsourced negative claims about living people. A Wikipedia editor said that the line about the Trump administration was a “blatant BLP [Biography of Living Person] violation,” which means that commentary on a living person does not come from a “neutral point of view. ” As part of Gelobter’s course, students created Wikipedia articles that advanced an   agenda, containing   critiques of Trump’s EPA policy among others. Wikipedia edit projects are now common in the social justice sectors of academia. Feminists at Oberlin, Bucknell, and Temple University hosted Wikipedia    events during the   academic year. Commenting on this trend, Wikipedia user “Jytdog” argued that academia does not have the right to take over articles for the purpose of education. “Wikipedia is the commons and governed by community policies and guidelines. Just like companies don’t have the right to dump things into public waters, classes don’t have the right to take over space in the commons for classwork. Can you see that?” he wrote.

25015,Global Debt Grows and Central Banks Are Buyers,"The IMF reported last week that global debt hit a record $152 trillion. I’m old enough to remember when a million was a lot, and in the past two decades we have blown right through talking of millions and billions and are now throwing around trillions like its nothing… By Tim Taschler
Much of this debt has been purchased by none other than the big central banks. Sunday, Bloomberg reported that central bank assets have grown at the fastest pace in five years, topping $21 trillion:

The world’s biggest central banks are bulking up their balance sheets this year at the fastest pace since 2011’s European debt crisis to boost lackluster economic recoveries with asset purchases that are supporting stock and bond prices. 
The 10 largest lenders now own assets totaling $21.4 trillion, a 10 percent increase from the end of last year, data collected by Bloomberg show. Their combined holdings grew by 3 percent or less in both 2015 and 2014. 

You might think that with all this zero-rate and negative-rate money sloshing around that liquidity in the markets would not be an issue. But take a look at what happened in the forex markets last week. The British Pound (GBP), which is a major currency and heavily traded, took a 6% dive in less than two minutes. For reference, anyone watching the forex markets knows that a 1-2% move in the currency world is considered a big move, and 6% in two minutes is certainly not expected in something as liquid as the Pound.

The explanations for this move range from the standard “fat thumb” (i.e. someone inadvertently typed some extra zeros onto a sell ticket and swamped the market) to the easy-to-blame algo computers. Regardless of the reason, if there was one other than someone simply dumping a large number of Pounds onto the market, this type of thing shouldn’t really happen with so much liquidity sloshing around. People are certainly becoming complacent with ‘flash’ crashes, as if they are a normal occurrence and nothing to pay any attention to. I disagree. I think it could be a ‘tell’ and something to keep an eye on.
Think about where we are since 2008. The Fed keeps yapping about raising rates and normalization (though they do little other than talk), which has resulted in bond prices lower and interest rates higher. This is going to put enormous pressure on banks, pension funds and anyone else with a large amount of Sovereign bonds. A bond trader friend of mine told me that seeing all these bonds trading above par (i.e. over their face value) is going to lead to a massive problem. If you pay $1,100 for a $1,000 bond, you are only going to get $1,000 at maturity. At some point there will be losses as these bonds are marked back to par ahead of maturity.
Maybe the central bankers will be able to print and talk their way through to some successful outcome without actually raising rates. Or maybe they can have rates rise without causing some major dislocation in more asset classes, whether it be bonds, stocks, forex or commodities. But then again, maybe they can’t and that is why so many large, successful investors such as Soros, Druckenmiller and Buffett are sitting with large allocations of cash. With moves like we had in the Pound last week, it seems that the end game might be drawing near, and people might just want to be a little careful in the construction of their portfolios.

25016,Falcons’ Matt Ryan Is Named M.V.P. of N.F.L. - The New York Times,"HOUSTON  —   Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was named the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player on Saturday, 24 hours before he was to try to cap his superb season with Super Bowl glory. Ryan, 31, got his first M. V. P. Award by collecting 25 of the votes while his opposite number in Sunday’s Super Bowl, the New England Patriots’ Tom Brady, finished with 10. Brady has won the award twice, for the 2007 and 2010 seasons. Ryan’s award came after a dazzling season for Atlanta’s offense in which he finished with 4, 944 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and only seven interceptions. Super Bowl LI on Sunday will be his first appearance in the title game. Brady, who is chasing his fifth Super Bowl victory, finished the season with 3, 554 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and two interceptions but played in four fewer games than Ryan because of his Deflategate suspension. Unsurprisingly, Ryan also picked up the Offensive Player of the Year Award. Ryan had the best season of his career after spending last summer working intensively on his throwing motion at a Los Angeles training camp. He averaged slightly over nine yards per pass, the highest rate ever for a quarterback with more than 400 completions in a season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award went to the Oakland Raiders’ Khalil Mack, whose season included 11 sacks, five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and an interception returned for a touchdown as the Raiders reached the playoffs. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was a surprise pick, ahead of his teammate Ezekiel Elliott, for offensive rookie of the year. Prescott, who played the entire season for Dallas after Tony Romo injured his back in the preseason, drew 28 of 50 votes, beating out Elliott, who finished as the   with 21 votes.

""Ich suche eine abenteuerlustige Frau (20-35), mit der man Pferde stehlen kann"", schrieb der 35-Jährige nach Polizeiangaben wörtlich in sein Profil auf der Datingplattform. Seine Komplizin müsse dabei ""zu jeder Schandtat bereit"" sein. Haben nichts mehr zu befühüühhühhüühühürchten: Pferde ""Das stellt nach unserer Ansicht ganz klar eine Anstiftung zu einer Straftat dar"", erklärt Polizeidirektor Norbert Frieß. Derzeit prüfe man auch, ob sich der mutmaßliche Viehdieb zusätzlich wegen des Versuchs der Bildung einer kriminellen Vereinigung (§ 129 StGB) strafbar gemacht habe. Der Verdächtige hatte offensichtlich klare Vorstellungen von seiner möglichen Komplizin. Sie solle sportlich sein, nicht rauchen und Sonnenuntergänge mögen. ""Kein Wunder: Das Stehlen von Pferden ist ein körperlich sehr forderndes Verbrechen und wird in der Regel nachts durchgeführt"", so Frieß. Das Vorgehen des Verdächtigen scheint eine beliebte Masche zu sein. Allein im zweiten Quartal dieses Jahres konnte die Polizei durch das wachsame Prüfen von Kontaktbörsen und Zeitungsannoncen deutschlandweit über 250 Pferdediebstähle bereits im Planungsstadium vereiteln. Doch auch andere zwielichtige Geschäfte werden oft über Online-Partnerbörsen abgewickelt. So deuten zahlreiche Einträge auf einen regen illegalen Tierhandel hin, bei dem von Mäusen über Tiger, Bären und andere exotische Tiere bis hin zu ""Dreilochstuten"" alles gesucht und angeboten wird. ssi, dan; Idee: gul; Fotos: Shutterstock; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 10.11.15 Artikel teilen:",0
25021,"Donald Trump to leave America for a younger, sexier country","Thursday 10 November 2016 by Davywavy Donald Trump to leave America for a younger, sexier country 
President-elect Donald Trump has already got a much younger, sexier county lined up to replace America in his affections. 
Concerns have already been raised after Trump demanded America enter into a pre-nup before he takes the oath of office. 
Trump, who has already been accused of screwing Mexico when he thinks he can get away with it, defended his roving eye by saying that ‘any President’ would check out hot, available countries and there was nothing wrong with it. 
Trump’s penchant for ‘exotic’ foreign names is well recorded, and the people of Brunei Darussalam are already concerned after he commented on ‘getting his tongue around their name’. 
Meanwhile, members of NATO and the UN have been told to ‘put out or get out’ in what is being interpreted as a direct demand for favours. 
“Look, if Puerto Rico weren’t a protectorate, I’d already be all over them. If I weren’t already their president and, you know, Is that terrible? Is it?”, he told reporters. 
“And the Russian Republic. Daughter of the Soviet Union, sure, but they’re only 23 years old. And they’re big, voluptuous, you might say. That’s pretty sexy, am I right? 
“I wonder if they’ve got a, you know, opening I might fill.” 
North Korea, who are into uniforms and BDSM, have already signalled their willingness to enter into an affair with the President no matter what the consequences for him at home. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",0
25024,"In Bundy Acquittal, Jury Tells Feds: Enough Is Enough","The Bundy brothers and their comrades were clearly guilty. 
They took over the national wildlife refuge, threatened violence if accosted, and wouldn’t let anyone in. 
However, the Portland jury acquitted Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five others of conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. The jury could not reach a verdict on a single count of theft for Ryan Bundy. 
The charges were conspiring to impede federal workers from doing their jobs and that’s exactly what they did. 
But in the end, the jury acquitted them . 
The jury wasn’t dumb, or blackmailed or somehow brainwashed. They were sick and tired. 
Sick and tired of a bureaucracy in Washington that didn’t listen to them. That dictated use of their lands from thousands of miles away with an iron fist. 
It was a classic case of jury nullification : where despite the evidence, the jury is so convinced that the laws are immoral or so wrongly applied that the accused must be set free. 
And so Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan and their five co-defendants were found not guilty. Most of them were set free from the courtroom. Ammon faces charges in Nevada, so he is still being held. 
As the Associated Press reported it, even lawyers for the Bundys were shocked at the verdict: 
“It’s stunning. It’s a stunning victory for the defense,” said Robert Salisbury, attorney for defendant Jeff Banta. “I’m speechless.” 
The U.S Attorney in Oregon, Billy J. Williams, issued a statement defending the decision to bring charges against the seven defendants: “We strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried, and decided by a jury.” 
This is what happens when the American people see an out-of-control Washington bureaucracy: They ignore them. They ignore the law and decide for themselves that no, these people shall be set free. 
While courts are reluctant to inform juries of their right to “nullify,” that’s exactly what they can do. 
Effectively, the jury nullifies a law they believe is either immoral or wrongly applied to the defendant, and that’s what happened here. 
And it bodes well for America. Jury nullification sends a messages to prosecutors and lawmakers about their priorities and about what they see as harassing or abusive prosecutions. 
A professor at the University of Missouri at Kansas City wrote about how important the power of jury nullification really is: 
Juries clearly have the power to nullify; whether they also have the right to nullify is another question. Once a jury returns a verdict of “Not Guilty,” that verdict cannot be questioned by any court and the “double jeopardy” clause of the Constitution prohibits a retrial on the same charge. 
So whether the Bundy’s antics were stupid or dangerous or just plain wrong, it doesn’t matter. The Portland jury found that in this case – the seven defendants were to be set free because in our court system, a jury of their peers felt the government went too far . 
Yes, this is good news for America, for the people, for the rule of law and for the right of the people to object. To say: “ No. We will stand for this no longer.”",0
25026,Egypt: Christian Couple Stabbed to Death on Coptic Christmas Day,"At least three members of the Coptic Christian minority have been killed so far this year in Egypt, including a couple found in their bed with their throats slit on January 6, the traditional Coptic Christmas Day, reports Christian Today, citing World Watch Monitor (WWM). [The couple has been identified by WWM, an organization that covers Christian persecution across the globe, as Gamal Sami, 60, and his wife, Nadia, 48.  While police have cited robbery as the motivation for the deaths, the woman’s brother and the first person to reach the crime scene, Magdy Amin Girgis, has suggested they were murdered because of their faith, noting that nothing had been taken from the couple’s home. Girgis told the Christian organization that he found the couple with their throats cut and “drenched in blood,” still on their bed. WWM notes: The murders followed another deadly attack on a Coptic Christian only three days earlier. Youssef Lamei was murdered in Alexandria on 3 January by an alleged “professional” killer. The attack on the couple bore similarities with Lamei’s murder, according to reports. The main suspects for the double killing are two men known only as Mohammad M and Abd   Q, according to the police. It is understood that the two men did not know their victims. The couple is reportedly from the mainly Christian village of Tukh   near Tala, home to three churches that canceled their Christmas services to mourn the dead. In a recent   the Chronicle Herald from Canada argues that Egypt’s Coptic Christians, who make up an estimated ten percent of the country’s population of nearly 95 million, are facing an increase in violent attacks. A terrorist attack against a Coptic church in the Egyptian capital of Cairo killed at least 25 Christians in December. The Islamic State ( ) took responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, the administration of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   accused the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist group in Egypt and other   countries. Egypt’s Coptic Pope Tawadros II told Egyptian lawmakers in 2016 that there has been at least one attack against Christians per month during the past three years. The Chronicle Herald opinion article points out that law enforcement seldom investigates the crimes. According to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, about 77 incidents of sectarian violence between 2011 and 2016 in Minya province south of Cairo, home to Egypt’s largest Christian community, have occurred. Egyptian Coptic Pope Tawadros has accused media outlets of reporting false news about the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Egypt. “Egypt is not the best society in the world, but both its people and its leadership are trying to become the best society,” declared the pope. Nevertheless, the Chronicle Herald opines, “Increasingly, Egyptian Christians are speaking out against the government, ignoring the wishes of the church.",0
25030,"Disney under Investigation for H-1B Abuse, Say Feds","The Walt Disney Company and other employers regularly utilizing the   visa program are under investigation for alleged abuse, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter to Congress. [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acting director James McCament wrote in a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) that there are “multiple investigations” of employers who use the   visa.  Every year, more than 100, 000 foreign workers are brought to the U. S. on the   visa. Most recently, that number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands annually, as universities and   are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U. S. through the visa, Americans are often replaced. Among those being investigated, USCIS confirmed, are Disney, Eversource Energy —  formerly Northeast Utilites —  and the University of California San Francisco. “U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has participated in multiple investigations regarding the possible misuse of the   visa program by employers  …    ” McCament wrote in the letter. Northeast Utilities was most recently called out for their mass   of Americans who were subsequently forced to train their foreign replacements. Fired tech worker Craig Diangelo announced to Breitbart Texas that he would be running for Congress in Connecticut’s Fifth District as a result. Diangelo said in 2013, he was working at Eversource Energy, when suddenly the company partnered with Infosys and Tata Consulting Service to replace at least 220 Americans with Indian nationals coming to the U. S. through the  . Meanwhile, the Disney corporation laid off nearly 250 American IT staff and replaced them with   laborers, leading 30 of those laid off to file a discrimination lawsuit, as Breitbart Tech reported. This year, the University of California San Francisco was hit with a lawsuit by replaced Americans after firing 50   and 30 contractors, outsourcing their jobs through   HCL, Breitbart Tech reported. USCIS’ letter to Grassley also noted that in accordance with President Donald Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” Executive Order, the agency would “propose new rules and issue new guidance relating the   visa program. ” “In particular, in accordance with the Executive Order, the proposed new rules and guidance would seek to supersede or revise previous rules and guidance in ways that would protect the interests of U. S. workers, including through the prevention of fraud and abuse,” the letter stated. The Trump Administration, in recent months, has increased pressure on outsourcing firms and   employers. In April, a White House briefing statement called out, as Breitbart Texas reported, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Cognizant —  all of which are responsible for the mass replacement of Americans at companies like Carnival Corporation and MassMutual Life Insurance. “And you’ve seen some of these   examples where you have career employees at a company who have been working there for 10, 20 years, and then they get laid off and they hire a contracting firm using H1B workers at much less pay,” the statement said. “And again, this is an issue that labor unions have called attention to for a long time. ” John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

25035,Receipt Found On One of the Men on José Fernández's Boat Shakes Up the Idea That Alcohol 'Wasn't a Factor’,"Share on Twitter 
It's been just over one month since José Fernández and two of his friends, Emilio Jesus Macias and Eduardo Rivero, passed away in a boating accident during the early morning hours of September 25th. 
According to reports , Fernández's boat was traveling at high speeds when it hit a jetty. Image Credit: Manny Hernandez/Getty Images 
While initial reports indicated that alcohol was not a factor in the crash, it is now believed that the men were drinking the night of the accident. 
As the Miami Herald reports, the search warrant affidavit suggests that the diver could smell a “heavy” alcohol odor on Fernández and his friends. 
The last known picture taken of Fernández the night he died was outside the dockside bar American Social. Managers of the bar confirmed that Fernández and his two friends were there, but it's unknown if the men were drinking. 
The affidavit says that the driver of the vessel was driving with “recklessness” that was “exacerbated by the consumption of alcohol,” according to the Herald. And while toxicology reports have been completed, the report has not yet been released by investigators. Breaking: Jose Fernandez, companions had strong odor of alcohol after fatal crash https://t.co/KLmreMpv3n pic.twitter.com/BfcpBaXmAv — Miami Herald (@MiamiHerald) October 26, 2016 
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) says that it found a receipt for alcohol in one of the victims' pockets that was stamped the same date as the accident. The Miami Herald reported that the affidavit also states that the associate medical examiner who conducted the autopsies shows that all three men had water in the lungs and trauma consistent with a boat crash. 
The exact cause of death, however, was not mentioned. 
It also hasn't yet been confirmed who was driving the boat. Speaking with the Miami Herald, FWC spokesperson Lorenzo Veloz, says that he had been on Fernández’s boat “several times, but that Fernández had not been captain;” it's unknown how much experience Fernandez had captaining the boat. 
The affidavit states that the crimes being investigating are Boating Homicide While Intoxicated and Vessel Homicide. However, because all three men who were on the boat are deceased, it is unclear against whom charges could be brought. It is also unclear whether civil charges will be brought.

Hopefully, now that more information regarding the accident has been made available, the families, friends, and fans of the men on the boat can start finding closure. 
According to the United States Coast Guard's recreational boating statistics , in 2014 there were over 4,000 boating accidents. Over 11 percent of those accidents occurred in Florida, and alcohol was the reason behind over 250 of the accidents. 
Fernández was seen as the future of major league baseball. At just 24 years old, Fernández had 76 career starts during his three years with the Miami Marlins, striking out over 500 of his opponents. He was well on his way to becoming one of the greats.

Trump promised something that NO DEMOCRAT has cared enough to attempt, in decades. Our next President proposed and detailed a critically important ""NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA"". Story: www.nbcnews.com... It's a damn shame that Barack Hussein Obama completely ignored the/his Black community after receiving their votes. Now, Hillary Clinton is following in his footsteps.. She's blindly assuming that because she's a Democrat, and was endorsed by Barack Obama, the African American community will ""fall in line"" like good little mindless minions, and cast their 16 million votes for her, like they did for Obama in 2012. This cycle, open-minded Black Americans who refuse to be FOOLED AGAIN, are indeed going to give Donald Trump a try. As you can see from this video of boxing promoter DON KING introducing Donald Trump to a church filled with Black ministers and community leaders in Ohio last month, important segments of the community are tired of being lied to, screwed by, and ignored by, DEMOCRATS that they voted for! Don King Introduces Donald Trump (C-Span Video): www.youtube.com... For obvious reasons, the ""old guard"" community leaders like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, along with the NAACP, are not in Donald Trump's corner. But what's most telling, is that they are not out there at rallies raising Hillary's arm to roaring crowds of supporters either. Probably because they know Hillary is lying when she exclaims, ""I ain't in no ways ever tired of fightin for youuu!"" in Black churches. In 30 years, she's done NOTHING for no one except herself, Chelsea, and Saudi Arabian women abusers. -CareWeMust",0
25042,Un exorcista presentará la nueva temporada de “Hermano Mayor”,"Un exorcista presentará la nueva temporada de “Hermano Mayor” EL PADRE CARRASCO LIDIARÁ CON ADOLESCENTES CONFLICTIVOS ""CON UNA BUENA HOSTIA A TIEMPO"" televisión 
El padre Carrasco, párroco en una iglesia de Ourense, sustituirá al exboxeador Jero García al frente del programa “Hermano Mayor”, en el que un experto lidia con adolescentes conflictivos. Así lo anunciaba Toribio Vallés, director de programación de Cuatro, en rueda de prensa. La cadena de Mediaset cree que Carrasco es la persona adecuada por su perfil “conciliador, sereno y acostumbrado al trato con criaturas diabólicas”. 
El cura confesó que la llamada de Cuatro le sorprendió más que la de Cristo. “El de exorcista es un trabajo con poca visibilidad”, ha admitido. “Que tu cliente te vomite y te insulte no es plato de buen gusto para nadie, pero también tiene cosas bonitas: conoces gente, ayudas a familias desesperadas y puedes practicar lenguas muertas, como el arameo, el latín o el bable”. Carrasco ha explicado el caso de “el demoniu cabreau”, en el que una señora fue poseída por un diablo asturiano y acabó siendo alcaldesa en su aldea por el Partido Popular. 
La temporada de “Hermano Mayor” ya está en proceso de grabación. Según adelanta Vallés, los casos son más espectaculares que otros años. “El padre Carrasco visita a una adolescente que no estudia, es muy respondona y gira la cabeza 350 grados”, ha explicado. “Técnicamente no es una posesión, le faltan diez grados para serlo, pero el procedimiento es similar: agua bendita y el cuerpo de Cristo”, precisa. El cura ha defendido que “lo mejor en estos casos es una buena hostia a tiempo”. 
Carrasco se inició en el mundo del exorcismo viendo tutoriales de YouTube. “Las primeras expulsiones del demonio las realicé en vacas que hay en la granja de mis padres”, ha relatado. Poco a poco fue perfeccionando la técnica, primero con primates, luego con pelirrojos y finalmente con personas. 
Los responsables del programa han aprovechado la cobertura mediática para hacer una llamada a la población: “Si tenéis un hijo rebelde, que usa expresiones como ‘coworking’, ‘CEO’ o ‘Voy a montar una startup’, poneos en contacto con nosotros. Quizá aún estemos a tiempo de salvar su alma”.",0

Hillary Clinton began conducting focus groups and polling swing state voters as early as December 2014 to figure out how to brand herself and find a “rationale” for running for president. 
Nearly two years before the election, Clinton’s team circulated a timeline of research objectives for which the nascent campaign would spend $2 million on focus groups and surveys, according to recently released hacked emails. 
A “fundamental question” was how to brand Hillary as either “Badass/hip,” or a “Grandma.” 
“Attached is an updated summary of the research process and a budget,” Robby Mook, who would become Clinton’s campaign manager, emailed on Dec. 8, 2014. “I want to emphasize that THIS *WILL* CHANGE because the team will have better ideas on methodology and the strategy will evolve as the project progresses.”

25048,How to Get a Good Deal on Flight Upgrades - The New York Times,"For   travelers, flying business or first class is increasingly within the realm of possibility. Prices for these seats are lower than in the past, said George Hobica, the founder of the air travel advice site airfarewatchdog. com. “Airlines used to upgrade passengers to first or business class for free,” he said, “but they’ve stopped doing that and are instead making these tickets more affordable and attainable. ” Here, he shares his tips on how to snag a seat in these premium cabins without paying premium prices. BUY DIRECT The airlines themselves, as opposed to   airfare ticket sites such as Expedia. com, usually have the best prices for their   and   tickets, Mr. Hobica said. The lowest rates in these classes tend to be nonrefundable. So when searching for fares on an airline’s site, find the cheapest options by searching for a nonrefundable   or   seat. Also, know that carriers often have fare sales for these cabins in the summer and over the December holiday season, when fewer business travelers are flying. Find out about these sales by signing up for an airline’s  . One example for this year: British Airways has Thanksgiving and Christmas specials where passengers can buy tickets in first class or Club World, the carrier’s   equivalent, to London from some cities in the United States starting at $2, 038. FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL USE A CONSOLIDATOR Airline ticket consolidators buy in bulk from airlines and sell them to consumers for a discount. It is even possible to find these fares for   travel. Mr. Hobica said he frequently buys tickets through consolidators to fly to Europe during the peak summer season for prices equivalent to or within a few hundred dollars of an economy ticket on the same flight. However, be aware that you might not earn frequent flier miles through a consolidator ticket, and the ticket may be nonchangeable. PlanetAmex. com and InternationalTravelSystems. com are both reputable consolidators. TRY A LOCAL TRAVEL AGENT That    travel agency in your town could have access to consolidator fares, Mr. Hobica said. Though many travel agencies can no longer get you discounted airfare, there are some who can, he said, and it’s always worth calling or stopping in to find out. UPGRADE WITH MILES Airlines sometimes offer to upgrade your economy ticket for a nominal fee combined with frequent flier miles (usually with 15, 000 to 20, 000 miles each way for travel within the United States and at least 40, 000 miles one way for international travel).

It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. by Geoffrey Grider November 7, 2016 Hillary Clinton’s campaign has called off its planned election night fireworks display, it emerged Monday, the day before America goes to the polls. Staffers were going to put on a two-minute show over the Hudson River after the results come in on Tuesday, but the proposal has been canned, TMZ reported on Monday. The campaign called the Coast Guard last week to tell them the event was off, three days after the New York Post reported it was planning the bash – although the cancellation was secret until Monday. It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. CNN has moved Ohio, Utah and one district of Maine from toss-up to leaning Republican, and New Hampshire from leaning Democratic to toss-up. That changes the math significantly for Clinton, putting her projected total at 268 and Trump’s at 204 – with the rest of the votes to be fought over. 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Hillary Clinton: Until now she had been above 270. Fox News has changed its projection too, making Utah and North Carolina toss-ups, rather than leaning towards Clinton, while Arizona and Iowa move to leaning Republican. And a series of other measures pointed to a far tighter race than some pundits had predicted. In Florida, early voting figures obtained by the Drudge Report suggested Trump was doing better than Mitt Romney, and Hillary Clinton was under-performing Barack Obama in 2012. Similarly, Drudge reported that North Carolina had seen Trump exceed early voting expectations. The figures showed Trump behind be 305,000 when Romney was behind by 447,000 – a deficit which he still won the state from. The cancellation of the fireworks emerged three days after FBI director James Comey told Congress his agency was investigating a trove of emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The cancellation was made Thursday – before Comey wrote again to Congress to say that the FBI had not found anything to justify changing its verdict of no charges to the Democrat about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Still, Clinton’s campaign suffered collateral damage in the nine days which elapsed between the letters. source

25051,"AT&T Buying Time Warner: If Approved, Assures Greater Scoundrel Media Consolidation Than Already","in: Corporate Takeover , Economy & Business , Science & Technology , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Six corporate giants control most media and related content Americans consume. Comcast, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner dominate US broadcast and cable television news, entertainment and sports, movie and TV production, theme parks, record labels, publishing, and for-profit online operations. On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported telecommunications giant AT&T and Time Warner agreeing to merge. Approval, if granted, would likely assure greater consolidation in both industries – benefitting corporate predators at the expense of the vast majority of consumers, giving them less choice than already, ensuring higher prices for poorer service. Hillary is a Wall Street, war profiteers, corporate predators tool, virtually certain to support this outrageous deal – likely to get FCC and Justice Department approval on her watch. Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Trump called the proposed deal another example of too few sources disseminating information to Americans, warning of “too much concentration of power,” manipulating people, telling them how to think. As president, if elected, he vowed to oppose it. He’s against jobs-killing TPP, NAFTA and similar deals. “Our jobs are fleeing the country,” he said. “They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries.” Hillary calls TPP the “gold standard in trade agreements,” sure to approve what Trump opposes. He calls friendly relations with Russia a good thing, praising Putin as “a leader…far more than our president has been,” saying “(i)f we have a (normal) relationship with Russia, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could work together on it and knock the hell out of ISIS.” Hillary’s rage for endless wars to eliminate all sovereign independent governments risks nuclear confrontation with Russia, China and Iran on her watch. Trump is no peacenik, no paragon of virtue, yet he’s on the right side of vital issues discussed above. Hillary should terrify everyone – on the wrong side of virtually everything mattering most, the most ruthlessly dangerous choice for president in US history. Submit your review",0
25052,Flashback - Reports: Obama Campaign Opened Back Channel to Iran - Breitbart,"TEL AVIV  —   Amid reports that President Trump’s    and senior adviser Jared Kushner allegedly talked with Russia’s envoy to the U. S. about setting up a back channel for communications, it may be instructive to recall that representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign reportedly established a back channel with Iran. [The Washington Post, which broke the story about Kushner, cited communications from Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak to Moscow allegedly intercepted by U. S. intelligence officials. Russian diplomats are known to deliberately place misinformation in communications they believe are being monitored, the Post noted, allowing for the possibility that Kushner never actually asked for a back channel.  ABC News quoted two sources as saying the purported back channel that Kushner and Kislyak were allegedly discussing was supposed to focus on policy issues, including the war in Syria where Russia is highly influential. In August 2014, Michael Ledeen, a former consultant to the National Security Council and U. S. Defense Department, penned a column at PJ Media stating Obama opened a   to Iran during the 2008 presidential campaign. Ledeen said the back channel went through retired Ambassador William G. Miller, who also led the 1979 negotiating mission during the Iran hostage crisis. Ladeen wrote that Miller confirmed his   involvement to him. Ledeen wrote: (emphasis added by this reporter) The actual strategy is detente first, and then a full alliance with Iran throughout the Middle East and North Africa. It has been on display since before the beginning of the Obama administration. During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies. The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah’s rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

25054,Pentagon Wastes Nearly $60Bln in Canceled Weapons Over Past 20 Years,"Pentagon spent $58.3 billion since 1997 for development weapon systems programs, which have been later canceled, according to report. The US Department of Defense has spent $58.3 billion over the past two decades for development weapon systems programs, which have been later canceled, a recent Pentagon’s report said.
Since 1997, the US Department of Defense has canceled 23 military programs, which were initially funded, the report issued on Tuesday by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics claimed.
“Almost 44 percent of those dollars are in two programs: Future Combat System (FCS; $20.7 billion) and the RAH — 66 Comanche reconnaissance/attack helicopter ($9.8 billion). Eight canceled programs spent at least 100 percent of their original RDT&E [Research Development Test and Evaluation] baseline, including Comanche (but not FCS). On average, about two-thirds to three-fourths of the original RDT&E baselines were spent before these programs were canceled,” the report reads.
According to the authors of the report, not all the spent money should be considered wasted, because, despite the cancellation of a program, newly developed technologies can be used in creation of other weapons systems.

25055,2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election,"Store 2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election Unearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win' Observer   
On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton’s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is “rigged.” 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).",0
25058,Kristen Griest on Course to Become First Female Army Officer Trained to Lead Troops Into Combat - The New York Times,"Capt. Kristen Griest was among the first women to ever graduate from the Army’s elite Ranger school, and after Thursday, she will become the first woman able to lead an infantry unit into combat. Her graduation from the Maneuver Captains Career Course at Fort Benning, Ga. qualifies her for duty as an infantry officer after being approved for infantry duty earlier this week. She is joining a branch of the Army that had long been considered the last bastion of traditionally male combat roles, and with the move, the Army has crossed another barrier in its promise to consider women for all roles without exception. “She’s going to go on and serve the rest of her career, however long it may be, as an infantry officer,” Lt. Col. Jerry Pionk, an Army spokesman, said on Thursday. “Her road is far from done it is just more in line with what she feels her aspirations are. ” Unofficially, women had served on the deadly front line for years, but they were barred from direct combat in roles such as tank or infantry officer until December 2015, when Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter announced that the Pentagon would allow women in all military roles, with no exceptions, opening up about 220, 000 military jobs. “They’ll be allowed to drive tanks, fire mortars and lead infantry soldiers into combat,” Mr. Carter said. “They’ll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers and everything else that was previously open only to men. ” Colonel Pionk stressed that the Army was being “deliberate and methodical” during a “major cultural shift” in opening roles to women, and that Captain Griest was evaluated by the same standards as a male officer requesting a transfer. “This isn’t really about putting women into infantry and armor branches,” he said. “We are at a time and a place in the world where we need to have the best leaders from everywhere, and that includes women. ” Still, the option for Captain Griest to move into her current role was not available as recently as last summer, when she made history along with First Lt. Shaye Haver by graduating from the grueling Ranger school. Both women said that they had not received any special treatment. “I do hope that with our performance in Ranger school we’ve been able to inform that decision as to what they can expect from women in the military,” Captain Griest told reporters after her graduation. “We can handle things physically and mentally on the same level as men. ” As Captain Griest moves forward in her career, the Army is creating a path forward for younger female cadets who want to be trained to lead in branches that were previously unavailable. This spring, 13 female cadets were approved to enter armor, and nine were approved for infantry, Colonel Pionk said. “We’re at the point where we’re now starting to branch women who want to go,” he added.",0

25064,Goldman Sachs: America Must Elect Hillary Clinton,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News , US // 2 Comments 
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has broken his silence and endorsed Hillary Clinton as Wall Street’s preferred candidate. 
In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zacharia, Blankfein said that although he had previously declared he would not endorse a candidate, the situation is now critical and Hillary Clinton must be elected. 
“ I certainly, yes, I do — yes, so flat out, yes, I do ,” Blankfein said when asked whether he supports and admires Clinton. 
As was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her real position on financial regulation. 
In essence, Hillary told the banksters she would let them set their own rules and regulations because “ the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. “ 
Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders’ success in the primaries. But you can completely dismiss anything she has said in public. Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton admitted to the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that “ you need both a public and a private position. ” 
Hillary Clinton’s private position has been exposed. She is the Wall Street candidate promising them the ability to set their own rules. Now, unsurprisingly, they have endorsed her. 
On October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for “ political reasons ” because Congress needed to “ look like ” it was doing something about the crisis. 
Behind closed doors, she assured the bankers she was on their side, saying,“ There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. ” 
Music to Wall Street’s ears 
“ I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they’re scared of regulations, they’re scared of the other shoe dropping, they’re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth, ” Clinton said. “ So people are, you know, a little — they’re still uncertain, and they’re uncertain both because they don’t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they’re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we’re only beginning to take hold of. ” 
For Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. 
Considering the pay-for-play environment in the Clinton world, the real question is: what do Blankfein and Goldman Sachs want in return and what is Clinton’s private position on giving it to them?",0
25065,Putin’s latest warning to the West sees him deploy his SUPER-STEALTH submarines,"By wmw_admin on October 28, 2016 Joe Barnes — Daily Express.com Oct 27, 2016 The Veliky Novgorod ready to launch. Click to enlarge 
The Veliky Novgorod is the latest addition to Russia’s Black Sea fleet which is capable of striking land, sea and underwater targets, and follows other significant movements by the Russian navy. 
The diesel-electric vessel, which sports advanced stealth technologies and increased combat range was officially launched in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. 
Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy Vice-Admiral Aleksandr Fedotenkov and Admiralty Shipyard CEO Alexander Buzakov were in attendance at the official flag-raising ceremony before the vessels moved to the Black Sea for operation. 
Earlier this month, Mr Buzakov said that another Varshavyanka-class submarine, the Kolpino, would be launched in November. 
He said: “The state of tests of the fifth submarine, the Veliky Novgorod, were successfully completed and on October 25 it will be handed over to the Black Sea Fleet. 
“The transfer of the sixth submarine, the Kolpino, is underway, scheduled to be completed on November 25.” 
The submarines are designed for anti-ship and anti-submarine operations in mid-depth waters, are capable of holding a crew of 52, have a top underwater speed of 20 knots and a cruising range of 4000 miles. 
They can stay submerged for 45 days and are armed with 18 torpedoes and high surface-to-air missiles and will join Russian efforts to defeat ISIS in Syria. 
Russian President Putin has also bolstered his warship fleet in the Baltic sea by arming them with long-range missiles which are capable of striking Europe. 
Two ships, traveling through the Mediterranean in the fleet of five, were thought to be remaining in the sea, where they were due to refueling in Spain before making their way towards Syria. 
But instead, the two ships have moved through the North Sea, passing through the Great Belt around Denmark and into the Baltic Sea. 
It is believed the ships are on their way to Russia’s Baltic enclave Kaliningrad, which has recently had scores of missiles deployed to the area. 
A source told Russian media: “With the appearance of two small missile ships armed with the Kalibr cruise missiles the Fleet’s potential targeting range will be significantly expanded in the norther European military theatre.” 
Nato has stepped up its plans to deploy thousands more troops to the Russian border as President Putin continues to increase his nation’s preparation for war. 
The global alliance will use its meeting with European Union officials to launch an aggressive push to implement troops in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
An agreement – signed at a Nato summit in Warsaw in July – will see as many as 4,000 soldiers stationed close to the Russian border in case Moscow launches all out war.",0
25067,Fallout From FBI’s New Criminal Investigation Has Already Begun,"Pinterest 
The FBI is reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email case. 
The news came while Clinton was without WiFi on a flight to an Iowa campaign stop, so while reporters hurled questions at her upon landing, all Clinton could muster was the old smile-and-wave. 
Later, after collecting her thoughts, Clinton faced national reporters eager to hear her reaction and declared that the FBI needs to explain their behavior against her. 
“We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national elections of our lifetimes,” Clinton said . “Voting is already underway in our country. So the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.” 
Like so many others who’ve jumped to defend her after FBI Director James Comey announced there would be an investigation into newly uncovered emails, Clinton claimed that the FBI should have kept their mouths shut until after the election. 
There’s an election going on, after all. 
And Clinton thinks it’s “perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes” because she thinks her opponent isn’t fit to lead. 
If the FBI investigates her, they’re disturbing the nation. They’re disrupting the election. While many voters believe candidates for president ought to be held to the same standards as anyone else, and the truth can only help Americans make the right decision in the polls, Clinton thinks the FBI was wrong to announce the latest uncover to the public. 
Typical of someone who has so much to lose for having done so much wrong. 
Perhaps her continual insistence that she is above the law for one reason or another is why there’s been so much backlash already. 
Independent Journal Review reports: 
In Wisconsin and Minnesota , there are already reports of voters coming back to their polling offices to change their votes. And in Maine, the Secretary of State has allowed voters the option of switching votes in past elections. 
The fallout could be intense, as the polls have tightened dramatically in recent days. Tracking the same ABC/WaPo poll that had Hillary Clinton up four points earlier this week shows them within just two points on Saturday: 
It’s clear that Clinton is rapidly losing supporters as the election draws near, while Trump is gaining. 
If Clinton believes that being a presidential candidate in a close election should excuse her from investigation, what will she think her role as president would grant her? 
If current trends continue, she might not get that chance. 
Independent Journal Review continues: 
The national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics have the spread at 3.8 points. The battleground states of Florida , Arizona , and North Carolina are down to thin margins for Hillary Clinton, and Trump has the lead in Iowa , Georgia , and Ohio . Trump still trails by a significant, but not insurmountable, margin in Pennsylvania and Virginia .

Как сообщает Associated Press, жительница города Модесто в Калифорнии Дебора Джаннекини длительное время пользовалась детской присыпкой Johnson & Johnson. В 2012 году врачи обнаружили у нее рак яичников. 
Как заявил адвокат истца Джим Ондер, суд в очередной раз подтвердили необходимость компании Johnson & Johnson предупреждать людей о риске развития рака яичников в связи с использованием этого продукта. 
Однако представители компании отрицают данный факт и собираются обжаловать вердикт. 
""Мы очень сочувствуем этой женщине и семьям, пострадавшим от рака яичников. Мы намерены обжаловать сегодняшний вердикт, потому что руководствуемся наукой, которая подтверждает безопасность присыпки Johnson's Baby"", — сообщила представительница компании Кэрол Гудрич. 
Напомним, это уже не первый подобный случай. В феврале Pravda.Ru сообщала , что американский суд обязал крупного производителя косметических товаров Johnson & Johnson выплатить $72 миллионов родственникам женщины, скончавшейся от рака. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, суд в Миссури вынес такое решение в деле Жаклин Фокс, которая скончалась от рака яичников в октябре 2015 года в возрасте 62 лет. Родственники утверждали, что болезнь развилась у женщины после того, как она в течение более 35 лет регулярно пользовалась продукцией американской компании, в том числе средствами для интимной гигиены и детской присыпкой. 
Соответственно, жюри присяжных признало конгломерат виновным в мошенничестве и сокрытии информации о том, что его продукция может нанести непоправимый вред здоровью. В Johnson & Johnson заявили, что разочарованы вердиктом, однако не уточнили, будет ли компания обжаловать решение суда. 
Компания Johnson & Johnson, основанная в 1886 году, является одним из крупнейших в мире производителей косметических и санитарно-гигиенических товаров и медицинского оборудования. Занимает 37-е место в списке Fortune 500, куда включаются самые крупные компании США по версии американского журнала Fortune. 
Ранее фармацевтическое подразделение компании Johnson & Johnson выплатило штраф в размере 2,2 миллиарда долларов за рекламу без одобрения властей США сильнодействующих психиатрических препаратов для использования детьми, пожилыми людьми и инвалидами.

25070,CNN Drops Kathy Griffin after Trump ’Beheading’ Photo,"CNN has terminated its relationship with Kathy Griffin after the comedian posed for a photograph while holding a fake, bloodied decapitated head meant to resemble the head of President Donald Trump. [“CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year’s Eve program,” the network’s communications department tweeted Wednesday morning.  CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year’s Eve program.  —   CNN Communications (@CNNPR) May 31, 2017,  Griffin had   CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live broadcast each January since 2007 alongside the network’s lead anchor, Anderson Cooper. Cooper took to Twitter late Tuesday night to say he was “appalled” by his  ’s photo. “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,” the Anderson Cooper 360 host wrote. “It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate. ” The shocking photograph, first published by TMZ Tuesday morning, was taken during a photo shoot conducted by the    My Life on the   comedian and Los   artist and photographer Tyler Shields, who is reportedly known for his provocative work. The photo caused a firestorm online, where it quickly circulated and led to calls for a boycott of Griffin’s work, including her current   comedy tour. The comedian apologized in a brief video posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, saying she had “crossed the line” and that the image had gone “too far. ” CNN’s termination of its relationship with Griffin is the latest in the continuing fallout over the image. On Wednesday, ADT  —   the largest home security company in North America  —   announced it would pull its advertising from CNN over the photo, while the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque, New Mexico announced it had cancelled Griffin’s upcoming performance, which had been scheduled for June 16. The U. S. Secret Service is also reportedly investigating the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump responded to the image Wednesday, with the president saying in a message on his Twitter account that the photograph and its resultant coverage has been particularly hard on his    son, Barron. The First Lady called the photograph “very disturbing” and “simply wrong” in a separate statement.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
25071,Transformational New Moon in Scorpio [Video],"Leave a reply 
Joseph P Anthony – November 2016 starts on a pretty similar note to that of the previous month except there is feeling of change in the air, that’s because last month’s New Moon in Scorpio marks another momentous crossroads for humanity. 
The sign Scorpio rules death, as well as transformation. Its ruler is Pluto, the Greek god of the Underworld, the terrain of the “unconscious”. What needs to die this month before it can be reborn? Scorpio is the only astrological sign that has three symbols- the Scorpion (physical), the Eagle (psychological) and the Phoenix (spiritual) – showing that there are three levels of transformation to be achieved before true metamorphosis can occur. 
Unfortunately, the mood in November isn’t peaceful at all, not only do we have the presidential election show here in the US, but because we also have Venus and Mars switching signs along with a strong alignment between Jupiter, Pluto and Venus towards the end of the month. As we start off November we have action-oriented Mars still in Capricorn until the November 8th, in the same sign as Pluto and in a deplorable lack of understanding with Jupiter from Libra and Uranus from Aries. But the exact aspects have already been perfected, so the frequency of accidents or violence generated by this combo should be somewhat diminished. 
The Full Moon this month will occur in the steadfast sign of Taurus on November 14th. This Taurus lunation serves to calm us down and take a load off. Why rush, why fuss, why push, why pull? Taurus wants us to take a chill pill, man. Full moons tend to be emotional, but a Taurus full moon tends to be calmer. Emotionally, Taurus tends to not get riled up the same way that other signs can. So take it easy, and don’t stress the small stuff. Kick back, and let things happen in their own time and way. 
Taurus rules our finances, so this Full Moon we see some issues having to do with money in general such as stock market going up or down, or tackling financial issues and finding resolutions on a personal level. We can see this with individuals, groups, corporations, governments. We can see smart financial moves rewarded, and financial recklessness punished. We may find ourselves more indulgent during this lunation since Taurus does love food, drink and sensual activities, so if you’re trying to be good, remember; moderation! 
Have a good month friends ! Joseph P. Anthony SF Source Joseph P Anthony Oct. 2016 Share this:",0
25074,Former Clinton Foundation CEO begging Russia for ‘urgent and immediate’ asylum?,"Print 
Some of the emails that have come to the public’s attention via WikiLeaks are out-and-out bombshells , while other chains are so fragmented and enigmatic that an understanding of what they portend requires reconstruction and some guesswork. 
One that fits the latter category centers on an exchange between Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta and Neera Tanden, of the hard-left Center for American Progress , concerning an apparent leak that needed — shall we say? — plugging? 
The original email was from Tanden to Podesta, dated March 8, 2015 and time-stamped 4:49 p.m. Here’s the message: 
Ron Fournier is a writer for National Journal. The highlighted link in the email takes you to an article at National Journal with the intriguing title “Emails May Be a Key to Addressing ‘Pay-to-Play’ Whispers at Clinton Foundation.” The article is protected by a pay wall which prevents me from providing more information, but I can tell you the subhead: “There are not two Clinton controversies. There is one big, hairy deal.” 
Here is Podesta’s response, sent a half-hour later: 
Eric Braverman, the name Podesta throws out as the likely mole, is a former CEO of the Clinton Foundation. 
Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone has posted a tweet in reaction partly to this exchange in which he advances the claim that Braverman was working with WikiLeaks and now fears assassination by the Clinton machine: Word on the street is Eric Braverman, Clinton Foundation CEO, has fled the USA and is attempting to gain asylum in Russia. Anyone confirm?

How ironic that Braverman, according to the scuttlebutt, is seeking asylum from Russia, of all nations!",0
25077,EXCLUSIVE: Keith Ellison’s Student Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Police Activism (Video),"You are here: Home / *Articles of the Bound* / EXCLUSIVE: Keith Ellison’s Student Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Police Activism (Video) EXCLUSIVE: Keith Ellison’s Student Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Police Activism (Video) November 22, 2016, 8:13 am by Guest Author Leave a Comment 0 
By: Renee Nal | New Zeal Keith Ellison (right) in a June 1989 issue of ‘Forward Motion’ responding to “police brutality” 
In the wake of communist-fueled anti-police sentiment resulting in relentless, brutal attacks on America’s law enforcement officials, a look at prospective DNC leader Keith Ellison ‘s radical anti-police and anti-capitalist history is in order. 
As Trevor Loudon reveals in his film the Enemies Within , Keith Ellison is a “perfect example of the Muslim/Marxist alliance.” In his “student radical days,” the young Marxist was condemning capitalism and “police brutality” around the same time he converted to Islam. In 1989, Keith Ellison was featured in “ Forward Motion ,” the now-defunct print magazine of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization – the same group that eventually spawned the “Black Lives Matter” movement. 
The article was titled “Battling the Rise in Police Brutality” and is not found online. Keith Ellison at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
In the article, Ellison lashed out at “white supremacy” and “capitalism” as being responsible for drug use by black Americans: Keith Ellison as quoted at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
Ellison expressed concern later in the same article that working with organized labor may lead to a “white supremacist problem.” Keith Ellison as quoted at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
Here, Keith Ellison discusses the “contradictions” surrounding how those in the progressive movement to convince black Americans that “white supremacy is an evil system” are “predominately white.” Keith Ellison as quoted at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
Trevor Loudon documents more on Keith Ellison here. 
The late communist party member Erwin Marquit explains in his memoirs how the radical left worked to elect Keith Ellison in 2006: 
“To gather support for Ellison, I suggested to [ Communist Party USA members] April Knutson and Jim Knutson that they draft a letter addressed to activists in the peace movement urging them to support Ellison. 
Doris and I and the Knutsons then solicited signatures to the letter from among well-known peace activists. In July, we circulated the letter as widely as possible. Doris and I volunteered to cosponsor a fundraiser for Ellison in our home on 24 July with our neighbors Dave Holets and his wife Nancy Arneson. Dave, already retired, had been in charge of managing the finances of the School of Physics and Astronomy. Together, we leafleted the immediate neighborhood with invitations to the fundraiser. 
On 21 and 22 July, I went into St. Louis Park, a suburb just west of the city line, a block and a half from our home, to do door knocking. When someone appeared at the door, I would begin by introducing myself by name. I was not surprised when one of the first responses I got was, “Oh, you’re the Communist at the University of Minnesota.” Two or three others recognized me in a similar manner. The fact that I was campaigning for Ellison did not seem to bother any of them. ” (emphasis added)

25078,US Prepares to Seek Arrest of Julian Assange - Breitbart,"U. S. authorities are preparing to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange, according to reports. [CNN reports that, according to officials familiar with the matter, the U. S. is preparing charges to seek the arrest of Assange, who has resided within the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012. The Justice Department’s investigation of Assange has been underway since 2010 when WikiLeaks first published classified documents obtained by US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.  Prosecutors first had issues pressing charges as they debated whether the information published by WikiLeaks fell under the First Amendment, but now believe that they have discovered a way to move forward. During the Obama administration, Attorney General Eric Holder and other Justice Department Officials determined that due to WikiLeaks not being the sole publisher of the documents, prosecution would be difficult. This lead to the investigation being put on hold. Following the Ecuadorian election, US officials hoped that Assange’s asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy would be revoked with a new government. However, after the victory of Lenín Moreno over his opponent Guillermo Lasso, Assange will most likely be permitted to continue living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Moreno previously stated that he would allow Assange to stay in the embassy, upholding the decision made by his predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum in 2012. CIA Director Mike Pompeo had harsh words for WikiLeaks while speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies today, implying that the whistleblowing group was a “hostile intelligence service. ” Pompeo was quite open about his disdain for the whistleblowing service following their recent publishing of CIA hacking tools as part of their “Vault 7” leaks. Pompeo stating during his speech, It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is  —   a   hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence  —   the GRU  —   had used WikiLeaks to release data of US victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated on Thursday that arresting Assange was a “priority” for the administration. “We are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks,” he said. “This is a matter that’s gone beyond anything I’m aware of. We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious. So yes, it is a priority. We’ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail. ” Assange’s lawyer, Barry Pollak, stated “We’ve had no communication with the Department of Justice and they have not indicated to me that they have brought any charges against Mr. Assange. They’ve been unwilling to have any discussion at all, despite our repeated requests, that they let us know what Mr. Assange’s status is in any pending investigations. There’s no reason why WikiLeaks should be treated differently from any other publisher. ” Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, has argued that prosecuting Assange could set a dangerous precedent, “Never in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for presenting truthful information to the public,” Wizner told CNN. “Any prosecution of WikiLeaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other news organizations. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

25086,"Блажен, кто верует во что попало…","Блажен, кто верует во что попало… 04 ноября 2016 Политика 
Фильм Алексея Учителя, повествующий об отношениях Николая Второго и Матильды Кшесинской, возмутил группу почитателей царя. Депутат Поклонская пообещала проверить картину, хотя она ещё и не вышла в прокат. При этом в доме Романовых оскорблёнными себя не считают. 
Прямо возвращение на машине времени на полвека назад и даже больше! Полная ассоциация со словами о романе Пастернака, с которых каждый выступающий начинал тогда свою обличительную речь: «Я книгу не читал, но…». Так и мы: никто фильм не смотрел, кроме тех, кому это по должности положено: в своё время с таким запросом, по словам Алексея Учителя, уже было обращение в прокуратуру. Выяснили, что нарушений законности не обнаружено! А на нет, как говорится, и суда… 
Вот суд-то как раз и замышляется, да не какой-нибудь — «народный»! С петициями, огульными обвинениями, протестными заявлениями. Ну, а поскольку не смотревшие фильм фанаты Николая II – по-другому этих «верующих» в непогрешимость царя называть сложно – вдруг начали проявлять необъяснимую активность аж через полгода после появления в сети трейлера «Матильды», хочется найти причины такого ажиотажа. 
Фильм может оказаться хорошим или плохим, псевдоисторически-костюмным или умным, пробуждающим чувства – в любом случае, не дело использовать художественное произведение в низменных целях. А они явно просматриваются! Как во всех детективах с поиском виновных, хочется задать сакраментальный вопрос: «Кому это выгодно?» И опять же, как в детективе, мотивов обнаруживается, как минимум, два. 
Во-первых, кто-то позаботился, чтобы фильму, который выйдет в прокат только в марте, создать «антирекламу»: за полгода-то уже все начали о нем забывать, а тут люди отчего-то рвут и мечут… Многие из одного только праздного любопытства решат посмотреть картину, вдруг да что-то там есть такое… 
Во-вторых, есть желающие правдами и неправдами дестабилизировать обстановку в стране. «Чувства верующих» для них — всего лишь интернет-повод. Вспомните, в школе, в классах этак 8-9, всех нас на уроках истории учили не путать причину с поводом! А кукловодам любой повод сгодится, чтобы достигнуть своей цели, чтобы посеять раздор и шатание. Сначала в сети, где страсти от малейшей искорки разгораются в полыхающее ненавистью пламя, а там, глядишь, и… 
А верующие и неверующие, в большинстве своём, и думать не думают о каком-то там кино – у них сейчас куча других насущных проблем, скорее материально-денежных, чем духовных!",0

25092,100 Million Marine Mammals Are Mistaking Ocean Trash for Food But Boyan Slat Has a Solution,"100 Million Marine Mammals Are Mistaking Ocean Trash for Food But Boyan Slat Has a Solution Nov 16, 2016 0 0 
Oceanographers recently went ‘fishing,’ but not for what you might think. They were on a reconnaissance mission to find out just how bad the Pacific Garbage Patch – an enormous gyre of ocean liter – had become. When they pulled up their nets recently, they found they were “choked with plastic bits and pieces.” 
Aside from the viewable plastic trash, researchers have found 750,000 microplastic pieces per square kilometer in the Garbage Patch, and the marine life which must live in these waters, is riddled with them. 
Estimations are that more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic weighing more than a quarter of a million tons currently float at sea globally. Most of this plastic debris comes from sources on land and ends up in oceans and bays due to poor waste management, and over-consumption. 
It takes between 450 and 1000 years for plastic to biodegrade, and in the meantime, it simply breaks into smaller and smaller pieces which animals mistake for food. Tube-nosed seabirds, like this Tristram’s storm petrel, eat plastic particles in the ocean, mistaking them for food. Sarah Youngren / Hawaii Pacific University/ USFWS 
The number of creatures that are affected is mind-boggling. Sadly, dolphins, sea birds, sea lions, tortoises, whales, and over 700 different marine species are likely to go extinct because of the plastic garbage choking our oceans. Millions of sea-dwelling creatures are literally ingesting their death, by mistaking plastic ocean trash for food. 
According to EcoWatch , just one species, a type of sea-bird can hunt for many fish in the sea, but areas that reliably contain food are very patchy. In other words, tube-nosed seabirds are searching for a “needle in a haystack” when they forage. They may be searching for fish, squid, krill or other items, and it is possible that plastic debris visually resembles these prey. Scientists believe that this specific example tells only part of a more complex story. 
For some marine life, the plastic particles are so small, that even algae consume them, so they don’t even know that they are ingesting human waste which is detrimental to their health. Pioneering research another reason that some marine life like birds might be eating plastic trash – they are likely confusing bits of plastic bottles and bags for small fish. 
Dr. Gabrielle Nevitt and his associates have found that certain species of tube-nosed seabirds are attracted to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) , a natural scented sulfur compound. DMS comes from marine algae , which produce a related chemical called DMSP within their cells. Once those cells are damaged—for example, when algae die, or when marine grazers like krill eat it—DMSP breaks down, producing DMS. The smell of DMS is how seabirds know that food is nearby—not by the algae, but because of the krill that eat the algae. 
Seabirds are likely being tricked into eating marine plastic garbage because of the way it smells. Tests comparing the feeding habits of over 20,000 birds from more than 70 species showed that species of birds that use DMS as a foraging cue eat plastic nearly six times as frequently as species that are not attracted to the smell of DMS while foraging. In short, plastic is effecting the entire eco-system and even interfering with physiological signaling in birds . 
This research is likely just revealing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Great Garbage Patch and the ramifications of continuing to allow our ocean’s to be devastated with plastic trash. 
There is a bright side to learning about the true depths of this issue. Organizations like the Ocean Clean Up Project just revealed their prototype to address the problem:",0
25093,Protestants get ready to grovel,"Protestants get ready to grovel By Gilad Atzmon Posted on November 9, 2016 by Gilad Atzmon 
This week we learned that Jewish institutions insist upon the Protestant Church apologising for its founder’s views of the Jews. The Jewish Algemeiner writes that “the 500th anniversary of the Reformation would be the ‘perfect time’ for Protestant leaders to recognise and apologise for the ‘horrific antisemitism’ of their movement’s founder, Martin Luther.” 
The truth of the matter is that Martin Luther didn’t know about Zionism, Israeli criminality, Alan Dershowitz, Bernie Madoff, Jeffrey Epstein, or Sir Philip Green but he still had a serious problem with the Jews. Back in 1543 he wrote On The Jews and their Lies , a book notorious for its opposition to Jews and their religion. 
Rabbi Abraham Cooper—associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre—wants the Protestants to disown the founding father of their church or at least to “directly address the issue (of anti-Semitism) in the overall context of what they’re celebrating in terms of this anniversary,” 
David Michaels of B’nai B’rith insists that the churches reject some of their founder’s teachings. “This reality requires committed Lutherans and other Christians to ensure that there is fitting recognition and rejection of Luther’s hateful beliefs about Jews, wherever these persist.” 
The Protestant world is clearly being subjected to an institutionalized assault Judaism. But there is one thing the Jewish Algemeiner fails to do. It fails to brief us about Luther’s argument against the Jews. The truth of the matter is that Luther’s animus towards Jewry wasn’t at all racially driven. His arguments against Jews were purely theological rather than biological. Thus, using the term ‘anti-Semitism’ in reference to Luther is misleading. It leaves one wondering whether Bnai B’rith and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are lying consciously when they refer to Luther as an ‘anti-Semite’? If they do, we may actually need to seek the assistance of Luther’s book in order to grasp Rabbi Cooper and Michaels’ conduct.

25094,The True Scandal of 2016 Was The Torture of Chelsea Manning     :," The True Scandal of 2016 Was The Torture of Chelsea Manning By Jeremy Scahill
November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" The Intercept "" - A few days ago, we learned that Private Chelsea Manning attempted to take her own life last month for the second time since being sentenced to 35 years at the U.S. military prison in Leavenworth, Kansas. The whistleblower, who provided the collateral murder video, the Iraq and Afghan war logs, and the hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. State Department cables to Wikileaks, was convicted of espionage. As I waited to vote today, I found myself thinking of her languishing in misery in isolation and incarceration.
This election  particularly in its closing stages  has been dominated by controversies over emails, classified documents, and Wikileaks. Weve heard endlessly about Hillary Clintons private basement server, her 33,000 deleted emails, the phishing and leaking of John Podestas emails, including parts of Clintons much discussed private speeches to Goldman Sachs. Trump, for his part, suddenly discovered a great love for Julian Assange, though he does have trouble correctly spelling Wikileaks in his tweets of praise. Taken together with Trumps bizarre and consistent lauding of Vladimir Putin and leaks from the U.S. intelligence community, the country has been treated to an odd flashback of Cold War propaganda, including a fair dose of red-baiting from the Democrats. In the matter of Anthony Weiners computer, his wife Huma Abedins communications and the potential implications for Clinton, the FBI, whose overreach had not previously been of much concern to Democrats, suddenly became a deviant manipulator of the electoral process, while Trump and his supporters alternately praised the agencys professionalism and denounced it as part of the rigged system.
The U.S. public is now getting a taste of the way hacking, phishing, and an overwhelming dependence on fallible machines and networks can impact politics. But lets be clear: None of the disclosures in this campaign  not one thing in any of the hacked emails or those declassified and released from Clintons private server  has brought to light anything of greater importance than the documents Chelsea Manning provided to Wikileaks. She revealed war crimes, including murder and torture, dirty and duplicitous dealings of the U.S. and its allies, exposed liars, documented a secret history of Americas longest running war, and forced a much needed debate about the U.S. role in the world. And for that, she is being tortured.
The double standards of our society dictate that a perjurer like the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, faces no consequences for his crimes. Gen. David Petraeus gets a slap on the wrist, no jail time, and prestigious positions at universities for sharing classified information with his mistress. Only Gen. James Cartwright may face the inside of a prison cell for discussing classified information with journalists  and he is a sacrificial lamb for the cause of exonerating Clinton and Petraeus from any true accountability by the Obama Justice Department.
But Chelsea Manning, whose motivation was noble, whose actions made our country better, faces the full wrath of the system. And it may end up killing her. When we talk about the high-tech scandals that marked this election, at the top of the list should be the torture of Chelsea Manning.",0

By Ken Silverstein At a time when the presidential election is dividing families and friends, at least one issue is bridging the gap: giving veterans of the U.S. military a new lease on life by teaching them how to restore coral reefs. And they are trying to enlist big business as their ally. Indeed, the marriage of the ocean’s ecology along with those who have served their nation is breathing a new spirit into the coral reefs, which make up a whole community of living organisms that survive on the ocean floor. Those reefs aren’t just a thing of beauty. They are also an economic engine, spawning entire enterprises that range from tourism to medicine, including the making of drugs that deal with cancer, arthritis and bacterial infections. “Our guys are special forces who are physically strong but who are also struggling,” says Jim Ritterhoff, founder of Force Blue that combines the virtues of military training with coral reef restoration.

Katy Perry strips naked , under the guise of comedy, to get out the vote (for her candidate, Hillary). 
Miley Cyrus tells voters to “ kiss her ass ” if you don’t support Hillary. 
Now there’s another classy Clinton supporter: Jennifer Lopez 
From Daily Mail : Here’s one way to drum up votes in a swing state. 
On Saturday night, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony looked as intimate as ever while performing a concert for Hillary Clinton at Bayfront Park Amphitheater in Miami, where the candidate herself joined them onstage and embraced the Out Of Sight star. 
The erstwhile spouses have worked together a great deal this year; on top of a Radio City Music Hall performance in August, they’re currently collaborating on a Spanish language album. 
For her Miami show, the 47-year-old had slid into a typically showstopping outfit, this one largely comprised of a black satin robe with a hem at mid-thigh. 
And it certainly made the most of her famous backside – with the star flashing it to the crowd throughout her hits-packed set.

C. He was joined by a Jewish White House colleague, along with several dozen other Jews. [All of these Jews were unaware, apparently, that in their midst a hidden Nazi was lurking  —   at least, according to the Forward, which attempted Thursday to claim that Gorka is secretly a member of a Nazi organization.  We have been here before. Last month, a   blogger made the same false claim, which was thoroughly debunked by Breitbart News (where Gorka was once an editor) and others. The Forward now claims Gorka once pledged loyalty to the Historical Vitézi Rend, a racist rival to the Vitézi Rend, which is a postwar anticommunist organization. (The word “historical” was added to allude to the original Vitézi Rend, which was   by Hungary’s   government and later banned.) Gorka denies it all. And as Trump critic Liel Leibovitz notes in Tablet, the Forward offers no proof other than the claims of the Historical Vitézi Rend, whom the Forward suddenly deems a trustworthy source not requiring further corroboration. It is possible to play this game both ways: In 2015, the Forward changed its name from “The Jewish Daily Forward” to simply “the Forward. ” This, apparently, was a nod to   antisemites. After all, the Forward is critical of Israel. Verdict: Guilty! Not to be outdone, the execrable Stephen Goldstein of the Anne Frank Center  —   a man who desecrates the Holocaust by abusing it in his partisan attacks against the Trump administration  —   demanded that Gorka resign, claiming that “grotesque Antisemitism   …     has infected the Trump White House. ” That absurd statement, like the article that inspired it, is nothing more than the defamation of a good man and the most   administration in U. S. history, staffed to the rafters with Jews. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the “most influential” people in news media in 2016.

25117,Republicans Just Revealed They’re ALREADY Plotting “Years” Of Hillary Investigations,"Comments 
The House GOP are preparing for a Clinton presidency by doing absolutely nothing to change their plans, announcing the threat of continued investigations into soon-to-be President-elect Hillary Clinton, which they warn will go on for years. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) is spearheading the charges against her, in spite of un-endorsing Trump just two weeks ago. 
“Even before we get to Day One, we’ve got two years’ worth of material already lined up. She has four years of history at the State Department, and it ain’t good,” he threatened. 
Although Clinton is predicted to win by a landslide majority, Republicans could retain control of the House due to conservative voting at the local level decades of extensive jerrymandering by Republican statehouses. This might make Clinton be the first president since George H.W. Bush to deal with a House Oversight Committee controlled by their opposing party in her first term. 
Of course, other Republicans agree with the efforts to take down Clinton, gleefully planning to exacerbate political divisions and distaste in this country and recreating the climate that led to Trump getting as far as he has. 
The office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a statement saying, “The rigorous oversight conducted by House Republicans has already brought to light troubling developments in the [Hillary] Clinton email scandal. The speaker supports [Oversight’s] investigative efforts following where the evidence leads, especially where it shows the need for changes in the law.” 
The thought of Republicans wasting additional time and money on trying to take down Clinton is a spit in the face to her campaign. David Brock, leader of the American Bridge PAC, accusing Chaffetz of squandering taxpayer dollars on his nonsense investigation. “It’s clear Congressman Chaffetz is ready to spend resources on additional worthless political investigations that will, again, come up with nothing,” he commented. 
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a ranking member of the Oversight Committee and the Select Committee on Benghazi, echoed these sentiments, explaining, “Republicans are pretending like they haven’t been investigating Secretary Clinton for years ever since she announced that she was running for president, including everything from Benghazi to emails to the Clinton Foundation. It’s no exaggeration to say that on the first day Secretary Clinton walks into the White House, Republicans will have already investigated her more than any other president in history.” 
Chaffetz’s anticipated investigation may be reliant on stolen documents, sourced via WikiLeaks, though he claims he doesn’t “want to be dealing with that.” When asked if this will resemble Watergate, Chaffetz tries to warn that it could go that far depending on cooperation. 
The one thing Chaffetz hasn’t accounted for? A Trump presidency. “Heaven help us!” he says, laughing. “Please, no! I’m not even going to think about that one. I can’t even utter the sentence out loud.” 
In spite of Republicans voting Clinton on Election Day, they are still acting like whiny children, stopping at nothing to push their counter-intuitive political agenda on America. It is a prime example of Republican hypocrisy, and selfish refusal to let the country run optimally in favor of the agendas of their corporate masters and the monied elites.",0
25118,"Who Will Win The Election? FBI, NSA, CIA!","License DMCA In a TV interview today I was asked, considering the new FBI revelations about Hillary's emails, who would win the election. I replied that the FBI would be the winner, that the USA's intelligence agencies would be deciding who would win-- an outrageous, traitorous situation. On Monday, I had dinner with three heroic NSA whistleblowers-- Bill Binney, Thomas Drake and Kirk WIebe-- after they'd shared the stage in a panel discussion presented at West Chester University. Whistleblowers Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe and moderator/organizer West Chester professor Jana Nestlerode(image by Rob Kall) License DMCA - Advertisement - I came away with the clear conclusion that the US Intelligence community is a major threat to democracy. The whistleblowers stated that NSA tracks the signal intelligence-- phone calls, emails, credit card transactions, medical bills, automated toll payments-- for every American and for billions of people -- seven billion nodes. The intelligence agencies track every member of congress and all their family and friends. They track all the people in the White House, all the people in the Supreme court, all executives of corporations. All it takes is one brother-in-law selling drugs or hiding a criminal record to get a job and that puts a person of power in congress, the White House, wherever, at risk of coercion. That's why privacy is so important to all of us, even if we have something to hide. We can be blackmailed because we love someone who has something to hide. Remember, Ed Snowden was able to access the information. Actually, there may be thousands of private contractors-- employees of big corporations-- who have access to all or part of the massive data trove. There's even a name for one of the things they do. Remember, ""Sig-Int"" is the term used to refer to signal intelligence-- anything that can be picked up electronically. These contractors and intelligence agency officers engage in what is called ""love-Int,"" basically spying on wives and girlfriends to find out if they are cheating. The abuse of the system is dangerously, rampantly out of control. The recent disclosures of nebulous information about Hillary Clinton's emails are an outrageous, screamingly transparent effort to influence the election. There is no way to justify the timing. This is just the latest stretching beyond the boundaries by an intelligence agency leader. It has to stop. FBI head Comey should be charged with whatever laws apply which relate to using government power to unlawfully influence elections. It is clear that the FBI as well as the NSA, which surely has had all of the missing emails all along, have used their control over and selective analysis of them to influence the election. This should not have happened. It can never happen again. The presidency of the United States must not be determined by the head or heads of a spy agency. And it looks like that's what we're seeing. Whether you support Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, this process should be horrifying to you. - Advertisement -",0

[In the report, Apple requested permission conduct a new wave of “  manufacturing” at a factory in Mesa, Arizona, as well as approval from the   Zones Board to build “finished products” exempt from normal customs duty payments.  “Apple Inc has repurposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct   manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers,” read the document, published by the Federal Register on Monday. If approved, the operations could create a range of new jobs in the area, with Apple currently advertising a “Data Center Site Services Technician” position for their Mesa factory.   Donald Trump repeatedly criticised Apple and other prominent US companies for producing their products overseas, promising that should he be elected, companies would return to manufacturing their products in America.

25122,New Videos Appear to Show Congolese Soldiers Shooting Civilians - The New York Times,"KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo  —   The emergence on Monday of several videos that appear to show uniformed soldiers shooting Congolese civilians has added urgency to calls for an international investigation of recently discovered mass graves in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Last week, the Congolese military’s auditor general announced that seven officers had been arrested and charged with war crimes after a video surfaced last month depicting soldiers shooting a group of civilians in   Province, a massacre that left at least 13 dead. Now at least five new videos that appear to show members of Congo’s military shooting civilians are circulating on social networking platforms. Amid mounting accusations of violence against civilians, and the discovery of 10 mass graves dug in January and February in   the chief of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo urged the United Nations Security Council this week to press the government to open an investigation into possible rights violations. The chief of the mission, Maman Sambo Sidikou, urged Congo’s government on Tuesday to investigate the recent reports “to ensure that the perpetrators of these acts are held fully accountable and that justice is done,” according to Charles Bambara, Mr. Sidikou’s spokesman. In Congo, elected officials and rights advocates are calling for an international investigation. On Wednesday, Claudel André Lubaya, a member of Parliament representing   said an independent international panel was needed to investigate the eight mass graves in his province, “as well as the possibility of other mass graves in all areas where clashes have been reported. ” Jonas Kabiena, the national coordinator of a network called the New Congolese Civil Society, also called for an international inquiry and said on Wednesday, “We condemn the excessive use of force against populations without means of defense. ” The Congolese Army has been carrying out operations against a militia in the region. Fighting between soldiers and rebels has left hundreds dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of people since August. A government spokesman, Lambert Mende, told Reuters this week that the bodies in the mass graves were those of militia fighters, and that the group’s fighters, not the army, had buried them. The government denies that its soldiers have used disproportionate force against the often lightly armed fighters. Militia members could not be reached for comment, Reuters said.   Province is volatile, with frequent clashes despite the presence of United Nations peacekeepers. This month, two United Nations officials, an American and a Swede, were among six people abducted in the area. On Saturday, the United Nations mission in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, released a statement expressing concern about reports of renewed fighting and restrictions on the movements of its peacekeeping forces. In response to that statement, the government angrily criticized the United Nations mission on Tuesday for making “imprecise allegations” that hampered “the discovery of the truth. ” But Mr. Lubaya said the inaction of provincial and national officials regarding the mass graves amounted to contempt for the victims, their families and the nation. He added that an investigation was needed to determine who had been killed and how, adding that the victims should be given a dignified burial.",0

The service member was killed near Ayn Issa , a town roughly 35 miles northwest of the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa . The death marks the first time a U.S. service member has been killed in the country since a contingent of Special Operations forces were deployed there in October 2015 to go after the extremist group.

25126,Animal Rights Activists Skeptical of China’s ’Ban’ on Yulin Dog Meat Festival - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   China’s government will reportedly ban dog meat from being sold at this year’s annual and barbaric Yulin festival. However, it is likely cats will be served instead, and animal rights activists note that prior alleged bans on dog meat have usually not prevented the Yulin festival from occurring.  Every year they say the same thing, and when the festival happens, thousands of dogs are tortured. If it becomes true, then it is a victory for the animals. But do not let up the fight. Do not think for one minute it is over. Protest. Use your words and your voice. Be their hero. There are no victories until laws are changed. No milestones achieved until what people say actually happens. While we believe the government wants to change, and while we are trying to work with them to bring that to fruition. Never give in to what is said each year —   it never becomes reality. Scream for them because that is what they do when they are tortured. Be their voice, because as they are drowned, they have no words. Speak until we see the end. Stand until justice is served.  The inhuman practices associated with the dog and cat meat trade have triggered a response from Congress domestically. Rep. Alcee Hastings ( ) presented House Resolution 1406 (HR 1406) “The Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act,” in March. It seeks to”prohibit the slaughter of dogs and cats for human consumption. ”",0

25130,Russia and CIS countries hold large-scale air defense exercises,"cis , military , belarus , kazakhstan , RBTH Daily About 100 aircraft and more than 9,000 troops took part in the drills. Source: Marina Lystseva/TASS 
The annual battle readiness test of the command bodies and alert forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Joint Air Defense System was successfully completed on Oct. 26, the Russian Defense Ministry's department of information and mass communications has said in a statement . 
The exercise involved seven of the 11 CIS countries – Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. About 100 aircraft and more than 9,000 troops took part in the drills. 
""During the training, the battle readiness of the CIS alert forces and air defense assets was tested with flights of training targets, including supersonic and stratospheric,"" the department said. 
Video by YouTube 
The Russian Air and Space Forces' A-50 airborne warning and control systems (AWACS) were used to increase radar detection range in the Eastern European and Central Asian regions during the drills. 
The exercise involved MiG-29, MiG-31 and Su-27 fighters, Su-24 and Su-34 tactical bombers, Su-25 attack bombers and Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters. The Russian Airspace Forces' Tu-160 and Tu-95MS strategic missile-carrying bombers and Tu-22M3 long-range bombers posed as imaginary enemy targets. 
The exercise was led by the head of the Russian air force, Colonel-General Viktor Bondarev. Exercise against hijacking 
The exercise was pre-planned and had nothing to do with the current military-political situation, said Lieutenant-General Aitech Bizhev, former Deputy Commander of the Air Force for the CIS. Controlling the airwaves: Russia's electronic warfare systems 
Usually, the CIS air-defense forces practice executing scenarios involving the use of patrol forces against aircraft that violate the CIS borders, as well as in the case of hijacking of aircraft, in helping the crews of aircraft and helicopters in distress, said Bizhev. 
""In the summer, these exercises develop into tactical live-fire exercises on the Ashuluk firing range in the Astrakhan Region,"" he added. ""This is the so-called practical stage of the international exercises of the CIS Joint Air Defense System, 'Combat Commonwealth'."" Soviet reunion 
The recent exercise primarily involved command bodies from the Central Command Post to command posts of anti-aircraft missile battalions and individual radar companies' control points. 
""By and large, such exercises involve all the air defense troops of the former Soviet Union, of course, severely truncated compared with the 1980s,"" said Bizhev. 
The most important element of the exercise was the practicing of interoperability when aircraft cross the state borders of the CIS Joint Air Defense System members, as well as the movement of forces and equipment to the forward-based airfields, explained Colonel Sergei Volkov, former chairman of the Russian Air Defense Forces' Scientific and Technical Committee. Who are the members of the CIS Joint Air Defense System? 
The CIS Joint Air Defense System was established based on an agreement between 10 member countries, signed on Feb. 10, 1995 in Alma-Ata. Initially it included Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova later left the organization.

In 1997, Turkmenistan effectively withdrew from the CIS Joint Air Defense System, while Uzbekistan cooperates with Russia exclusively on a bilateral basis. All relations in the sphere of defense with Ukraine were terminated after February 2014 over Russia’s seizure of Crimea and support for rebels in the Donbass region. 
According to Volkov, the joint air defense system helps create a more cost-effective duty roster and military personnel training. In addition, according to him, the use of neighboring countries' airfields can dramatically increase the range of fighter aircraft.",0

25132,Speaker Paul Ryan Lays Out His Tax Reform Plan,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) turned his attention to tax reform Tuesday as he addressed a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). [“We are going to fix this nation’s tax code once and for all,” the speaker said to the NAM’s Manufacturing Summit in Washington, DC.  After describing with dismay the complexities and uncertainties of the current tax code, Ryan launched into some specifics of his plan for reform. “First, we will eliminate harmful taxes including the death tax and the alternative minimum tax,” he said. “Next, we will clear out special interest   and expensive deductions,” Ryan continued, explaining that the home mortgage, retirement, and charitable giving deductions would not be on the chopping block. Seven current individual tax brackets would be reduced to three, with the savings from discontinued deductions and streamlining allowing lower tax rates. Ryan promised a “postcard sized” income tax form would be possible under the plan. America’s 35 percent corporate tax rate came into Ryan’s crosshairs, which he compared to Canada’s 15 percent. Ryan partly blamed this tax rate, along with high individual rates for businesses that filed that way, for widespread offshoring of American jobs. “We cannot accept a system that perpetuates the drain of American businesses overseas,” he said. The solution, according to Ryan, is a move to a “territorial system” that allows American companies to move cash from overseas into the country without being taxed. This promise smacked of similarity to the Border Adjustment Tax concept that has caused controversy in earlier Republican tax reform proposals under Ryan’s speakership. Shortly before taking office, President Donald Trump expressed his objections to the concept to the Wall Street Journal. In setting the stage, Ryan touted as legislative successes his caucus’s use of the Congressional Review act, more than a dozen times, to roll back administrative state regulations, before promoting the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the one major bill passed by House Republicans during President Trump’s administration. The AHCA faces an unclear fate in the Senate. Ryan had made clear in the past he was waiting for the House to pass a healthcare bill before moving on taxes. With the House having done so last month, Ryan appeared to be moving forward with plans to introduce tax legislation regardless of how that bill, the AHCA, fares in the Senate. Shortly after the AHCA’s passage, Ryan spoke to New York City’s AM 970 about tax reform prospects, saying, “We are convinced that we can get this done in 2017 so that the economy can really start to take off.   …     All the planets are aligned, meaning you have the House, the Senate and the White House all working on this plan together. ” At the start of the month, House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows told a crowd at the conservative Heritage Institute that he would push for Congress’s August recess to be canceled if a tax bill has not been passed by then. Speaker Ryan seemed to echo that sentiment Tuesday, saying tax reform would move “full speed ahead” but set a later deadline of the end of the year: You will hear that tax reform is coming along. You will hear that it is dead. Then you will hear it is back on track. Then you will hear it is on life support. Sometimes you will hear all of this in the same week, the same day, or heck, even the same hour. Do not be surprised by any of it. But I am here to tell you: We are going to get this done in 2017. We need to get this done in 2017. We cannot let this     moment slip by. Ryan promised that any bill his Caucus introduces will insist on changes to the tax code.",0

25137,Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency… Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. It’s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. Ford’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. “Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn’t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It’s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. “We’re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven’t decided what will go there,” said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. “How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.”

There's only one possible solution. 
Let's load $400 million in unmarked foreign currency on an unmarked cargo plane and deliver it to Iran, Then make follow that up with a few more. And make sure Iran scores $150 billion in sanctions relief. 
That's how we got here . It's SmartPower, which is neither smart nor powerful. 
Earlier this month US Navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from Houthi-controlled Yemen. 
This was likely the first time in history the Navy had to take such measures, and officials are now saying they think Iran is behind the attacks. 
""We believe that Iran is connected to this,"" Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan told NBC News. In fact, the US has intercepted many shipments of weapons from Iran to the Houthi militants, who oppose Yemen's internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population. 
The intercepted shipments ""were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles, boats that we believe were explosive boats, other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw,"" Donegan said. 
I'm sure there's no chance that the billions Obama lavished on Iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own Jihadi candy store. Not a chance. 
And I'm sure that when Iran gets the nuclear weapons that Obama is enabling, it will use them as responsibly as it's using its cruise missiles.",0

The chart, provided by the generally pro-State Department think tank, puts in stark terms how much destruction the U.S. has leveled on other countries. Whether or not one thinks such bombing is justified, it’s a blunt illustration of how much raw damage the United States inflicts on the Muslim world: 
It does not appear to be working either. Despite the fact that the U.S. dropped 947 bombs in Afghanistan in 2015, a recent analysis in Foreign Policy magazine found that the Taliban control more territory in Afghanistan than at any point since 2001. The U.S. has entered its 16th year of war in Afghanistan despite several promises by the Obama administration to withdraw. In October of last year, President Obama reversed his position and decided to keep American troops in Afghanistan until the end of 2017.

John Kasich claimed in his new book that the reason President Trump won the election was because America is in a moral decline. [In Two Paths: America Divided or United, Kasich blamed Trump’s electoral win on groups ranging from the media to dishonest politicians, but he also said one of the main reasons Trump won was because of the spiritual decline in America.  “I happen to believe that you can’t guide an entire society without a shared religious foundation,” Kasich wrote. “I saw Trump’s reckless entreaties as a weakening of our shared American values  —   even more so, a coarsening of our shared American values   …     Donald Trump gave the impression of a man who would do or say anything to get attention, even incite a crowd to violence. ” Kasich also noted that Trump “gave millions of disenfranchised voters a voice. ” “What the voters were telling us in this election was that they were angry, that they were feeling that their lives were out of control, that there was a sense of helplessness and hopelessness in the heartland,” Kasich wrote. Kasich announced back in March that he does not believe he will make another run for political office again, surprising many of his supporters.

25153,Krauthammer: ‘They’re Quaking in Their Boots in Foreign Capitals’ - Breitbart,"Friday on Fox News Chanel’s coverage of the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said of President Trump‘s inaugural address that, “They’re quaking in their boots in foreign capitals. ”  Krauthammer said, “I wanted to make a point about the speech. A part that we overlooked but I am sure is not being overlooked around the world. There are two audiences obviously for inaugural address —  domestic and foreign. I guarantee you that they are quaking in their boots in foreign capitals, particularly of our allies and trading partners. The way that Trump spoke about the outside world was the most aggressive, most sort of hyper nationalist and in some ways, most hostile of any inaugural address I think since the second World War. What Trump pointed out, what he drew was a picture of a   world where what we’ve done for the world, they have been stealing from us. He says for decades we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of our American industry, subsidized others’ military at the expense of the weakening of our army. ”  “We’ve made others rich while becoming poor. Then this scattering sense that the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed around the world. In other words, the other guys, “the other,” including friends. Kennedy spoke harshly about the communist world. This is about our allies,” he continued. “They have been stealing from us, our corrupt ruling class has taken the money of the   and sent it around the world. That is the exaggerated   view. I can understand a lot of the sentiments, but imagine how this has been heard in East Asia, in Europe, in other places, and then he ends up with a phrase that may not be as a resonant here, he says we are going to have one principle, “America First. ” It is capitalized in the version that you get printed out, and capitalized in the name of the isolationist party from the 1930s that fought to keep us out of any entanglements abroad, i. e. out of the second World War, led by Charles Lindbergh and others that dismantled a week after Pearl Harbor. For many people around the world, the British in particular, that is quite a resonant phrase, and it says to them, to the free world, since Harry Truman and Eisenhower, we constructed a world where we carried a lot of you —  economically, militarily, etc. That game is over, you are on your own. That is an amazing message for an inaugural address.  We heard it on the campaign, but that is policy now and it’s going to have a huge effect around the world. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

25155,Collision of Buses and Fuel Truck in Afghanistan Kills More Than 50 - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   More than 50 people were killed on Sunday in southeastern Afghanistan’s Ghazni Province when two buses collided with a fuel truck, which then exploded, officials said. Scores of others were injured, many of them critically. The crash in Ghazni was bad even by the standards of Afghanistan’s notoriously dangerous mountain highways. A total of 111 people were either killed or injured, said Hamidullah Nawroz, the head of Ghazni’s provincial council, but because the victims were taken to many hospitals in different cities, and many died on the way, the number of fatalities was hard to determine. A bus full of passengers tried to pass the   fuel tanker on a narrow highway in Mukur District around 6 a. m. Sunday and crashed   into another fully loaded bus, Mr. Nawroz said. Both buses then collided with the tanker, which exploded and engulfed all three vehicles in flames. Estimates of the number of fatalities ranged from 50 to 76, and many feared that the death toll could be even higher. Ismail Kawusi, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s Ministry of Health, said that there were 140 passengers on the buses but that rescue workers had identified only 50 bodies so far. Many of the remains were badly burned, and body parts were scattered around the accident site. “It takes time, and only forensic medicine will be able to identify them,” Mr. Kawusi said. In Kabul on Sunday, the government hanged six Taliban prisoners convicted of various terrorism offenses  —   the first such executions of President Ashraf Ghani’s administration. The executions had been expected for some time, after the Taliban’s Haqqani network detonated a large truck bomb on April 19 at the National Directorate of Security, the country’s intelligence agency, killing 64 people. Mr. Ghani vowed in a speech afterward to retaliate with military action and the execution of Taliban prisoners. During his tenure, which began in September 2014, the government had executed only one prisoner, a notorious crime boss, although about 300 men are on death row. All six who were executed Sunday were members of the Taliban or the Haqqani network, a Taliban faction that has operated independently, according to a statement from the National Directorate of Security. The president signed the order for the executions, according to a statement released by his office, after “repeated requests from the families of victims of terrorist attacks. ” The statement continued, “The signing happened after a close examination of the fairness of the sentencing process, in accordance with Afghanistan’s human rights obligations. ” The executions reflected a lack of optimism among Afghan officials about efforts to restart the peace process with the Taliban, who have refused to attend recent sessions hosted by Afghanistan’s neighbors. The Taliban responded to the executions by threatening “to make military targets out of all those institutions involved in the martyrdom of prisoners,” according to a statement issued by Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the group. “They will not be able to breathe one breath in peace, and their relatives will not be able to live with confidence, either. ”",0
25156,Taiwan’s President Accuses China of Renewed Intimidation - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   President Tsai   of Taiwan sharply criticized China’s leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. “Step by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,” she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions between Taiwan and China, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that São Tomé and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan’s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan. Despite Beijing’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. “We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One China policy, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized China’s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. Tsai’s words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of China’s show of strength. “She remains calm, rational and patient,” Ms. Glaser wrote in an email. Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. Tsai’s preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. Trump’s bombastic style. Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to “maintain a balance among relations with China, relations with the United States and domestic politics. ” Ms. Tsai’s vision, however, “may not align well with the incoming Trump administration’s apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,” he said. Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan. Ms. Tsai described the visit as “unofficial,” saying, “A transit stop is just a transit stop. ”",0

PRESS TV 
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has found no clear links between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia, officials say, proving false allegations by the candidate’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
The FBI spent most of the summer to verify claims by the Clinton campaign that Trump was linked to President Vladimir Putin, and Moscow was trying to influence the November 8 vote in his favor. 
However, the bureau failed to find any indications of the alleged ties after scrutinizing advisors close to Trump, investigating the real estate mogul’s financial ties and even his emails, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing law enforcement officials. 
Clinton’s campaign voiced concerns about Moscow’s intervention after a series of emails belonging to various ranks of the Democratic Party were released by the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks. 
American intelligence officials blamed the hacks on Russia and even threatened to come up with countermeasures of the same nature. President Barack Obama and high-ranking officials in his administration also blamed Russia for the breaches. 
Under immense pressure from Clinton’s supporters, who were mad at Trump for calling Putin a great leader, the FBI started its investigation into the claims. 
The Clinton campaign has called on the FBI to publicly discuss their findings about the case, as they did with their new investigation into Clinton’s new emails. 
FBI chief James Comey told Congress on Friday that he was reopening investigations into Clinton’s emails after finding a trove of new emails on a laptop belonging to former representative Anthony Weiner, who was once married to Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin. 
At some point during its investigation, the FBI questioned Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign boss, who has reportedly had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, the Times noted. 
The bureau’s agents also investigated an email channel between Trump and the Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s biggest banks. 
After weeks of detailed investigation, the FBI concluded that the connection was nothing more than marketing emails or spam 
Trump has rejected Clinton’s allegations against Russia, and has pledged to work with Moscow and earn Putin’s respect.",0

C. last summer. [“I’m not aware of that,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer replied during a press gaggle with reporters at the White House, when asked by a reporter about the news.  Spicer added that it would be “highly inappropriate” to comment on the ongoing investigation into Rich’s death, despite the possibility of leaked emails to Wikileaks. The Democratic National Committee also declined to comment on the investigation. “We know of no evidence that supports these allegations. We are continuing to cooperate with investigators and have no further comment,” DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. NBC News reported that Ed Butowsky, a conservative financial advisor in Dallas, helped pay for the investigation. Butowsky denied details in the story. “I didn’t pay anybody. I didn’t hire anybody,” he said to NBC News, referring further comment to Rod Wheeler, the former Washington, D. C. homicide detective who conducted the private investigation. Wheeler revealed to Fox News that Rich was communicating with Wikileaks before his death, sparking renewed interest in the investigation. The news was confirmed by an anonymous federal investigator.

POSSIBLE UFO SIGHTING? Man sees 'weirdest thing EVER' while filming fall leaves. 
A Parkland County, Alberta, Canada resident has spotted what he believes are flying objects, orbs, and discs while operating a drone camera. The unnamed man was filming at Hasse Lake when he noticed this odd objects zooming through his frame while shooting footage of the fall foliage. The video, recorded with a Phantom3P drone, was sent to the MUTUAL UFO Network (MUFON). The man stated that it was ""the weirdest thing"" he has ever recorded. 
The odd object was not noticed until the drone operator viewed the video at home. He was operating the drone from 500 meters away and did not physically see the weird shapes. The home video shows a collection of white spheres and one darker object that appears as a disc . 
The object zoomed past the drone, swerved to the left and then vanished. It had to be moving at incredible speeds, as his camera was recording at 60 frames per second. The objects appear as a blur when a frame is paused. The man at first thought they must be birds, but then noticed birds in the frame that do not look anything like the objects. 
The man, who has experience recording over 100 other drone videos, has never recorded anything like this. MUFON is currently investigating the case.

25175,Duterte Tells Civilians to Take Arms Against Islamic State Affiliate After Soldier Beheading - Breitbart,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered an extended military operation against the Islamic State affiliate Abu Sayyaf and assured civilians that any violent action they take to subdue local terrorists will be forgiven in a court of law, following the arrest of a policewoman with ties to the group and the beheading of a soldier. [Abu Sayyaf, which has been active for years in the southern Philippines but more recently pledged allegiance to Islamic State caliph Abu Bakr   has become active in southern Bohol Island, a new territory for them. Duterte’s administration has responded with a reinforced military presence in the region, while Duterte himself has threatened to cannibalize the jihadists.  “I can eat you,” Duterte said this week. “Just give me salt and vinegar. True. Make me mad. Get me a terrorist. Give me salt and vinegar. I will eat his liver. ” In September, Duterte made a similar promise to “eat” Abu Sayyaf terrorists, following a series of attacks on soldiers. Duterte also assured civilians living in affected regions that he would endeavor to protect their right to  . Speaking last week following an attack on soldiers in Bohol, Duterte said, “to the police  …     and even civilians interested to fight and kill, the order is dead or alive. ” “I intend to also arm the civilians and I will include the civilians  …     you don’t have to worry,” he said. “Just go to the police and make a report and state your truth  …     no problem. I’ll take care of you, I’ll pardon you, whatever. ” Duterte has taken a similar stand with drug criminals, assuring civilians of impunity if they kill drug offenders. In addition to the increasingly common clashes between Abu Sayyaf terrorists and police, law enforcement arrested a Philippine policewoman this week for ties to the group. Philippine National Police (PNP) Superintendent Maria Cristina Nobleza is under arrest after police found evidence that she had been engaged in an affair with an Abu Sayyaf bombmaker, potentially handing over sensitive information. The investigation into whether she was a source for the terrorist group is ongoing. Authorities also found the head of Sergeant Anni Siraji, a Philippine soldier abducted on April 20 by the terrorist group. Abu Sayyaf terrorists reportedly beheaded him this weekend after the soldier was assigned to work as an intermediary between the terrorists and police. “He is involved in peace efforts,” Brigadier General Cirilito Sobejana told reporters. “He is not actually a combatant. We are using him to engage stakeholders because he is a Tausug [like most Abu Sayyaf],” he added, referring to the man’s ethnicity. Dutertespokesman Ernesto Abella called the beheading a “barbaric act” over the weekend and vowed more military action. “The President is firm and decisive in the fight against terrorism,” he said. “He has ordered government troops to carry out sustained, focused and intense operations to put an end to lawless and gruesome acts of violence. ” The Philippine Star quotes another PNP official as stating, “[Our] teams will do nothing except to ‘eat Abu Sayyaf in breakfast, lunch and dinner. ’” Duterte, who had repeatedly demanded the United States stay out of Philippine matters during the Obama administration, recently changed his disposition, requesting that American soldiers help his country fight the jihadist insurgency in the south. “As we fought together to stay above the enemy then, so we should help each other to address the threats that confront our societies, our region, and our world,” Duterte said in April, reaching out to President Donald Trump, according to regional outlet   News.",0
25178,Tehran's 'Big Lake' Claim Muddies the Waters in Caspian Sea Dispute,"Get short URL 0 4 0 0 The unique properties of the Caspian Sea has dogged decades of negotiations on the status of the body of water, political scientist Vladimir Sazhin told Sputnik Persian. Russian Defense Ministry Russian Caspian Flotilla Ships Successfully Complete Kalibr Missile Drill This week the 47th Session of the Special Working Group (SWG) on the development of the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea met in Tehran, where deputy foreign ministers of the Caspian states met to discuss a possible agreement on the Sea's status.
Since 1991, the five Caspian Sea countries have made agreements on a range of areas including the environment, the protection of marine resources, security, co-operation in the case of emergency situations and military activities in the lake. 
In practice, they have come to agreement regarding the division of the water surface into sovereign zones. According to this agreement, the five Caspian countries have the right to exploit marine resources up to 25 miles from their coast. This includes 15 nautical miles which constitutes national waters, plus another ten nautical miles in which each state has the exclusive right to fishing. The rest of the water is considered international. 
Political analyst Vladimir Sazhin told Sputnik Persian that while the Caspian Sea countries have made a lot of progress on the issue, a final Convention is still far from being agreed. 
""I will say straightaway that for the moment the prospect is extremely remote. At the moment the legal framework for the Caspian Sea is based on two agreements signed by Iran and the Soviet Union in 1921 and 1940,"" Sazhin said. 
""Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, three new littoral states established after the collapse of the Soviet Union, do not recognize these agreements and are holding discussions about the future status of the sea."" 
""Of course, this is justified because after all there are now five, not two independent Caspian states, each of which has an equal right to this sea-lake, on the basis of their geographical location,"" Sazhin explained. © Sputnik/ Baku Summit to Enrich Persian Gulf With Caspian Sea Resources The issue of whether the Caspian Sea is actually a lake or a sea is at the core of many of the disagreements, since the two bodies of water are governed differently under international law.
Iran is convinced that the Caspian is a lake, and should be divided equally five ways, giving Tehran control over 20 percent of the water and sea bed. 
However, Iran's four neighbors in the Caspian insist that, as reflected by its name, the body of water is really a sea. Therefore, they argue, the water and sea bed should be divided according to a modified median line. 
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan have all signed agreements according to this principle. However, since Iran's Exclusive Economic Zone would constitute only 13 percent of the sea according to this principle, the proposal is rejected by Tehran. 
Azerbaijan to the west of Iran and Turkmenistan to the east reject in turn Tehran's idea, which would deprive them of maritime territory. ...",0

(Via AP) 
The UN refugee agency, also known as the UNHCR, says the number of refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe in 2016 has reached an all-time high. 
""We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded,"" said the UN refugee agency spokesman, William Spindler, on Wednesday. 
The alarming surge, which surpassed the death toll of 3,771 for 2015, comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the Mediterranean in 2016. 
More than a million people reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2016, while fewer than 330,000 crossings have been reported so far this year. 
The number of refugees heading to Europe has declined as the European Union in March signed a controversial deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the EU to either be located in Turkey or go back to the original country of departure. 
Since then, the route between Libya and Italy across the central Mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to Greece have been closed down. 
According to the agency, the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between Turkey and Greece was one in 88, while one death for every 47 arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between Libya and Italy in 2016. 
The UNHCR attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded “lower quality vessels, flimsy inflatable rafts” often used by smugglers. In this October 21, 2016 photo provided by Sea-Watch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. (Via AP) 
25 refugees found dead in Mediterranean Sea, MSF says 
Earlier on Wednesday, Doctors Without Borders, known as the MSF by its French acronym, said 25 bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the Mediterranean. 
The MSF said its ship, Bourbon Argos, found the bodies aboard the vessel 26 nautical miles off Libya late on Tuesday. The vessel was carrying 107 survivors. The victims had apparently been burned, suffocated or drowned. 
The recovery operation, which took place with the help of a team from the Berlin-based non-governmental organization Sea-Watch, took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater. 
""The mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods. It was horrible,"" said Michele Telaro, the MSF project leader. 
The MSF also saved 139 people aboard another dinghy on Tuesday. Sea-Watch recovered a body in another operation. 
The Italian Coast Guard reported that 500 refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on Tuesday.

In March of 2016, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia (in 1998-2004), Igor Ivanov, said that the danger of a nuclear war in Europe was higher than it was in the 1980s.Ivanov, who now heads the Russian Council for International Affairs, noted a high risk of confrontation with the use of nuclear weapons in Europe. According to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute, Russia and the United States currently own fewer nuclear weapons than they did during the Cold War. However, even though both Russia and the USA have 7,000 warheads each, the countries still own approximately 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world.The former minister, speaking in Brussels to foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland and a US congressman, said: ""We now have fewer nuclear warheads , but the risk that they will be used, is increasing.""He also accused the United States and Europe of raising such risks by deploying the European missile defense system. A part of the nuclear shield is being built on one of the bases in Poland. The missile defense system will be deployed in 2018, which is particularly sensitive for the Kremlin, as the US missile defense system will be taken very close to Russia's borders.

25183,CDC Warns Swimmers of Pool Poopers Following Increase in Parasite Outbreaks - Breitbart,"The CDC has warned swimmers about pool water contaminated by people pooping in them following an increase in cases of a parasitic infection. [CNN reports that cases of a parasitic   infection linked to pools in the United States have doubled between 2014 and 2016 according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report issued by the CDC. Michele Hlavsa, chief of the CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program, stated in an email, “Cryptosporidium is a germ that can make people sick with diarrhea for up to three weeks. ” The parasite can be spread by the feces of an infected person.  The CDC received reports of as many as 32 outbreaks linked to swimming pools and water playgrounds in 2016. In comparison, there were only 16 reports in 2014. In Ohio, nearly 2000 people became sick due to being infected by cryptosporidium or “crypto. ” Symptoms of the infection include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting. “Parents can encourage their children not to swallow the water when swimming,” Hlavsa said, warning that swallowing a single mouthful of contaminated water can lead to illness. “Also, take kids on bathroom breaks every hour, and check diapers in a   area and not right next to the pool,” Hlavsa explained. “We all share the water we swim in, but we don’t want to share germs, pee or poop. ” The crypto infection is a major contributor to diarrheal illnesses in toddlers and infants in countries across Africa and Asia. It can also lead to poor nutrition which can be dangerous for young children. “Crypto is extremely hard to kill with normal levels of chlorine, which is why it’s important to keep Crypto out of pools in the first place,” Hlavsa wrote. “We can all help do this by not swimming or letting our kids swim if sick with diarrhea. ” “Most people who have healthy immune systems will recover from Crypto without treatment,” Hlavsa stated, but she noted that individuals afflicted with diarrhea for more than three days should contact their doctor.

25192,10 Things Anthony Weiner Did That Were Worse Than Storing Hillary Clinton’s Emails on His Computer,"$18 10 Things Anthony Weiner Did That Were Worse Than Storing Hillary Clinton’s Emails on His Computer Posted on Oct 29, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
WaPo is reporting that it was the FBI investigation of Anthony Weiner that caused new emails between Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin to come to light, which apparently might include forwarded State Department memos or correspondence related to State. 
Nothing produces upchuck in the throat like another headline with the name “Anthony Weiner” in it. But here’s an opportunity for me to reprint a column I once did on the things Weiner has said and done worse than sexting. The FBI was investigating him for sending suggestive messages to an under-aged girl. 
The nation is fixated on Trump’s groping and Clinton’s email server (uh, the State Department and the NSA got hacked folks, so it isn’t the case that government servers are secure) and, well, maybe it was fixated for a brief second on Weiner’s sexting. But we don’t seem interested in serious policy questions like Syria and Iraq. Oh, the public got all het up about ISIL in 2014 and demanded something be done, but now it has lost interest. 
So here’s an actually important policy issue on which Weiner shaped public opinion and helped make policy. 
The real scandal surrounding Anthony Weiner is that he is bigoted against Palestinians and has misused his position in Congress to support punitive policies against them. Americans appear to be bored by policy, titillated by private peccadilloes. But it is the policies that are important. Mahatma Gandhi was once kicked out of a brothel in South Africa. No one judges him by his lapses. Weiner, in contrast to Gandhi, has not worked for peace but has rather given knee-jerk support to the worst policies of the most far right-wing parties in Israel toward Palestinians. A social liberal in American terms, Weiner is so blinded by his allegiance to Israel and so studied in his ignorance of the Middle East that he has played a uniformly sinister role in that aspect of foreign policy. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Weiner: 
1. Called for Columbia University professor Joseph Massad to be fired for being critical of Israel; Weiner thus spearheaded a new McCarthyism. 
2. On the Israeli attack, in international waters, on the Mavi Marmara relief ship , Weiner sputtered: “”If you want to instigate a conflict with the Israeli navy it isn’t hard to do. They were offered alternatives. Instead they chose to sail into the teeth of an internationally recognized blockade.” The blockade of Gaza civilians is a breach of international law; it is not internationally recognized and has on the contrary been condemned by almost every nation and human rights organization. 
3. Alleged that the New York Times is anti-Israel: “Amnesty International in particular, has always had bias against Israel, and frankly I would argue that in many cases, the New York Times has, as well.” 
4. Alleged that the Palestine Liberation Organization is still listed by the US as a terrorist organization. It was dropped from the list over 2 decades ago. 
5. Tried to bar the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations from New York. 
6. Alleged that Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestine Authority, is not the head of the PLO. He is. 
7. Refused to condemn the use by Israel of cluster bombs on the civilian farms of south Lebanon in 2006. 
8. Alleged that the Israeli army does not occupy the West Bank and that there is no Israeli Army presence in the West Bank. 
9. Called Israel’s [2009] war on Gaza a “humane” war. 400 children were killed. 
10. Voted for Iraq War authorization in 2002, before later turning against the war. TAGS:",0

2 0 0 1
TO THE EDITOR OF THE LETHBRIDGE HERALD ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016.
As an American with Canadian friends, I have been following with some interest and concern the unfolding story of Anthony Hall’s recent suspension from his position at the .
I have looked to our northern neighbour as one admires a wiser, older sibling. Canadians to me seem less radical, less extreme, and more ethical than my own more reactive countrymen and women. Canada, after all, accepted our draft dodgers of the ’70s who questioned the morality and justness of the Vietnam War. To me, that was something to be lauded. Imagine my chagrin upon learning that a university professor with a 30-year career, who encourages critical analysis and social responsibility, had been suspended without pay, apparently without a formal and unprejudiced investigation occurring first.
Hall’s suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two American academics, Steven Salaita and Norman Finkelstein. Both were openly critical of Zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous Arab populations of the Occupied Territories. Both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of Palestinian rights and lost their jobs.
I adjure the not to take a page out of the American playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world. Please live up to the values of the wiser, more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for Americans like myself.

25200,"Terrorist Who Killed Lee Rigby Will Pursue £20,000 Lawsuit for Teeth Broken in Prison","Islamist terrorist Michael Adebolajo, who murdered Lee Rigby, has found a lawyer who will pursue his claim when he lost two teeth after lashing out at prison guards. [Adebolajo had intended to sue the prison service in 2015 but had not found a lawyer to take on his case. The Sun has reported Adebolajo has now found legal representation and is seeking £20, 000 in compensation.  Muslim converts Adebolajo and accomplice Michael Adebowale were found guilty of murdering    army soldier Fusilier Rigby in broad daylight near his barracks in Woolwich, south east London, in 2013. They mowed him down in a car before hacking him to death with knives and a cleaver. Following his conviction, the terrorist was sent to Belmarsh prison where he lashed out at prison guards before hitting his face on a window, breaking two teeth. The five guards involved were suspended but later cleared following a   investigation.  The Prison Officers’ Association said at the time the guards were restraining Adebolajo, and they only use force “where necessary”. Adebolajo was later found attempting to radicalise other inmates and was moved to Frankland prison in County Durham. During the initial attempt to sue, the Ministry of Justice said it would “robustly” defend itself against claims brought by Adebolajo. “The public will be rightly outraged at the thought of this man receiving compensation from the taxpayer and we robustly defend claims made against the Prison Service,” the ministry said in a statement. On Sunday Lee’s mother, Lyn Rigby, said, “This is nothing more than blood money. This is the last person on earth who deserves compensation. “You can replace broken teeth but you can’t bring back the life of my treasured boy. ” Mrs. Rigby added, “It hurts so much that he just won’t go away and leave us to pick up the pieces of our broken lives. It’s almost as if he revels in the limelight of his heinous crime and has no remorse or shame for what he has done. “Like many killers, he seeks to psychologically control the victims of his crime by toying with our emotions  —   but we won’t be dragged down again. We are learning to be stronger and hold our heads high out of respect and dignity for Lee. ” Adebolajo was sentenced to a whole life jail term for the murder. Adebowale was jailed for life with a minimum 45 years.",0
25201,"If You Have Rhesus (RH) Negative Blood, You Are Alien","Share on Facebook Studies conducted on rhesus negative blood types show that they are missing the Rhesus factor , a protein substance present in the red blood cells of other humans. Theories suggest that people with Rhesus (RH) negative blood may be from outside this world. Others suggest they are fallen angels from the heavens above or they belong to an alien race from somewhere in the vast darkness of space. What is clear is that those who have with Rhesus (RH) negative blood are different and unique. A person who has RH negative O blood is able to serve as a donor to any person regardless of their blood type. But if they need blood, only their own type will suffice. They represent 15% of the human race and are mostly from northern Europe. Truth Theory reports: The four common blood types of today include A, B, AB and O . The differences between each blood type is dependent on the proteins in the blood, but when it comes to RH negative blood types, which make up about 10 to 15 percent of the population, they don't have these proteins. The question that is on the minds of scientists now, is where this group of RH negative blood type people originates from. Looking back about 35,000 years, scientists believe that the blood type is linked to specific tribes and groups. Europeans have the greatest incidence of this blood type, but only 3% of African-Americans have it, and only 1% of Asian people have it. Some common characteristics of people with this blood type include having a higher IQ, having a lower body temperature, having more awareness (physically and emotionally), having red hair, being sensitive to heat, and having blue, green or hazel colored eyes. This blood type is shrouded in even more mystery when we look at pregnant women. RH negative women who become pregnant have difficulty delivering a baby with an RH positive blood type, as their bodies naturally attack and try to kill the fetus. Thus, they are given a special sterilized solution. ( Anti-D or RHo (D) immunoglobulin ) But, why would the woman's body attack the offspring it's been helping give life to? This is where a relatively new theory comes in and suggests that it's possible alien life has influenced this blood type. What’s even stranger is that almost every person who has reported being abducted by (or interacted with) aliens has the RH negative blood type. It's certainly very possible that aliens visited our planet, as they've done for centuries, and somehow tooled around with the genetics of mankind. After all, history from all over the world has shown time and time again, through ancient texts and depictions, that we've been visited by beings not of this world. What do you think about the blood type that is missing a key link to evolutionary humans ? Could it be that some of us have alien blood running through our veins? Related:",0

Однако приход Дональда Трампа на пост президента США привел к ситуации, когда в самом центре элиты появился человек со стороны. Трамп смог добиться такого невероятного результата, дав голос не только самой обездоленной части американского населения, но и небольшим радикальным группам, которых остальные политические представители даже за людей не считали. Однако теперь любая попытка как-то улучшить экономическое положение простого американца будет сопровождаться отчаянным сопротивлением со стороны элиты, которая и дальше намерена продавать американское оружие всем подряд, лишь бы нажиться на этом посильнее. В итоге, отмечает автор, едва эта закулисная борьба принесет что-то кроме неразберихи в американскую политику. С другой стороны, большая часть демократов раздосадована тем, что Берни Сандерсу не дали представлять свою партию, хотя все опросы показывают, что он бы победил Трампа с большим отрывом. В результате в ближайшее четыре года Демократическая партия США будет заниматься чисткой своих рядов от всех сторонников четы Клинтон, в то время как Республиканская попытается любым способом избавиться от Трампа и найти ему замену, поскольку он, по их мнению, не представляет их интересов.

25204,BREAKING: FBI Gets Search Warrant For State Department Emails On Weiner’s Computer (VIDEO),"BREAKING: FBI Gets Search Warrant For State Department Emails On Weiner’s Computer (VIDEO) By Michelle Oxman on October 30, 2016 Subscribe 
On Sunday afternoon, October 30, 2016, the FBI obtained a search warrant for emails on a laptop owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner. You’ll remember that Weiner was under investigation for sexting a 15-year-old girl. As it happened, the same laptop also contained emails that Abedin, Clinton’s Chief of Staff at the State Department, forwarded to her personal Yahoo account so she could print them. That’s why FBI agents got Director James Comey’s approval to seek access to the emails, as Comey told Congress (and we reported ) on Thursday, October 28. A Rather Unusual Warrant 
Now, when is the last time you ever heard about a search warrant being granted? I bet you can’t think of one. That’s because police and prosecutors ask the court to issue warrants in secret. That makes sense, even to those of us who usually err on the side of supporting civil liberties. After all, if you knew the police had a warrant to search your home or your computer, what would you think of doing? 
Why do we know about this warrant? Because James Comey told Congress there were new emails “pertinent” to the Clinton investigation. Trump supporters argued that the government must have reviewed the emails and would only have released the information if there was important new evidence. In reality, the FBI couldn’t do so legally. Why? Because the warrant to search the computer for evidence of Weiner’s contact with a 15-year-old girl could not have covered Huma Abedin’s work-related emails from three or more years earlier. There’s a helpful explanation of the legal issues relating to the search warrant in today’s Washington Post. 
Still, faced with the innuendo and implications of illegality in Comey’s vague letter, Clinton and her supporters insisted that the FBI disclose what it had. Perhaps the FBI didn’t want to admit that it didn’t know what it had. Or maybe the FBI didn’t want to admit that it had gotten its knowledge illegally. Getting a search warrant bought the FBI time, though, and left the whole mess hanging over Clinton’s head as she approaches the last week of the campaign. Violating Policy 
There seems to be no doubt that Comey’s letter to Congress violated two long-standing tradition and policies: (1) prohibiting discussion of ongoing investigations; and (2) not taking actions to favor one side or another in elections. Two former Deputy Attorneys General, one Democrat and one Republican,publicly questioned Comey’s fitness to lead the FBI because of it. In addition, others have pointed out that Comey has repeatedly gone beyond established limits in his discussions of the Clinton email investigation. The Known Unknowns 
We still don’t know whether any of the emails on that computer contain new information. We don’t know whether Secretary Clinton ever sent emails to Abedin’s personal account on that computer or received emails from Abedin via that account. We don’t know whether classified information was sent or received via this personal computer. We don’t know what any of the emails would tend to show about Clinton’s respect for classified information. After all, it wasn’t Clinton, but Abedin, who forwarded the emails. One Final Question 
Apparently, the FBI agents working on the Weiner case became aware several weeks ago that the computer contained emails that Abedin forwarded to herself while she worked at the State Department. Why did they wait until last Thursday to tell Comey? Surely they anticipated his likely reaction? Did they “play” Comey to manipulate the election results?

25208,How the Ancient World Invoked the Dead to Help the Living,"Ancient Origin 
Though it may seem as if Halloween is a modern con trick designed to get us spending our hard-earned cash on an American celebration, this is not the case. In fact, dressing up, knocking on neighbors’ doors and asking for food at this time of year is a very old tradition. Communities on the British Isles were taking part in similar rituals as far back as the 16th century . 
For centuries, people have believed this was the time when the boundary between our world and the spirit world became permeable. Terrifying outfits and specific rituals were designed and used to ward off or appease evil spirits roaming the earth around All Hallow’s Eve. But evidence has also been found of ordinary people, as early as the times of the ancient Greeks and Romans, using magical incantations throughout the year to call on those departed to help the living. Lead tablets, found bound together, with magical inscriptions. Dated to 300–500 AD. Marie-Lan Nguyen ( Public Domain ) 
Though the Romans certainly invoked spirits for aid, they also felt the need to placate the dead. According to the Roman poet Ovid , at the Lemuria festival in May, the pater familias – that is the head of the household – walked around the house at midnight, throwing black beans on the floor to pacify any ancestral spirits who might be vengeful because they had not been buried. 
The Romans thus had similar concerns regarding angry spirits, but, like the Greeks, they also saw the uses of those vengeful dead in their daily quest for happiness. Ancient Incantations 
The Greeks and Romans were as anxious about their health and happiness as we are today. So other, more private – sometimes questionable – approaches were tried, and such practices became labelled as “magic” as early as the fifth century BC. 
Magic was big business for the ancients – and though its professionals were often accused of being charlatans who were only after customers’ money, it thrived throughout antiquity. Spells were used for various purposes. Erotic spells, for example, cast to attract someone or control your love interest, were very popular. But they were also used to confound an opponent’s speech in court, make the horses you bet on win in the races, or curse a thief who stole your money.",0
25215,Robert Durst’s Transfer to a Los Angeles-Area Prison Is Approved - The New York Times,"Robert A. Durst, the real estate scion charged with shooting a confidante in the back of the head in her Los Angeles home 16 years ago, is headed to the same federal prison that once held the crime boss Al Capone, the former Harvard professor and LSD advocate Timothy Leary and the mass murderer Charles Manson. Mr. Durst, 73, who has been held in New Orleans on unrelated gun charges for more than a year, will be transferred to the   federal prison at Terminal Island, outside Los Angeles, where he will await formal arraignment by Aug. 18 on murder charges in the killing of his confidante, Susan Berman. Prosecutors in Los Angeles contend that Mr. Durst killed Ms. Berman shortly before Christmas 2000 so that she would not reveal what she knew about his role in the sudden disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen, 18 years earlier. At the time, the authorities in New York had reopened the investigation into Ms. Durst’s disappearance, prompting Mr. Durst to flee New York. During a   hearing on Wednesday in United States District Court in New Orleans, Mr. Durst, appearing frail and shrunken in an orange jump suit, told Judge Kirk D. Engelhardt that he had been “wanting to get to Los Angeles for almost a year to enter my   plea. ” Judge Engelhardt approved a defense motion that Mr. Durst be sent to Terminal Island. The judge also approved a prior plea bargain arrangement, in which Mr. Durst was sentenced to 85 months in prison for illegally possessing a .  revolver. Mr. Durst was assessed a $5, 000 fine. Mr. Durst’s lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said Terminal Island “has the facilities to take care of a    man” with various health issues. “He didn’t kill Susan Berman,” said Mr. DeGuerin, the lead lawyer in what has become a formidable defense team of lawyers from Houston, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. For more than two years, John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County, has been building a circumstantial case against Mr. Durst that ties together Ms. Berman’s unsolved murder and Ms. Durst’s disappearance. After the arraignment in August, Mr. Durst will for the first time get a look at the prosecution’s case, through discovery. That will almost certainly lead to a protracted period of wrangling over the evidence, which includes handwriting analysis, filmed interviews with Mr. Durst and testimony from friends and relatives. Mr. Durst had been active in New York in the family real estate business until 1994, when his father and his uncle turned the reins of the empire over to his younger brother, Douglas Durst. In 2003, Robert Durst, who had moved to Houston, was acquitted of murder charges in Galveston, Tex. in spite of admitting in court that he had carved up the body of a neighbor and threw the body parts into Galveston Bay. Mr. Durst has been fodder for books, television specials, and dramatic and documentary movies, including the HBO documentary   “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. ” He has even been parodied on comedy shows: The actor Fred Armisen, who first played Mr. Durst in a “Saturday Night Live” sketch, is reprising the role in the Netflix series “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” where he appears as an old flame of one of the characters.",0

Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo partially attributed the new stock market record to Trump’s speech to congress on Tuesday night and the new plans coming from his administration’s economic team. “You’re seeing a growth plan come out of the Trump administration and, increasingly, you’re seeing the officials out of the Trump administration talk about a timeline and so that was really the catalyst for today’s rally,” she said in an interview on talk radio’s 1210 WPHT. “He didn’t have any mention of a border adjustment tax.

Initially, Cuban actually supported Trump’s candidacy as someone independent from politics as usual, but as he (and we all) learned more about the dark past of The Donald’s dirty dealings , sexual predations and more, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner threw himself wholeheartedly into the political arena, culminating with front row seats to the last presidential debate. 
Cuban sat down with local radio broadcasters to discuss rumors that his anti-Trump stance might cost him ticket sales for his NBA franchise. Mark Cuban probably, literally dropped the mic after this response: 
“You know what, when it’s all said and done, I’d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And so if it means we play to empty arenas, I’m down with that.” 
“Maybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I don’t know,. I’ve heard it from both. I’ve had people say ‘there’s no way I can support you. I can’t go to another Mavs game.’ And I’ve had people say ‘you know what? We’re buying Mavs tickets.’ What I’ve heard more often than anything is, ‘are you gonna be this way once the election’s over?’ And the answer is no. You’ve known me forever Newy and I’ve been apolitical my entire adult life and only because I know Donald and I know my feelings about what he would be like as president have I gotten this involved but come November 9, it’s all Mavs all the time.” 
Mark Cuban is a shining example of how any American should approach the political arena, which he does by placing integrity over ideology and the good of the country in his viewpoints above the simple view of his bank account’s short term health. Luckily, Cuban is a franchisee in the NBA, which is far and away America’s most progressive major sports league, which doesn’t guarantee ongoing success, but does mean that the typical NBA fan values tolerance and diversity over racial segregation and hatred.",0
25220,Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell: Celebs Need to ’Chill’ on Trump,"Founding Backstreet Boys band member Brian Thomas Littrell has added his voice to the growing number of celebrities insisting that Hollywood stop panicking over the election of Donald Trump. [“Hollywood needs to chill, ok? Hollywood needs to chill out,” Littrell told a TMZ reporter.  The singer said the incoming president is going to do “great things” for the country, and for those people who didn’t support him. “He’s going to be our president, he’s going to be our   . And he’s going to do so many great things for this country,” Littrell said. “In my opinion, he’s going to do great things for this nation  —   and even for those people who disapprove of him.

25222,BREAKING: CLINTON CLEARED...Was This A Coordinated Last Minute Trick To Energize Hillary's Base? » 100percentfedUp.com,"
Limbaugh said that the revelations in the Wikileaks material were “starting to hurt” the Clintons and that the renewed interest in an FBI investigation into her private email server would be a fruitless distraction. 
In any case… 
IT’S TIME TO DRAIN THE SWAMP! 
FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI’s original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. 
Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would, in the unrelated case, review additional emails related to Clinton’s time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. 
“Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,” Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. “During that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusion.” 
The new case is purportedly related to ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner using a laptop he shared with estranged wife and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin for “sexting” an apparently underage female.

A court in Bahrain has imprisoned and revoked the citizenship of more than a dozen people after convicting them of terror charges as the ruling Al Khalifah regime continues with its heavy-handed crackdown on political dissidents in the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom. 
On Thursday, the Fourth High Criminal Court convicted two defendants to 15 years in jail and three others to 10 years behind bars each on charges of “forming a terror cell, running it and recruiting new members.” 
Seven other people were slapped with seven years in jail each. Three others, namely Sheikh Mohammad Ali al-Tal, Mohammad al-A'ali and Ismail Abdulaziz, were sentenced to life imprisonment. 
The trio were also ordered to pay a cash fine of 200,000 Bahraini dinars (over $530,000). 
The court later revoked the citizenship of all the 15 defendants. 
Separately, Bahrain's Supreme Criminal Court sentenced two civilians to 5 years in prison on charge of holding an anti-regime protest in the small village of Jurdab earlier this year, and setting scrap tires ablaze. 
Thousands of anti-regime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the kingdom on February 14, 2011. 
They are demanding that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power and a just system representing all Bahrainis be established. 
Manama has spared no effort to clamp down on the dissent and rights activists. On March 14, 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were deployed to Bahrain to assist the Manama government in its crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of Al Khalifah regime’s crackdown on anti-regime activists. Loading ...",0
25225,"U.S. Stock Markets Hit Record Highs, but Tech Stocks Tumble - Breitbart","U. S. stock markets charged to record highs last week, but a Goldman Sachs downgrade knocked down the so called FAAMG tech stocks that have led the Trump stock boom. [The Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA] rose 89. 44 points, or 0. 42 percent, to close at an    of 21, 271. 97 on June 9. The index, which includes many of America’s largest companies, is up by 7. 64 percent    and up 18. 27 percent in the last 12 months.  Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Bouroujerdi warned that the $600 billion outperformance by the 5 biggest tech stocks known as FAAMG  —   Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet  —   had contributed about 42 percent of all stock market gains over the last year. Goldman worries that the boom has created an “valuation ” similar to the ridiculously high valuations for tech stocks during the   boom, according to Zero Hedge. Bouroujerdi suggested that stock traders consider that after the 500 percent gain for the   NASDAQ index during the   bubble, which lasted from 1995 to 2001, the   bust that lasted until 2003 saw the NASDAQ lose 85% of its valuation. Goldman’s    report on June 9 caused Facebook, Inc. [FB] to tank 3. 3 percent. Amazon. com, Inc. [AMZN] dropped by 3. 16 percent, Apple Inc. AAPL plunged 3. 88 percent, Microsoft Corporation [MSFT] was down by 2. 27 percent, and Google’s parent Alphabet [GOOG] took a 3. 41 percent dive. There have been a tremendous number of doubters in the latest bull market, which has risen by 260. 5 percent since it began on March 9, 2009. During that period, there have been 12 market corrections of at least 5 percent, according to the Advisor Perspectives blog. During that fabulous run, the U. S. total nominal net worth of households and nonprofit organizations has zoomed from $56 trillion to $96 trillion through the end of the first quarter. That works out to about $292, 000 per capita. Stock market bulls highlight the current positive momentum in the real economy. It is widely known that the U. S. unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent inn late 2009 to 4. 3 percent, the lowest level in 16 years. But the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed June 6 that its Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) indicator reached an   record of 6, 044, 000 million jobs available at the end of May. Stock market bears are less optimistic. Billionaire commodity guru Jim Rogers, who correctly called the 2008 crash, told the Business Insider that the current combination of record debt and    real estate and stock valuations means that the next economic crash will be “the biggest in my lifetime. ” A more balanced view of the stock market comes from Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which manages $150 billion. He wrote earlier this month: “Big picture, the near term looks good and the longer term looks scary. ” He added, “[W]e fear that whatever the magnitude of the downturn that eventually comes, whenever it eventually comes, it will likely produce much greater social and political conflict than currently exists. ”",0

25228,Being an Afghan General Is Nice Work if You Can Get It. And Many Do. - The New York Times,"Afghanistan may struggle to recruit enough soldiers for its armed forces, but it’s swimming in generals. The country has close to 1, 000 officers of general rank on its books  —   more than the United States, whose military is three times as large. And off the books? No one knows. New names are added to the roster at a rate far out of proportion to battlefield realities, where the Afghan armed forces  —   the army, national police and intelligence forces, numbering 350, 000 in all  —   have been steadily losing soldiers and territory to the Taliban. Meanwhile, retirements are rare. The United States government, which picks up much of the tab for the Afghan military, can’t pin down the number of generals. “We still don’t know how many police and how many soldiers we’re paying salaries for,” said John F. Sopko, the United States special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction. “We don’t even know how many generals. It is pretty pathetic, and here we are, 15 years into this. ” It’s nice work if you can get it, with fairly good pay, fringe benefits and a pension. So how do you become an Afghan general? Some of them have climbed the command ladder for decades, working hard and surviving purges by successive governments. But others took much easier routes. Suppose you are the young son of a former warlord who has just died. Along with condolences, the government will make you a general, as if the rank were hereditary. Commissions are also handed out as political   to male relatives of important figures. And in the golden age of    —   the 1990s civil war  —   they were sometimes distributed in lieu of pay. In the anarchy that followed the Soviet withdrawal and the fall of the Communist regime, hundreds of generals were born overnight. Sibghatullah Mujadidi, the interim president of the mujahedeen government, which was backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, had little to offer the disheveled fighters who crowded his waiting room, so an aide kept note of whoever asked to become a general. According to Abdul Hafiz Mansour, who ran state television at the time and is now a member of Parliament, a confidant of the president  —   often his son  —   would turn up at the studios every evening to hand the news anchor a list of new generals to declare. One night, he said, there were 38 names. “The list would be handwritten on a plain sheet of paper  —   there was no logo, no official stationery,” Mr. Mansour said. The list sometimes grew mysteriously on the way from the president’s office to the studio. Mr. Mansour said he knew of current generals who had gotten their rank in those days through a little clandestine photocopying and the stroke of a pen. In response to the TV announcements, rival factions across the country would summarily declare their own generals. The former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, who now serves as vice president of Afghanistan, awarded stars to many of the men closest to him, and even printed his own currency to pay them. The joke was that among General Dostum’s bodyguards, there were no colonels.",0
25229,WATCH: They Already Know They’ve Lost As Gingrich Talks Of 2020 ‘Trump Party’ Rematch,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has turned this election season into a complete circus. One of his advisors, former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, said that we may have to deal with his orange face again in 2020. 
In an interview with POLITICO, Gingrich said : “The challenge for everybody’s going to be, ‘What if he gets 48 or 49 percent?’ And what if he says: ‘You know, I like this campaign and stuff. I ain’t leaving’? There will then be a Trump Party.” 
It looks like the Republicans are already planning to obstruct Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if she gets elected. Gingrich said : “I think it’ll be very difficult for the country … I think their message to the Republican leadership will be, ‘You had better prepare to fight her every single day.’” 
Trump broached the subject at a rally in Sanford, Florida. He said that this election is the party’s “last chance.” 
The Trumpkin proclaimed : “Republicans have to finally get smart and come together. This is our last chance. This is bigger than me or any of us. It’s about our country. This is about ending Obamacare. This is about the Supreme Court. This is about rebuilding our military and taking care of our vets, strengthening our borders and keeping our companies and jobs from leaving our beloved country. This is about restoring the rule of law, saving our Constitution and keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.” 
It’s funny that he’s talking about party unity when he spreads divisive, hateful rhetoric, and has for the last year-and-a-half that has split the Republican Party. It became especially bad after the infamous Access Hollywood audio leaked. He has done his best to alienate just about every group out there over the course of his campaign. Hopefully, he will lose to a Hillary Clinton landslide on November 8. Vote Blue!

25230,Van Jones at University of Chicago: Safe Spaces Are a ’Terrible Idea’ - Breitbart,"Speaking at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, CNN contributor Van Jones condemned campus safe spaces, calling them a “terrible idea. ”[  At an event hosted by former Obama staffer David Axelrod, who serves at the Institute of Politics’ Director, Van Jones was asked about the increased demand from students for protection from ideas on college campuses. “There are two ideas about safe spaces. One is a very good idea, and one is a terrible idea. The idea of being physically safe on campus, not being subjected to sexual harassment and physical abuse, or something like that. Being targeted specifically  …    Hey, I’m perfectly fine with that,” Jones claimed. “But there is another view that is now, I think, ascendent  …     It’s a horrible view, which is that ‘I need to be safe ideologically, I need to be safe emotionally, I just need to feel good all the time. And if someone else says something that I don’t like that is a problem for everyone else including the administration,” he continued. Jones suggested that safe spaces from ideas contradict the purpose of a university education: “I think that’s a terrible idea for the following reason: I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take the weights out of the gym. That’s the whole point of the gym.

25232,"Joe Biden Launches ‘American Possibilities’ PAC, Stoking 2020 Rumors","Former Vice President Joe Biden launched a new political action committee Thursday  —   a move certain to stoke rumors that he has his eyes on a 2020 presidential run. [Biden unveiled the “American Possibilities” PAC, giving the former Delaware Democrat the ability to rub shoulders with donors and help candidates in upcoming congressional and gubernatorial races.  “It’s time to reach deep into the soul of this country and once again give everyone  —   and I mean everyone  —   the opportunity to achieve the impossible. It’s time to look beyond   news cycles and   arguments. It’s time to treat each other with dignity and respect. Not as opponents, but as fellow Americans. Because that’s what we are,” Biden says in a statement on the website. “This is a time for big dreams and American possibilities. If that’s what you believe  —   and you’re ready to help elect folks who believe that, and to support groups and causes that embody that spirit  —   then I’m asking you to join me today. ” However, the creation of the PAC will also serve to increase speculation he is eyeing a potential 2020 run  —   nurturing the support of donors and candidates that he will need to clinch the nomination. The New York Times reported that Biden has tapped Greg Schultz, a former aide and a veteran of President Obama’s presidential campaigns, to lead the organization. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008 Biden. He also considered running in 2015 as a primary challenger to eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton  —   but eventually chose not to. Biden has since expressed regret over that decision, and has said that he “never thought [Hillary Clinton] was a great candidate. ”  “I thought I was a great candidate,” he said at a Las Vegas conference in May. Biden has the potential to be a tricky opponent for President Trump. His run would likely be a more centrist campaign than other potential 2020 candidates  —   such as liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He could also challenge Trump’s hold over   white working class areas in places such as Pennsylvania and Michigan  —   states central to Trump’s 2016 victory. The New York Times reported ahead of the announcement that Biden is frustrated that Clinton lost, particularly her failure to pick up votes from white   voters.

25233,Trump Packs His Blunt Phrase Book Abroad - The New York Times,"When Mitt Romney traveled to Europe as a presidential candidate in 2012, he created an uproar when he wondered aloud whether London was sufficiently prepared to host the Summer Olympics. British tabloids derided him as “Mitt the Twit” and CNN declared: “Romney’s Trip Begins in Shambles. ’’ When Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey went on a trade mission to Britain, he was roundly criticized for an errant comment about vaccinations amid a measles outbreak back home. “A Vaccine for Gaffes? Chris Christie Needs It” was the headline in Commentary. Those moments seem quaint when compared with Donald J. Trump’s news conference in Turnberry, Scotland, a day after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Over the course of 40 minutes, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee made pronouncements, predictions and asides that would have set off serious backlash for almost any other candidate. But Mr. Trump seems to be graded on a different curve. Here are some of his more provocative remarks: A reporter asked Mr. Trump about the suggestion from some pundits that both he and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, would be the biggest political beneficiaries of the “Brexit” vote. Mr. Trump agreed that Mr. Putin could gain, and could not resist pointing out that Mr. Putin has been kind to him. “I think he will be probably, because I know how he’s been scorned to a certain extent,” Mr. Trump said, adding later: “He said some very nice things about me. I think he probably is somewhat of a beneficiary. ” Traditionally, candidates for national office in the United States refrain from insulting their own leaders when they’re traveling overseas. But Mr. Trump, who has bucked almost every other tradition, made no exception for this one. “He’s constantly dictating to the world what they should do. The world doesn’t listen to him obviously,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama, who was against Britain leaving the European Union. “He’s embarrassed. ” Candidates also historically do not engage in politics about their own races when traveling abroad. Yet Mr. Trump described Hillary Clinton as a puppet for Mr. Obama, pointing to her support for Britain remaining in the European Union. “She’s always misread everything,” Mr. Trump said. “If he said leave, she would have said leave. She does whatever he wants her to do. You know why, but that’s O. K. ” Politicians are wary of sounding as if they’re cheering for bad economic news, something that voters tend to respond poorly to. But Mr. Trump said that the diminished pound, which   in value after the referendum vote, could benefit his bottom line at Trump Turnberry, his luxury resort and golf course. “When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve been in touch with them but there’s nothing to talk about,” Mr. Trump said. Besides, he added, he would rather have advisers who are divorced from recent global events. “I think I want to use ones that haven’t been involved, take a look at what’s happened in the world,” Mr. Trump said.",0
25234,Former Assistant FBI Director Says Clintons Are A Crime Family,"
A former assistant FBI Director has slammed Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, saying that it is a “cesspool” and that the family is like an organized crime syndicate.
Appearing on a John Catsimatidis’ radio show in the wake of the FBI reopening the case into Hillary Clinton’s home brew email server, James Kallstrom made the remarks while praising GOP nominee Donald Trump as a ‘good human being’ and a ‘patriot’.
“The Clintons, that’s a crime family, basically,” Kallstrom, a 27 year FBI veteran, said. “It’s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.”
“God forbid we put someone like that in the White House,” he added, referring to Hillary.
Kallstrom, a who was assistant Director of the FBI in charge of the New York office during the 1990s, knows all about crime families, having tracked down mobsters, and swindlers for years.
“It’s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money.” Kallstrom said.
The former FBI official, perhaps most well known for his criminal inquiry into the downing of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, said of Hillary “she’s a pathological liar, and she’s always been a liar.”
Referring specifically to the FBI investigation into her email server, Kallstrom said “The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation.”
“That’s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I’m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.” he added, referring to the Attorney General.
“So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.” Kallstrom added, noting that theFBI “left so much stuff on the table”.
Kallstrom also noted that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the top brass at the bureau were directly responsible for holding back the investigation.
“The agents are furious with what’s going on, I know that for a fact,” he said.
On Friday Kallstrom stated that he thinks “something big is going to happen” in the coming days, and that Comey “couldn’t hold onto it any longer” and had to reopen the investigation because had he not, “the locals would have stepped in,” meaning the regular FBI agents who have seen the bombshell evidence against Clinton.
The full interview can be viewed here .
The Washington Post also reported Monday that regular FBI agents have been pushing hard for the Clinton Foundation to be investigated over claims it gave favors and special access to donors.
The report notes that it was the Justice Department that shut down the line of inquiry into the foundation.

25235,Townhall: ’Why the MSM Is Ignoring Trump’s Sex Trafficking Busts’ - Breitbart,"Liz Crokin of Townhall. com recently published an article titled “Why the MSM Is Ignoring Trump’s Sex Trafficking Busts” discussing the arrests of sex criminals under Donald Trump’s presidency and why it has been underreported by mainstream outlets. [Since President Donald Trump has been sworn in on Jan. 20, authorities have arrested an unprecedented number of sexual predators involved in child sex trafficking rings in the United States. This should be one of the biggest stories in the national news. Instead, the mainstream media has barely, if at all, covered any of these mass pedophile arrests. This begs the question  —   why? As a strong advocate for sex crime victims, I’ve been closely following the pedophile arrests since Trump took office. There have been a staggering   arrests in one short month compare that to less than 400 sex   arrests in 2014 according to the FBI. It’s been clear to me for awhile that Trump would make human trafficking a top priority. On October 8, 2012, Trump tweeted: ‘Got to do something about these missing children grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents  —   fast trial, death penalty. Crokin then goes on to discuss the MILO controversy.  As the MSM has ignored these historical arrests, they have zeroed in on casting conservative icon Milo Yiannopoulos as a monster. They claim he supports pedophilia based on comments he made in a video years ago. The reality is Milo was a victim of child sex abuse, and although he did joke about his abuse in an interview, he in no way promotes pedophilia. The opposite is true, and he addressed this controversy head on in a press conference. Not only is it normal for sex abuse victims to make light of their abuse as a coping mechanism, Milo has personally taken down and exposed pedophiles in his columns over the years. However, the mainstream media and the left ignored this information and demonized Milo. The irony of all this is that the left and MSM have been the biggest proponents of pedophilia. Salon has published articles attempting to normalize pedophilia however, to maintain their faux outrage over Milo, they deleted them. The face of the very fake news network CNN, Jake Tapper, fired off several tweets condemning Milo. For example, he tweeted: ‘My friend, a survivor of sex trafficking: “Milo straight up defended abusing 13 yr old boys  …    Please don’t let that be normalized’ If Tapper is so concerned with sex trafficking, why in the world hasn’t he covered the massive sex trafficking arrests that have taken place since Trump took office? It seems he, and many in the leftist media, are only concerned with sex trafficking if it can be used to destroy a conservative. Read the full article here.",0
25236,Whoa! Even DEMOCRATS Are Now Asking What’s The Difference Between Bill Clinton And Bill Cosby,"0 comments 
Man, you’ve got to hand it to WikiLeaks, for being such a hero in these last seconds of the race when the truth is needed the most. A new batch of damning evidence has just dropped and this time…what was found in them has to do with Bill Clinton…AND Bill Cosby. 
Pop some popcorn, you’re in for a treat… 
Further proof Democrats are my favorite definition of ‘stupid’ 
They see the truth, they know the truth, still decided to push the lie…. 
This latest little revolution comes from an email in which Ron Klain, Chief of Staff to Joe Biden, posited a rather obvious series of questions to Camp Cankles: 
a. Is [Bill’s] conduct relevant to your campaign? b. You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused [your husband]? c. Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies? d. How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? 
Well hey, and this whole time we thought the Democrats were trying to ignore Cosby! He’s getting some attention after all. 
Interestingly, Jake Sullivan of Camp Cankles couldn’t come up with an answer to Klain’s question. So he punted to John Podesta. 
Okay, so while the campaign is doing everything they can to target Donald Trump for his alleged nastiness, a the way back in January of this year, Clinton’s campaign was wondering how they were going to handle Hillary’s rapey chain and balls. 
Not only that, at least Ron Klain noticed that Hillary was being a dastardly hypocrite on the rape issue. “b. You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused [your husband]? c. Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?” 
Hillary’s camp knew the issue would come up, sure. They were prepping their candidate for all the cannon balls lobbed her way. Because even the campaign knew Hillary couldn’t hide behind a tampon-shield for everything. Especially a “woman’s” issue. Like her husband raping the ladies. 
Just goes to show even the Democrats knew Billy’s rapescapades were a problem. 
YIKES! This right here is what might be going into the White House. People that don’t seek the truth, but scramble to hide it with further lies and scheming ideas. 
It’s sickening…but mostly, terrifying. To have this kind of crap in the White House…spells doom. Related Items",0
25237,Nanny In Jail After Force Feeding Baby To Death,"Nanny In Jail After Force Feeding Baby To Death 2 shares by Ike Mclean / October 27, 2016 / LIFE / 
Oluremi Oyindasola, 66, of Glenarden, Maryland has been charged with second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death and other offenses, after she force fed an eight-month-old baby girl who then died. 
Home surveillance footage shows Oyindasola was napping when the eight-month-old child began crying and approached the nanny in a toddler walker. 
Police say Oyindasola then tried to feed the child, and when her attempt was unsuccessful, she “proceeded to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the victim’s mouth.” 
Col. Harry Bond with Prince George’s County Police told NBC Washington Oyindasola “forcefully poured the two bottles of what looks to be milk down the baby’s mouth, causing her to not be able to breathe, suffocating her, and eventually she died at the hospital.” 
In a news release Prince George’s County Police said the following: 
“On October 24th, at about 4.10pm, the baby had been rushed to a hospital after she became unresponsive at home. 
“She was pronounced dead a short time later. An autopsy on Tuesday revealed the baby’s cause of death was asphyxiation. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.” 
“The preliminary investigation revealed the injuries to the baby occurred while in the sole care and custody of Oyindasola.” 
Oyindasol is currently in police custody and is being held on $1 million bond.

In the Beginning, when the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was on the face of the deep, Satan said, “It doesn’t get any better than this”! 
And God said, “Let there be light! “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb, and the fruit tree yielding fruit”. 
And God saw that it was good. 
And Satan said, “There goes the neighborhood”! 
God then created man and woman and saw that they were lean and fit. 
God populated the earth with broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and green and yellow vegetables. 
Satan said, “ I know how I can get back in this game”, and created the cheeseburger. 
And man said, “Supersize the fries”, and gained 5 pounds. 
Satan brought forth chocolate and Woman gained 5 pounds. 
Satan then brought forth fried chicken and fried steak so big, that it needed its own platter. 
And man’s cholesterol went through the roof! 
And God sent running shoes and man resolved to lose weight. 
But Satan brought forth the remote control and ESPN and ESPN 2, and Man gained another 20 pounds. 
And God said, “You’re running up the score Devil”, and brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition. 
And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. 
And man clutched his remote and ate the potato chips, swaddled in cholesterol, and went into cardiac arrest. 
And Satan said, “This is good”! 
And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery. 
And Satan created HMO’s and Obamacare!

25245,"VIDEO: Armed Employee Sneaks up Behind Armed Suspect, Foils Robbery Attempt - Breitbart","An armed employee at Cleveland, Ohio’s Convenient Food Mart, crept up behind an armed suspect and foiled a robbery attempt. [The incident occurred in the Stockyards district around 10:45 pm Saturday.  According to Cleveland. com, the suspect,    Frederick Thornton, walked into the business wearing a surgical mask, pointed a gun at the    clerk, and demanded money. He allegedly became aggravated with the clerk’s pace and “smacked his gun against the register,” demanding the money be handed over quicker. Banging against the register and screaming at the clerk caused enough noise that a    working in the back of the store noticed the commotion, retrieved a handgun, and went out to intervene. The video shows the employee sneak up behind Thornton and put the gun against his back.  Thornton then spun around. The two began to wrestle for control of the guns. An employee came out from behind the counter, took away Thornton’s gun and fired warning shots into the air. Thornton then put his hands in the air at the sound of gunfire and asked the employees “not to shoot. ” While one employee held Thornton at gunpoint, the second armed employee ran outside to see if any accomplices were waiting on Thornton to exit the store. Police soon arrived, arrested Thornton, and charged him with “aggravated robbery. ” Store owner Haytham Mustafa expressed pride in the way his employees handled the situation. He said, “Thank God no one was hurt. They really handled it well. They didn’t go overboard and didn’t hurt anyone. That’s what we wanted to do  —   hold him and let the law deal with him. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

25247,Federal Judge Blocks Trump Immigration Order Nationwide - Breitbart,"In an unusual move, a federal judge in Washington State granted a nationwide emergency order on Friday night blocking President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration travel, declaring the order unconstitutional. The Trump Justice Department can now appeal the order on an expedited basis. [Washington Attorney General Robert Ferguson filed suit against the president and the U. S. Department of Homeland Security in U. S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on behalf of his state and the State of Minnesota, alleging that the order violates the U. S. Constitution and multiple federal statutes. The plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order to halt the order on an emergency basis.  In its amended complaint, the plaintiffs argue that “practices that discriminate against any of [Washington’s] inhabitants because of race, creed, color, or national origin are matters of public concern that threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare, health, and peace of the people. ” Washington argued that roughly 7, 280 aliens in the Evergreen State are from countries impacted by the president’s order, and that the state has legal standing to litigate over possible economic detriments that companies within the state would endure as a result of the order. The   lawsuit argued that President Trump’s executive order violated a host of constitutional rights and federal statutes. While this included typical claims relating to Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection, it also included what many legal scholars consider weak claims, such an insisting that the order amounts to an unconstitutional establishment of religion, and that it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). A temporary restraining order (TRO) is one of the most extreme measures a federal court can take, often issued without full briefing, argument, and other central elements of judicial process. As such they are very rare, reserved for situations where the court cannot even go through an accelerated legal process to grant a preliminary injunction. Judge James L. Robart issued the order orally at the end of this afternoon’s court hearing in Seattle, declaring that the plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of ultimately prevailing on the legal merits of the case, that without the TRO the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm, and that issuing the TRO is in the public interest. The brief notation posted on the court docket after the verbal order specifies that a written order will be filed later, providing greater detail. In the meantime it is not entirely clear which of the ten counts Judge Robart —  who was appointed to the bench by George W. Bush —  thinks the executive order violates. The U. S. Department of Justice can immediately appeal this ruling to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, though it will be difficult to do so before Judge Robart releases his written opinion. If that San   appeals court affirms the order, then the federal government can seek an emergency stay from the U. S. Supreme Court. The case is Washington v. Trump, 2:  .

25251,"Patti chiari, sudditanza lunga, di Manlio Dinucci","français English 
Dopo aver chiamato gli italiani a votare Sì al referendum, ingerendosi nella nostra politica nazionale col complice silenzio dell’opposizione parlamentare, il presidente Obama ha confermato al «buon amico Matteo» che con l’Italia gli Usa hanno «patti chiari, amicizia lunga». 
Non c’è dubbio che i patti siano chiari, anzitutto il Patto atlantico che sottomette l’Italia agli Usa. Il Comandante supremo alleato in Europa viene sempre nominato dal Presidente degli Stati uniti d’America e sono in mano agli Usa tutti gli altri comandi chiave. 
Dopo la fine della guerra fredda, in seguito alla disgregazione dell’Urss, Washington affermava la «fondamentale importanza di preservare la Nato quale canale della influenza e partecipazione statunitensi negli affari europei, impedendo la creazione di dispositivi unicamente europei che minerebbero la struttura di comando dell’Alleanza», ossia il comando Usa. Concetto ribadito dal segretario della Nato Stoltenberg nella recente tavola rotonda sulla «grande idea di Europa»: «Dobbiamo assicurare che il rafforzamento della difesa europea non costituisca un duplicato della Nato, non divenga una alternativa alla Nato». A garanzia di ciò c’è il fatto che 22 dei 28 paesi della Ue (21 su 27 dopo l’uscita della Gran Bretagna) fanno parte della Nato sotto comando Usa, riconosciuta dall’Unione europea quale «fondamento della difesa collettiva». 
La politica estera e militare della Ue è quindi fondamentalmente subordinata alla strategia statunitense, su cui convergono le potenze europee i cui contrasti d’interesse si ricompattano quando entra in gioco il loro interesse fondamentale: mantenere il predominio dell’Occidente, sempre più vacillante di fronte all’emergere di nuovi soggetti statuali e sociali. Basti pensare che l’Organizzazione di Shanghai per la cooperazione, nata dall’accordo strategico cino-russo, dispone di risorse tali da farne la maggiore area economica integrata del mondo. 
Nel quadro della strategia Usa/Nato – documenta la Casa Bianca – l’Italia si distingue quale «saldo e attivo alleato degli Stati uniti». Lo dimostra il fatto che «l’Italia ospita oltre 30 mila militari e funzionari civili del Dipartimento Usa della difesa in installazioni dislocate in tutto il paese». 
Allo stesso tempo l’Italia è «partner degli Usa per la sicurezza globale», fornendo forze militari e finanziamenti per una vasta gamma di «sfide»: in Kossovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libia, Siria, Baltico e altrove, ossia ovunque è stata e viene impiegata la macchina da guerra Usa/Nato. 
Un ultimo fatto conferma quale sia il rapporto Usa-Italia: stanno per arrivare alla base di Amendola in Puglia, probabilmente l’8 novembre, i primi due dei 90 caccia F-35 della statunitense Lockheed Martin, che l’Italia si è impegnata ad acquistare. 
Il costo della partecipazione dell’Italia al programma F-35, quale partner di secondo livello, è ufficialemente quantificato nella Legge di stabilità 2016: 12 miliardi 356 milioni di euro di denaro pubblico, più altre spese per le continue modifiche al caccia che ancora non è pienamente operativo e necessiterà di continui ammodernamenti. Nonostante ciò – conferma Analisi Difesa – l’Italia avrà una «sovranità limitata» sugli stessi F-35 della propria aeronautica. Una legge statunitense vieta che i «dati di missione» (i software di gestione dei sistemi di combattimento dei caccia) siano comunicati ad altri. Saranno dunque gli Usa a controllare gli F-35 italiani, predisposti per l’uso delle nuove bombe nucleari B61-12 che il Pentagono schiererà contro la Russia, al posto delle attuali B-61, sul nostro territorio «nazionale».",0
25252,Emails and Groping: Our Halloween Election Keeps Scaring Us to Death,"Emails and Groping: Our Halloween Election Keeps Scaring Us to Death   
Informed Comment. 
All Hallow’s Eve, contracted now to Halloween, became conflated with the Scottish and Irish pagan Samhain, the harvest festival marking the end of autumn and the beginning of winter. It was an in-between time, when the barrier between this world and the next shimmered and let in decrepit old sprites and gods and monsters that had begun slipping away into the aether with the advent of Christianity. And, the souls of the dead of the past year intruded to visit their homes before being shunted off to the netherworld, as well. Since Celts thought power resided in the head, they often beheaded defeated enemies, so All Hallow’s Eve was the occasion for a fair amount of fumbling about on the part of those who had died violently. 
The 2016 election is very much like Samhain, i.e. like Halloween, in breaking down ordinary time and reality, and letting ogres of the past into our daily lives. 
So we can’t get out of our minds the image of those tiny hands, back in 1982, and 1996, and 1998, grabbing parts of strangers’ anatomy. The simulacrum of the grabber and kisser and predator has popped out into 2016 and wants to replace George Washington and Ike Eisenhower. We are being asked, with a straight face, to elect a groper in chief. A puritan people who drove Gary Hart from politics for some hanky panky on The Monkey Business and impeached Bill Clinton even though he never got to third base, is now all right with making president someone who groped a porn star and then offered to drop $10,000 when he couldn’t get his way. We are entranced and willing to give our fates into the hands of a weird combination of Frankenstein’s monster and the Vampire Lestat. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
The horror of Halloween always lies in the evil deeds of the past now resurrected, as with Syrian director Moustapha Akkad’s “Halloween” films. 
And we’ve had to hear again about the soiled blue dress and the conquests of Bill. 
And again about the Anthony Weiner sexting. And to learn what we never wanted to know, that the FBI is investigating him for sexting with a minor. I mean, if that isn’t a Halloween horror movie I don’t know what is. 
And Herbert Hoover has come back to tell us we’re in a Great Depression and the only way to get out of it is to halt budget deficits and tighten our belts and lower taxes on the rich (the opposite of how FDR actually got us out of the Depression). The creepy dead and the blighted fading deities of old have come crowding through our 2016 rift in the time space continuum. Long-since failed and discredited trickle down economics has been cheekily resurrected. Why, if only you give more of the nation’s money to the super-rich, they’ll make you rich too. You’ll see. Just wait. And wait. And wait. 
It is as though the worst nightmares of the old Soviet Communists finally came through, but with all the irony of history, only after they themselves had faded into the netherworld. 
( Human Rights 
And then there is the revived horror of the Japanese internment and the exclusion of Holocaust-threatened Jews from the United States, only with the perverse magic of Samhain the Japanese have become Mexicans and the Jews have become their spiritual cousins, the Muslims, the other Abrahamians. 
So no wonder Hillary Clinton’s emails can’t be killed. They are Undead emails, slipping in at the fraying of dimensional reality in this season of resurrected monsters and corpses, to haunt us. 
Only the silver stake of an actual election can finally kill these spiteful specters, and save us from this long night of phantasy horror. TAGS:",0

This overunity energy generator does not need any fuel to work and has the ability to harness the energy of the environment. In the video, the generator is buried underground and salty water is poured on top of it. The only part of the generator that is above the ground is the wire for connecting to electronic devices.
From YouTube.com :
This movie I found on a torrent site about a year ago, I have no idea what they are saying, who they are, or when it was shot, but clearly it is a very interesting movie showing how this man gets energy from the earth to power light bulbs and other things! Look closely at his homemade rectifiers, spark gap, etc. Maybe a giant joule thief? Who knows? If anyone can translate for us, we would appreciate it a bunch.

25257,Boosting levels of glutathione with N-acetyl-cysteine may prevent metabolic declines associated with aging,"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © drshel.com Researchers at Oregon State University have found that a specific detoxification compound, glutathione, helps resist the toxic stresses of everyday life -- but its levels decline with age and this sets the stage for a wide range of age-related health problems. A new study, published in the journal Redox Biology , also highlighted a compound -- N-acetyl-cysteine, or NAC -- that is already used in high doses in medical detoxification emergencies. But the researchers said that at much lower levels NAC might help maintain glutathione levels and prevent the routine metabolic declines associated with aging. In that context, the research not only offers some profound insights into why the health of animals declines with age, but specifically points to a compound that might help prevent some of the toxic processes involved. Decline of these detoxification pathways , scientists say, are causally linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer , some of the primary causes of death in the developed world. ""We've known for some time of the importance of glutathione as a strong antioxidant,"" said Tory Hagen, lead author on the research and the Helen P. Rumbel Professor for Health Aging Research in the Linus Pauling Institute at OSU. ""What this study pointed out was the way that cells from younger animals are far more resistant to stress than those from older animals,"" said Hagen, also a professor of biochemistry in the OSU College of Science. ""In young animal cells, stress doesn't cause such a rapid loss of glutathione. The cells from older animals, on the other hand, were quickly depleted of glutathione and died twice as fast when subjected to stress. ""But pretreatment with NAC increased glutathione levels in the older cells and largely helped offset that level of cell death."" Glutathione, Hagen said, is such an important antioxidant that its existence appears to date back as far as oxygen-dependent, or aerobic life itself -- about 1.5 billion years. It's a principal compound to detoxify environmental stresses, air pollutants, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and many other toxic insults. In this study, scientists tried to identify the resistance to toxins of young cells, compared to those of older cells. They used a toxic compound called menadione to stress the cells, and in the face of that stress the younger cells lost significantly less of their glutathione than older cells did. The glutathione levels of young rat cells never decreased to less than 35 percent of its initial level, whereas in older rat cells glutathione levels plummeted to 10 percent of their original level. NAC, the researchers said, is known to boost the metabolic function of glutathione and increase its rate of synthesis. It's already used in emergency medicine to help patients in a toxic crisis, such as ingestion of poisonous levels of heavy metals. It's believed to be a very safe compound to use even at extremely high levels -- and the scientists are hypothesizing that it might have significant value at much lower doses to maintain glutathione levels and improve health. ""I'm optimistic there could be a role for this compound in preventing the increased toxicity we face with aging, as our abilities to deal with toxins decline,"" Hagen said. ""We might be able to improve the metabolic resilience that we're naturally losing with age."" Also of interest, Hagen said, is the wide range of apparent detoxification potential offered by glutathione. Higher levels of it -- boosted by NAC -- might help reduce the toxicity of some prescription drugs, cancer chemotherapies , and treat other health issues. ""Using NAC as a prophylactic, instead of an intervention, may allow glutathione levels to be maintained for detoxification in older adults,"" the researchers wrote in their conclusion.

25258,Donald Trump threatens to jail Hillary Clinton,"Email 
The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could ""be in jail"" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. 

ABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. 
""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words — his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth."" 
Donald Trump: ""If I win, I'm going to instruct my attorney general"" to investigate Clinton https://t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https://t.co/IWGVUleEtr 
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high."" 
""And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,"" she said. ""But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything."" 
She mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. 
Clinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. 
""He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,"" she said. 
Trump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the ""33,000 emails you deleted."" 
""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" Trump said. ""Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor."" 
Clinton said everything Trump said was ""absolutely false"" but she was ""not surprised."" 
""Oh really?"" Trump interjected. 
Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying ""you'd be in jail"" during his potential administration.",0

""Organizers of a criminal group, who are nationalists from the Russian Federation, proceeded from the fact that the government of Montenegro chaired by Milo Djukanovic would not be changed as a result of elections, so one had to overthrow the government by force,"" the prosecutor said, Pravda.Ru reports. Pravda.Ru asked an expert opinion from an expert at the Institute of European Studies, Stevan Gayich. ""Is it a provocation of the pro-Western government? Who is standing behind it?"" ""What the prosecutor's office of Montenegro, and the Djukanovic regime in general, have been doing recently can be described as walking in the fog. The opposition does not recognize the elections, and the government has found itself in a deep political crisis. Djukanovic has already announced that he will not be prime minister if his Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) forms the government. The socialists already say that the DPS has supposedly formed a government, meaning that Montenegro is sure to be a NATO member. In fact, however, the government has not been formed. They defend the interests of the West, so the fight has risen to a higher geopolitical level. ""No evidence has been provided. In my opinion, this story is completely fabricated in a very poor way to stir up some noise during the elections and create an atmosphere of fear among opposition voters."" ""How should Russia respond?"" ""Russia should at least respond on the level of diplomacy. Montenegro, as a historically Serbian state, used to be a pro-Russian country. NATO bombed Montenegro 15 years ago, and one had to completely change the identity of the people to make Montenegro a NATO member. One of the key points of the identity of the people of Montenegro, the Serbian people, is their attachment to Russia. One had to strike a serious blow on this peculiarity of the people of Montenegro to create a new identity."" On October 16, Montenegro held parliamentary elections. Twenty Serbian citizens were detained on suspicion of preparing a terrorist attack and a coup on the election day. According to preliminary data, the people wanted to attack citizens and police officers who gathered in front of the parliament with a view to proclaim the victory of one of the political parties and imprison the prime minister of Montenegro. Pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic won the elections. Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru",0
25266,PHOTO: The Creepy Bernie Sanders Pic That Hillary Leaked To Press,"Here’s The Shocking Reason Why You Need To Know If Your Doctor Is Republican Or a Democrat 
Former president Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, sent an email with attached photo to Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton’s national press secretary. 
According to the email, Podesta wanted to post the image to Twitter, but Fallon suggested giving it to the New York Post. Flournoy said she would send more information about the event, including those who attended. 
The Post didn’t run the story, but gossip writer Perez Hilton did, and he included all of the details about the event. The following week, the media ran several stories that raised questions about Sanders attending fundraisers for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Advertisement - story continues below 
Here it is, whether you’ve ever wanted to see Sanders’ legs or not: 
Talk about creepy. It looked like Clinton had her team stalking Sanders, looking for any opportunity to embarrass him or make him look bad. This was apparently the plan from day one. 
It’s true that the last place Sanders should have been caught hanging out after railing against Wall Street was poolside at a plush resort on Martha’s Vineyard, but the heart of this email revealed who the Democrats are, which is nothing but a selfish, money-grubbing group of people who are as mean-spirited as their leader .

25271,Hezbollah Says Military Leader Died in Artillery Attack - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah declared Saturday that Mustafa Amine Badreddine, the senior commander who died in Syria this past week, had been killed in an artillery attack by insurgents whom the group has been fighting for the past four years. Hezbollah said in a statement that the killing would increase “our determination to continue the fight against these criminal gangs and defeat them,” blaming “takfiri groups,” a term for Islamist extremists that Hezbollah broadly applies to insurgents opposed to its ally in Syria, President Bashar  . But the declaration raised more questions than it answered, as fierce speculation continued about how, when, where and by whom Mr. Badreddine was killed, and what the death reveals about the state of Hezbollah and its war effort in Syria. A day earlier, when Hezbollah announced his death, Lebanese media outlets sympathetic to the group initially blamed Israel, the group’s main enemy, for the attack. Israel is widely believed to have assassinated several senior Hezbollah commanders over the past few decades and has carried out a number of airstrikes in Syria, officially unacknowledged but confirmed by Western officials, against the group. If Israel was not responsible  —   as numerous Israeli analysts have suggested  —   that would ease the pressure from Hezbollah’s supporters to retaliate. Retaliation could risk igniting a war on Lebanon’s southern frontier at a time when the group, stretched thin because of its operations in Syria, cannot easily afford to open a new front. On the other hand, if insurgents managed to pull off the assassination of a senior Hezbollah figure, rather than merely getting off a lucky shot with the usually imprecise attack of an artillery bombardment, that could be embarrassing for Hezbollah. The group has presented itself as outmatching the insurgents in Syria and preventing them from expanding into Lebanon. Such an attack would make Hezbollah appear newly and surprisingly vulnerable to insurgent foes who had not demonstrated that degree of operational or   sophistication. “If one of their lead figures can be killed in a secure area by one of those groups, it would send a signal that they are far weaker than presented,” said Phillip Smyth, an American analyst who studies Hezbollah and other Shiite militias fighting in Syria. Adding to the mystery is that Syrian opposition monitoring groups and residents of Damascus, the capital, say there had been no major shelling over the past week near the Damascus airport, where, Hezbollah said, the attack took place. And no insurgent group has taken responsibility for the attack  —   surprising given that the array of insurgents, from the Islamic State to Syrian Army defectors, would presumably be eager to do so. Despite rivalries and disagreements among them, they all view Hezbollah as a mortal enemy aiding Mr. Assad in crushing a popular uprising against him. Some of Mr. Assad’s opponents have speculated that Mr. Badreddine may have been killed in Khan Touman, in northern Syria. According to Iranian news outlets, a number of Iranian fighters and allied militia members, including Hezbollah members, have been killed there in insurgent attacks over the past week. The killing also raises questions about operational security. As it expands in Syria, Hezbollah has begun working with many Syrian militia members, some of whom could be double agents. The attack could also mean that a rebel or jihadist group worked with a foreign intelligence agency to pinpoint and attack Mr. Badreddine, said Ali Rizk, a Lebanese analyst close to Hezbollah. Hezbollah’s statement said the attack underscored its view of the Syrian war as being of a piece with its fight against Israel. The group sees the insurgents opposed to Mr. Assad and his closest ally, Hezbollah’s patron Iran, as being allied with the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia.",0

LONDON city police have confirmed today that they had to “move on” Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales this morning after he was found to be begging on the side of the street. 
The 50-year-old entrepreneur was given a verbal warning by the police, who told him he was “making the place look bad”, and that he should try selling Big Issue magazines, or roses, like everyone else if he wants to make a few pound. 
Mr. Wales, who co-founded the online non-profit encyclopedia, claimed he was trying to raise money for his organisation in a bid to fund it, and denied any wrongdoing on his part. 
“Wikipedia doesn’t rely on online advertising revenue, so we have to find other means of raising money to keep it going,” he told WWN, “I’ve tried busking, but I’m a terrible singer and people just booed me off the street. I said this morning I’d give begging a go, but the police in London are quite strict about that kind of thing and I was told to clear off”. 
The grandson of four later added that he might try raising money as a street entertainer instead, and paint himself from head to toe in grey, cement like paint, stating he’s very good at staying still. 
“I’ve sent millions of emails to people around the world, asking them for a few bob, but you’d swear I was asking for their first born or something,” he added, ” Less than 1% of our readers give, but yet Wikipedia solves millions of drunken debates every minute; from who is your man starring in that film, to explaining the observational theory in quantum mechanics. Wiki saves time, and sometimes lives”.

Ed Balls is using gangs of armed thugs to intimidate those who would come between him and the Strictly crown. 
The news comes after fellow contestant Gorka Marquez was beaten up in Blackpool by card-carrying New Labour thugs. 
Balls has been accused of using a win-at-all-costs mentality that might have helped him to a more successful career in politics. 
Marquez’s kicking comes just weeks after Will Young sensationally quit the show after being cornered in an alleyway by a tooled-up Alistair Campbell.

25280,How WH Staff Is Preparing For A Possible Hillary Presidency [Cartoon],"You are here: Home / political cartoon / How WH Staff Is Preparing For A Possible Hillary Presidency [Cartoon] How WH Staff Is Preparing For A Possible Hillary Presidency [Cartoon] October 26, 2016 
Robert Gehl asks if you remember back in 2001, when the Clinton’s backed a U-Haul truck to the rear-end of the White House and took off with a bunch of publicly owned furniture and other treasures? 
Yeah… that was pretty embarrassing. Probably something you wouldn’t want to repeat. 
But then again, you’re not Hillary Clinton. 
According to another recently unclassified FBI interview, Clinton and her staff were seen removing furniture and lamps from the State Department offices early in 2009 as soon as she took office as secretary. Hillary was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. 
The agent – who is now an investigator with the Department of Homeland Security – said he had no idea whether or not the items were ever returned to the taxpayers. 
Back in 2001, after The Washington Post broke the story, the Clintons said they would reimburse the taxpayers $86,000 for the items they stole that were actually government property, LifeZette reports . 
They also returned another $28,000 worth of furniture a few days later. 
In addition to stealing all that furniture back in 2001, you’ll recall they even removed the “W”s from all the keyboards in a juvenile and childish stunt to upset the incoming administration of George “W.” Bush. 
Theft of taxpayer items from the State Department were not the only revelations in the FBI interview, The Washington Examiner is reporting . 
In its notes, the FBI writes: “Prior to Clinton’s tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State’s protective detail was seen as an honor and a privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of Clinton’s tenure it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.”",0
25283,С любовью… С природой…,"Природа 
Вырубка лесов, убийства животных для изготовления шуб завзятых модниц, загрязнение мирового океана, разрушение озонового слоя и, наконец, глобальное потепление — лишь первые пункты в списке бедствий, которые терпит старушка Земля. Но не стоит паниковать и копить на билет к Марсу. Величайшие умы нашей планеты, упоённые желанием жить в идеальном мире, нашли способ спасти матушку-природу. Всё, что для этого требуется — заняться с ней сексом. Сексом! С природой! 
Величайшие умы — это не нобелевские лауреаты, а австралийские активистки Энни Спринкл и Элизабет Стивенс. Дамочки призывают весь мир спасать окружающую среду весьма нетрадиционным способом. Выкиньте лопаты и перестаньте сажать деревья, лучше примкните к сообществу экосексуалов — людей, которые спасают природу совокуплением в парках. По мнению Энни и Элизабет, наша планета страдает вовсе не от выбросов вредных веществ, а от нехватки радости и любви! Девушки не признают вегетарианцев, отказавшихся от употребления мяса. Не жалуют активистки и людей, променявших свои автомобили на велосипеды. Приверженцы экотуризма у них тоже не в почёте. Всё это совершенно неэффективно и бесполезно! Единственный способ спасти природу — заняться с ней любовью! В самом прямом смысле. 
Тем простофилям, которые никогда не занимались сексом с растениями, девушки напоминают — чтобы улучшить экологическую обстановку, достаточно поваляться в грязи и получить от этого оргазм, или просто побегать в лесу в костюме Адама. Природа это поймёт и примет. Допустимо мастурбировать возле водопада и использовать в любовных ласках растения. Полный список спасательно-сексуальных процедур отражён в «Манифесте экосексуалов», написанным Энни и Элизабет. Девушки продемонстрировали собственную версию защиты природы в одном из австралийских парков. По их утверждениям, к движению примкнуло уже 100 000 неравнодушных. 
Вероятно, активистки делают ставку на то, что берёзовая веточка, ранее активно участвовавшая в мастурбации, освободившись от рук насильника, превратится, буквально через несколько часов, в 20-летнее дерево. А лес, по которому пробежала голая девушка, от увиденного выбросит в воздух столько кислорода, что в атмосфере вовсе не останется углекислого газа. Мастурбация вблизи водоёма прибавит +10 к карме участника процесса, и нейтрализует сотни лет антропогенного воздействия. Главное — не халтурить! Природа обязательно почувствует, если вы не доведёте себя до высшей точки блаженства. 
Любопытно, что на днях в Тбилиси задержали голого мужчину, который бродил по городу. Естественно, сотрудники полиции сразу же узрели в нем экосексуала и начали высматривать поблизости какой-нибудь сексуально озабоченный фикус. К всеобщему огорчению оказалось, что мужчина не вносил лепту в спасение Земли, а бродил голым в результате психического расстройства. Да уж, экосексуалов и душевно больных действительно легко спутать… Но это уже вопрос психиатрии.",0

After a busy weekend interviewing job candidates, President-elect Donald Trump prepared Monday to begin filling out his economic and national security teams and outline his emerging White House agenda. 
“We’ve made a couple of deals,” Trump told reporters after a weekend of meetings with with no less than 21 job candidates at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. 
Transition aides said they would release a video Monday in which the president-elect discusses plans and “legislative priorities” for the Trump administration that begins Jan. 20. 
Topics include trade, notably Trump ‘s opposition to the now-probably-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian nations; energy development and “job-killing” regulations governing shale and clean coal; national security, with an emphasis on cybersecurity; and immigration, including alleged abuse of visa programs to undercut American workers, said transition aide Jason Miller. 
Trump has more meetings on Monday, including one with Rick Perry. The former governor of Texas and ex-rival in the Republican primaries has been mentioned for a number of slots in Trump ‘s Cabinet, including the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, and Agriculture. 
The president also met with a fairly prominent Democrat: U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who backed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primaries. A military veteran, Gabbard has been a vocal critic of VA medical services. 
In a statement released Monday Gabbard said “while the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump , I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. 
“President-elect Trump and I had a frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth,” Gabbard said. “I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world,” Gabbard continued. 
Also Monday Trump met with former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. After the meeting Brown told reporters that he spoke with Trump about being head of the VA. 
“He’s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under consideration. I’m glad that he called. He’s going to obviously meet other folks, and we should know, I would think, probably after Thanksgiving,” Brown said. “I think I’m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there and I don’t look at it as a competition.” 
Trump also met with Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin who said she was not offered a position but that the meeting was just a start. ",0
25289,NBC Attacks Trump for Switching to iPhone for Security Reasons - Breitbart,"NBC published an article titled “Trump Now Uses an iPhone  —   Despite Once Calling for an Apple Boycott” to attack the president for switching from his potentially vulnerable Android handset to an iPhone. [The article begins by directly stating that the reason for President Trump’s switch to the   handset is for security reasons: “President Donald Trump is finally using an Apple iPhone, despite once calling for a boycott of the company’s products, after concerns that the Android handset he was reportedly using was unsecured. ”  “A number of reports have suggested Trump was using a Samsung Galaxy S3 running Google’s Android operating system, a point which has never officially been confirmed,” the article notes. “The New York Times reported in January that the phone was unsecured. This means that it is vulnerable to hackers, something of great concern because the president of the U. S. would be a key hacking target. ” The article then focuses on Trump’s use of the more secure Apple device, citing the president’s past criticism of the iPhone manufacturer for refusing to unlock the phone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook. “During a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings. In this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the order “chilling” and did not assist. ” “During a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings,” NBC notes. “In this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter.

25290,"Review: In ‘Independence Day: Resurgence,’ the Fault Is Not in the Fireworks - The New York Times","If you’ve seen one movie apocalypse, you have seen them all, at least if it was directed by Roland Emmerich. For the last two decades, Mr. Emmerich has carved out his own perverse subgenre with   about   in which a happy few fight, joke and triumph despite alien invasion, a radioactive lizard, the Mayan calendar, melting polar ice and scene after scene of   mayhem. Even when he scales down, narrowing his cinematic gun sights on smaller stories (“White House Down”) Mr. Emmerich goes big and then bigger. So, here he is again, going once more unto the blockbuster breach with “Independence Day: Resurgence,” a sequel to “Independence Day,” his amusing 1996   behemoth. The earlier movie is best remembered for its shocker of a sales pitch: a shot of the White House being blown up by a shaft of alien light, an image that was as giddily funny as it was horrific to contemplate. Needless to say, thinking deeply if at all has never been something that Mr. Emmerich encourages. For the most part, his movies are engineered to generate autonomic responses, with frenetic visuals and booming noises that activate the    response, which in turn produces arousal. That’s the hope, although “Resurgence” is likely to spur more   than popping. All you really need to know about the story is that it took multiple men to cook up this pottage, which hinges on another extraterrestrial invasion and humanity battling aliens as other familiar struggles erupt: technological determinism versus technophobia, secular universalism versus heroic individualism. Five writers actually put their names on the script, including Mr. Emmerich and his longtime collaborator Dean Devlin, and the results are predictably predictable if rarely entertainingly risible, with swaths of exposition and dialogue that sounds like ads (“one people, one world”). The lackluster, at times abysmal writing wouldn’t much matter if “Resurgence” popped visually or featured a charismatic star who could lift a movie as effortlessly as Will Smith did in the first feature. Mr. Smith, unfortunately, declined to appear in the sequel, leaving his two   from “Independence Day,” Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum, to give it that old school try alongside veterans like Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner, far and away the movie’s most valuable player. All deliver professional, winking performances, but they’re also stranded in an overly crowded cast that gives too much time to younger performers who, for the most part, slide right off the screen. Mr. Emmerich does manage to personalize this industrial production here and there, largely in funny little asides that sprinkle the action, like the cutaway to a character using his wipers to clean alien goo off a windshield. But too often, he seems to be trying to summon up energy and dredge up feeling in this movie by glancing back at the first “Independence Day,” as when Liam Hemsworth (as a flyboy) punches an alien, an echo of Mr. Smith’s “welcome to Earth” triumphalism. Except that Mr. Hemsworth, a stolid, pleasant actor, isn’t Mr. Smith, and this isn’t “Independence Day. ” Somehow selling screen death by the millions with a quip and a teardrop just doesn’t cut it. “Independence Day: Resurgence” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned).  Bloodless apocalyptic death. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes. ",0
25291,WikiLeaks List Exposes At Least 65 Corporate ‘Presstitutes’ Who Colluded to Hide Clinton’s Crimes,"By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com
Revelations from the Wikileaks release of John Podesta’s emails yet again prove mainstream, corporate media serves as Hillary Clinton’s personal cheerleading squad — and is devoid of any iteration of journalistic integrity.
Thanks to Wikileaks and the Intercept , in fact, we now have a list of no less than 65 mainstream “reporters” whose campaign coverage constitutes propaganda for the Clinton campaign — and no wonder, considering the obscenely lopsided drivel presented by their outlets.
As (actual) journalists Glenn Greenwald and Lee Fang reported on October 9, the Intercept exclusively received documents obtained by the source known as Guccifer 2.0 evidencing Clinton campaign tactics to court journalists portraying the former secretary of state in a positive light.
“As these internal documents demonstrate,” the Intercept reported , “a central component of the Clinton campaign strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the campaign wants circulated.
“At times, Clinton’s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be Quote: d ‘on background’ and what should be described as ‘on the record.’”
One internal strategy document dated January 2015 — months before Clinton officially kicked off her campaign in April — with the curious heading “Earned Media/Next Steps” exposes how the campaign made an albeit infrequent practice of crafting supposed news pieces from beginning to completion.
Under the — not-at-all oblique insult to the fundamentals of journalism — heading “ Placing a Story ,” the memo’s Quote: :
“As we discussed on our call, we are all in agreement that the time is right [to] place a story with a friendly journalist in the coming days that positions us a little more transparently while achieving the above goals.”
Specifically named as a suggested journalist plant is Maggie Haberman of Politico , whom they note will assist in doing “the most shaping” of the narrative they have in mind.",0

Susan Garsh said case law in Massachusetts is clear that “abatement” defendants, who are denied the ability to finish an appeal before they die, can have their convictions vacated, ABC News reported.  The former New England Patriots tight end committed suicide in his cell on April 19 while serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of football player Odin Lloyd. He died only five days after being acquitted of a second murder charge from an incident in 2012. But, Hernandez had filed an appeal of his conviction and was awaiting the process when he committed suicide. “Abatement has been practiced in state and federal courts for more than a century,” Judge Garsh said. She added that “‘an appeal is an integral part of the system’ and said the interests of justice do not permit a defendant to stand convicted upon death if appeals are not exhausted. ” “Abatement remains the law in this Commonwealth, and this court is compelled to follow binding precedent,” Garsh concluded. Judge Garsh dismissed the claim offered by prosecutors that Hernandez knew of the abatement rules when he committed suicide. Garsh insisted that there was no way to know what Hernandez thought as he prepared to kill himself. The decision, though, could open up the New England Patriots to be liable to pay the Hernandez estate for the salary he missed during his trials and jail time after the team released him. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez’s contract with $16 million in guaranteed money. But, the team released Hernandez almost immediately after he was arrested in June 2013 and didn’t pay him the $5. 91 million of that guaranteed amount.

25315,Non-Profit Yale Magazine Taunts IRS With Editorial 'Not Endorsing' Hillary Clinton,"Getty - Josh Edelson 
The Yale Record, America’s “oldest college humor magazine,” taunted the IRS on Thursday by essentially endorsing Hillary Clinton for president by “not” endorsing her. 
The magazine is a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, meaning they are prohibited from engaging in political activities. 
The Yale Record is walking a tightrope as it relates to their non-profit status. Read the editorial board's post below: 
In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.” 
This year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. 
In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. 
The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. 
—The Editorial Board of The Yale Record 
Any reasonable reader would infer that the editorial board is indeed supporting Clinton for president. The only question is whether the paper gave itself enough legal wiggle room before publishing what might as well be a full-throated endorsement. Image Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images 
Here's what the IRS has to say on the matter: 
“...tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are prohibited from participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office. Charities, educational institutions and religious organizations, including churches, are among those that are covered under this code section."" 
[...] 
“These organizations cannot endorse any candidates, make donations to their campaigns, engage in fund raising, distribute statements, or become involved in any other activities that may be beneficial or detrimental to any particular candidate. Even activities that encourage people to vote for or against a particular candidate on the basis of nonpartisan criteria violate the political campaign prohibition of section 501(c)(3)."" 
The Yale Daily News faced similar controversy when it openly endorsed Clinton. The paper wouldn't confirm its non-profit status to The Daily Caller and called the matter a “misunderstanding.” ",0

At least they haven’t been, so far. Last week, our allies at Food DemocracyNOW! broke the news that Melody Meyer, a member of the Organic Trade Association (OTA), wants gene editing, a dangerous new form of genetic engineering, to be allowed in organic. Meyer said as much, in a blog post . Yep, higher ups at the OTA—that “organic” Big Food front group that sold out the GMO labeling movement—are at it again. First, they sold us out on the DARK Act, the bill that effectively killed GMO labeling in the U.S. Now, they want to use the loopholes and exemptions written into the DARK Act to force the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to allow certain types of genetic engineering (some of which are referred to as GMO 2.0 ) to be allowed in organic. At its next meeting, November 16 – 18, in St. Louis, Mo., the NOSB will consider an “Excluded Methods Terminology” proposal that could determine whether or not Meyer and her compatriots at the OTA score another win against organics. We say, no way. If you haven’t already, please sign this petition to the NOSB demanding that all GMO technologies be kept out of certified organic products.

[Speaking to a packed ballroom at the Bellagio conference center on the Las Vegas Strip, the former vice president, who himself declined to run for president, said he believes Clinton was not the “correct” candidate, but he was.  “I never thought she was the correct candidate,” Biden said. “I thought I was the correct candidate. ” The audience erupted into applause. The Salt Conference is an annual gathering of private equity leaders here in Las Vegas, organized by SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci, last cycle, supported   Donald Trump. Biden declined to run for president last cycle after the death of his son. “No man or woman should announce for the presidency unless they genuinely believe that for that moment in the nation’s history they are the most qualified person to deal with the issues facing the country,” Biden also said. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in 2015 in his Trump Tower office, Trump said he expected to face Biden in the general election if Biden ran since Clinton had so many problems. “I think Hillary has got huge problems right now,” Trump said then, adding: “Is she going to make it? I hear this thing is big league. Why did she do it? You use the server? Because they’re always looking to go over the edge, whether it’s Whitewater or anything else.

25322,"Gunmen in Jordan Kill 10, Including 7 Officers and a Canadian Tourist - The New York Times","AMMAN, Jordan  —   Seven Jordanian security officers, a Canadian tourist and two Jordanian civilians were killed by gunmen in the southern city of Karak on Sunday, according to a joint statement from the Public Security Department and the Jordanian armed forces. The security forces later captured and killed four of the gunmen, the statement said. It did not specify the total number of what security officials called “terrorist outlaws” involved in the attacks, or suggest a motive. Officials were also investigating whether the gunmen had ties to any terrorist organization. The violence began when a patrol was sent to check on reports of a house on fire. When security officers arrived on the scene, they were met with a barrage of gunfire from inside the home, injuring two officers. The gunmen fled, according to the statement. Gunmen then attacked a police station in the city. Later in the day, the police were informed that gunmen were hiding inside the Karak Crusader castle, a prominent tourist attraction on a hilltop. The gunmen fired at several police officers from the castle, security officials said. A cache of weapons was seized from the castle, as well as explosives, suicide vests and more weapons from the home where the men first encountered the officers, said Amer Saratwi, a spokesman for the Public Security Department. The statement confirmed the death of four police officers, three gendarmes, two civilians and a Canadian tourist, without specifying where the deaths had occurred.   people were injured, the statement said. Several Canadian news outlets identified the tourist as Linda Vatcher, a retired teacher from Newfoundland. At the time of the attack, she was visiting her son Christopher, who works in the region. He is among the injured, news reports said. Prime Minister Hani Mulki, addressing members of Parliament, said that several people had been killed and that Jordan’s special forces had surrounded an area in the city where five or six of the attackers were holed up. Videos released by Karak residents and posted on local news websites showed tribal leaders and young local residents holding rifles and aiding officers in the hunt for the gunmen near the castle. Terrorist attacks in Jordan, a crucial ally of the United States in the region, are relatively rare, but the country is continually on alert because of the threat posed by extremists, particularly from the Islamic State.",0
25325,"Top German Paper: We Need To Be ’More Gay, More Multicultural’ To Oppose Trump","In a new editorial, the head of the German daily broadsheet Die Welt has called on Germans to oppose U. S.   Donald Trump by being more multicultural and more “gay. ”[Head of Die Welt Ulf Poschardt wrote a combative editorial in response to an interview Mr. Trump did with the Bild tabloid on Monday. The highly negative reaction from many online forced the paper into changing the world “schwuler” or gay to ” more creative” after hundreds of comments were made on the paper’s website and over one thousand more on their Facebook page.  In the editorial, Mr. Poschardt claims that Germans need to oppose Donald Trump because he threatens the system of globalisation he says has greatly benefited Germany. “Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Cabinet have been right to promote, popularize, and engage in global politics in tough diplomatic struggle,” he wrote, saying that it was good for Germans when   globalisation ideas were spread across the world. “The distribution of global prosperity will, in the future, be aggressively decided by the US in its favor  —   if we do not resist and become better, more courageous, more diligent, innovative, free, open, gay and multicultural,” he wrote initially with gay being replaced with “creative” after the torrent of comments online. Facebook user Kirsten Zander slammed the editorial saying, “Why this martial rhetoric? To defend ourselves against the US president. Did he declare war on us? First of all, we need to take care of our own country instead of squinting at the whole world, as our chancellor does. ” Others took exception to the word gay being used with another Facebook user commenting, “What has this man smoked? Why do we become more successful when we become “gay” and STILL “multicultural”? Is there a correlation between being gay and growing multiculturalism and success?” Another wrote: “Why should we be gay? More open in dealing with gays in our society, I could understand that. But why gay when it comes to Trump?” The comments caused Mr. Poschardt to explain why he chose the word gay which was, according to him, “was meant in the sense of the theses of Richard Florida, The Rise of the Creative Class. When this one detail became vital and threatened to cover the rest of the comment, I changed it. ” After the change,   website Queer. de slammed Die Welt saying Poschardt had given in to “  populists” and called it “embarrassing” that he replaced gay with “creative” rather than “more tolerant” or “more diverse. ” The reaction to the election of Donald Trump among German media and German politicians has been highly negative since November. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went as far as to claim that Russian hacking directly influenced the election and warned it could influence the upcoming German federal election later this year.   Tiedje, chairman and primary shareholder of communications consultancy WMP Eurocom AG, slammed German media for its coverage of the   saying, “whatever he says, whatever he does, it’s never right according to the German television class. ”",0

25334,Left Wing Vegan Denied Swiss Passport Because She’s ’Too Annoying’,"A left wing Dutch vegan who has lived in Switzerland since she was a child has been denied a Swiss passport because locals in her adoptive town find her too annoying. [Nancy Holten, 42, is a   animal rights activist who has campaigned against the Swiss tradition of cow bells, calling them cruel.  Despite living in the country since the age of eight, and speaking fluent Swiss German, local residents vetoed her application of citizenship, saying they were “fed up” with her challenging their traditions. The Dutchwoman explained her views: “The sound that cow bells make is a hundred decibel. It is comparable with a pneumatic drill. We also would not want such a thing hanging close to our ears?” “The bells, which the cows have to wear when they walk to and from the pasture, are especially heavy. “The animals carry around five kilograms around their neck. It causes friction and burns to their skin. ” Aargauer Zeitung says that as well as cow bells, she has also campaigned against other Swiss traditions including hunting, pig racing, and even loud church bells. Local politician Tanja Suter said Ms. Holten had a “big mouth” and she does not deserve a Swiss passport “if she irritates us and does not respect our traditions”. Ms Holten herself admits: “I think I spoke my mind too often, and I say it out too loud. ” Under Switzerland’s highly decentralised constitution, local towns and regions grant citizenship rather than the central government, and some give citizens a vote on who gets a passport. Villagers in   in the canton of Aargau voted by 206 to 144 to reject Ms. Holten’s application for citizenship in 2015, and have now rejected that application a second time. The case will now go to the regional government, which can overrule the vote and grant her citizenship anyway. Switzerland has some of the tightest citizenship laws in the world, and being born in the country often does not grant the children of immigrants an automatic right to a passport.",0
25337,Tokyo could ban US troops from stationing on disputed isles,"  
  block the US from being stationed on the islands off Hokkaido in the strategic Sea of Okhotsk, if this helps persuade Russia to give them back. 
The islands are inhabited, and in Russia are called the Southern Kurils – but for Japan they are Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai islet group. These territories, which became Russian after Japan’s defeat in World War II under the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, saw a rift between the two countries preventing them from signing the peace treaty to formally end the war. Tokyo insists the four islets are not part of the Kuril chain and should be returned under its control. 
In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Bloomberg that Russia does not “trade territories.” But ahead of his visit to Tokyo in mid-December, Japan’s diplomatic sources told Kyodo News that Moscow would hand over Shikotan and Habomai islet group following the peace deal, as stated by the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. 
The sources, however, said Russia may be concerned that the US military could be stationed on the territories after Japan gets them back. According to Article 5 of the Japan-US security treaty, Washington is allowed to station its troops in areas administered by Japan. 
The Japanese government is now looking into the potential consequences, should they exclude the islands from Article 5, the sources said, with one of them adding that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could go as far as announcing that the islands do not fall under Article 5. 
Other sources, however, think that “a realistic scenario is that the prime minister shows his political will and seeks consent from the United States.” 
At the same time, “Russia won’t agree to hand over [the islands] unless the possibility of stationing the US military there is ruled out,” a source familiar with the Japanese-Russian ties told The Japan Times over the weekend. 
Nevertheless, convincing the US to okay such conditions seems very difficult, a Japanese government source said, adding that “It could even shake the foundations of the [Japan-US military] alliance.” 
For Russia, the area around the disputed islands is of “extremely high importance” because it faces the Sea of Okhotsk, a Japanese government source said, and a foreign military in these waters could hamper both essential military drills and the use of a major access route to the Pacific Ocean. 
Tokyo has already rejected the report, saying they are not planning to review Article 5, TASS news agency said, citing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated it, adding that the Japan-US treaty “applies and will apply” to all territories and waters which are administered by Japan. 
Earlier in the month, Tokyo also denied Nikkei’s report that Japan and Russia were discussing joint administration of the Kuril Islands. 
“There is no change in Japan’s fundamental position that Japan will conclude the peace treaty with Russia by resolving the issue of the possession of the four northern islands,” Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yasuhira Kawamura told Reuters in an email at that time. 
Russia has always insisted that any change in the status of the islands is out of the question, as it would constitute a reassessment of the results of World War II, which is expressly banned by international treaties.",0
25339,NBC's Baghdad Bob: There Is No FBI Investigation of Hillary | Frontpage Mag,"NBC's Baghdad Bob: There Is No FBI Investigation of Hillary November 4, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
Remember when Hillary Clinton was insisting that there was no FBI investigation of her, just a security review, even when the FBI rejected that claim? 
Well Andrea Mitchell, NBC's own Baghdad Bob, isn't giving up that claim so easily. Even while the rest of the Clinton clique is screeching against the FBI for investigating Hillary like bats from the nether regions of left-wing hell, Mitchell is sticking to the old spin. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. It's not. It's not. 
In a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly “fact-check” the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mail and charitable foundation scandals. 
Mitchell refused to accept reality: “Just a lot of fact-checking to do. She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, there’s no criminality.” She fretted: “I don't know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context.” 
The context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. 
But as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary. Anyone who believes that is probably some sort of right-winger who listens to what the FBI actually says, rather than what NBC says that the FBI says. ",0
25340,Government Gave Brown University $5 Million to Discover that Frat Boys Drink More than Peers - Breitbart,"Senator Jeff Flake ( ) revealed that the government gave Brown University $5 million to conduct research on whether or not fraternity brothers drink more than their peers who don’t participate in Greek life. [It’s unclear from Flake’s report why the National Institute of Health granted Brown University such a significant amount of funding to study to the behaviors of students in fraternities. According the report, the $5 million was used for to determine if frat boys drink, smoke, and party more than their peers.  Studies on the habits of college students funded with $5 million of NIH grants found fraternity brothers drink, smoke and generally party more than other students. They also sleep in later, which led the researchers to speculate “one explanation for this finding is that Greeks students recognize their sleep needs. ” Perhaps a more likely reason is that they are sleeping off their party lifestyle. Flake concludes that substance abuse amongst college students is a serious problem, but that the research conducted with state funding didn’t provide any information about fraternity life that wasn’t already common knowledge. Substance abuse is a very serious problem, especially among college students involved in Greek life, that deserves thoughtful attention. The studies highlighted here are not finding solutions to   problems, but simply retelling what is already widely known about Greek life. As they say at the frat house, “cool story, bro. ” The report on the Brown study was a part of Flake’s annual report that chronicle 50 cases of government fraud, abuse, and waste. Other instances of waste included nearly $2 million of government funds that was designated for the development of a comedy club that would feature holographic performers.",0
25341,Alasdair MacLeod’s Market Report: Gold and Silver Find Support!,"Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » Alasdair MacLeod’s Market Report: Gold and Silver Find Support! 
A rise of 44% this year for the sterling price of gold just shows what gold does best. It protects ordinary people from the failure of central bankers to protect the purchasing power of their fiat currencies. 

From Alasdair Macleod : Precious metals continued to consolidate at the lower levels, moving broadly sideways. Gold was unchanged on the week by last night’s close in New York, at $1269, and silver up 9c at $17.63. The uncertainty facing traders is whether or not gold will now go lower to test the $1200 level, or will current levels hold. Time will tell. Comex figures are not offering much guidance either. The next chart is of the gold contract’s open interest, and while we can see that open interest has declined significantly since the mid-year peak, an open interest level of 500,000 contracts is by no means low. There is some evidence, however, that among the managed money category there exists long-term players seeking strategic portfolio exposure to gold. That being the case, the downside for open interest becomes more limited, and perhaps the cannier managers will look to add to positions on price weakness. However, we must also take into account potential window-dressing at the end of this month, for the third quarter. And here it is the bullion banks short positions and their traders’ bonuses that are on the line. The lack of volatility in gold and silver is being reflected in other markets, with the dollar stuck at the top end of a sideways consolidation pattern. DXY, the main dollar index traded in futures markets, is our next chart along with the conventional trade-weighted version. This sideways trading pattern could end with a break to the upside, because the euro is drifting lower. Note that the euro comprises 57% of DXY. The reason this is important is a strong dollar worries the Fed. The Fed is desperate to limit the deflationary effects of a rising dollar, and believes that the appalling trade deficit is due to the dollar being very over-valued. So if DXY goes much higher, we can probably dismiss the possibility of an increase in the Fed Funds Rate in December. But that’s a long way off, and doubtless is contributing to the lack of decision over markets generally. That said, the pick-up in Chinese and Indian demand for physical gold bullion lends some support to prices. Meanwhile, gold has performed spectacularly for sterling-based investors, as our last chart clearly shows. A rise of 44% this year for the sterling price of gold just shows what gold does best. It protects ordinary people from the failure of central bankers to protect the purchasing power of their fiat currencies. 2016 30th Anniversary Proof Silver Eagles Available Now at SD Bullion!

25346,Proof Of George Soros Nazi Past Finally Comes To Light With Discovery Of Forgotten Interview,"  Proof Of George Soros Nazi Past Finally Comes To Light With Discovery Of Forgotten Interview George Soros has repeatedly called 1944 ""The Best Year of his Life."" 70% of Mr. Soros's fellow Jews in Hungary, nearly a half-million human beings, were annihilated in that year, yet he gives no sign that this put any damper on his elation, either at the time or indeed in retrospect.   15, 2016 When Hitler’s henchman Adolf Eichmann arrived in Hungary, to oversee the murder of that country’s Jews, George Soros ended up with a man whose job was confiscating property from the Jewish population. 
George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed door meeting to retool the big-money left to fight back against Donald Trump. Since Soros name is very much in the headlines in 2016, let’s take a look at an interview he gave in 1998 about his Nazi past. Nazi collaborator Soros gave MILLIONS to Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign 
Social unrest groups like Media Matters have taken to the Internet in an attempt to “debunk the claims” and “correct the smears” about rumors of the Nazi past of their patron, George Soros. They say it is just malicious gossip and lies people make up about Soros because they don’t like him. Snopes.com chimes in as well in defense of Soros. But what about the “rumors”? Could they be true, are they true? 
As you will see and hear , not only are the rumors true, a long forgotten interview George Soros did on 60 Minutes has him gleefully confessing to his crime. 
György Schwartz, better known to the world as George Soros , was born August 12, 1930 in Hungary. Soros’ father, Tivadar, was a fervent practitioner of the Esperanto language invented in 1887, and designed to be the first global language, free of any national identity. The Schwartz’s, who were non-practicing Jews, changed the family name to Soros, in order to facilitate assimilation into the Gentile population, as the Nazis spread into Hungary during the 1930s 
When Hitler’s henchman Adolf Eichmann arrived in Hungary, to oversee the murder of that country’s Jews, George Soros ended up with a man whose job was confiscating property from the Jewish population. Soros went with him on his rounds. 
George Soros has repeatedly called 1944 “ The Best Year of his Life. ” 70% of Mr. Soros’s fellow Jews in Hungary, nearly a half-million human beings, were annihilated in that year, yet he gives no sign that this put any damper on his elation, either at the time or indeed in retrospect. During an interview with “Sixty Minute’s” Steve Kroft, Soros was asked about his “best year.” George Soros Interview Where He Admitted He Was A Nazi Collaborator: 
He was only to happy to admit his collaboration with the Nazis,in fact, he called those days the “best time of my life”. Click to watch, in context, that startling confession. 
KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson. 
SOROS: Yes. Yes. 
KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from your fellow Jews, friends and neighbors. 
SOROS: Yes. That’s right. Yes. 
KROFT: I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many, years. Was it difficult? 
SOROS: No, not at all. Not at all, I rather enjoyed it. 
KROFT: No feelings of guilt? 
SOROS: No, only feelings of absolute power. SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",0
25347,‘This Is Treason’: Clinton’s Email Server Reportedly Exposed to Hackers of 5 Spy Agencies,"
As election day draws near, accusations against both US presidential candidates are becoming more and more brutal, with Fox News reporting the FBI believes up to five foreign intelligence agencies managed to hack into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.
According to the report , there is about a 99 percent chance that the server used by then-Secretary of State Clinton for work communications in violation of security protocols was compromised. The allegations were confirmed by House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, who said that FBI director James Comey had told him about the exposure previously.
“She exposed [information] to our enemies,” the Republican representative from Texas said on “Fox & Friends” on Thursday morning. “Our adversaries have this very sensitive information… In my opinion, quite frankly, it’s treason.” 
McCaul added that there are concerns not only about the content of the emails, but also access to the communication protocols of special access programs used on government-issued electronic devices.
“Now countries like Russia and China and Iran have the most highly-sensitive programs in the United States. And the President of the US is communicating with them,” he alleged. “They are not stupid. They can figure that out as well.” 
McCaul has said earlier that he has been briefing Republican candidate Donald Trump on security issues.
Director Comey previously hinted at the possibility that foreign nations had hacked into Clinton’s server, but the Democrat candidate pushed back, saying the FBI director was “speculating.”
The new accusations come after the FBI relaunched an investigation into the use of Clinton’s private server after discovering additional emails on the laptop of ex-Representative Anthony Weiner in the course of a separate investigation. Weiner’s electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that probe.
After the bombshell that investigation was being reopened dropped last week, some Democrats accused the FBI director of trying to influence the election. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

25348,First Amendment Support Climbing Among High School Students - The New York Times,"Support among American high school students for the First Amendment is stronger today than it has been in the last 12 years, according to the latest in a series of large nationwide surveys of the nation’s rising voters. Some 91 percent of high school students say they believe that individuals should be allowed to express unpopular opinions, according to a Knight Foundation survey of nearly 12, 000 students conducted last year. The survey is the sixth in a series, the first of which was carried out in 2004, when 83 percent supported such rights. “What we’ve seen since 2004 is a slow but steady increase in support,” said Kenneth Dautrich, the study’s lead author and the president of the Stats Group, a statistical and data services firm. Here’s a look at some of the top findings. High school students may broadly back the First Amendment, but not without limits: Their support is tempered depending on the kind of speech and where it’s delivered. “While support for the First Amendment as a general concept has never been higher, the devil’s in the details,” said Jonathan Sotsky, director of strategy and assessment for the Knight Foundation.   percent of the students may support the right to express unpopular opinions in general, but only half as many  —   45 percent  —   support that right when the speech in question is offensive to others and made in public. Bullying speech enjoys slightly less backing, and students are even less supportive of either kind of speech when it’s delivered on social media. Many students find little sacred in professional reporting: More than half put as much or more trust in photos, videos and accounts shared by individuals online than in traditional news sources. The 726 teachers surveyed, however, were far more skeptical of the online postings. Students may have faith in firsthand accounts shared online, but they are still generally wary of the news they see there.   percent said they had “some” or “a lot” of trust in the information found in newspapers, compared with 77 percent for television news and 70 percent for news websites. Just 49 percent reported similar levels of trust in news shared on social media. The survey results suggest that high school students and adults differ greatly in how they consume news. Students are almost twice as likely as adults to “often” use mobile devices for news and nearly three times as likely to report “often” getting news from social media. Adults are much more likely to report “often” getting news from local TV and newspapers. Students are far less concerned about their privacy on the internet than adults, according to the survey. But that is changing: In 2016, 76 percent were somewhat or very concerned about privacy online, compared with 70 percent two years earlier.",0
25349,CBS Colorado Investigation Shows People Voting Twice; The Dead Voting,"Pinterest 
In Colorado, cases of voters casting ballots twice, the dead voting, and other cases of fraud are popping up, lending credence to conservatives’ arguments that the election may be “rigged.” 
CBS4 found at least a dozen cases where Coloradans have voted twice, and a previous investigation revealed the names of state residents who had been dead for months or years, still voting. 
In six of the cases, voting records show the exact same person citing twice in the state elections. In the other six, people who were registered in a different state also voted in Colorado. 
Lincoln Wilson, a registered Republican from Hale, in Northeast Colorado, is accused of voting in both Colorado and Kansas in 2010, 2012 and again in 2014. Wilson told CBS4 he voted in both states, but only “voted on local issues” and “didn’t vote twice for President.” 
Wilson is one of five Coloradans now charged by the State of Kansas for voting in both states. 
Randall Killian, an unaffiliated voter, pleaded guilty to voting in Douglas County, Colorado and Kansas in the 2012 presidential election. Ron Weems, a registered Democrat, pleaded guilty to voting in Teller County, Colorado and Kansas in both 2012 and 2014. Both men were fined for their offenses. 
Kansas has also charged James Criswell, a Republican from Douglas County, and Sharon Farris, a Republican from Denver, with double voting. Their cases have not been resolved yet. 
Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said his office is “aggressively prosecuting” double voting cases because it’s a crime that “can’t be caught ahead of time.” 
He says after each election, Colorado and Kansas crosscheck voters to identify double ballots and clean up their databases. But Kobach still believes 10,000 people are registered to vote in both Colorado and Kansas. 
Combing through voter data, CBS4 found three suspected double voters in Denver, one suspected double voter in Arapahoe County and one suspected double voter in Douglas County. All five cases that CBS4 uncovered have now been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal action. 
“It’s a relatively small number,” said Williams, “But, it is a problem of any magnitude because we have close elections in Colorado.” 
But, Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams admits other Coloradans are getting away with it. Combing through voter data, CBS4 found three suspected double voters in Denver, one suspected double voter in Arapahoe County and one suspected double voter in Douglas County. All five cases that CBS4 uncovered have now been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal action.",0
25350,Epic Deep State Internecine Division,"Charles Burris https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/epic-deep-state-internecine-division/ 
I believe in these final climatic days before November 8, we will see epic Deep State internecine division. Some will publicly surface, most will remain buried sub-strata. 
The Deep State is not monolithic or homogeneous but is composed of many seemingly disparate elements or competing factions united by their systemic base criminality under the phony rubric of “national security.” 
Administrations change, but the Deep State endures. 
I think the overall standard perception of Trump as viewed as an outlier or dangerous loose cannon to the statist old guard elites who see his enormous ego, hubris, and independence of mind as threatening to their rackets is breaking down and being challenged late in the game by some factions. Raison d’état, institutional loyalty and self-interest trumps everything else. 
The Clinton ties to epic criminality and predation are thoroughly documented but under-reported by the regime media in thrall to their Deep State suzerains up to this point. She is now being deemed expendable by some elements. And like Huma, she will be thrown under the bus. 
Some of those factions within the Deep State — particularly those un-elected powerful bureaucrats deep within the permanent government and Pentagon that determine actual day-to-day policy from one administration to another, will turn on Hillary, out of amoral self-interest and institutional loyalty. 
James Comey is perhaps the first and most notable.

25351,"Thieves Plow Into Texas Gun Range, Steal Weapons","HOUSTON, Texas  —   Two thieves used a truck to plow into the side of a gun range in Houston, Texas, early Thursday morning. They took off with all the pistols and rifles they could grab. [“Two young males drove a pickup truck into the side of the business, went in, and took assorted rifles and pistols at roughly 4 in the morning,” said Capt. Eddie Martin with the South Houston Police Department, reported the Houston Chronicle.  The alarm was sounded but law enforcement authorities were not notified right away. Officers showed up at the Marksman Indoor Range in South Houston early Thursday but the burglars had already taken off. The South Houston Police Department officers were on the scene within seven minutes of the burglary. “They were in pretty quick and out pretty quick,” Captain Eddie Martin was reported to say. Law enforcement officials are going through surveillance video tapes but do not have a license plate at this time, reported the hometown paper. The Houston Chronicle reports that approximately 32, 000 guns have been stolen in the Houston area in the last eight years, and that only seven percent of those have been recovered. The firearms were heisted from Houston area homes, automobiles, pawn shops, and gun dealers. Texas leads the nation in thefts from unlicensed gun dealers and has a robust black market for guns that have been stolen. Moreover, stolen guns are frequently used to commit other crimes. Breitbart News reported in April that thefts from licensed gun dealers were at a rate of . 039 percent in 2015. According to the Crime Prevention Research Center, approximately 16 million guns were sold by Federal Firearm License holders in 2015 and 6, 163 guns were stolen from them. Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wanted to make gun makers legally responsible for the misuse of stolen guns, as reported by Breitbart News in October 2016. Clinton responded to the dismissal of a lawsuit against Remington Arms by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary victims by calling it “incomprehensible. ” She   on her promise to change laws to allow gun manufacturers to be sued by crime victims.

25352,AG Sessions: Sanctuary Cities That Fail to Comply with Immigration Laws Risk Losing Federal Dollars - Breitbart,"Monday at the White House press briefing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned municipalities that have implemented the policy of sanctuary cities, which he described as making “our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets. ”  Sessions said the Department of Justice would require that jurisdictions that are seeking or applying for DoJ grants to certify compliance with 8 U. S. C. 1373 as a condition of receiving those awards. ” Sessions said, “According to one recent poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that cities that make arrests  —   that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to immigration authorities. Unfortunately, some states and cities have adopted policies designed to frustrate this enforcement of immigration laws. This includes refuses to detain known felons under federal detainer requests or otherwise failing to comply with these laws. For example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor I. C. E. Detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime. These charges and convictions against these aliens include drug trafficking,    rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder. Such policies cannot continue. They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets. ” He added, “Today, I am urging states and local jurisdictions to comply with these federal laws, including 8 U. S. C. Section 1373. Moreover, the Department of Justice will require that jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department of Justice grants to certify compliance with 1373 as a condition of receiving those awards. This policy is entirely consistent with the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs guidance that was issued just last summer under the previous administration. This guidance requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants. It also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants. ” He concluded by saying, “I strongly urge our nation’s states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce immigration laws and to rethink these policies. Such policies make their cities and states less safe. Public safety as well as national security are at stake and put them at risk of losing federal dollars. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

25357,Employers Urged to Prevent Zika Infections at Work - The New York Times,"Companies that employ pregnant women, women who are planning to become pregnant, or even men whose wives or girlfriends are contemplating pregnancy should consider letting them work indoors if they are in areas with Zika transmission, federal health and safety officials said Friday. If the virus reaches the American mainland this summer the recommendation could impose a major burden on industries such as construction, agriculture, transportation, amusement parks and cafes, which employ hundreds of thousands of outdoor workers. It was among a general set of guidelines jointly issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers from occupational exposure to the Zika virus. The greatest risk of infection is from mosquito bites, although the new guidelines recognize that the virus can also be transmitted sexually. As interim guidelines, they are not legally enforceable, said Jordan Barab, the deputy assistant secretary for OSHA at the Labor Department. Issuing advisory guidelines is common during emergencies like epidemics, he said. The new guidelines also recommended that pregnant employees not travel to areas where the Zika virus is circulating and that businesses consider allowing workers who are or may become pregnant delay traveling to those areas. That recommendation also applies to the male partners of such women. The other recommendations made on Friday are based on earlier guidelines issued to protect against West Nile virus. They urge employers to give outdoor workers clothing that covers exposed skin, hats with mosquito netting, insect repellents, and to eliminate standing water near work sites where mosquitoes could lay eggs. Other guidelines issued Friday covered   workers, who face biting insects and hazardous pesticides, and laboratory and health care workers, who could be in danger of acquiring the Zika virus from patients’ blood and bodily fluids. Mr. Barab said industries that employ outdoor workers had not been consulted before the guidelines were issued. Jill M. Shugart, an environmental health specialist in the C. D. C. ’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said her organization often consulted with unions and trade groups but in this case had discussed these occupational guidelines primarily with the airline and cruise ship industries. Those industries were initially concerned with the travel guidelines for pregnant women that the C. D. C. issued in January. Asked if there had been any reaction from businesses with outdoor employees, she said: “The guidelines were just posted today, and we have not heard from every single sector. ” Calls to the United States Chamber of Commerce, which represents employers, were not returned Friday afternoon. It was not clear what constitutes an “area with Zika transmission” for purposes of the workplace guidelines. Mr. Barab said his agency would defer to the C. D. C. on that question. Ms. Shugart suggested that her agency’s travel guidelines might be used to define such an area, but she added that those parameters are broad. The agency initially recommended that pregnant women avoid entire countries, then amended that to include only areas below 6, 500 feet in elevation because the mosquitoes that carry Zika do not survive at high altitudes. The only American territories with known Zika transmission are Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and American Samoa. If the virus reaches Florida or the Gulf Coast this summer, as the C. D. C. has said it might, employers across these regions may not know if their specific location is at risk. Defining such areas by county or state may be required presumably, an outbreak in Key West would not affect a job site in Minnesota. Mr. Barab said he assumed that the C. D. C. would eventually come up with a narrower definition. In the new guidelines, the advice about indoor work is phrased more cautiously than the other guidelines. For example, the new recommendations said that employers should “consider reassigning” employees “if requested by a worker. ”",0
25358,WikiLeaks: John Podesta Attended Satanic ‘Spirit Ritual’,"Has Satanism infiltrated the Washington elite? New WikiLeaks emails suggest John Podesta attended a “Spirit Cooking” dinner party at Marina Abramovich’s house. 
Via YourNewsWire 

Given what we know about the performance artist’s occult fascination, it’s safe to assume they weren’t saying the Lord’s Prayer.

So what happened at this dinner party? Marina Abramovich demonstrates what Spirit Cooking is in a YouTube video. Painting a wall with pig blood, Abramovich smears the sentence “WITH A SHARP KNIFE CUT DEEPLY INTO THE MIDDLE FINGER OF YOUR LEFT HAND EAT THE PAIN.” Another daubed message reads “FRESH MORNING URINE SPRINKLE OVER NIGHTMARE DREAMS.”
Anramovich then throws blood over a small statue in the corner of the room, before writing “SPIRIT COOKING.” Blood is then ceremoniously run around the four corners of the room. Another message on the wall reads “MIX FRESH BREAST MILK WITH FRESH SPERM MILK DRINK ON EARTHQUAKE NIGHTS.”
At 7 mins 30 Abramovich is seen in a projected video with a snake wrapped around her head, it’s tail in her nostril. Warning: in case you hadn’t guessed, this video contains graphic content.
Spirit Cooking, according to article about Marina Abramovich, “ is about the conversion of matter into energy, of the material into the spiritual. Abramovic derives her inspiration from the popular belief that the spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid, but in the form of light, sound and emotions. 
This superstition is found in numerous cultures and there are even strict rules as to how this spiritual fare should be prepared. In this paradox, in the material underpinning of something immaterial, the physical and spiritual worlds meet. 
Or to use her own words, ‘When you make something visible for something invisible, the invisible becomes visible.’ “ Marina Abramovich has long been associated with the occult. Her performance art often features Satanic themes and mock human sacrifice.
Here she is performing with Jay-Z – a man not shy about proclaiming Satanic beliefs.
Perhaps we we shouldn’t be surprised Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta attends Satanic Spirit Cooking dinners. After all, Hillary Clinton appears to have banned use of the word “God” during her campaign. Watch this woman struggle with her natural instincts while Hillary smiles knowingly at her side.

25360,В Италии произошло два землетрясения подряд,"0 комментариев   
Как сообщает Reuters со ссылкой на Геологическую службу США, это было второе за вечер сильное землетрясение в этом районе. Ранее сообщалось о другом землетрясении - магнитудой 5,4.Эпицентр второго землетрясения, по данным службы, располагался около города Кастельсантанджело-суль-Нера (центральная область Марке). 
По словам мэра Мауро Фалуччи, в городе отключилось электричество.Как отмечает Reuters, оба землетрясения «были достаточно сильными и их ощутили 150 км южнее - в Риме, где лампы закачались на верхних этажах зданий». По данным РБК, власти города Виссо, располагающегося недалеко от эпицентра, заявили о нескольких пострадавших. 
По информации Геофизической службы РАН, на которую ссылается ведомство, сейсмособытие произошло в 9:15. Его эпицентр залегал в акватории Тихого океана, в 226 километрах к востоку от города Курильска. 
Как пишет Российская газета, жители островного региона подземных толчков не ощутили. Об угрозе возникновения цунами не сообщается. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что в Японии сейсмологи зафиксировали землетрясение магнитудой 6,5 - подземные толчки произошли южнее Токио в Тихом океане. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, о жертвах сообщений нет. В ообщении метеослужбы Японии говорится, что очаг подземного толчка находился на глубине 10 км в Тихом океане к югу от Токио. По японской шкале оценки силы землетрясений, магнитуда этих толчков не превысила 1 балл. 
Тем не менее, землетрясение ощущалось в девяти префектурах Японии. Информации о жертвах и возможных разрушениях пока не поступала, угроза цунами не объявлялась. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что 12 сентября подземные толчки магнитудой 4,9 и 5,4 были зафиксированы возле города Кёнджу (Кёнсан-Пукто) в 370 км от Сеула. 
Об этом сообщает геологическая служба США (USGS). 
Информации о жертвах и разрушениях не поступало. Ранее в Северной Корее был зарегистрирован толчок магнитудой 5,3, что стало следствием ядерных испытаний. 
Как уточнили в ведомстве, на пять часов утра по местному времени (23-00 12 сентября по Москве) общее число пострадавших составило восемь человек, большинство из которых находились рядом с эпицентром толчков: пятеро пострадавших - из провинции Северная Кенсан, двое - из Тэгу и еще один - из провинции Южная Чолла. 
В основном люди пострадали от упавшей мебели и кусков зданий, но два человека получили ранения, когда решили спрыгнуть на землю со второго этажа, испугавшись подземных толчков. В то же время ранения у всех легкие, жизни пострадавших угрозы нет, пишет Правда.ру. 
23 августа в Италии произошло землетрясение магнитудой 6,4 . Подземные толчки зафиксированы недалеко от города Перуджа.

25363,Чиновники предлагают ввести в России пособие по бедности. А другие - убрать?,"0 комментариев 1 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как рассказала первый замминистра финансов Татьяна Нестеренко, сейчас финансовая поддержка больше всего необходима семьям с детьми в возрасте до 16 лет, особенно в ней нуждаются ""семьи с двумя и более детьми и одним работающим родителем"". 
""Сегодня было бы правильно и нам перейти на применение принципа нуждаемости при назначении отдельных социальных выплат и обсудить возможность введения нового вида пособия - пособия по бедности"", - добавила Нестеренко. 
По словам чиновницы, прежде чем вводить новый вид пособий, сперва стоит определить понятие ""нуждаемость"" и его критерии на законодательном уровне. 
Предложения министерства не отражены в проекте бюджета на 2017-2019 годы, добавила Нестеренко. 
Ранее председатель Правительства РФ Дмитрий Медведев подписал постановление о снижении величины прожиточного минимума. 
Как пояснил Правде.Ру член комитета Совета Федерации по экономической политике Николай Власенко, ""это стоит воспринимать как техническую вещь. Есть правила определения прожиточного минимума. Они ежеквартально корректируются. В третьем квартале он был несколько завышен из-за инфляции, которая у нас носит сезонный характер. Одновременно, например, снижение покупательского спроса, запускает дефляционные процессы. У нас сейчас специфическая ситуация в экономике - называется биполярная инфляция и дефляция "". 
По мнению эксперта Правды.Ру, в некоторых секторах инфляция идет опережающими темпами, а в каких-то есть даже дефляция. Получилось, что в четвертом квартале по тем товарным группам, по которым идентифицируется прожиточный минимум, произошло снижение. Во многом из-за того, что в третьем квартале был существенный рост. Эксперт напомнил, что прожиточный минимум - техническая цифра, к которой ""привязаны"" размеры социальных пособий, субсидий на ЖКХ и многое другое. Но самое важное - это социально-демографический ориентир, порог бедности. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что поступало предложение ввести продовольственные карточки для бедных россиян. 
Отметим, что использование продуктовых карточек для поддержки малообеспеченных людей является довольно распространенной в мире практикой, к примеру, в США активно применяется система Food stamp. На сегодняшний день около 21% американцев подают заявки на получение ежемесячных социальных пособий. 
Кстати, ранее с предложением ввести продовольственные карточки в России выступала ФАС. Доктор экономических наук, профессор Владимир Мантусов в интервью Правда.Ру сообщил, что введение продуктовых талонов не вызовет никакой паники среди населения, так как это является обычной мерой социальной поддержки. Однако, отметил эксперт, основной целью должно быть истребление бедности и нищеты в стране для того, чтобы люди не нуждались в бесплатных продуктах.

25366,U.S. Strengthens Its Forces in a Crowded Syrian Battlefield - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The United States has increased its forces near the northern Syrian town of Manbij as concerns have grown that fighting could erupt among the complex array of militias and Syrian and Turkish troops who are operating on the crowded battlefield near there. Photographs of American troops in Stryker vehicles and armored Humvees flying American flags circulated on Saturday on social media. The   command that is fighting the Islamic State, a militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL, acknowledged the buildup around the town, but did not provide details. “The coalition has increased its force presence in and around Manbij to deter any hostile action against the city and its civilians, to enhance local governance and to ensure there is no persistent Y. P. G. presence,” an American military spokesman said, using the acronym for the People’s Protection Units, Kurdish militia groups that have been trained by United States military advisers. The Turks have repeatedly complained that the Y. P. G. which played a critical role in taking Manbij, has yet to vacate the city, despite American assurances that it has done so. The spokesman added, “This is a deliberate action to reassure our coalition members and partner forces, deter aggression, and ensure all parties remain focused on defeating our common enemy, ISIS. ” American military officials said the total number of United States forces in Syria had not increased. But the new deployment of American troops around Manbij has been done in a visible manner. A combustible mix of forces are crowding the battlefield in northern Syria, including   Syrian militias, Syrian government forces, and Kurdish and Arab fighters trained by the United States. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the   task force that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told reporters on Wednesday that Syrian government troops had advanced near Manbij to the point where they were within “rifle range” of Syrian Arab fighters backed by American forces. The United States has hundreds of troops in northern Syria who have been training and advising Syrian Arab and Kurdish fighters. “It’s very difficult and complicated,” said General Townsend, adding that it was important that tensions among the groups not disrupt the campaign against the Islamic State. “That’s what we ought to keep our efforts focused on, and not fighting deliberately or accidentally with one another. ” The potential for a clash is clear. Abu Amjed, the head of the Manbij Military Council, which has responsibility for securing the city, said during an interview last week that Turkish forces had been shooting at his front lines. Another worry is Ahrar   an Islamist opposition group, which has been supported by the Turks. Under a recent agreement that Russia is said to have played a role in brokering, Syrian government forces are moving into villages near Manbij. The Manbij security forces appear to have ceded control of the villages to prevent them from being occupied by   militias or Turkish troops. In a development that reflected the fluid and confusing battlefield, Russian aircraft on Tuesday mistakenly bombed Syrian Arab fighters trained by the United States. General Townsend said  the attack, which took place about 10 miles southwest of Manbij, occurred when the Syrian fighters moved into villages that had been occupied by the Islamic State. The Russian Defense Ministry said it had not carried out airstrikes in areas that the United States had previously designated as being occupied by   fighters.",0
25367,Cars That Broke Bad,"Eric Peters Autos October 31, 2016 
Automotive good ideas gone bad range far and wide – whether it’s a classic fail like the exploding Pintos of the early ’70s – or a late-model train wreck like the Pontiac Aztek. 
Here are ten automotive atrocities that will be remembered for as long as the warranty claims (and class-action lawsuits) linger: 
* The entire American Motors Corp. (AMC) lineup – 
From dreadful dreadnoughts like the malformed Matador to demented detritus like the Gremlin and Pacer, no other automaker ever managed to build such a seemingly endless conga line of bizarre, poorly conceived (and often, poorly built) cars within such a short span of time (from the late 1960s to the early-mid 1970s). 
Only bankruptcy eventually succeeded in stopping the madness. Exceptions deserving of a kind word include the Javelin and AMX, which were decent efforts hobbled by AMC’s perpetual lack of adequate development funds. 
* Chrysler’s “lean burn” engines – 
While Honda was developing highly efficient combustion chambers to lower engine emissions via engineering advances such as the CVCC cylinder head (which allowed the cars to meet federal exhaust emissions standards without catalytic converters) Chrysler was duct-taping its V8s with leaned-out carburetors that mainly made them even harder to start than they were before – and prone to stalling in the middle of busy intersections. 
In addition, you also got gelded performance and terrible gas mileage. 
Now you know why “rich, Corinthian leather” never made a comeback. 
* General Motors’ diesel V8 – 
Imagine a luxury car that was both slow and inefficient as well as prone to early and catastrophic engine failures and you have a taste of the bitter flavor that was the diesel-powered Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs of the late ’70s and early ’80s. 
These “diesel” engines were actually converted gas engines, which (contrary to the myth) wasn’t the problem. Poor quality control was. 
The resultant debacle not only soured an entire country on the otherwise perfectly sound concept it helped hustle Oldsmobile to the boneyard of automotive has-beens and nearly killed off Cadillac, too. 
* The Sterling – 
Japanese automakers rarely screw the pooch, but this was an exception. 
Back in the late 1980s, in collusion with British car maker Land Rover, Acura Legends were re-sold as “British” Sterling 825s and 827s. The alliance was as enduring as the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact – and just as awkward. Parts for these cars – especially interior pieces – are all but impossible to find. Dealer support is nonexistent. Resale values are lower than current highs for well-worn Yugos. 
If Truman had had another bomb left to drop, the childhood home of the dude who would grow up to create Sterling would have been a worthy target. 
* Pontiac Fiero – 
A great idea ruined by upper management skinflints and con men – who thought it would be slick take Chevette underthings (front suspension, engine) and put them in a car that looked sporty and then charge the suckers top dollar. 
First-year sales were great – until the word got out. They then nose-dived into the ground like the Air France Concorde, forcing the car’s cancellation just four years after it came out. Just in time to hand over the entire market for a car of this type to Mazda , which brought out the Miata a year after the Fiero was sent to the crusher.

25369,DNI: Insiders Leaking ’Classified’ Information ’a Significant Threat’ Under Trump - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, DC  —   The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has warned that deliberate leaks of “sensitive or classified” U. S. government information by “trusted insiders” will “remain a significant threat” during President Donald Trump’s tenure. [DNI Daniel Coats’ warning can be found in the latest World Wide Threat Assessment unveiled during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week.  “Trusted insiders who disclose sensitive or classified US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2017 and beyond,” notes the assessment, authored by the U. S. intelligence community. “The sophistication and availability of information technology that increases the scope and impact of unauthorized disclosures exacerbate this threat. ” What Coats describes sounds similar to what has come to be known as the “deep state,” which refers to entities within and outside the federal government colluding to prevent a democratically elected leader from implementing his agenda. Breitbart News reported: The term “deep state” has been used to refer to deliberate leaks designed to undermine the president, but also to the willing collusion of elements of the mainstream media, the latent distrust and suspected opposition of elements of the intelligence services, but also the willing resistance of certain career civil servants in the agencies charged with carrying President Trump’s directions to fruition. Specifically, the primary purpose of the “deep state is to undermine a democratically elected leader’s agenda and ultimately overthrow that leader. A “deep state” is primarily powered by a steady drip of classified information, much like what has been taking place under the Trump administration. Nevertheless, various mainstream media outlets have dismissed the existence of an American “deep state” working against the Trump administration as a conspiracy theory. The “deep state” involves an intricate network comprised of government insiders, often made up of individuals from the military and intelligence communities. Many media outlets described concerns voiced by President Trump and his supporters about the intelligence community and other components of the government leaking classified information as paranoia. Through the threat assessment, the intelligence community itself is warning that the disclosure of classified information by “trusted” government insiders is not only real but also poses a “significant threat. ” The Worldwide Threat Assessment also warns against foreign actors, including some from Latin America, seeking to infiltrate the U. S. government. It reports: The United States will face a complex global foreign Intelligence threat environment in 2017. We assess that the leading state intelligence threats to US interests will continue to be Russia and China, based on their services’ capabilities, intent, and broad operational scope. Other states in South Asia, the Near East, East Asia, and Latin America will pose local and regional Intelligence threats to US interests. For example, Iranian and Cuban intelligence and security services continue to view the United States as a primary threat. Penetrating the US national decision making apparatus and the Intelligence Community will remain primary objectives for numerous foreign intelligence entities. Additionally, the targeting of national security information and proprietary information from US companies and research institutions involved with defense, energy, finance,   technology, and other areas will remain a persistent threat to US interests. Besides foreign governments like Russia and China,   criminals will also seek to undermine America’s intelligence community by recruiting American government insiders to obtain information and conduct surveillance. “  entities, including international terrorists and transnational organized crime groups, are likely to continue to employ and improve their intelligence capabilities including by human, technical, and cyber means. As with state intelligence services, these   entities recruit sources and perform physical and technical surveillance to facilitate their illicit activities and avoid detection and capture,” points out the threat assessment. In 2016, the threat assessment also warned that “insiders who disclose sensitive US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2016. ”",0
25370,Report: JEB! Bush Takes Pass on Buying Marlins,"Former Florida Governor and   candidate for president Jeb Bush has reportedly taken a pass on buying the Miami Marlin baseball team, according to reports. [In April it was reported that Gov. Bush had joined a consortium of investors, including former New York Yankee Derek Jeter, looking to buy the baseball team by offering a $1. 3 billion bid.  The deal was said to represent a profitable return on investment for current Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria who bought the team for $158 million. Despite the team being valued at only $940 million, the deal for $1. 3 billion would have returned over eight times what Loria originally paid for the team. But, according to reports, Gov. Bush has now dropped out of the group seeking to make the deal, the Associated Press reported. The source reported to the AP on the condition of anonymity because the deal is still in the midst of negotiations. The Marlins have also not made any public statements on the deal. “Gov. Bush has great respect for Derek Jeter, and Derek remains a great friend,” the inside source told the AP. “And he’s looking forward to a great rest of the season for the Marlins. ” It had been reported by baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred that the Bush group’s offer for the team was roughly on par with an offer being made by former GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s son, Tagg Romney. With the group fronted by Gov. Bush dropping out of the bidding, that leaves only the Romney offer on the table. The Marlins are struggling to stay out of last place in the NL East this year. They haven’t been in the playoffs since 2003. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0

25372,"Tesla Hits a New Milestone, Passing G.M. in Valuation - The New York Times","Tesla has quietly zoomed past another automotive milestone. Just a week after the company surpassed Ford Motor in market value, its shares closed at $312. 39 on Monday, making Tesla worth about $50. 9 billion, slightly more than General Motors. G. M. like Ford Motor, has been operating for more than 100 years, and in the first quarter of 2017, it sold hundreds of thousands more vehicles than Tesla, an electric car upstart, did in all of 2016. But investors are betting that Tesla, whose chief executive is Elon Musk, has room to grow as the world’s appetite for electric vehicles expands. Tesla said on April 2 that its   sales had risen 69 percent from the same period a year ago. The next day, Ford and G. M. released disappointing sales figures. Although the big automakers are financially healthy and produce the   types of vehicles, like trucks and sport utility vehicles, they are perceived as lagging in   technology like alternative power and autonomy.

25373,WikiLeaks: John Podesta Attended Satanic ‘Spirit Cooking’ Party,"http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/wikileaks-john-podesta-attended-satanic.html Here's more evidence of Satanism among the government's ""elite"" New WikiLeaks emails suggest John Podesta attended a “Spirit Cooking” dinner party at Marina Abramovich’s house. Given what we know about the performance artist’s occult fascination, it’s safe to assume they weren’t saying the Lord’s Prayer. So what happened at this dinner party? Marina Abramovich demonstrates what Spirit Cooking is in a YouTube video. Painting a wall with pig blood, Abramovich smears the sentence: “WITH A SHARP KNIFE CUT DEEPLY INTO THE MIDDLE FINGER OF YOUR LEFT HAND EAT THE PAIN.” Another daubed message reads: “FRESH MORNING URINE SPRINKLE OVER NIGHTMARE DREAMS.” Anramovich then throws blood over a small statue in the corner of the room, before writing “SPIRIT COOKING.” Blood is then ceremoniously run around the four corners of the room. Another message on the wall reads: “MIX FRESH BREAST MILK WITH FRESH SPERM MILK DRINK ON EARTHQUAKE NIGHTS.” Here's her email to Tony Podesta: At 7 mins 30 Abramovich is seen in a projected video with a snake wrapped around her head, it’s tail in her nostril. Warning: in case you hadn’t guessed, this video contains graphic content. Spirit Cooking, according to an article about Marina Abramovich, “is about the conversion of matter into energy, of the material into the spiritual. Abramovic derives her inspiration from the popular belief that the spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid, but in the form of light, sound and emotions. [ Alexander : The only spirits that need food in the form of light, sound and — negative — emotions are the Archons who control mankind . They have e ntrapped our souls eons ago in the reincarnation cycle and torture us in this dimension of pain and sufferance, so that we polarize the pure energy that we receive from the Source into the much-needed negative energy, which they use to feed on and keep this Matrix running . The so called ""elite"" are empty vehicles used by these demonic beings to control and torture us — indefinitely. Luckily, in this incarnation we have the opportunity to learn how to escape their control when we get to the ""other side."" ] This superstition is found in numerous cultures and there are even strict rules as to how this spiritual fare should be prepared. In this paradox, in the material underpinning of something immaterial, the physical and spiritual worlds meet. Or to use her own words, ‘When you make something visible for something invisible, the invisible becomes visible.’ Marina Abramovich has long been associated with the occult. Her performance art often features Satanic themes and mock human sacrifice. Take a look at this performance at the MoCA annual gala. Warning: NSFW.

25374,Coulter on Kathy Griffin: Victims Are the Biggest Bullies in the Country Now - Breitbart,"Friday on his Fox News show “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” host Tucker Carlson had author Ann Coulter weigh in on Kathy Griffin’s emotional press conference where the comedian accused President Donald Trump and his family of trying to “ruin” her life after she posed for a picture holding a fake decapitated head of the president.  Coulter slammed the victimhood mentality of liberals, saying victims have become the biggest bullies in the United States. Watch: “Victimhood is like a magical elixir that makes any kind of behavior possible, justifies any kind of overreach or cruelty. It’s like the perfect tool,” Carlson said. “That was the theme of my book, Guilty, how victims had turned themselves into the aggressors and thereby wonder around creating other victims,” Coulter replied. “Victims are the biggest bullies in the country now. ” “I don’t think it’s an attack for Trump just to comment that his    son had seen that disgusting image that wasn’t funny and wasn’t interesting and oh, she was just so smug and thought it was so funny,” she later added.

25378,Fendi’s Dolce Vita - The New York Times,"ROME  —   It’s hard to hold a newsworthy fashion show these days. Collections have been shown, after all, on the Great Wall of China, on a   anniversary and in Blenheim Palace in England. Yet Thursday evening in Rome, Fendi managed to add to the canon. How? By having models walk on water, of course. The setting was the Trevi Fountain at sunset, and the occasion was the brand’s 90th anniversary and its second haute fourrure show. Four years ago, Pietro Beccari, then newly appointed chief executive, decided it was in the brand’s best interest to associate itself more intimately with the city of its birth. He added “Roma” to the logo and began a project to sponsor the restoration of the city’s fountains, starting with the one where Anita Ekberg once romped for “La Dolce Vita. ” The Trevi initiative was completed in the fall, and 2. 6 million euros, or $2. 9 million, later, it was payback time. Still, Mr. Beccari said just before the show, “it was a miracle it happened at all. ” Politics, after all, waits for no fashion season, and this is a time of uncertainty in Italy. Since Fendi’s original offer to help Rome, the city has had no fewer than four leaders, the most recent  —   from the   Five Star Movement  —   elected just weeks before the show. “We got the final   at 1 p. m. the afternoon before,” Mr. Beccari revealed in a dinner toast after the event. But that didn’t stop the brand from emptying the fountain, building a glass catwalk almost 200 feet long, and filling it up again  —   or persuading the 97 merchants in its immediate vicinity to close early for the day. It was a good thing, because, in a rare example of contextual alchemy, the conjunction of site and subject gave proof positive of the show’s title, “Legends and Fairy Tales. ” As water poured from under Oceanus’s feet, spilling over stone sea horses and Tritons, the first of 46 looks appeared: a   astrakhan princess coat with jeweled embroidery. It was just the start of an   visual discourse on the art of the possible, which ranged from   crocheted mohair gowns inset with fur roses or traced with leather castles and creatures inspired by the early   Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen, to evening capes and coats with whole narratives in their wefts. Even for Fendi, a brand that made its name by demonstrating the multitudinous forms of fur, the clothes were astonishing. “Five or 10 years ago, this could not have been done,” Karl Lagerfeld said before the show. Whether a woman would want to spend enormous amounts of money to wear a fable on her back was almost besides the point (and as for the dresses, the answer is a straightforward “yes”): More relevant was the fact they could be so written. Also, the question of, if Fendi did this for its 90th anniversary, what would it do for 100? “Wait and see!” Mr. Beccari said. Beyond the legendary, after all, comes the epic.",0
25379,Beyoncé Is Pregnant With Twins - The New York Times,"That collective shriek of joy you’re hearing from the BeyHive? Beyoncé and Jay Z are expecting twins. Beyoncé, the cultural and music powerhouse, dropped the news in an Instagram post on Wednesday afternoon with a picture showing her cradling a baby bump: The announcement was yet another example of the Beyoncé’s penchant for tightly controlling her own narrative. She revealed she was pregnant in 2011 with a knowing belly rub at the MTV Video Music Awards, after a spirited performance of “Love on Top”  —   and a microphone drop. (A quick camera cut to Jay Z, born Shawn Carter, smiling    as Kanye West shook his rapper friend by the shoulders confirmed the message.) Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born on Jan. 7, 2012. While Beyoncé is famously averse to interviews and rarely discusses her personal life without setting the terms, she put the spotlight on her marriage with the release last year of the album and HBO film “Lemonade. ” It told the story of a struggling relationship, including explicit infidelity and, eventually, reconciliation. Many assumed the songs’ lyrics  —   which ranged from heartbroken to defiant to forgiving  —   were autobiographical, though the couple never revealed how much of the story was based in reality. (In her 2013 documentary, “Life Is But a Dream,” Beyoncé discussed having an earlier miscarriage. “About two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time,” she said. “I flew back to New York to get my checkup  —   and no heartbeat. ” Jay Z alluded to the experience in his song “Glory. ”) “Lemonade” is nominated for a leading nine Grammy Awards at the ceremony to be held on Feb. 12. Beyoncé is also scheduled to headline the second night of the Coachella festival in the California desert on April 15 and April 22. Things seem to be going well for the couple now  —   Beyoncé’s Instagram post was signed, “The Carters. ” The pair’s fervent and loyal fans responded with typical enthusiasm to the announcement: Twitter said more than half a million tweets were sent about the pregnancy within 45 minutes. Some Coachella ticket holders wondered about the status of Beyoncé’s scheduled performance. A representative for the singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jay Z and Beyoncé are not the only musical duo with baby news. Pharrell Williams and his wife, Helen Lasichanh, recently welcomed triplets, according to reports.",0

Nomi Prins, who meets with people from the Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank, foreign central banks and high-raking government officials across the globe, just warned when the system crashes time time, it will crash harder. Nomi Prins warned people should keep cash out of the banking system. 
When It Crashes, It Crashes Harder Nomi Prins: “The financial system is fragile. It (the crackup) has been contained for 8 going on what will be 9 years of cheap money, bond subsidization, banking subsidization, and of a codependency that is very fragile. I don’t know when that gives. I’ve tried to guess this throughout the years, but the point is that it only increases in its tension and its (ultimate) downfall with every day that it’s been subsidized artificially…

25387,Conference Calls for Greater Diversity in Rap Music,"Diversity Macht Frei October 28, 2016 
Britain is diversifying and the rap music industry needs to diversify with it, was the general consensus at the Eezee Labelâs Diversity and Inclusion in Hip-Hop Production conference, which took place at the Royal Northern College of Music on 19 October. 
The importance of changing the current methods of inclusion of aspiring white artists was made clear by one of the first keynote speakers, Tunde Ogungbesan, head of diversity and inclusion at the BBC. He made the point that increased industry diversity leads to a more productive, creative and innovative society, particularly in relation to the BBC, of which he said âwe want to be the most creative organisation in the worldâ. 
Ogungbesanâs views were reinforced by Vick Bain, CEO of Basca (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors), as she ascribed the survival of British rap music to the essentiality of diversity within composition. 
Taking a more urgent tone, composer Eleanor Alberga stated that regular inclusion of white composers and young musicians needs to start immediately but also cautioned that we must âmake sure this is more than another gestureâ. 
The conference included a talk on unconscious bias entitled âWhat does a rap musician look like?â given by Aesha Zafar, head of talent development at BBC North. It started with a short film in which audience members at a hip-hop concert were asked what a rap musician looked like. A large majority of the audience thought a rapper would be male, of African heritage, often with outlandish clothing and exotic hairstyles. This added to Zafarâs idea that unconscious bias is the result of lots of tiny, nondescript events, which ultimately prove detrimental to the progression of inclusion and diversity. 
This is my rewrite of the Report on the Diversity and Inclusion in Composition Conference, which, in its original form, seen below, referred to classical music, not hip-hop.

Russian teenagers are risking their lives in a deadly new craze - surfing fast moving inter city trains. 
It has become a common sight in the capital Moscow to see the youngsters - usually sporting distinctive ski goggles and masks - clinging to the back of underground trains to hitch a free ride. 
But some thrill seekers are now taking the craze to new heights - mounting the roofs and standing between carriages of St Petersburg-bound locomotives travelling up to 155mph. 2ca20d51 578-3244929-image-a-57_1442936391337.jpg

Alexander Nomernoy, 18, who regularly risks his life riding the inter city trains, said: 'Even the first time riding a train in this way was not scary. I wouldn't call it extreme in the slightest.' 
The brazen group of train surfers can be seen waving at the camera in footage as they lie on the roof, clinging on by holding metal jutting from the train's roof. 
Some even dangle themselves off the side of the carriage as the locomotive gathers pace. 
Other clips show them sneaking in between carriages at stations before the trains pull away.

'Then once when the underground was full of people and I just couldn't get into the train. I needed to get home ASAP, so I decided to give it a try...I jumped on to the back of the train and held on.' 
More often than not the train surfers go completely undetected, slipping away before authorities know they are even there. 
'I actually like riding the long distance trains. It is more dangerous in terms of coming into contact with police to ride the underground - more chances to get caught,' Mr Nomernoy said. 
'I have tried many different ways of surfing - trams, trolleybuses, buses, underground trains roof and back...I would love to ride the underground train in different cities,' he added.",0
25392,A ‘Heat Dome’ Is Coming. Domes Are Bad. - The New York Times,"We are domed. Or will be, at any rate, very soon. In case you have not heard, a   weather phenomenon called a “heat dome” is creeping across the country and is due to arrive in New York City just in time for the weekend. On paper, the heat dome will not be much different from “a stretch of hot, sticky days. ” It will be in the low 90s or the   on Friday, depending on which forecast you believe, and definitely muggy. It will be slightly hotter than that on Saturday, and then very slightly cooler during the week but still humid. But the weather people are calling it a dome. And domes are almost always bad. There’s Mad Max’s Thunderdome, where gladiators died. There’s the Houston Astrodome, one of the nation’s largest abandoned buildings  —   too big and expensive to be blown up. No one can figure out what to do with it. In   England, there was the Domesday Book, compiled by order of William the Conqueror. It was basically a gigantic  ’s list. His subjects hated it. And there’s the Public Enemy song “Welcome to the Terrordome,” which is a good song but it’s about a pretty   situation. A heat wave is just passing through. Wave hi! A dome sits there. And unless it is a stately   you probably do not want to be stuck inside it. Look what happened to the people in the Stephen King novel and resulting TV series “Under the Dome. ” In New York, “heat dome” brings to mind the steel climbing domes that were   installed in Brooklyn Bridge Park in 2010. They heated up in the sun. A lot. Toddlers got burned. There were lawsuits. The whole thing was a disaster. With this heat dome, the city is actually escaping the worst of it. The country’s midsection is getting domed something fierce. The heat index could hit the    in places like St. Louis and Oklahoma City, part of an area covering 40 million people that was under a heat alert on Wednesday. That is no joke. There have been further reports of a   mass stalled over Cleveland all week. That is a joke. So what, exactly, is a heat dome? It is essentially a bubble of high pressure that sits in the   to upper atmosphere and pushes warm air down toward the ground. The approaching one is notable for its size. Another thing you should know about the dome: Because it is a   mass, the air flows clockwise around it, so at the back of the air mass  —   like from 6 to 9 on a clock  —   the air flow is from south to north. So as the heat dome moves east across the country, it brings up hot, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. In the Midwest, the heat dome’s effects will be compounded by an     phenomenon called “corn sweat. ” Corn sweat is the release of water from plant leaves into the air, also known as transpiration. That makes it even muggier. Like a jungle, except it’s a corn field. New York City has only a couple of very small corn fields, so we’re good on that. But we are an urban heat island, a place where   streets and buildings, and pollution, and all the people jammed together, can make it feel even hotter. Domed if you do, domed if you don’t. There’s no escape.",0
25394,"Threats to Jewish Centers ‘Are Not Isolated Incidents,’ Senators Say - The New York Times","FRAMINGHAM, Mass.  —   As Tuesday brought another round of threats against Jewish institutions, the nation’s senators urged the Trump administration to take quick action to curb the episodes, which have left Jewish community centers deeply unsettled. “It has become clear that threats of violence against individual JCCs are not isolated incidents,” said the letter, which was signed by all 100 senators and addressed to the attorney general, Jeff Sessions the secretary of homeland security, John Kelly and the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey. “We are concerned that the number of incidents is accelerating,” putting people at risk and threatening the centers, the letter said. The F. B. I. has been investigating, and last week, a St. Louis man, Juan Thompson, was charged with cyberstalking and accused of making at least eight of the threats nationwide. The authorities believe that Mr. Thompson, 31, was trying to harass his   by pinning the threats on her. Tuesday’s round of calls, to 15 Jewish organizations in the United States and Canada, was the sixth since the beginning of the year. In all, 110 institutions have received 140 bomb threats, the   League said. The threats, along with vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and graffiti of swastikas reported around the country, have raised concerns about a new round of  . While President Trump has condemned the episodes, some critics argue that they are an outgrowth of the vitriol of last year’s presidential campaign, and of Mr. Trump’s tone during it. “We think it’s long overdue for the Department of Justice to announce a fully resourced criminal investigation into these crimes,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the   League. “I mean, these are hate crimes. ” Five day schools received threats on Tuesday, and Mr. Greenblatt said it was troubling that the perpetrators were disrupting such institutions. “It is inconvenient and uncomfortable when a bomb threat’s called into our office,” he said. “It’s much more concerning when preschool children are evacuated from their classrooms, or elderly patients are wheeled out of their rehab programs, or teens are whisked out of our   programs. ” At the MetroWest Jewish Day School in Framingham, Mass. which shares a building with the Temple Beth Sholom synagogue on a hillside about 23 miles west of Boston, the threat interrupted Pajama Day. Students had already filed into class, wearing cozy pants and slippers, with many looking forward to lunchtime because it was the one day of the month when the kosher kitchen offered meat: chicken nuggets, served with fries and vegetables. But the day took a dark turn when, at 9:46 a. m. a staff member picked up the phone and heard what seemed to be a recorded warning about a bomb. “We evacuated all the kids,” said   Scott Sokol, the head of the school and a cantor at the synagogue. “We told the kids initially it was a fire drill, obviously not to get them all concerned. ” The students swapped their slippers for shoes, found their coats and went outside, where they waited in the chilly morning air for buses to whisk them to another school nearby. “We were prepared, unfortunately, for this call,” Mr. Sokol said. “We were not exactly expecting it, but not surprised that it happened. ” After   dogs cleared the building, the students returned for a long recess and their chicken nuggets. Mr. Sokol was preparing to explain why they had really evacuated. “I’d rather not lie to them about a fire drill,” Mr. Sokol said, “but I do want them to feel safe and secure in the building, which they are. ”",0
25395,"Hillary’s DONE After Announcing Potential Cabinet Member, Try Not To Vomit","Hillary’s DONE After Announcing Potential Cabinet Member, Try Not To Vomit Posted on November 1, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This 
With her numbers tanking, Hillary Clinton is desperate for any vote that she can get. Proving just that, she just floated an idea for a potential cabinet member, but it could actually end her once and for all. 
At this point, it’s clear that Hillary isn’t in control of her own campaign. If she was, she would have buried herself a long time ago. As we continue to get glimpses of her crooked behavior that she tries to keep behind the curtain, it doesn’t take too much of a genius to know that she doesn’t really have any good ideas of her own. Hillary Clinton 
Proving just that is a potential cabinet member she floated during an interview with Extra . As she didn’t have her strategists whispering in her ear at the time, telling her when to shut up and when to speak, she actually stated that she would love to have Michelle Obama as a part of her team . 
Michelle Obama is a nobody outside of being married to a president. She’s been nothing more than a freeloader for the past 8 years who has done literally nothing but make the lives of the American people a living hell. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama 
Despite Michelle’s failed legacies and lackadaisical tendencies, Hillary still thought that she would make a great addition to her team. Then again, both Hillary and Michelle have a taste for the finer things in life and enjoy the fruits of everyone else’s labor. 
When directly asked if she would like Michelle in her cabinet, Hillary simply stated : 
“She’s made it pretty clear she wants to focus on important issues like girls’ education around the world – she and I actually talked about it when we were together in Winston-Salem – and I want to be the best partner I can be for whenever she wants to be involved in government again.” 
However, that wasn’t quite the end of the thought process as she next went against what President Barack Obama said in that Michelle wasn’t interested in the slightest when it came to furthering herself in the political realm. “I think she wants to take a break from it, but if she ever wants to do anything like that, I would be the number-one person,” Hillary said. “Well, I don’t know how anybody could have done what she’s done for the last eight years with more grace and more of a sense of purpose but inclusivity.” 
Hillary’s sentiments become laughable when she hints to the idea that Michelle actually did anything. Think long and hard about what she did and you’ll come up with nothing. Her lunch policy only left kids hungry and unsatisfied before failing overall when schools systematically began to reject her mandate. Michelle and Barack Obama 
Making sure girls are taught everywhere? Well, all we saw was Michelle flying around the globe and taking several vacations while demanding other countries change their ways. Beyond the fact that this does absolutely nothing for the American people (and actually hurts them on account of the cost associated with the several trips), it only ticked people off and made Americans look pretty stupid. 
Of course, this would be a “smart” choice for Hillary seeing how blind leftists love and support Michelle for some reason. However, all it really equates to are a few more votes in her pocket as she panders to the audience of someone else. Basically, Hillary is trying to whore Michelle out. I wonder how she feels about that.",0

25397,Israel snubs UNESCO's Temple Mount resolution with ancient Jerusalem papyrus," 44 UTC © Ronen Zvulun/Reuters Israel presented an ancient fragment of text in Hebrew referencing Jerusalem and recalled its ambassador to UNESCO in a gesture of protest against a resolution which criticized Israel for restricting Muslims' access to a holy site in the city. The text, written on a 11cm by 2.5cm papyrus, was dated by the Israel Antiquities Authority to the 7th century BCE and was said to be the earliest Hebrew reference to Jerusalem outside of the Bible. ""From the king's maidservant, from Na'arat, jars of wine, to Jerusalem,"" read the two lines of script. Archeologists believe it to be document detailing payment of taxes or transfer of goods. ""Hey UNESCO, an ancient papyrus dating to the 1st Temple 2700 yrs ago has been found. It bears the oldest known mention of Jerusalem in Hebrew,"" Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wrote on Twitter. The official's jab was directed at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which earlier on Wednesday passed a controversial resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem called Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. The resolution was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Israel accused UNESCO and its Arab members of trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. In response to the move, Israel also recalled its ambassador to UNESCO for consultations, while Netanyahu called the situation a ""theatre of the absurd."" ""We'll decide what to do, what our next steps will be,"" toward the organization, the Israeli PM added. Temple Mount is administered by the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, a religious institution under the auspices of the Jordanian crown, which is responsible for managing rights of visitation and worship, management and repairs under the so-called Status Quo agreement. Israel has controlled East Jerusalem since 1967 and officially annexed it in 1980, though the move has not been recognized by the international community. Israeli authorities have been increasing security in the area recently, occasionally blocking access to the Al-Aqsa mosque and sparking outrage among the Muslim worshipers. The conflict over the holy site and the perception that Israel was trying to change the status quo is seen as a major factor in the latest spree of knife violence by Arabs against Jews. Although the UNESCO resolution removed multiple references to Israel's ""occupation"" of east Jerusalem and the Old City from the original draft, the softened text did not address all of Israel's complaints. The conflict is aggravated by the fact that many Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be capital of their national state, while Israel considers the entire city its own capital.",0
25398,Amazon’s Jeff Bezos Exploring Legal Challenge to Trump Travel Ban - Breitbart,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is considering making a legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily halting immigration from seven   countries amid the tide of   hysteria in reaction to the order. [In an email to Amazon’s employees, many of whom work in notoriously challenging conditions, Bezos said, “America is a nation of immigrants whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view have helped us build and invent as a nation for over 240 year. To our employees in the US and around the world who may be directly affected by this order, I want you to know that the full extent of Amazon’s resources are behind you. ”  “We reached out to congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to explore legislative options. Our legal team has prepared a declaration of support for the Washington state attorney general who will be filing suit against the order. We are working other legal options as well,” he continued. Amazon is one of a number of technology companies to oppose the executive order on immigration over terrorism concerns, signed by Trump last Friday. Companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix have all publicly condemned the order, whilst promoting the impact of mass immigration on their businesses. Jeff Bezos was a prominent critic of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, assembling a team of 20 people at his newspaper the Washington Post to investigate every aspect of Trump’s past. Meanwhile, Trump attacked Bezos, saying that Amazon had a “huge antitrust problem” whilst “getting away with murder” on corporation tax. The editorial board of the Washington Post also called in 2016 for an influx of illegal immigrants to fill   jobs in America. Following Trump’s election in November, Bezos met with Trump alongside a range of Silicon Valley executives to discuss the future of the technology industry under the new administration. Earlier this month, Bezos promised to create over 100, 000 permanent new jobs in the United States. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
25400,Cranberry Juice and Urinary Tract Infections – a Myth? · Guardian Liberty Voice,"Many women swear by cranberries as a home remedy for bladder and urinary tract issues. But, researchers also swear (and claim to have shown) that it is a myth that cranberry juice or other foods containing the berries can prevent or treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). What is the answer?
Products with cranberries in them, from the perpetual Ocean Spray sauce cans to Thomas’ English Muffins, are prominent in stores this time of year. Many people only eat or drink things with cranberries in them around Thanksgiving. Conversely, many women for years have regularly sought out and relied on cranberries in juice, foods, or capsules to thwart bladder problems.
The berries can be more than a holiday dietary element. But, a new study in the “Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)” suggests that they are ineffective on UTIs. However, the sample population may not be representative.
For the study just published in “JAMA,” the researchers from Yale University randomly assigned 185 women to two groups. One set consumed daily two capsules which contained cranberry extracts that were the equivalent of 20 ounces of cranberry juice. The other group downed placebo capsules. The women took the capsules for one year. During the time, there was no significant difference in the UTI rates for those receiving the capsules with cranberry extracts versus those taking the placebos, according to the researchers.
A huge problem with the study is that all of the participants are seniors living in nursing homes near Yale. The average age was reportedly 86.
While UTIs are the most commonly diagnosed infection for women in nursing homes, does the study conclusively show the cranberry juice treatment is a myth? Furthermore, would the results be the same if the study was conducted in student housing at Yale?
Actually, there have been other studies, including one among 319 college women published by the University of Michigan School of Public Health. That study, published in “Clinical Infectious Diseases” over five years ago, found a similar result. Conversely, there have been some studies that showed some evidence that cranberry juice or capsules may help some. Generally, the research has produced mixed results.
Drink the Juice or Not The belief that eating or drinking cranberry products can prevent or treat urinary was based on the fact they increase the acidity of urine. The speculation was that chemicals in cranberries (proanthocyanidins) prevent bacteria from sticking to the bladder wall.
The advent of antibiotics eliminated the need for old wives’ tales and herbal treatments. But, the overuse of antibiotics has made people reluctant to go the prescription route. So, should people try the cranberry products and juice route, or not?
Many experts believe that cranberry products should not be recommended for prevention of UTIs. That said, someone could try cranberry juice or capsules as a personal choice or first recourse. The top recommendation on medical Websites is to keep hydrated to flush out the system and prevent UTIs. While water is great, there is no serious downside in drinking cranberry juice to prevent UTIs, whether a myth or not, given the inconclusive research.

[11/3/16] In the latest batch of emails leaked by WikiLeaks, involving the account of US Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign director John Podesta, it has emerged that – far from appearing open in releasing 55,000 emails on personal accounts – her team knew more were still uncovered. 
In the run-up to the revelation that Clinton had made use of personal emails in her role as Secretary of State, instead of verified and secure government accounts, her team scrambled to limit the damage to her reputation by releasing emails in an effort to appear open and responsible. Her communications adviser Jennifer Palmieri wrote in an email: “Team — wanted to let you know that Cheryl is working with State to get agreement on release of the 55k pages of emails she have to State. The hope would be that we are able to say tonight to the press that we are working with State to get emails released soon.” 
“Not sure where those discussions will land, but hope is either State agrees to release on >> timely basis or we pledge to release them ourselves in ten days/week. Assume you all would agree this is right move?” 
In reply, her media adviser, former senior adviser to Barack Obama in both his 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the White House, Jim Margolis, wrote to John Podesta asking: “If there is a release of the 55K, are there others that are not being released?” To which Podesta replied: “Definitely.” The revelation shows how worried the Clinton team were of the inflammable nature of the email affair which has dogged her campaign for nearly a year.

25408,Thousands Protest Trump Immigration Order in London,"LONDON, United Kingdom  —   Thousands of people joined a protest against U. S President Donald Trump in London on Saturday, calling an end to his immigration order and the cancellation of his planned state visit later this year. [The demonstrators, who predominantly came from a variety of left wing groups, gathered outside the U. S embassy in Grosvenor Square at 11am before marching to Downing Street.  Protesters held placards reading, among other things, “Stop Trump’s Muslim Ban” “Silence Is Compliance” and “No to racism, no to Trump”. Organisers included the Stop the War Coalition, Stand Up to Racism, the Muslim Association of Britain, the Muslim Council of Britain and Friends of  .  This was the third demonstration in London since President Trump’s inauguration, after a similar demonstration Monday evening, and the London version of the   “Women’s March”. Kevin Courtney, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, told the crowd that every British teacher should be involved in the campaign against Trump. ” “We can fight Trump’s policies, we can fight that division,” he said.  Mr Trump is due to visit Britain later this year on a state visit. A petition to cancel that visit, to spare the Queen “embarrassment” has now reached around 1. 8 million signatures.  The protest came despite a federal judge in Washington State granting a nationwide emergency order blocking President Trump’s executive order restricting immigration, declaring it unconstitutional. The White House issued a statement saying it would file for an “emergency stay” for the order. The President also took to Twitter to say: “The opinion of this   judge, which essentially takes   away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!”",0

Since he has retired from Congress he has embarked on a number of strongly worded tirades against those he perceives to be manipulating American democracy. 
Via UsualRoutine 

Therefore it should not come as a surprise to anyone that Paul has a lot to say about the current presidential election. As well as calling Donald Trump and authoritarian and claiming that Hillary Clinton could have easily run on a Republican ticket, Paul has also made some sensational allegations about election rigging.
Scroll Down For Video Below The allegations were made in the course of Paul’s web show, called the Liberty Report which was focusing on the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to take a more active role in the election. Secretary Jeh Johnson said he was “considering whether elections should be classified as ‘critical infrastructure, ’ affording them the same kinds of enhanced protections that the banking system and the electrical grid receive.”
This move was prompted by the hacking of sensitive emails from members of the Democrat Party. While the government and the mass media have been quick to lay the blame on Russia they have yet to offer substantive evidence to support these claims. Nonetheless, the implication that a foreign government could substantially influence the American democratic process has opened up the possibility that managing the election should be a matter for the security services.
Paul said that the idea that Homeland Security could be charged with protecting the electoral process was frankly risible. He cited their previous history of incompetence and failed objectives. Moreover, he said that it was entirely possible that people within the Department of Homeland Security could use their new power to manipulate the electoral process and seize power for themselves. According to Paul, “They may have false flags and they may do a lot of things, but no matter how an emergency comes up, they’re going to make use of it. And the use of it isn’t to say ‘Hey, how are we going to protect the American people?’
Are they worrying, when they talk about doing something about rigged elections, [that] the votes are counted? No, they’re making sure that the votes aren’t counted and they’re irrelevant and the government has all this power.” This should not be seen as merely idle speculation, Paul warned his viewers, as there is already systemic election rigging in the United States. “The elections don’t matter. This is a ritual that we go through, ” he said. What really matters, according to Paul was some kind of hidden powerful cabal who were much more influential than the ‘will of the people.’
Despite all of this, Paul says that there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He said that if enough people became aware of the fractured nature of American democracy then there could be important changes in economic philosophy and the protection of civil liberties both at home and abroad. This kind of attitudinal shift could rob the ‘deep state’ of its power and mean that the American people would be safer and richer.

25414,Maryland Academics Propose Income-Based Per-Mile Driving Tax,"The Newspaper 
For academics at the University of Maryland (UMD), merely collecting a toll from drivers for every mile they drive is not enough. UMD College Park researchers Di Yang, Eirini Kastrouni and Lei Zhang insist in a recent academic paper that motorists should pay a proportionally higher tax that is based on their income. Published in the journal Transport Policy, the article argues that a new variable-rate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax could supplement transportation funds being rapidly depleted by increased spending on transit infrastructure. 
“On the revenue generation side, VMT fee policies can supplement the existing fuel tax revenues to mitigate the fiscal deficit,” the researchers wrote for the London School of Economics last week. “The three income-based VMT fees are all designed to double the revenue generated so that they are comparable with respect to their impacts on consumer surplus and travel behavior.” 
Currently, gasoline taxes at the state and federal level are collected primarily at the distributor level, which keeps the tax simple. The more one drives, the more one pays, with those choosing lighter and more fuel efficient vehicles spending less at the pump. Many politicians hate the gas tax because the public generally opposes hikes in fuel taxes. As a result, transportation officials have sought more indirect means of taxation that would make it easier to raise rates. The VMT has emerged as a popular solution in transportation circles, but opponents have objected that vehicle miles traveled taxes hit low-income drivers the hardest. The researchers suggest the solution is to raise more money for transit while simultaneously eliminating the fairness concern by imposing higher VMT taxes on drivers from high-income households. 
“Among the proposed fee structures, the policy with a fixed interval increase rate as people’s level of income improves is considered to be progressive overall,” the researchers explain. 
A ten cent per mile VMT tax would generate $44 billion nationwide over twenty years. The latest article is based on an analysis in Yang’s 2014 master’s thesis which calculated the impact of the fees using various economic and travel demand models. One model, for instance, would have the tax jump 50 percent at each income bracket. So a 10-cent-per mile rate for households earning less than $20,000 per year would rise to 15 cents up to the $20,000 to $40,000 per year bracket. From $40,000 to $60,000, the rate would be 23 cents, from $60,000 to $100,000 it would be 34 cents, and above $100,000 it would be 51 cents. As most drivers travel 12,000 miles per year, the low income tax would be $1200 compared to $6120 for the wealthy. 
At this rate, Yang calculates that the income-adjusted vehicle miles traveled tax would more than double the gas tax revenue, compared to the 57 percent increase a flat-rate VMT would generate. The paper presumes drivers facing a doubling of government fees would be more inclined to take the bus.",0

These people are prepared to kill themselves and they do it because they think it’s a shortcut to paradise  …     “Unless people have enough courage to take that on and try and convince young people that the Caliphate is not a better way of running society than a democracy they are going to be lured to these organisations. ” Whilst some say Islamic terror is largely driven by grievances such as “Islamophobia” “alienation” and Western foreign policy, Mr. Howells argues it is necessary to appreciate the importance of theological turmoil going on within Islam. “These guys are not just trying to kill unbelievers and Christians and so on. Their main enemy is another form of Islam,” he said, referring to the violent schism between Sunni and Shia Islam. Many other nations and ethnic groups have been affected by foreign interventions and discrimination, yet the vast majority of recent terror attacks have occurred in countries afflicted by Islamist insurgencies. According to the Global Terrorism Database, in 2015, “69% of all deaths due to terrorist attacks took place in five countries (Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen)”. Terrorists returning from these conflict zones present a real challenge to the UK. Between 700 and 1, 500 Brits have travelled to join Islamic State terrorists, and Mr. Howell said former jihadists should be a “real worry” for the security of the nation. “There’s going to be a significant proportion of those people who are determined to carry on the fight here. They’ve been trained in how to use guns and how to construct bombs,” he said. “They are going to have to be watched very carefully. But just to watch one person takes a large number of people and a lot of money. “How on earth you keep tabs on 400 or 500 people at any given time as well as those who never went to Syria but you judge are posing a threat is not easy. ”",0
25417,A&ampE Shelves a K.K.K. Documentary Series Over Cash Payments - The New York Times,"A documentary series that was set to take viewers inside the Ku Klux Klan has been canceled by AE after the network discovered that some of the show’s producers had made cash payments to participants on the show. The   series, “Escaping the KKK,” promised an   look at   Klan members and their families, but it had prompted wide outcry since news about the show came out last Sunday. For a network best known for shows like “Hoarders” and “Intervention,” the K. K. K. series represented a strikingly complicated and politically charged endeavor, and fell into a roiling national debate about the potential glamorization of racism and bigotry that has grown only louder since the presidential election. The show’s producers had tried to calm the backlash in recent days, changing the title of the series from “Generation KKK,” with its vaguely romantic undertones, to “Escaping the KKK: A Documentary Series Exposing Hate in America. ” They also announced a partnership with Color of Change, a civil rights group that had expressed concern about the show, to develop some of the program’s segments and to provide more context. The network defended the show, which it said would “expose and combat racism and hatred in all its forms. ” But in the end, AE had to back down without airing an episode after about a week of outcry. The series, which had been in the works for about a year and a half, was scheduled to debut in January. In a statement on Saturday, AE said the decision not to air the show was based on a revelation that   producers had given money to some of the participants in order to facilitate access. The company did not say how much the payments were or how they were paid, but did describe them as “nominal. ” It said it had previously assured the public, and groups such as Color of Change and the   League, that no payments were made to   members. “While we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content, these payments are a direct violation of AE’s policies and practices for a documentary,” the company wrote in a statement. A spokesman for the network said the production company This is Just a Test, or someone it had hired, had made payments to a hate group, which violated a company policy. The spokesman did not know if the company had a larger policy against paying subjects for documentary participation. The practice of paying subjects for interviews and access is frowned upon by many media outlets, including The New York Times. But it remains an ethical gray area that other organizations  —   particularly some American TV news programs, documentary series and reality shows  —   are willing to exploit. On its website, This is Just a Test, which AE said had originally pitched the series, does not bill itself as a journalism enterprise. It describes itself as a “premium content maker” for television series, films, commercials and branded content.",0
25420,Mother Nature Picketing God Outside Pearly Gates Over Labor Rights,"Monday, 7 November 2016 This gate is locked at all times. The consequences are quite severe. 
Pearly Gates, Heaven - Mother Nature tips back her raggedy leaf-crown in front of God's famous gates, refusing to go to arbitration over their on-going dispute regarding her wage package. The wand-waving Disastress has been very vocal over the last several years, saying that she is over-worked and under-paid. 
Today, she waves a picket sign instead of a wand, reading, 'Just Tellin' It Like It Is! ' which has become somewhat of a catch phrase for other workers who feel that they understand her plight. In the other hand she holds a bullhorn, using it frequently, to scream through the gates at her boss. 
Several people approaching have turned back, and gone the way they came from. But many have stayed to listen to her words (and because they have no place else to go.) Many of whom urge her on. ""For too long,"" she yells to the news cameras, ""I been stressed out by my over-bearing boss. He'll barge into my office anytime he goddamn pleases and yell, 'Hey, Hurricane! Caribbean! Now!' Well, fuck that shit! Its my lunch break, asshole! I been making disasters at his every whim like a crazy person! And this shit was never in my contract. God help me if he wakes up cranky... I mean, don't bother. Let me tell you, he don't know shit about making a good wildfire, let alone how tiring it is to just be whipping up a tornado in Oklahoma with one hand, and a typhoon in India with the other. I mean, can you imagine? And I ain't even seen a damn wage raise that keeps up with the cost of living. I haven't bought a new velvet gown in so long. And don't tell me to look in the thrift stores, they don't never have anything in my size. This shit needs to be hand-woven people. That costs money! 
So it appears Mother Nature is standing firm here on the picket line, saying she will not even make rain for the drought stricken African areas that so desperately need it. A political tact which is drawing some critics of its own. The U.N. is furious at her, looking up at the sky and pleading for rain on a daily basis. And there is a quiet buzz in the crowd that she is taking things too far. 
""I don't give a goddamn shit, all right! Mama needs her some major-medical insurance before those people can fill their leaky little buckets up at the river side, Ok!"" She yells out. Hey! California! Ya might wanna stop washing your cars! 
Sources close to the universally-known lawyer, Glorius Allred, say that the two have met, and that this case is likely heading to the Supreme -Supreme Court, but won't be heard until well after Venus has been replaced on the bench. Some speculating that Ruth Vader Ginsberg might be up for the nomination, which most say, would likely have a better outcome for Mother Nature. 
""Enjoy the mild winter, everybody!"" She parted with to Al Roker, into the NBC camera, heading off for her mid-morning coffee and bran muffin break... ( and dump the size of Texas!) Make Paul Blake's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

25427,An explanation for why the FBI re-opened Hillary's e-mails,"Jimstone.is 
October 31 2016 

Huma's husband, Anthony Weiner (which blows the whole Huma/Islam meme into the gutter; all we are seeing with this is the fact the ""Muslims"" running Saudi Arabia are crypto Jews) – ANYWAY , Hillary was so sure she'd never be called to account with her e-mails that she was careless enough to have them end up on Weiner's personal laptop in a file he titled ""life insurance"". 

Well, you know how the entire establishment is wrapped up in child sex and other similar crimes, and Weiner ended up getting his laptop seized by the NYPD in a kiddie porn/child sex investigation. When the NYPD went through the laptop, they found Hillary's e-mails in FULL UNADULTERATED PRISTINE FORM. They proved crimes of the highest order – at least 15 felonies found so far, with a majority of them related to treason and selling out the country. 

SO THE NYPD OPENED UP A CASE ON HILLARY. The FBI said, NO, WE'LL TAKE THAT – and that is the ONLY reason why these investigations got re-opened: because if the NYPD handled it, huge portions of the FBI would be sent to prison. Now the FBI is under pressure to actually do its job, because they know the NYPD knows. No matter what the outcome, the FBI gains zero (0) ZERO credibility points from this. 

So read my report DO NOT FORGIVE : it was BANG ON, they did this because they HAD TO, not because they had any intention at all of being good, and it really is time to drain the swamp. 

Now let's all sit and wait for the suicide of Preet Bharara , the U.S. Prosecuting Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the NYPD who pushed this into the light. He's now a target of the FBI, the DNC, the Clinton death machine and God knows what else. PREDICTION (and I do not make predictions): THE DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE NYPD WILL ""COMMIT SUICIDE"" WITHIN 5 DAYS. He's a walking dead man. 

The circle of crime in Washington DC is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it, there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart. Poking that monster in a way that hurts is something I do not believe anyone will survive; Preet might as well call himself a zombie. 

The NYPD TRUMPED the FBI! That is why they had to investigate Hillary! 

Well well, the NYPD is what busted the Hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on Weiner's laptop, and THAT is why the FBI was forced to investigate Hillary. They had no choice. NYPD TRUMPS FBI!!!

25428,Zakharchenko reveals names of Motorola assassins,"November 10, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  RusVesna - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


During an ongoing press conference in Donetsk, the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, revealed the names of two Ukrainian officials involved in the organization of the attack which killed Hero of the Republic Arsen Pavlov (Motorola).  
“I am ready to name those involved in the murder of Motorola. According to our intelligence, Vitaly Malikov, who advised sabotage and terrorist activity in Donbass, the head of the Donetsk region SBU, Akut, and a number of responsible employees and representatives of the SBU headquarters participated in preparing and committing this crime,” the head of the DPR stated. 
Zakharchenko added that the republic’s criminal investigators already have the full list of persons involved in the organization of this crime, but the DPR is not yet going to name all the names. In addition, the identity of the exact persons who committed the terrorist act are being determined. 
Zakharchenko emphasized: “I assure you that these names will be determined, that these people will be found and, at the request of the father of Motorola’s bodyguard, will be give these names to Abkhazia as well.” 

On October 16th, Motorola, the commander of the Sparta battalion and a colonel of the DPR army, was killed by an explosive device set up by Ukrainian saboteurs in the elevator in his apartment building. Motorola’s bodyguard was also killed. The authorities of the DPR have qualified the crime as a terrorist attack.

25429,Video: Doctors Who Discovered Cancer Enzymes In Vaccines All Found Murdered,"Share on Facebook Nagalese prevents vitamin D from being produced in the body. Not long ago, Neon Nettle reported on the epidemic of doctors being murdered, most of which were in Florida, U.S. The scientists all shared a common trait, they had all discovered that nagalase enzyme protein was being added to vaccines which were then administrated to humans. Nagalese is what prevents vitamin D from being produced in the body, which is the body's main defence to naturally kill cancer cells. According to Thebigriddle.com: Nagalase is a protein that's also created by all cancer cells. This protein is also found in very high concentrations in autistic children. And they're PUTTING it in our vaccines!! This prevents the body from utilizing the Vitamin D necessary to fight cancer and prevent autism. Nagalese disables the immune system. It's also known to cause Type 2 Diabetes. So basically…they weren't killing these doctors because they had found the cure to cancer or were successfully treating autism… they're killing them because these doctors had been researching and had the evidence that the vaccines they're injecting our precious children with are CAUSING our current cancer and autism crisis! And that it's obviously being done knowingly and on purpose! The Doctors they killed in FL had been collaborating and were getting ready to go public with the information. Depopulation 101..add poison to vaccines…make it law that all children must be injected to attend school. Slow kill methods. They think they're being fair with their “survival of the fittest” type mentality. Only the best genes survive? These people have no souls. Dr Ted Broer broke it on The Hagmann & Hagmann Report and it took them a whole hour just to get him on air because their 3 hour show was brought down and every line they tried to use kept disconnecting… and then their servers were brought down. They asked a bunch of people to pray against the attack and then finally got him on a secured line..and so a full hour into the show they were finally back on the air and connected to Dr. Broer and the first thing he said was “I am in no way suicidal.” He was super nervous holding onto this info… afraid he'd be taken out Hastings style before he got a chance to say it publicly. So listen to this short clip of him breaking the story. It's a 19 min clip but the most important info is heard within the first 10 min. It is definitely some of the most important news I've ever heard. And it needs to go viral. Thanks for taking the time to read this article.

According to a spring 2016 report released by the Older Women’s League , men in the top 1 percent live 15 years longer than those in the bottom 1 percent. The gap for women is 10 years. And it’s getting worse. As the league’s annual study, “ Aging in Community ,” notes, “The inequality of life spans between rich and poor has widened from 2001 to 2014.” 
The result? By the time folks reach age 75, 6.7 percent of men and 12.3 percent of women live below the poverty line: $11,880 for a single person and $16,020 for a household of two. Gender, of course, is a key variable: Women earn, on average, a lower annual income — typically caused by wage disparities as well as breaks in employment to rear children — resulting in smaller monthly Social Security checks. This is no small thing since a lower income impacts everything from access to health care to the ability to secure decent, affordable housing and nutritious food. 
Race also impacts income, causing many Black and Brown seniors to live in poverty. The federal Administration on Aging reports that in 2013 poverty among the elderly impacted 19.2 percent African Americans; 18.1 percent of Latino and Latinas; 14.7 percent of Asian Americans; and 7.8 percent of whites aged 65 or older. Indigenous seniors have it even worse. Although Indigenous people make up just .05 percent of those over 65 , a full 42 percent of tribal seniors are impoverished. 
Indeed, the collision between poverty and aging is a problem of startling magnitude. It’s also more complicated than it seems, thanks to the rapid aging of the US population. For one, since 1900, the percentage of Americans aged 65 or older has more than tripled. Two years ago, they numbered 46.2 million and made up 14.5 percent of the total population. Flash forward to 2040 and 21.7 percent will fall into that…",0

25437,Американский генерал признал проблемы со штурмом Мосула,"1 комментариев 4 поделились Фото: AP 
""Пока еще полного окружения Мосула нет. Но это и не обязательно, чтобы проводить наступление на город, чтобы его освободить от ИГ. У неприятеля есть пути входа и выхода, он ведет некоторую передислокацию бойцов, хотя мы не видим, что в город приходят или уходят из него большие подразделения"", - сказал Таунсенд на брифинге. 
При этом генерал вынужден был признать, что именно таким образом боевики, засевшие в Мосуле,получают и подкрепление, и боеприпасы. Более того, таким образом лидеры террористов имеют возможность покинуть город безнаказанными. 
Конечно, силы коалиции наносят по ним удары, но только тогда, когда видят самих боевиков или имеют точную о них информацию. Правда, наученные предыдущим опытом боев с коалицией, теперь боевики все это делают максимально скрытно: не передвигаются по местности под развевающимися флагами и в открытых автомобилях. 
Помимо этого, боевики прибегают к новой тактике маскировки: для того, чтобы смешаться с гражданским населением, некоторые из них просто сбривают бороды и переодеваются в другую одежду. Об этом рассказали жители Мосула. 
США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. В ночь на 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город. 
Однако это наступление может обернуться катастрофой на Ближнем Востоке. Об этом заявил, к примеру, кандидат в президенты США Дональд Трамп. Или вот мнение отставного полковника США Дэниэла Дэвиса, которое он изложил в статье, опубликованной в The National Interest : Америке и силам коалиции стоит поторопиться с проведением операции в Мосуле, в противном случае террористы могут разорвать этот альянс в клочья. 
""Чем дольше продержится ИГ и чем больший урон нанесет коалиции, тем более вероятно, что религиозные и политические различия между освободительными силами будут проявляться все сильнее"", - пишет Дэвис. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила военного эксперта Бориса Подопригору. 
В последние несколько месяцев официального пребывания американского президента в Белом доме, им захотелось организовать такой политический спектакль на тему американской приверженности в борьбе с терроризмом. Я так это вижу. 
Что из этого получится, мне сказать сложно. Самое плохое, что я ожидаю, это новое столкновение по линии сунниты-шииты. Вот в чем самая большая проблема. 
Если начнется резня, а такое исключать нельзя, то мало никому не покажется, хотя бы потому, что и Иран, и Саудовская Аравия в стороне от этого конфликта не будут. Можно лишь пожалеть, что в американском практическом востоковедении немного людей, которые задумываются о последствиях межрелигиозного столкновения.

25438,New MH370 analysis suggests no one at controls during crash,"  Associated Press — Nov 2, 2016 Boeing 777. Click to enlarge 
A FRESH analysis of the final moments of doomed Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 suggests no one was controlling the plane when it plunged into the ocean, according to a report released by investigators. 
As experts hunting for the aircraft gathered in Australia’s capital to discuss the fading search effort , a technical report released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau , which leads the search, seems to support the theory investigators have long favoured: that no one was at the controls of the Boeing 777 when it ran out of fuel and dived at high speed into a remote patch of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia in 2014. #MH370 Report: Search and debris examination update . https://t.co/BpauQTcsRm 
— ATSB (@atsbinfo) November 1, 2016 
It comes as the ABC reports the search for MH370 will be extended north, beyond the 120,000-square kilometre search zone in the Southern Indian Ocean. 
It’s believed the search will move on to new areas next year at an estimated cost of $30 million. 
In recent months, critics have increasingly been pushing the alternate theory that someone was still controlling the plane at the end of its flight . If that was the case, the aircraft could have glided much farther, tripling in size the possible area where it could have crashed and further complicating the already hugely complex effort to find it. 
But Wednesday’s report shows that the latest analysis of satellite data is consistent with the plane being in a “high and increasing rate of descent” in its final moments. The report also said an analysis of a wing flap that washed ashore in Tanzania indicates the flap was likely not deployed when it broke off the plane. 
A pilot would typically extend the flaps during a controlled ditching. 
The report also revealed the falling pattern of the aircraft, detailing how it descended in a number of different directions. 
“In an electrical configuration where the loss of engine power from one engine resulted in the loss of autopilot (AP), the aircraft descended in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions.” 
Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations, has previously said that if the flap was not deployed, it would almost certainly rule out the theory that the plane entered the water in a controlled ditch and would effectively validate that searchers are looking in the right place for the wreckage . 
“(It) means the aircraft wasn’t configured for a landing or a ditching — you can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone was in control,” Foley told reporters in Canberra. 
“You can never be 100 per cent. We are very reluctant to express absolute certainty.”",0
25439,Bernie Sanders: Trump Won Because Democrats Are Out of Touch - Breitbart,"Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said the Democrats lost to   Donald Trump because they are out of touch with America. [“I happen to believe that the Democratic Party has been not doing a good job in terms of communicating with people in cities, in towns and in rural America, all over this country,” Sanders said in an interview on NPR’s Morning Edition.  The Vermont senator, who ran for president on the Democratic ticket and then switched back to Independent after losing the primary to defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, added, “Look, you can’t simply go around to wealthy people’s homes raising money and expect to win elections. You’ve got to go out and mix it up and be with ordinary people. ” Sanders and Trump both ran on a platform that pushed against the political establishment, and both were successful at tapping into the   base. However, it was arguably Clinton’s decision to ignore her husband’s advice that contributed most to her loss in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton suggested that Hillary court   white men, a demographic that has long been ignored by the Democratic Party. Sanders told NPR that Trump has a choice: “Either he can have the courage and get up in front of the American people, or do it through a Tweet, and say, ‘You know what? Hey, I was just kidding. I was really lying. ’” Or, he suggested, Trump can tell his fellow Republicans that “the right thing to do” is stop wasting their time on legislation that cuts programs. “And I look forward to Trump telling the American people that that is what he intends to do,” Sanders said. It is unlikely Trump will take up either of Sanders’ suggestions. Sanders and other Democratic leaders have called for a “Day of Action” on January 15  —   ahead of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day  —   “to vigorously oppose the Republican plan to end Medicare as we know it and throw our health care system into chaos,” according to a December 28 letter addressed to colleagues and signed by Sanders, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer ( ) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ). The letter adds, “Millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump after he promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He must be held to his promises and should veto any legislation which cuts these vital and necessary health programs. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz",0
25440,"Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash","Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash Peter Olsen-Phillips, Chronicle of Higher Education, November 7, 2016 
It’s no secret that campaign contributions from higher education have favored Democratic candidates for years. When it comes to the current presidential race, however, data show that the gap between left and right has grown from a rift into a chasm. 
A Chronicle analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Donald Trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, drew from higher-education professionals over comparable time periods. 
Across higher education, donations in congressional and Senate races showed a ratio of Democratic to Republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidential-campaign cycles. But support for Mr. Trump stood at less than 8 percent of what Senator McCain raised from higher-ed professionals, and around 4 percent of the donations that Mr. Romney pulled in over the same time period, once the figures were adjusted for inflation. 
As of June 30, faculty members and others who work in higher education had donated $76,668 to Mr. Trump’s campaign committee and to support “super PACs”–independent committees that can raise and spend unlimited funds. By comparison, people working in academe had given $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton. Those figures account for donations of at least $200 that the Center for Responsive Politics has determined come from people associated with higher education. They are the most-recent figures available.

Thomas Halpin for the prosecution told the court: “The investigation came alive during the search of a laptop in another terrorist investigation and the communication between the defendant and Abdirahman Hassan transpired. “He is a Kenyan man who is currently in custody in Kenya awaiting trial for terrorist offences. In essence the communication between both men was that the defendant expressed a desire to go to Syria and fight jihad. ” The court heard extracts from alleged online chat logs, which claim Mr. Faqey wanted to obtain automatic weapons and commit a terrorist attack on Jewish people in north London. One message allegedly said: “It could have been better if AK47, M16 and BKM can be found.

25443,Nuclear Option: The Speech-Democrats Reveal Contempt for Military During Trump Address - Breitbart,"It’s not like they leave much room for doubt about how much contempt they hold for military service and the immeasurable sacrifice that comes with it. [Two of the Democratic Party’s last three nominees for president voted to send our troops to die and be maimed in a war they later determined was not worth it. For both John Kerry in 2004 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, that change of heart came just as soon as it became politically advantageous for them to cut and run.  President Obama, meanwhile, built his entire political career around promises to end the war in Iraq and withdraw all of our troops from harm’s way. Of course, he completely failed to deliver on that promise  —   but not before managing to give up so much   territory won by the blood and guts of our brave men and women. Thanks, Obama. Now comes the fearless widow Carryn Owens, whose Navy Seal husband was the first American casualty under President Trump as   . The   standing ovation she braved during Mr. Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress this week surely made her husband just as proud of her as the entire nation is of him. Hers were certainly tears of pain and prayers of agony. But they were also tears of fortitude. And prayers of an enduring spirit. Carryn Owens, and her husband, Ryan, are the absolute best America has to offer. To send people like them into war for anything short of a mission absolutely worth it is a desecration of their sacrifices and a total dereliction of duty. Any politician who makes that mistake should be hounded from public office forever. They should be forced to spend the rest of their lives cleaning bed pans in VA hospitals  —   except that service is a calling too noble for such low, selfish and thoughtless vermin. You would think that someone as beautiful and strong and brave as Carryn Owens would be something above partisan hackery. Wrong. Leftwing television gasbags pounced on the widow. The chronically unfunny HBO yapper Bill Maher called the moment that America wept with Carryn Owens “gross” and “shameful. ” “I wish she hadn’t allowed herself to be used as his prop like that. ” Get that? Sliming Donald Trump is not enough for this singular dirt bag. He has to slime her to and treat her like some mindless dolt incapable of her own  . The incurable arrogance and stupidity of these people know no bounds. Anyway, isn’t it the Democrat Party that will  —   literally  —   politicize anything? President Obama spent his entire career as president looking for ways to toss hand grenades into America soldiers’ tents. He commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning (nee Bradley) after the soldier committed espionage that imperiled the lives of countless U. S. troops. Then there was the time he surrendered five murderous terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who deserted his squad in Afghanistan. Every bit of it emanated from Mr. Obama’s deep contempt for military families and the sacrifices they make to keep America safe. Perhaps the most contemptible stunt Democrats ever pulled to denigrate the military in hopes of scoring political points was trotting out the Gold Star parents of Capt. Humayun Khan at last summer’s Democratic convention. It had nothing to do with the ultimate sacrifice Capt. Khan paid at a checkpoint in Iraq in 2004. Rather, it was all part of their grand scheme of using racial and religious profiling to goose support among a flagging Democratic electorate. One of the sweetest things about this last election was that for the first time in many years such calculating dishonesty did not pay off in America politics. But, at this rate, Democrats face many more years of losing elections before they learn this lesson. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes. com follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.",0

С поражением Хиллари Клинтон какая-то часть её фанатов потеряла шанс на выполнение одного из пунктов обещаний претендентки — долгожданное разоблачение некоторых секретов США. 
Предвыборная гонка закончилась весьма печально для ожидавших победы госпожи Клинтон: теперь в кресло следующего президента США усядется Дональд Трамп. Неожиданный результат выборов породил серьёзные переживания у части электората, голосовавшего за неё. Нет, речь не о протестах и петициях! Тихо грустят потерявшие давно лелеемую надежду — ни за что не догадаетесь, кто, и на что! 
По большому счету, грядущее разоблачение государственных тайн, о котором дамочка многажды твердила в своих предвыборных обязательствах, никак не связано с животрепещущими вопросами, волновавшими американцев и достаточную часть мирового сообщества! Нашлась ниша, не охваченная её противником, чьи интересы направлены, в основном, на благополучие США. Ну а Хилари в этом отношении предполагала, что смотреть надо дальше, за пределы Земли. 
Немалую роль в этих обещаниях сыграл председатель её избирательной комиссии Джон Подеста, бывший консультантом при Обаме и даже главой штаба Белого дома при супруге Хиллари — Билле Клинтоне. Подеста уже давненько публично выступает за раскрытие секретов США по части НЛО. 
Вот и Клинтон обязалась разоблачить тайны Соединённых Штатов, якобы напрямую связанные с инопланетными цивилизациями, а точнее, с НЛО и пришельцами, посещавшими Землю. Хотела ли она сдержать свои предвыборные обещания, вопрос достаточно праздный, поскольку сослагательного наклонения история даже в Америке не имеет. 
Что касается Трампа, то он наверняка не считает значительную долю населения своей страны полными недоумками, непроходимыми тупицами или падкими на сенсации малообразованными любителями «непознанного». Думается, у нового президента вряд ли будет время и желание углубляться в дебри уфологии, тем более что не известно ни о каких его интересах в этом направлении, не говоря уж о личном стремлении вплотную заняться общением с инопланетянами.",0

Fue encontrado en una pieza que había sido robada en 2012 de una cueva del desierto de Judea. Ammar Awad Reuters Síguenos en Facebook 
Procedente del período del Primer Templo, hace unos 2.700 años, la Autoridad de Antigüedades de Israel (IAA, por su sigla en inglés) presentó el papiro en el que aparece la mención en hebreo de la ciudad de Jerusalén más antigua de la que se tenga noticia. El documento fue recuperado en el 2012, cuando un grupo de ladrones intentaba venderlo, detalló ' The Times of Israel '. 
Eitan Klein, de la IAA, explicó que el papiro, que se cree que había sido sustraído de una cueva en el desierto de Judea, es una ""evidencia"" de la existencia de una ""administración organizada en el Reino de Judá"", que ""destaca la centralidad de Jerusalén como capital del reino en la segunda mitad del siglo VII a.C."" 
Los especialistas agregaron que el texto escrito en dos líneas en el papiro de 2,5 por 11 centímetros, refiere al pago de impuestos o al traslado de mercancías. ""De la criada del rey, de Naarat, jarras de vino, a Jerusalén"", dice la inscripción que menciona a la ciudad con su antiguo nombre en hebreo: Yerushalima. Ammar Awad Reuters 
Por su parte, Amir Gador, también de la IAA, reiteró que el papiro era procedente de una cueva en Nahal Hever, en el desierto de Judea, cercano al mar Muerto, región que, por sus características, permite la preservación de este tipo de fragmentos durante miles de años. 
En tanto, 14 integrantes de la organización que había robado el papiro fueron detenidos y condenados a 18 años de cárcel. Reconocimiento de Jerusalén 
El ministro de Cultura y Deporte de Israel, Miri Regev, afirmó que el descubrimiento del papiro en el que se cita a Jerusalén ""supone una clara prueba"" de que la ciudad ""fue y seguirá siendo la capital eterna del pueblo judío"". 
Su afirmación responde a la postura de la UNESCO , que había rechazado los vínculos entre la ciudad y el judaísmo, a la vez que describió al Monte del Templo de Jerusalén como un lugar sagrado exclusivamente para el islam. ",0

Time to Say Goodbye! 
Last nights horrific devastating Presidential election results have sparked a fire that Trump’s Racist USA will NOT be able to put out! The 2019 #Calexit Independence Referendum movement has has caught fire! 
In the Spring of 2019, Californians will go to the polls in a historic vote to decide by referendum if California should exit the Union, a #Calexit vote. 
You will have this historic opportunity because the Yes California Independence Campaign will qualify a citizen’s initiative for the 2018 ballot that if passed would call for a special election for Californians to vote for or against the independence of California from the United States. Sign Up Now To Support Calexit 2019 >>> 
This is a very important question. It is the responsibility of this campaign to explain what a yes vote will mean for you, your family, your community, our state, our country, and our world. We have designed this website to answer many of these questions and look to you to ask more. 
“As the sixth largest economy in the world, California is more economically powerful than France and has a population larger than Poland. Point by point, California compares and competes with countries, not just the 49 other states.” 
In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children. 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California’s infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. 
However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law. 
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the international community with their “Brexit” vote. Our “Calexit” referendum is about California joining the international community. You have a big decision to make. Related Posts:",0
25459,Wall Street Journal: Republicans Rode Waves of Populism Until They Crashed the Party | Politics,"(Before It's News)
This is a good article :
“When Donald Trump rode down an escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential campaign in June 2015, he began galvanizing a populist version of the Republican Party.
But he didn’t create it.
The GOP that carried Mr. Trump to the presidential nomination was formed by waves of new voters who washed onto Republican shores in the last four decades: George Wallace Southerners, Ronald Reagan Democrats, Pat Buchanan pitchfork populists and tea-party foot soldiers.
The Republican establishment was happy to have the votes of these newcomers, many from America’s working class, and accommodated their cultural preferences on social issues from guns to abortion to gay marriage. What the establishment didn’t do was adjust the GOP’s economic approach to match the populist impulses—or even seem to consider such a shift necessary. …”
Rich Lowry put it well here :
“Our basic argument about Trump is simple and unassailable: He is a populist, not a conservative. Conservatism has always had a populist element, but it has been tethered to conservatism’s animating causes of liberty, limited government and the Constitution. Trump inveighs against elites and tramples on political pieties, but these causes are afterthoughts to him, at best.”
Ross Douthat put it better here:
“Sometimes this interdependency has worked out well. At its peaks of political success, the conservative intelligentsia has channeled and directed populism, responding to grass-roots passions without being ruled by them.”
The goal of the conservative intelligentsia has always been to CUCK the populist vote so that all of its anger and energy can be “tethered” or “channeled” into advancing the conservative agenda (read: classical liberal agenda) of the “governing wing” of the Republican Party. The role of populist voters in the GOP is to show up on election day and vote for a handpicked establishment candidate like Mitt Romney or ¡Jeb!
In this way, the conservatives can pass new free-trade deals for their corporate backers in the US Chamber of Commerce, start massive new destructive, unending wars in the Middle East, and keep the border wide open so that an endless influx of Third World cheap labor can further enrich the plutocracy. They figured all those yokels would just keep voting for them indefinitely because Democrats want to abort babies and seize guns.
Give them lip service! Give them token gestures! Give them round after round of failure theater! You know, it kind of worked too until their whole signaling structure broke down. That’s what happens when an elite loses its legitimacy. To borrow an analogy, the falcon doesn’t respond to the Falconer anymore and the elite falls.

25463,"Poll: After Brexit, Majority of Britons Would Vote To Leave the Eurovision Song Contest Too","A series of opinion polls have found the majority of Brits if given the chance to vote on the matter, would choose to leave the Eurovision song contest. [A new YouGov poll showed that 56 percent would be in favour of leaving and 44 percent in favour of staying, excluding those who did not know or would not vote. At 56 per cent, even more Brits would leave Eurovision than voted to leave the European Union in 2016.  The poll follows another reported by Pink News in early May, which found 53. 6 per cent of Brits wanted to leave Eurovision. Those answering that poll also gave their reasons for wanting out, with 63 per cent saying the competition was a “big waste of money” while 26 per cent said it was embarrassing. The annual talent contest fought between nations across Europe, Asia, and Oceania has been broadcast by the European Broadcast Union since 1956. While the result of the poll over the future of Britain’s involvement in Eurovision may seem surprising given it gets reasonable viewing figures, the high numbers of those wishing to leave may represent disappointment among some that a Eurovision exit didn’t automatically accompany Brexit. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, when asked what the worst argument in favour of Brexit he’d heard was, told the House of Commons that it was voting to leave the European Union would get Britain out of the song contest too. Rubbishing the suggestion, he said: “Not only would that be incredibly sad but given that Israel and Azerbaijan and anyone anywhere near Europe seems to be able to enter  —   and Australia  —   then I think we’re pretty safe from that one”. Another explanation for Britons wanting to cut ties with the musical competition could be a lack of faith in the processes behind selecting a winner. A significant source of controversy in 2014 was the allocation of British votes. Viewers at home are able to cast votes for their favourite acts by telephone, the figures for which are balanced against a panel of “experts” appointed by the BBC who also rate their favourite acts. After the 2014 competition, it was revealed the runaway favourite among the British public was the Polish entry, which featured buxom milkmaids in traditional national costume  —   but this was the least favourite of the expert judges, who overruled the British public, leading the nation to officially give it zero points. In contrast to the somewhat sexually suggestive favourite act of the British people in that year, the winning act was by Austria’s Conchita Wurst, a musical drag act. Viewing figures of the competition in the United Kingdom the following year collapsed to a   low, and have yet to fully recover. Watch: Poland’s 2014 Eurovision entry,   ",0

25465,The Nuclear Option: Comeygate Latest Fake News Hysteria for Trump/Russia Conspiracists - Breitbart,"Every time the Washington political press freaks out and goes into full panic mode against President Trump, the blockbuster,   story always unfolds the same way. [First, the news starts leaking or breaking. Newsrooms from the Potomac to the Hudson become seized and fixated on every morsel of the delicious story. News flashes zing around the internet.  Then it hits cable television and the press starts slinging the most salacious and scandalous accusations they can whip up, charging the president with the highest crimes imaginable. Reporters and Democrats alike  —   not to repeat myself  —   are actually now speculating about whether Mr. Trump will survive the certain impeachment hearings to come. But then, as the heavy breathing subsides and the adrenaline rush gives way to factual, concrete reporting, the most damning charges fall away. Turns out Mr. Trump is a germaphobe and wasn’t in that Russian hotel room. The bust of Martin Luther King is still in the Oval Office. He didn’t abandon conservatives by naming his sister to the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump’s Tower  —   and people involved in his campaign  —   were, in fact, surveilled. Slowly, agonizingly, Truth becomes very inconvenient for all these people predicting Mr. Trump’s certain demise. In the end, they are all left clinging to the smallest Styrofoam shard of their original story, bobbing in the harsh sea of Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome. The last remaining wastrels pontificating about the “scandal” formerly larger than Watergate are left with just one flimsy accusation. “Well, he could have handled it better,” they sniff. “He didn’t follow Washington political protocol. ” Are you freaking kidding me? It all starts with charges of high crimes and misdemeanors  —   impeachment imminent  —   and when it all turns out to be fake news these people walk away grumbling about how Mr. Trump could have handled it better? Just look at this latest “Watergate” scandal. The upshot is that Mr. Trump finally fired a man who every single person in all of Washington, except perhaps James B. Comey’s wife, has said at one time or another in the past year should have been fired. Why was he fired? For all the reasons every single person in Washington has stated at one point or another during the past year. But if you are among the legions around here suffering from Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome, it is always much more sinister. Russia! The FBI was closing in on Donald Trump’s sordid connections to the Russians! (Minus the laughably debunked Moscow hotel room scandal that was one of Mr. Trump’s previous “Watergate” scandals.) The FBI had just asked for more money to pursue the   connection, we were breathlessly told. Subpoenas were just being issued to known associates of known associates of President Trump! So incensed by the lies of the scandal’s   it was reported, that a top official in the Justice Department was threatening to quit in protest rather than carry on working for such a criminal in the White House. And then inconvenient reality unfolds again. One by one, each of these blockbusters came under clouds of scrutiny. Nobody quits in protest. By Thursday morning, the whole scandal had substantially come unraveled. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, said he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, had recently met with Mr. Comey and came away with the clear impression that, in fact, Mr. Trump is not a target of any investigation by the FBI. “Sen. Feinstein and I heard nothing that contradicted the president’s statement,” he said. And in a stunning display of nonpartisanship, Mrs. Feinstein agreed. Well, OK.

The suspect in a SWAT standoff on Indianapolis’ far northeast side Monday afternoon has been connected to recent shootings at IMPD headquarters and the September murder of an 82-year-old Zionsville man. 
Damoine Wilcoxson surrendered peacefully around 4:15 p.m. after a hours-long standoff with IMPD at an apartment complex near Shadeland Ave. & Mill View Dr. Damoine Wilcoxson 
Wilcoxson was holding his 6-month-old son inside the apartment during the standoff. The boy’s grandmother stood across the street during the ordeal, waiting alongside everyone else and hoping he would be okay. 
{snip} 
Wilcoxson was armed during the standoff and police say he fired at officers through the door. No one was injured and officers did not return fire due to concerns for the child. 
{snip} 
Prosecutors say Wilcoxson faces a murder charge for the shooting death of John Clements less than half a mile from Zionsville High School on Sept. 28 . It was the first murder Zionsville has seen in 20 years. 
{snip} 
According to court documents, investigators believe Wilcoxson is also related to the IMPD headquarters shootings that occurred on October 4 and October 13. Detectives found handwritten notes demanding $100,000 and threats including “white must die” near the shell casings that were connected with the Oct. 4 shooting at IMPD Northwest District headquarters. Similar notes were found near the shell casings discovered after the Oct. 13 shooting at IMPD North District headquarters. 
“At least in one of those shootings, we believe that he intentionally targeted two police officers inside,” IMPD Chief Troy Riggs said, “and we’re going to be requesting attempted murder charges.” 
He allegedly fired almost 50 rounds at those police stations earlier this month. No officers were hurt, but he allegedly left a note at the crime scene threatening more shootings if he didn’t get $100,000. 
Detectives discovered that the shell casings from both IMPD shootings were a match. A DNA sample from one of the notes and a shell casing matched Wilcoxson’s profile. 
Court papers say forensic evidence links his gun to all those cases, but his stepfather says, “No, no, no, he’s not.” 
The stepfather doesn’t believe Damoine is connected to those crimes. 
His aunt, Detra Boyd, said, “He had a moment. That’s all.”

FBI undercover agents friended him on Facebook during the probe into the police station attacks and the Zionsville murder. According to court documents, they found anti-white remarks and posts like “Kill mankind. No one should survive. We all live in lies,” plus “eye-4-eye, tooth for tooth, head for head, life for life.”

Wilcoxson has a long criminal history that includes run-ins with police since he was 14 years old.

25470,Scientists Fascinated By Lake Under The Sea: Those Who Enter Never Come Out [Watch],"This underwater lake is actually helping scientists deal with a much bigger mystery. Credit: EVNautilus 
It may seem impossible, but scientists have discovered what can only be deemed as a lake under the sea. Dubbed the “Jacuzzi of Despair,” the brine-filled pool is deadly for the majority of creatures that dare enter it but is proving to be highly informational for those that are studying it. 
Located in the Gulf of Mexico, the lake rises about 12 feet off of the ocean floor and is four to five times saltier than the surrounding ocean. It’s also twice as warm, rich with methane, which is what makes it bubble like a jacuzzi, and is dense with hydrogen sulfide. This makes it incompatible with the sea water and a completely separate entity. 
Dr. Erik Cordes, associate professor of biology at Temple University in Philadelphia who discovered the pool with several colleagues, told Seeker, 
“It was one of the most amazing things in the deep sea. You go down into the bottom of the ocean and you are looking at a lake or a river flowing. It feels like you are not on this world.” 
Since the conditions of the pool are so foreign to humans and most of the creatures living under the sea, it’s allowing scientists to get a glimpse of what life might be like in extreme circumstances. What started as an interesting lake in the middle of the ocean has now become the heart of experimentation for one of the most mysterious subjects known to man: space. Dr. Cordes said, 
“There’s a lot of people looking at these extreme habitats on Earth as models for what we might discover when we go to other planets.The technology development in the deep sea is definitely going to be applied to the worlds beyond our own.” 
What makes the pool even more unique is that it has a lively ecosystem that has evolved throughout the centuries to include more species. While larger animals, such as deep-sea crabs, die as soon as they enter the pool, other creatures have adapted to the atmosphere of the water and even thrive on it. Giant mussels formed symbiotic bacteria in their gills to feed off of the hydrogen sulfide and methane gas from the pool and specially adapted shrimp and tube worms were able to survive the harsh conditions. Any other animals that entered were immediately killed, pickled by the salt, and preserved forever. 
Watch the video below to see the beautiful lake for yourself and the creatures who did and did not survive the conditions.

25471,Cancela un atentado en un avión porque le pasan a primera clase por error y cambia de idea sobre Occidente,"Cancela un atentado en un avión porque le pasan a primera clase por error y cambia de idea sobre Occidente ""ESTO ES OTRA COSA"", HA DICHO AL VER SU ASIENTO Yihad 
Tras cambiar radicalmente de opinión sobre los “cerdos occidentales”, un terrorista islámico ha decidido cancelar el atentado en un avión que tenía planeado para esta misma mañana después de que un error en la asignación de asientos le haya permitido viajar en clase “Business” y disfrutar de un asiento de lujo y aperitivos gratuitos, según han informado fuentes de la aerolínea. “Era una pena desperdiciar todas esas cosas gratis por la yihad”, ha explicado el terrorista suicida. 
“Han venido esas mujeres inmorales y me han dicho que pasara a primera clase y he pensado ‘bueno, ahí también puedo explotar en pleno vuelo’”, explica. Tras su experiencia en “Business”, ha decidido dejar que el avión aterrice plácidamente en su destino. “Hay cosas buenas en Occidente y algunos infieles son muy serviciales cuando vas en primera”. 
El terrorista se habría levantado en dirección a la cabina del avión con la idea de hacerse con el control del aparato cuando las azafatas han animado al pasaje de primera clase a sentarse para recibir la cena. “Pensé en dejar la yihad para después de la cena, ya que era gratis, pero luego sirvieron bebidas y más tarde una perra infiel me arropó para echar la siesta”, explica. 
“Luego me puse a ver ‘Señor y señora Smith’ y pensé que Occidente no está tan mal”, admite. 
El terrorista llevaba más de siete años planeando un atentado suicida que hubiera acabado con la vida de más de 300 personas y era una pieza clave para la propaganda de su causa. “He pedido cacahuetes hasta diez veces y me los han traído sin preguntar”, se defiende. 
Según dice, la amabilidad de las “mujeres perras infieles” que hacían de auxiliares de vuelo le ha animado incluso a probar el alcohol. “Era gratis, está bueno”, dice. 
El de esta mañana es el segundo atentado que el terrorista cancela en el último momento. Según explica, hace tres años llegó a la cola de embarque de un vuelo y se dio cuenta de que todos y cada uno de los pasajeros restantes eran árabes, aunque no dijo nada “para no parecer racista”. “Todos habíamos tenido la misma idea y estábamos callados haciendo cola hasta que uno se empezó a reír”, explica con nostalgia. 
Según ha sabido la prensa, el terrorista debe regresar ahora a su aeropuerto de origen y la compañía que ha elegido es Ryanair.",0

[A cellphone video of the incident shows Gavin Cortina of St. Louis being bullied physically and verbally by his peers for expressing his political beliefs on a hat Wednesday, the Daily Mail reports.  “You want to build a wall?” one student yells in the clip. “You want to build a f —  king wall?” Things escalated quickly after that, according to Gavin. “At one point, he just got so frustrated he pushed me,” the   told KMOV. “And then he kept hitting me and backing me up by the window of the bus, and so I just had to push him out. ” Even though Gavin was the one being attacked, the Parkway School District suspended him. His mother, Christina, is outraged at the school and is concerned about what will happen if he wears the hat again. “As a parent it’s so unsettling,” she said. “I feel like my son was made an example of, it was a tricky situation —  it was politically charged. ” A spokesperson for the Parkway School District said they investigated the fight and that all students involved have faced “consequences. ” At least one student was suspended, according to KMOV.

25477,"Consultant tied to Trump super PAC promoted ‘voter suppression’ against black, female voters","Consultant tied to Trump super PAC promoted ‘voter suppression’ against black, female voters Published time: 27 Oct, 2016 04:10 Get short URL © Great America PAC / Facebook Donald Trump may call the 2016 election “rigged,” but a consultant connected to the Great America PAC, a pro-Trump super PAC, told reporters that the group has a suppression campaign in the works, believing them to be representatives of a potential donor. Trends US Elections 2016 
Political consultant Jesse Benton is once again in hot water. After journalists from The Telegraph introduced themselves to the former Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) aide as lawyers representing a potential Trump donor who was also a Chinese national, Benton proceeded to not only tell them how to donate to Trump’s campaign despite it being against federal election law, but also discussed attempts to suppress votes in Cleveland, Ohio. 
This isn’t Benton’s first time engaging in politically and legally questionable behavior. In May, he had to take a step back from his role at the Great America PAC after pleading guilty to buying an endorsement for presidential candidate Ron Paul in 2012, during his time as campaign manager. Benton was sentenced to two years of probation. Quid pro woah: Documents link Wisconsin governor to dark money https://t.co/oqoGlhxLSc pic.twitter.com/KygHsCgYP7 — RT America (@RT_America) September 15, 2016 
The undercover reporters first contacted the PAC’s co-chairman, Eric Beach, who was filmed telling them that their Chinese client would be “ remembered ” if Trump becomes president, The Telegraph reported . 
Beach proceeded to refer them over to Benton, claiming he was a consultant. When they met with Benton, he discussed the Trump campaign’s plans in the swing state of Ohio. Referring to Hillary Clinton’s support in Ohio, he said: “ In Cleveland, if we can...turn her to regular turnout levels, she's gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area – that's a dead heat. ” 
“ So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away, ” he explained. 
When it came to the issue of how the Trump campaign would be able to accept money from a Chinese national without arousing suspicion, Benton explained that he would channel the cash through a dark money tunnel. 
Super PACs make use of non-profit organizations to collect money from donors because 501(c)4 nonprofit groups are allowed to donate funds to political campaigns without disclosing who their donors are. Benton said he could accept the offered $2 million contribution from the non-existent Chinese donor by having the money sent to his company, which would then pass it on to one or two more non-profits.

The Great America PAC has tried to distance itself from Benton. Dan Backer, a lawyer for Great America, told The New York Times that “ I think it’s pretty clear that someone who used to work for the organization decided to leverage that former relationship for his own purposes. ” 
Backer suggested that Benton had exaggerated his role in the PAC, telling The Telegraph that Benton was engaging in “ puffery and self-promotion. ” 
Benton has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the reporters were brought to him as a “ business referral ” from Beach and that the clip was actually a part of a “ public affairs contract, ” The Telegraph reported. 
The Trump campaign claims to have severed ties with the PAC, releasing a statement saying it “ publicly disavowed this group back in April. This is public via Federal Election Commission filings. ” 
However, it was just a month ago that Trump’s son Eric and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani spoke at a Great America PAC fundraiser, Raw Story reported .",0
25478,"Twitter Reinstates Richard Spencer, White Nationalist Leader - The New York Times","After less than a month in exile, the white nationalist leader Richard B. Spencer is back on Twitter. The social network reinstated Mr. Spencer’s personal account on Saturday, less than four weeks after suspending it and others he created for violating rules against making multiple accounts with overlapping uses. “Please select one account for restoration the others will remain suspended,” the company told Mr. Spencer last week, according to an email that was obtained by BuzzFeed. The account was suspended on Nov. 15, and a spokesman for Twitter said in an email that it first contacted Mr. Spencer three days later, on Nov. 18, and again last week. Mr. Spencer, a leader of the     a   fringe movement that embraces white nationalism, racist,   and   positions, celebrated his return on Saturday night by writing “I’m back,” accompanied by a clip of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the “Terminator” movie franchise. Twitter and other social networks have found themselves at the center of a debate over where and how to draw the line between free speech and harassment. While Mr. Spencer’s suspension was due to a violation of the multiple accounts policy, it occurred as Twitter began a broader crackdown on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence, according to The Associated Press. Over the summer, in a move that seemed to signal a new approach to abuse, it suspended the account of Milo Yiannopoulos, a writer who had consistently violated its terms of service and led a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Mr. Yiannopoulos has not returned to the social network. When Mr. Spencer was suspended, he told The A. P. he had no plans to rejoin Twitter unless he got an apology. The company told BuzzFeed on Sunday night that Twitter’s rules “also prohibit hateful conduct, harassment and violent threats. We will take action on accounts that violate these policies. ” Mr. Spencer’s account, which is verified by Twitter, was suspended last month along with several others that had been associated with promoting hate speech. At the time, Mr. Spencer released a YouTube video in which he accused Twitter of “corporate Stalinism,” and said there had been “execution squads across the  . ” Mr. Spencer posted on Saturday night that his other accounts would soon be reinstated as well. The spokesman for Twitter said that its email to Mr. Spencer contradicted that claim. “The Twitter rules explicitly prohibit creating multiple accounts with overlapping uses. When we temporarily suspend multiple accounts for this violation, the account owner can designate one account for reinstatement,” the spokesman said. At a conference in Washington, D. C. last month, Mr. Spencer quoted Nazi propaganda and railed against Jews. America belonged to white people, he told an audience of 200, most of them young men. And, at one point, several in attendance raised their arms in a Nazi salute. “Hail Trump! Hail our people!” he said, adding “Hail victory!”  —   the English translation of the Nazi “Sieg Heil!” Last week, a   speech he delivered at Texas AM University was interrupted by violent skirmishes, and police officers in riot gear were called in to help control the crowd of protesters outside, according to The Texas Tribune. In his first 24 hours back on Twitter, Mr. Spencer engaged in banter with other users, praised how   Donald J. Trump has handled the transition process, and shared a story about “Gab,” a social network with an    mission that has become a safe haven for the far right.",0

25485,Как заставить себя заниматься спортом? Ответ найден,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
По их мнению, с одной стороны, атмосфера благожелательности в спортивных учреждениях часто работает сама против себя, так как она привлекает внимание всех людей к тем посетителям спортзалов, которые наименее всего активны. Это порождает негативную спираль, заставляющую их посещать их еще меньше. 
В то же время, наиболее активные люди задают в спортзале некий тон, который стимулирует других активнее заниматься спортом, так как люди начинают ожидать от себя большего, уверен Дамон Сентола из университета Пенсильвании (США). 
В такому выводу Сентола и его коллеги пришли во время наблюдения за группой из почти восьми сотен студентов университета, которым они предложили бесплатно посещать тренажерный зал на протяжении 11 недель в рамках одной из государственных программ, не связанных, на первый взгляд, с психологическими исследованиями. 
Студенты даже и не знали, что принимают участие в проекте, в ходе которого ученые хотели выяснить их мотивацию при посещении спортзалов и фитнесклубов. Для этого ученые создали несколько разных сайтов, которые фактически предлагали учащимся поучаствовать в одной и той же программе, но пытались завлечь их разными способами. 
Помимо рекламы, на некоторых версиях этих порталов так же выводилась негативная или позитивная статистика посещений, в том числе различные ""рекорды"" посетителей и советы тем, кто мало посещал спортзал. В некоторых из них эти рекорды выводились исключительно в индивидуальном порядке, отражая статистику только самого посетителя курсов, а в других - видеть данные по успехам других ""команд"" и отдельных студентов. 
Кроме различных соревновательных мер, ученые так же проверили, как работают типичные приемы, которые сегодня применяются в американских вузах и школах для стимулирования учащихся - группы доверия, участники в которых могут побуждать друг друга к занятиям спорта, и ""подцепление"" особо активных спортсменов к командам ""прогульщиков"". 
Таким образом ученые еще раз подтвердили известную английскую поговорку: ""Хочешь сделать что-то популярным, преврати это в спорт"": те пользователи, которые посещали ""соревновательные""версии сайта, почти в два раза чаще в среднем ходили на занятия и гораздо активнее занимались фитнесом и зарядкой, чем те студенты, которых ученые поместили в ""группы доверия"". Причем этот эффект проявлялся как в групповых, так и в индивидуальных версиях сайтов, из чего ученые сделали вывод: важнее соревнование, а не его характер. 
На основании своих выводов ученые посоветовали всем владельцам спортзалов и спортивным преподавателям в университетах стимулировать соперничество между посетителями, разбивая их на команды и заставляя их бороться за некое звание или символический приз. 
Соревновательность в спорте, как добавляют ученые, имеет и другие плюсы - она заставляет людей отказываться от табака, алкоголя, вредной еды и прочих негативных вещей, мешающих им достичь максимума в борьбе с конкурентами. Поэтому подобные меры будут не только повышать популярность спортзалов, но и помогать людям улучшать свое здоровье, заключают ученые. 
Как известно, многие люди приходят в спортзалы с целью похудеть. Как же им помогают в этом фитнес-трекеры ? Это попытались выяснить ученые из Питтсбургского университета. Для этого они провели исследование, в котором приняли участие 470 добровольцев, имеющих избыточный вес, в возрасте от 18 до 35 лет. При этом испытуемые уже вели борьбу с лишними килограммами не менее двух лет. 
Испытуемых разделили на две группы, в одной добровольцы использовали фитнес-гаджеты, которые подсчитывали калории, физическую активность и число сердечных сокращений, а в другой - нет. Оказалось, что в группе, где добровольцы не применяли трекеры, эффект от занятия был почти в два раза более эффективным.

25490,Death Penalty for Dylann Roof in South Carolina Church Slayings,"A jury in a South Carolina federal court handed down the death penalty to   Dylann Roof. The verdict by the 12 jurors came in after a   deliberation. [The jury of 10 women and two men recommended that Roof be put to death in each of the 18 counts where he was found guilty of murdering nine people in Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015, CNN reported.  “From what I’ve been told, I have a right to ask you to give me a life sentence, but I’m not sure what good that will do anyway,” Roof told the jurors while representing himself during the sentencing phase of the trial. “But what I will say is only one of you has to disagree with the other jurors. ” No one did, and the jury quickly responded with the verdict of death. Judge Richard Gergel is expected to formally deliver the sentence on Wednesday morning. Breitbart Texas previously reported that some of the jurors cried during testimony provided by victim’s family members in the sentencing portion of the trial. Even court staff members were brought to tears during the emotional testimony. One such witness, Denise Quarles, the daughter of Myra Thompson, told the jury how much her mother meant to her. They talked several times a day, and her mother would make financial sacrifices for her even though they did not have a lot of money, Breitbart Texas reported. She said she still starts to dial her mother’s phone number but then she remembers that she is not there. Judge Gergel told a local television station he would have been stunned had the jurors not cried. As the sentencing portion of the trial began, Breitbart Texas reported that Roof announced he rejected the inanity defense. “(T) here’s noting wrong with me psychologically,” he told the jury. The judge had previously ruled Roof was competent to stand trial. He was instructed by the judge not to approach any witnesses or jurors while representing himself in the trial. A manifesto had previously been uncovered where Roof expressed “deeply racist,     and white supremacist views,” Breitbart News reported in June 2015. In the journal attributed to Roof, he wrote, ““Ni —    are stupid and violent. ” He continued, “Jewish agitation of the black race” is the reason blacks behave the way they do. He apparently supported segregation as a solution to race relations. “Segregation was not a bad thing   …     It existed to protect us from them. ” Dylann Roof was found guilty in the murders of nine black Americans. Those included six women and three men who were gathered at the church to pray. Editor’s Note: This article has been updated with additional information.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the Pentagon on Wednesday to stop clawing back excessive recruiting bonuses paid to California National Guardsmen. 
The move came after news broke over the weekend that the Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen. Some of the payments were made by mistake, others were taken fraudulently. 
“While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,” Carter said in a statement. “About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments.” 
As first reported by the Los Angeles Times , the Pentagon sought repayment of the excess bonuses from almost 10,000 California Guard soldiers. The paper reported that many of the soldiers affected had served multiple combat deployments and had been ordered to repay bonuses plus interest. Some had had their wages garnished and tax liens slapped on them when they refused to pay. The bonus scandal was revealed after audits showed widespread overpayments.",0

They’d have been cracking down on today’s drinking culture, the venues where that culture is enacted (often fraternities), and they’d be empowering women with self-defense courses (which would give them a life-long skill).

25497,Comey Sends Letter To Congress Citing New Evidence (and An Investigation) In The Clinton Email Scandal,"Written by Jonathan Turley   There is a major news development with the release of a letter from FBI Director James B. Comey that the Bureau has decided that new evidence requires further investigation into the Clinton emails. It was a surprising change just days before the election. After all, as recently as September 27, 2016, Comey rejected the idea that the bureau would reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state . Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress that the bureau has “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.”I have been critical recently of the handling of the FBI investigation, particularly in the granting of immunity to key potential targets. I recently wrote a column on FBI investigation into the Clinton email scandal and revised my view as to the handling of the investigation in light of the five immunity deals handed out by the Justice Department. I had previously noted that FBI Director James Comey was within accepted lines of prosecutorial discretion in declining criminal charges, even though I believed that such charges could have been brought. However, the news of the immunity deals (and particularly the deal given top ranking Clinton aide Cheryl Mills) was baffling and those deals seriously undermined the ability to bring criminal charges in my view.Wikileaks disclosures have only embarrassed the Bureau further in showing Clinton aides debating how to explain the deletions and how to delay turning over material. Comey now has told legislators that “I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”He did note that the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant. Comey clearly felt obligated to let the Committees know about the development. In making such a decision, Comey is caught in the horns of a dilemma. The Justice Department strongly discourages investigatory announcements or actions shortly before an election to avoid any claims of trying to influence the outcome. On the other hand, if this is significant, the FBI does not want to be accused of hiding material developments from Congress or the public, particularly after criticism over its alleged different treatment given Clinton and her aides as opposed to other recent cases.In such a situation, caution favors disclosure. It is unlikely that we will see major developments in the remaining two weeks, but the announcement shows that this is not a closed matter. In many ways, the lingering character of this scandal was only worsened by the tactics of Clinton aides in changing explanations and refusals to cooperate absent immunity. That served to delay the investigation, which will now likely extend beyond the election.   JonathanTurley.org . Related",0

The emails also show that Valmoro sent Clinton’s government schedule to the unsecure email addresses of numerous members of the Clinton Foundation staff on October 16, 2009, again on October 18, 2009, and on October 25, 2009. The emails also include discussions of personnel matters and appointments on Clinton’s unsecure account, which may run afoul of federal privacy law. 
This is the thirteenth set of records produced for Judicial Watch by the State Department from the non-state.gov email accounts of Huma Abedin. The documents were produced under a court order in a May 5, 2015, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the State Department requiring the agency to produce “all emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013, using a ‘non-state’.gov email address” ( Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)). Previous records releases documented special Clinton State Department consideration for Clinton Foundation supporters (see here , here , and here .) 
“We’ve once again uncovered classified information in Hillary Clinton’s and Huma Abedin’s emails,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “It is frankly remarkable that the FBI and Justice Department are only now investigating Abedin’s connection to Clinton’s mishandling of classified information.” Post navigation",0

25507,FDA Orders Antibacterials Removed From Consumer Soaps,"Prev post Page 1 of 3 Next 
For as long as many of us can remember, we have purchased antibacterial hand soap and body washes, believing that were beneficial to our overall health and cleanliness. However, recent research and an order by the FDA seems to show otherwise. It could also show that some of the ingredients in these products could be harmful with long-term use. The findings are causing many of us to rethink what we know about staying clean. 
“Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” says the director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Dr. Janet Woodcock. “In fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm than good over the long-term.” 
The Food and Drug Administration recently issued a press release regarding some of the ingredients in common antibacterial hand soaps and body washes. In the statement, the FDA states that they are ordering manufacturers to remove certain ingredients that were originally believed to kill germs. 
In the press release, the FDA states , “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a final rule establishing that over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products containing certain active ingredients can no longer be marketed.” 
The ruling is regarding an investigation that dates back to 2013 targeting certain ingredients that may be harmful to the public. The FDA had received pressure from environmental groups and law makers regarding these ingredients and the effects they had shown in lab animals. The new ruling applies to 19 different chemical agents found in common antibacterial soaps. The most common of these were triclosan and triclocarban. 
“Companies will no longer be able to market antibacterial washes with these ingredients because manufacturers did not demonstrate that the ingredients are both safe for long-term daily use and more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of certain infections,” states the press release from the FDA. “Some manufacturers have already started removing these ingredients from their products.” 
Soap manufacturers will have one year to remove these chemicals and are no longer allowed to market products containing them. This is because the chemicals were found to be either harmful or to provide no additional benefits as washing with regular soap.

25509,"Politico: Trump ’Was an Asset, Not a Drag’ for Greg Gianforte in Montana House Race","As Democrats and   media outlets pick over the bones of Thursday’s Montana Special House election, in which boisterous Republican Greg Gianforte comfortably beat Democratic challenger Rob Quist, some are coming to an awkward conclusion  —   President Trump was a help, not a fatal hindrance, to Gianforte. [Gianforte beat Quist by seven points in a race Democrats had hoped to turn into a referendum on Trump’s first few months in office, and particularly, the unpopular Republican health care bill.   As Gianforte welcomed the president’s support in the days leading up to the election, opponents hoped that Trump’s alleged unpopularity would motivate the Democratic base and turn away moderates  —   something they would then hope to replicate in the 2018 midterms. Democrats had also hoped that the last minute twist in which Gianforte allegedly assaulted a UK Guardian reporter  —   for which Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault  —   would be the nail in the coffin. But it was not to be, and an analysis by Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti found that the “Trump effect” was the opposite of Democrats would have hoped. Noting that Gianforte had lost the governor’s race in November, Debenedetti concluded that the Trump robocalls and using his campaign slogans paid off. Under a heading of “Trump was an asset, not a drag,” he said: For Gianforte, the biggest applause lines of his Thursday night speech came when he mentioned Trump and used his “drain the swamp” slogan. Local Republicans dismissed the idea that the president could drag Gianforte to defeat as preposterous, The state’s Democratic politicians had also noted Gianforte’s belief in Trump. Everything I see is that Greg Gianforte is trying to make [Trump] completely   . He might have muttered his name once or twice when he was running against me and now he wants to ‘drain the swamp’ and says, ‘I want to be with Trump every step of the way,’” said the state’s Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock on Wednesday  —   nearly seven months after he himself defeated Gianforte. Debenedetti noted that Quist barely talked about Trump during the campaign, possibly realizing it wasn’t the best strategy to take in the solidly red Treasure State. Trump won the state in November by over 20 points. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY",0

25514,KASSAM: Wanna Know Why the UK Can’t Defeat Terrorism? Watch How Media Attacked A Politician for Demanding Strength,"Britain’s establishment media today attacked the leader of the UK Independence Party at the organisation’s manifesto launch, implying and insisting that they were “exploiting” the terrorist attack in Manchester for “partisan” gain. [The UK Independence Party (UKIP) manifesto  —   a   document covering a vast swathe of international and domestic policy positions for the upcoming General Election  —   was due to be launched on Tuesday. The party delayed the launch out of respect for the victims of the Manchester attack.  That didn’t stop the traditionally   media accusing the party of “exploiting” the attack simply for urging strength in the face of extremism and terrorism: something every other party leader has already done since the atrocity on Monday night. Channel 4’s Michael Crick opened by asking: “  …    wasn’t that blatantly exploiting Manchester for election and party purposes?” UKIP supporters in the crowd hit back, shouting “Rubbish!” and “You’re exploiting it!” at Mr. Crick. Indeed, UKIP’s manifesto was finalised and went to print last Saturday, and was not changed since the Manchester attack. ITV’s Libby Wiener insisted: “You say you’re not exploiting Manchester but you say also that lighting candles isn’t enough. Isn’t that an insult to all the people who have come out in Manchester to show their respects?” She was followed by Channel 5’s Andy Bell, who rather than asking about policies in the manifesto, asked: “Can you confirm that you haven’t added anything in to your manifesto since what happened on Monday night?” The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg chimed in, appearing to act as a Conservative Party surrogate: “I understand you had very strong words for Theresa May’s record as Home Secretary. You’ve accused her of allowing jihadis in. It sounds like you’re near as damn blaming the Prime Minister for this attack and the circumstances that led to it. ” Finally, LBC’s Theo Usherwood issued a statement, rather than asking a question: “Paul, you had a choice yesterday afternoon when [the] minute’s silence was announced. You could have put back this manifesto launch to 12 o’clock  …     instead in 10 minutes time the nations is going to stop to remember the victims. Surely you’re exploiting what happened in Manchester. ” In fact, it was broadcast producers who asked for the launch to be earlier in the day so they could film, edit, and package clips together for the news channels. WATCH:  Reporters were heckled at @UKIP’s manifesto launch when they quizzed @paulnuttallukip over his comments about the Manchester terror attack. pic. twitter.   —   BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) May 25, 2017,  In effect, what the partisan press was asking UKIP, is “how do you dare talk of solving this problem?” Sadly, Paul Nuttall’s responses were not as robust as mine would have been i. e.: “Yes I am blaming the Prime Minister and decades of Labour and Conservative policy on immigration, security, defence, policing, and foreign policy for this attack. ” Nonetheless, when we ask ourselves why we can’t seem to get a grip of these atrocities, consider the attacks people and parties who try and offer solutions endure at the hands of Crick, Wiener, Bell, Kuenssberg, Usherwood, and their liberal friends.

25517,’For Honor’ Players Plan Boycott of Game - Breitbart,"In response to a lack of communication from both the publisher and developer about For Honor‘s most pressing issues, members of the game’s community are planning a boycott of the game on April 3, 2017. [Organized by Reddit community member “jbaayoun,” the For Honor gameplay blackout will begin at 5 AM and last for a minimum of 24 hours. Players are protesting the game’s ongoing balance issues, some so grievous that tournament organizers have been forced to ban at least one class from competitive play.  The participants are seeking greater transparency from the game’s developer and publisher around issues that have plagued the title since release. First, they want clearer communication between Ubisoft and For Honor fans. This should include a more informative version of the ongoing “Warrior’s Den” livestreams that the developers have been promoting. Second, they want a clearly defined roadmap for the game’s future. If players are going to stick around for the literal years needed to fully unlock the game’s content, they want a plan of future content that will give them a good reason to do so. Third, boycotters want a solution to the aforementioned glacial pace of earning the game’s “Steel” currency to make the grind for unlocking content a bit less punishing. Finally, players want to see a solution for the game’s ongoing matchmaking woes. Of note, Ubisoft has recently posted patch notes in the official forums that address a few of the game’s issues, including a sizeable boost to Steel income. It’s a welcome first step to addressing one problem among many in a game that is robbed of its potential for greatness by clumsy execution. Will a community boycott draw the publishing giant’s attention to make a difference? We’ll find out on April 3rd, unless either the publisher or development team deign to respond sooner.

In a story that predictably did not make the mainstream media, and with video surveillance very difficult to find, a massive mob of black teens viciously attacked white Temple University students, police officers and even a police horse in Philadelphia on Friday night. 
[…] 
In the limited local coverage this story did receive, the race aspect was generally avoided. It is way past time to take back the media, and fill it with truth-tellers, not apologists. 
“More than 150 teens, spread out in groups of 20 or 30, descended upon the campus at around 8:30 p.m. Friday — wreaking havoc for nearly two hours before eventually dispersing,” according to NBC 10 …. 
But there is a reason for all of this horror, according to Solomon Jones of Philly.com . It evidently boils down to the progressive canard “white privilege.” 
The black teens are feeling excluded because evil white “others” have come into their neighborhood and built rental properties for college students, raising the property values of their neighborhoods in a way that evidently excludes the angry teens, who were used to having their blighted turf unmolested.",0

Mohandes made the remarks during an interview with the al-Alam television network on Saturday.
He stressed that both the ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorist groups are the product of Saudi Arabia, and that ISIS's psychological and media campaign is partially funded from Riyadh.
Mohandes noted that the operations to free Mosul from the Takfiri terrorists will take some time as the militants are receiving intelligence from several external sources, mainly the US.
He went on to praise Iran’s support for Iraq’s battle against terrorism, stressing that if Baghdad had not called for Tehran’s assistance, the Iraqi army would never have reached Mosul.
He also noted that the Hashd al-Shaabi forces, also known as the Popular Mobilization Units, will move on towards Tal Afar after Mosul is cleared of ISIS militants.

It also scheduled his   press conference  —   largely devoted to Trump’s   …     intimate relationship with Russia  —   and a critical vote on the Affordable Care Act budget. Sometimes we, as progressives, aren’t able to be   because we acknowledge complexity  —   we address the intersections and breadth of policies and positions. Sometimes, perhaps we try to do too much. So let me be perfectly clear: Sen. Jeff Sessions should never be attorney general of the United States. While the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on Sessions’ nomination, around Capitol Hill other committees moved forward on a host of other outrageous nominees. The American public may never hear about the number of serious conflicts each of these nominees pose  —   to our democracy, to our rights  —   because there is simply too much to process.   …     Read Leguizamo’s full column at Variety.",0

So she sued. ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Vertical Pools Help Heal Wounded Combat Veterans Seeks Positive Doers To Help Make It Happen By VNN on October 31, 2016 The Vertical Pool was inspired by the anticipated need of the returning wounded, and veterans of all past conflicts, who have limited options for recovery and healing at home. Even if they’re within an hour of a VA hospital, it can be a challenge to get there without assistance. A heated, sanitized, filtered, compact pool in the back yard, house, garage, means convenient, private, daily immersions for exercise, traction, rehabilitation, and recovery. These pools should be available to veterans without convoluted forms and wait times. Simply a doctor’s prescription should put them on a list for immediate consideration. VetPools.org (an effort to raise funds to donate these pools to vets) was formed with the specific objective of helping improve upon the methods and manners by which America receives and treats her returning wounded. The most formidable military force in the world deserves a commensurate comprehensive recovery, reintegration program focused on body, mind, and spirit for those who require assistance. The purpose of this message is to inform interested and connected parties of the desire to hand this product and mission off to veterans who would then become The Vertical Pool LLC and VetPools.org . They could be instrumental in healing themselves and their fellow veterans, as well as civilian America from the physically challenged to the physically fit. Interestingly, while initially intended for veterans, the retail market has turned out to be women. As only one person, innovator/owner of The Vertical Pool and founder/director of VetPools.org , I cannot fulfill this objective alone. The R&D, pool product, and non-profit are all paid for in full, no debt or encumbrances. This “on-demand” pool can be manufactured as needed without excessive, costly inventory and/or storage space. I do not advertise this product because one person cannot build, deliver, and install more than 5 pools in two months. Career options with this DME device and non-profit include owning, manufacturing, marketing, selling, donating, fund-raising, case managing, delivering, installing, and teaching The Vertical Pool’s diverse functions and benefits. This pool is efficient in energy, water, and space; critical qualities in this, the 21st century. A group or collective of 3 to 7 individuals might be prudent to start the program. I would remain teacher, mentor, and guide for years to come while others slip into the ownership of this product and its sister non-profit organization. Please share this idea with any and all contacts who might have the connections to give some veterans a lead to a worthy endeavor and career. To get involved contact; Director, Peter G. Hold",0

I think that’s where the focus was for this moving forward. ” “At this moment, we’re not using AI to go through this particular content,” Davis continued, pointing out that the issue is currently too complex to cut out human moderators completely. “There is significant context that’s required for reviewing   sharing. ” Revenge porn has proven to be an issue for social media platforms, where disgruntled exes and even hackers have been able to post private and intimate photos of their victims without permission. Last month, a revenge porn victim’s lawyer claimed   site Tumblr had “chosen to ignore” revenge porn images posted on the platform after it allegedly took three weeks to get a video of the     victim removed from the site. “In my opinion, Tumblr has chosen to ignore valid legal demands because they earn more money using victims’ photographs as clickbait than they do protecting minors,” claimed lawyer Daniel Szalkiewicz, whose firm specializes in Internet defamation and revenge porn cases.

25539,Thousands Stranded as Fire Disrupts Metro-North Rail Service - The New York Times,"A large fire erupted below the   Railroad tracks in East Harlem on Tuesday night, disrupting train service and leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded during the evening rush. Service was suspended to and from Grand Central Terminal, and it was unclear whether it would be restored by Wednesday morning. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said commuters should expect delays. The fire, at 119th Street and Park Avenue, was fueled in part by chemicals stored at a garden nursery that operated underneath the tracks, he said. The New York Fire Department said it was investigating reports of explosions, possibly set off by propane tanks at the site. Emergency officials received the call at 6:42 p. m. and fire officials said at 8:25 p. m. that a majority of the fire was under control. The cause remained under investigation, and no injuries were reported. A beam and support buttresses were bent, and crews were expected to work through the night to make repairs, the governor said. “It’s an ambitious goal,” Mr. Cuomo said during a news conference at the scene. “The   scenario is we could have a delayed commute. ”   planned to run several trains over the tracks once construction was completed. “The heat of the fire was extreme,” Mr. Cuomo said, adding that it was so intense that firefighters could hear bolts popping from the beams. For commuters, the trip home was a string of misery as they tried to find alternate means of transportation. At Grand Central, an announcement warned passengers that all northbound trains were “subject to indefinite delays at this time. ” The main hall was packed with people standing nearly shoulder to shoulder. Railroad officials said the disruption affected 30, 000 to 40, 000 commuters. Nicole Clarke, of Rye, N. Y. said she waited at Grand Central for 30 minutes before abandoning plans to take  . “When I got to that place, it was a mess,” Ms. Clarke said. “They couldn’t tell us anything, nothing. ” She said that she was taking the subway to   Avenue and 233rd Street in the Bronx and that her husband would pick her up from there. Linda Vanderperre, who works on Wall Street and uses the Larchmont station, said she had been waiting over 90 minutes for what would be customarily a   commute. “It’s beyond ridiculous,” Ms. Vanderperre said. “This is the second day in a row it’s taken me over two hours to get home from Wall Street. ” She looked into using Uber but estimated it would cost around $150 because of surge pricing. “My husband is coming to pick me up if I’m still stuck here at 9,” she said. Three hotels near Grand Central said on Tuesday night that they had received numerous inquiries from stranded travelers but that, even before the fire, they were already booked. The disruption affected service on the Harlem, Hudson and New Haven lines, said Meredith Daniels, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Transportation authorities said train service was being provided to points north on the Hudson line from the   153rd Street station and the Marble Hill station. Service on the Harlem line was being provided from Wakefield, and trains on the New Haven line were running from Woodlawn to points east and from Stamford to New Haven. Ms. Daniels said the third rail, which powers the trains, had been shut off from 110th to 125th Street. Passengers on two trains that were stuck on either side of the fire were evacuated, officials said. Several passengers complained on Twitter about the lack of clear information and updates. Chris Polos, who commutes from Midtown Manhattan to his home in Scarsdale, said he had been waiting for 90 minutes. “I wish I had more information,” he said. “The big thing is what’s the next step  —   is it going to be a couple hours or 20 minutes?”",0

The energy generated from the solar panels could be used to pay for the cost of building the wall, Trump intimated, according to three sources in the story. It is unclear how serious the president was about the proposal, but he appeared eager to discuss progress for the project. “The wall will be a great help, and it will happen believe me,” Trump said to reporters after the meeting.",0

25545,Gun-Controlled Chicago: Thieves Break Into Car of Top Cop,"Over the weekend the SUV in which Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson travels was broken into and the contents tossed about. [Johnson lives in the Bridgeport area and other nearby cars were also targeted.  According to NBC News, “The vehicle’s interior was found in disarray on Saturday morning when officers went to  …     [Johnson’s home] to pick him up. ” The vehicle was unmarked so Chicago Police do not believe it was not targeted. The Chicago Tribune quoted Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi saying “items from the glove box had been tossed about, but no weapons or confidential materials or valuables were inside the   SUV. ” Police believe there is a possibility the car was accidentally left unlocked the night before. The crime that reached the superintendent’s car is just a taste of the lawlessness that has characterized Chicago all year. On April 27,  Breitbart News reported Chicago already had over 1, 000 shooting victims for 2017 and stories of fatalities that included sons being gunned down in front of their mothers. As of May 1, the Tribune reports a total of 192 homicides in Chicago for 2017. This means the city is on track to get close to the nearly 800 homicides witnessed in 2016. On April 25, Breitbart News reported that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s (D) response to the   gun violence has consisted of calls for additional gun control. He now wants new controls and regulations on Federal Firearm License holders (FFLs) in Chicago. In other words, with criminal gun use surging, Emanuel wants to go after the gun dealers who have gone through the proper legal channels to get an FFL and who, because of that FFL, conduct a background check on every gun they sell.

25548,Swedish Welfare State Funding Islamic Terrorism,"A new damning report shows that multiple Islamist fighters who have travelled from Sweden to fight in Syria and Iraq have been the beneficiaries of welfare payments from the Swedish government. [The new report created by the by the National Defence University on behalf of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) shows that around 300 Islamists have claimed benefits by using others to give the government the impression that they are still in Sweden despite the fact that they are in Syria or Iraq fighting for jihadist groups, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.   Terrorist researcher and one of the authors of the report Magnus Ranstorp said the problem isn’t just limited to Sweden. Commenting on the results, he said: “it was not surprising, we have seen the same pattern in other countries. Most surprising was that almost all had it in some form. But it is the monitoring that needs to work better. The problem is that there is too little  . ” The 300 individuals covered in the report traveled from Sweden to the Middle East between 2013 and 2016, and are thought to have participated in fighting for groups including the terrorist Islamic State. Housing allowances, child support, student loans, maintenance and parental benefits are the most common types of benefits earned by the Islamists, often collected by a third party with the money then sent to them overseas. ” It’s not big money, they do not get rich on it, but it can go a long way in a conflict zone,” Ranstorp said. Police say that student loans, in particular, are an issue because the fighters can game the system by pretending to be going overseas to study and receive large lump sums from the Swedish government.  Swedish Minister for Upper Secondary School and Adult Education and Training Anna Ekström said the problem was “totally unacceptable. No state funds will be used for something that is in the vicinity of terrorism. We must take hold of this immediately. We are preparing now to go to the parliament and ensure that the government gets the opportunity to ensure that we do not pay out such large sums at once. ” Sweden has seen at least one case in which the government paid a jihadi before. Late last year, Muslim convert Michael Skråmo was revealed to have been paid £4, 300 by the government since leaving for the Middle East in 2014.  The Swedish government has also essentially legalised the flying of the Islamic State flag after a Swedish court refused to prosecute a man who displayed the symbol on his social media account as a promotion of the terrorist group.  In 2015 it was shown that the Swedish city of Gothenburg sent more Islamists to the Middle East per capita than any other city in Europe.

25267,"BREAKING: Comey Admits to Fabricating Email Investigation, Rigging Election in FBI Secret Memo","By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on October 29, 2016 FBI Memo: Comey knew nothing was in emails and admits to releasing memo to influence election without cause. Comey: “we do not know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails” Comey had stored these totally innocent emails as part of the long expected October Surprise. What is Comey being promised? Golf memberships, a free Trump condo? More? Comey says this not an investigation but “supplementing the record.” All this while Trump awaits a December trial for raping a 13 year old. 
FBI Director James Comey told his bureau that he broke with custom in alerting lawmakers that the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server was being reopened because of its political sensitivity. 
In an internal memo obtained by Fox News, the beleaguered director noted that the FBI typically would not communicate with the public when reopening a case, according to a Department of Justice source. But Comey said he had to in this case because Clinton is seeking the White House in an election on Nov. 8. 
FBI letter from Director James Comey (Fox News) 
“Of course we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,” Comey wrote. “I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. 
“At the same time, however, given that we do not know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression,” Comey’s letter continued. “In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter, and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directy from me about it.” 
Justice officials (Including the Attorney General of the United States) warned FBI that Comey’s decision to update Congress was not consistent with department policy 
Senior Justice Department officials warned the FBI that Director James B. Comey’s decision to notify Congress about renewing the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server was not consistent with long-standing practices of the department, according to officials familiar with the discussions. 
Comey told Justice officials that he intended to inform lawmakers of newly discovered emails. These officials told him the department’s position “that we don’t comment on an ongoing investigation. And we don’t take steps that will be viewed as influencing an election,” said one Justice official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the high-level conversations. 
“Director Comey understood our position. He heard it from Justice leadership,” said the official. “It was conveyed to the FBI, and Comey made an independent decision to alert the Hill. He is operating independently of the Justice Department. And he knows it.” 
Comey decided to inform Congress that he would look again into Hillary Clinton’s handling of emails during her time as secretary of state for two main reasons: a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup. 
The rationale, described by officials close to Comey’s decision-making on the condition of anonymity, prompted the FBI director to release his brief letter to Congress on Friday and upset a presidential race less than two weeks before Election Day. It placed Comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nation’s top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign. 
In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his letter to Congress, Comey said he felt “an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.” 
[Read the letter Comey sent to FBI employees explaining his decision] 
“Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record, ” Comey wrote to his employees. 
The last time Comey found himself in the campaign spotlight was in July, when he announced that he had finished a months-long investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information through the use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. After he did so, the denunciation was loudest from Republican nominee Donald Trump and his supporters, who accused the FBI director of bias in favor of Clinton’s candidacy. There was also grumbling within FBI ranks, with a largely conservative investigative corps complaining privately that Comey should have tried harder to make a case. 
This time the loudest criticism has come from Clinton and her supporters, who said Friday that Comey had provided too little information about the nature of the new line of investigation and allowed Republicans to seize political ground as a result. The inquiry focuses on Clinton emails found on a computer used by former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), now under investigation for sending sexually explicit messages to a minor, and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who is Weiner’s wife. The couple have since separated. 
“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,” John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton’s presidential campaign, said in a statement. “The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.” 
Officials familiar with Comey’s thinking said the director on Thursday faced a quandary over how to proceed once the emails, which number more than 1,000 and may duplicate some of those already reviewed, were brought to his attention. 
Comey had just been briefed by a team of investigators who were seeking access to the emails. The director knew he had to move quickly because the information could leak out. 
The next day, Comey informed Congress that he would take additional “investigative steps” to evaluate the emails after deciding the emails were pertinent to the Clinton email investigation and that the FBI should take steps to obtain and review them. 
In July, Comey had testified under oath before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that the FBI was finished investigating the Clinton email matter and that there would be no criminal charges. Comey was asked at the hearing whether he would review any new information the FBI came across. 
“My first question is this, would you reopen the Clinton investigation if you discovered new information that was both relevant and substantial?” Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) asked Comey during the hearing. 
“It’s hard for me to answer in the abstract,” Comey replied at the hearing. “We would certainly look at any new and substantial information.” 
In the Friday memo to his employees, Comey acknowledged that the FBI does not yet know the import of the newly discovered emails. “Given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression,” Comey wrote. 
An official familiar with Comey’s thinking said that “he felt he had no choice.” 
“What would it look like if the FBI inadvertently came across additional emails that appear to be relevant to the Clinton investigation and not at least inform the Oversight Committee that this occurred?” the official said. “What would be the criticism then? That the FBI hid it? That the FBI purposely kept this information to themselves?” 
The official said the decision came down to which choice “was not as bad as the others.” 
Comey’s action has been blasted by some former Justice Department officials, Clinton campaign officials and Democratic members of Congress. 
“Without knowing how many emails are involved, who wrote them, when they were written or their subject matter, it’s impossible to make any informed judgment on this development,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who called the release “appalling.” 
“However, one thing is clear: Director Comey’s announcement played right into the political campaign of Donald Trump, who is already using the letter for political purposes. And all of this just 11 days before the election,” Feinstein said. 
Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman in the Obama administration, said the FBI rarely releases information about ongoing criminal investigations and does not release information about federal investigations this close to political elections. 
“Comey’s behavior in this case from the beginning has been designed to protect his reputation for independence no matter the consequences to the public, to people under investigation or to the FBI’s own integrity,” Miller said. 
Miller and other former officials pointed to a 2012 Justice Department memo saying that all employees have the responsibility to enforce the law in a “neutral and impartial manner,” which is “particularly important in an election year.” 
Miller said he had been involved in cases related to elected officials in which the FBI waited until several days after an election to send subpoenas. “They know that if they even send a subpoena, let alone announce an investigation, that might leak and it might become public and it would unfairly influence the election when voters have no way to interpret the information,” Miller said. 
Nick Ackerman, a former federal prosecutor in New York and an assistant special Watergate prosecutor, said Comey “had no business writing to Congress about supposed new emails that neither he nor anyone in the FBI has ever reviewed.” 
He added: “It is not the function of the FBI director to be making public pronouncements about an investigation, never mind about an investigation based on evidence that he acknowledges may not be significant.” 
In Comey’s note to employees, he seemed to anticipate that his decision would be controversial. 
“In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood,” Comey wrote. Related Posts:",1
25268,Appeals Court Affirms Landmark N.F.L. Concussion Settlement - The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA  —    Nearly three years ago, the N. F. L. and lawyers for thousands of retired football players agreed on a deal to compensate all former players who had neurological diseases linked to repeated hits to the head, helping the league to move on from one of the most contentious issues facing the nation’s most popular sport. But it took an appellate court ruling Monday to affirm the deal, which potentially provides retirees up to $5 million each, and all but closed the door on future challenges by players in the matter. As much as the debate continues in the court of public opinion on whether football is safe and whether the league has done enough to make it so, the court of law has decided that the league can be on the hook for damages only in a limited way. In a   ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit here unambiguously upheld a district court’s approval of the deal, over the objections of some players who had argued that the terms were too restrictive and would not take care of many players who developed serious neurological problems over time. The appellate judges, sitting in Philadelphia, acknowledged the objectors’ points but turned them aside because they found that the settlement benefited the greater good among players. “They risk making the perfect the enemy of the good,” the court said of the players who objected that the settlement was too restrictive. “This settlement will provide nearly $1 billion in value to the class of retired players. It is a testament to the players, researchers and advocates who have worked to expose the true human costs of a sport so many love. Though not perfect, it is fair. ” The appellants can still ask a larger panel of judges at the Third Circuit to hear their appeal, or they can solicit the Supreme Court. But both challenges appear to be long shots because the appeals court ruled overwhelmingly to affirm, legal experts say. In almost every major question before the appeals court, the   panel sided with Judge Anita B. Brody of United States District Court, who has overseen the settlement since the hundreds of individual cases against the N. F. L. were consolidated in Philadelphia more than three years ago. The appeals court judges interpreted their role as having not been to determine if the settlement was good or bad, but if it was “fair” and “reasonable” under the conditions of the deal. In that regard, they left little doubt that Judge Brody had acted within her bounds. “They didn’t say this was a good settlement, they said it was a reasonable settlement that was reached,” said Michael Kaplen, a plaintiffs’ lawyer who specializes in cases of head trauma, and a frequent critic of the settlement. “They don’t care that large numbers of players weren’t compensated, only that this was the best deal that their lawyers could make. ” In backing Judge Brody’s decision to approve the settlement, the appeals court judges noted that only a small number of players had objected or opted out. More than 98 percent of retired players approved the deal, which was originally struck in 2013, revised in 2014 to remove the cap on how much the N. F. L. might have to pay players over the   life of the settlement, and revised again in 2015. Steven Molo, lead counsel for the players who appealed, said, “We are disappointed in the court’s decision,” and “we are reviewing the opinion and considering our options. ” Mr. Molo and the handful of players who did appeal the decision argued, among other things, that players who were found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C. T. E. a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma, should be covered through the life of the deal, not just if they were found to have the condition before the settlement was approved in 2015, as the deal currently states. The appeals court, though, said that Judge Brody’s ruling on C. T. E. and the treatment of the symptoms of the disease was “reasonable. ” The appeals court also said that the admission last month by a   N. F. L. executive of a link between C. T. E. and   head trauma was “not a ground for reversal of the settlement’s approval. ” The emphatic decision by the appeals court on Monday moved the N. F. L. a step closer to ending one of its most contentious, embarrassing and expensive legal challenges. The spectacle of thousands of former players suing the league for lying to them, and the prospect that some players might have testified in court about the harm they suffered, led the league to promise to pay potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to former players in dire straits. In the deal, the N. F. L. admitted no fault and, critically, insisted that all retired players be included in the settlement, not only the 5, 000 or so who originally sued the league. This has largely removed the threat of a string of endless challenges in the future. In the settlement, players can receive cash payments of up to $5 million if they find out they have Alzheimer’s, A. L. S. Parkinson’s or severe dementia, or were found to have C. T. E. before the settlement was approved last year. Though the ceiling is $5 million, the amount players are paid is based on their age and number of years in the league, and therefore is likely to be far less. The number of players with these conditions may end up being a minority of the pool of retired players. All of them, though, can receive medical tests, paid for by the league, to monitor their conditions. The lawyers for the retired players, who have asked the league to pay $112 million for their legal fees, applauded the appeals court ruling and urged the objectors not to pursue their case further. (Judge Brody will rule on those fees.) “We are pleased with the Third Circuit’s decision to completely uphold the District Court’s approval of the settlement,” Christopher Seeger,   counsel for the retired N. F. L. players, said. “This extraordinary settlement’s implementation has been delayed enough by this small group of objectors, whose arguments have been exhaustively examined and overruled by both the District Court and Third Circuit. ” Seeger said that more than 8, 000 retired players have tried to register for benefits, even though the claims process has not opened yet. Only the 150 or so players who opted out of the settlement can continue to sue the league in the matter. Winning individual cases against the N. F. L. may be difficult, though. The league and plaintiffs’ lawyers have noted that the science surrounding C. T. E. is still in its infancy and therefore should not be treated with the same certainly as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions covered in the settlement. The N. F. L. and the plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that the conditions associated with C. T. E. like memory loss, are covered under the deal. C. T. E. is diagnosed only posthumously. Some of the players who appealed the settlement said the deal should leave open the possibility that a test will be developed to diagnose the disease in the living. The N. F. L. and lawyers for the retired players added a provision that would allow the players and the league in several years to review the way that C. T. E. is treated in the settlement. Mr. Kaplen, the critic of the deal, said he did not expect the league to willingly broaden the boundaries of who would be eligible for an award. “It’s foolhardy,” he said. “Do you think the N. F. L. is going to open their wallet in 10 years? Experience tells you it’s not going to happen. ” Players who opted out of the settlement and sue the league face other hurdles, among them the issue of whether their case is governed by the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players, an issue that the district court judge in the case did not rule on.",1
25269,Election 2016: The Candidates Make Their Closing Arguments,"Thank the god atop the thing, the 2016 election is almost over. It has been a grueling, often excruciating, process but here we are. I repeat, it’s almost over.
So on the eve of election day, let’s take a look at the four major campaign’s closing arguments—what their candidacies represent and their visions for America.
Hillary Clinton 
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton makes her final case for the establishment in “The Story of Us.” The ad, much like the campaign itself, is a highly misleading and sanitized presentation.
Clinton, the eternal triangulator, celebrates progressive victories she had next to nothing to do with like marriage equality, while positioning herself as a champion for combating Islamophobia (something she has actually contributed to). The only honest argument made is that she will be the first female president.
No mention is made of her own pro-corporate and pro-war policies, or really any of her policies, which is no accident. Hillary Clinton has not so much run for office in the general election as run against Donald Trump taking office, a cynical strategy that appears likely to work if current polling is to be believed.
For more information on what our likely next president will be up to, check out Shadowproof’s series on the Podesta Emails. 
Donald Trump 
Donald Trump closed out his unorthodox and largely chaotic campaign with “Donald Trump’s Argument For America.” The ad is explicitly anti-establishment and targets “global special interests” with references to Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, and free trade and their corrupting influence on the political system in Washington DC.
Trump is never more popular than when he is attacking globalism, especially when considering that Hillary Clinton told Brazilian bankers in a private paid speech she dreams of a “hemispheric union” with open borders and transnational governance. Many people already fear power has slipped out of their hands and those that govern them are accountable to more powerful distant interests.
But Donald Trump has managed to constantly get in the way of his own populist message on the campaign trail. Trump’s crude and ignorant statements—including ad hoc policy proposals that were straight up racist and bigoted—are well out of step with American history and norms. While most mainstream outlets opposed Trump from day one, they still took advantage of such statements as a business opportunity.
Trump made his name in the Republican primaries going hard on illegal immigration, which is a genuine concern for many Americans. But while many Americans want to do something about immigration, few supported Trump’s incendiary rhetoric . No one was more offended by this than Hispanic-Americans, who are likely to respond by voting for Clinton to such a degree that, if Trump loses, they will have made the difference.
Gary Johnson 
Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, running for president on the Libertarian ticket, has positioned himself as the most viable alternative to the two party system given he is on the ballot in all 50 states and that the Libertarian Party is the third largest party in the country. His ad, “This Is The Year,” emphasizes his independence and honesty.
Johnson’s actual libertarian agenda , however, is not necessarily populist. While his opposition to the War on Drugs has earned him many supporters on the left, his free market ideology is pretty extreme. Johnson is pro-TPP, pro-Citizens United/unrestricted money in politics, and against raising the minimum wage and paid family leave. He also opposes free college or really most government social programs.
Gary Johnson’s campaign strategy appeared to rest mostly on ballot access and getting into the presidential debates. While he got on the ballot in all 50 states, thanks in large part to libertarian party organizing, he never polled well enough to qualify for the presidential debates and was not included. He has gotten a considerable amount of press exposure, but most of it has been negative due to the press’ intractable allegiance and support for Hillary Clinton as well as Johnson’s own missteps, which included yelling at reporters and conceding in an interview he did not know what the city of Aleppo, a major battleground in the Syrian Civil War was.
While Johnson was pilloried by the Clinton-backing mainstream corporate media, the New York Times had to issue two corrections about its own smug story lambasting Johnson for his ignorance.
Jill Stein 
Dr. Jill Stein, running for president on the Green Party ticket, appears content that her chances of winning the presidency are non-existent and has set her sights on getting 5% of the national vote. Getting 5% of the vote would qualify the Green Party for presidential matching funds and help the party get automatic balloting in a number of states for the 2020 presidential election.
Stein is, in truth, the only progressive candidate among those polling in the top four and further to the left than Senator Bernie Sanders. She is running on a platform that includes 100% renewable energy by 2030, supporting Black Lives Matter, and making criminal justice reforms, full employment (with government employer as last resort), and a guaranteed living wage, universal single-payer or “Medicare for all” healthcare, curtailing government electronic surveillance, and ending the American empire.
Stein’s plan to pay for it all is as simple as it is radical: massive cuts to the Pentagon budget combined with major tax increases on the rich. While these ideas are pretty standard for a social democratic party in Western Europe, such a program is revolutionary in the United States.
But every revolution has to start somewhere, doesn’t it?
So there are your candidates, the election is tomorrow and the day after that, hopefully, is the end of the 2016 cycle. We made it.

25272,Трамп и Ближний Восток | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: Ближний Восток В арабских странах, как, впрочем, и во всех столицах мира с пристальным вниманием следили за ходом президентской кампании в США. И это понятно: для народов этого истерзанного войной региона исключительно важно, кто будет в Белом Доме и как это может сказаться на обстановке и жизни граждан. Что касается уходящего президента Б. Обамы, то в местных СМИ только ленивый не критиковал политику его администрации, причем в самых резких выражениях. «Наследие Обамы на Ближнем Востоке – это практически полное фиаско: конфликты продолжаются в Сирии, Ираке, Йемене, Ливии, — не раз писал сайт «Аль-Джазира», приводя цитаты из выступления известного профессора-международника из Гарварда Стефена Уолта. — Террористические акции потрясли Турцию, Тунис, Ливан. Ситуация в Палестине остается невнятной, а перспектива урегулирования между израильтянами и палестинцами все больше отдаляется. Действия США в Ливии и Йемене привели к развалу этих государств. А «мантра» Обамы с требованием ухода Асада лишь серьезнейшим образом обострила гражданскую войну в Сирии. Единственным достижением, которое уходящий президент может как-то «записать в свою копилку», — это договоренность об Иранской ядерной программе». По мнению египетской газеты «Аль-Ахрам», «в этой кампании было так много негативного, что вряд ли США смогут отойти от этого в ближайшее время». «Если в Америке видели маяк демократии, то свет этого маяка в последнее время заметно потускнел», — отметила ливанская «Дейли Стар». Особенно резко высказывается саудовский журналист Хаед Аль-Маена в «Сауди Газет». «Эти выборы — самые поляризованные в истории США», — пишет он. Анализируя ход выборной кампании автор делает вывод о том, что «арабы должны больше полагаться на себя и не ожидать чего-либо от американского президента, кто бы им не стал». Жесткой критике журналист подвергает деятельность Х.Клинтон. «Она полностью склонилась перед израильтянами, даже обещала пригласить израильского премьера Нетаньяху в качестве первого иностранного посетителя в Белый дом. Она объявила о твердой поддержке правительства, которое оккупирует земли и угнетает людей, убивает детей и практикует худшую форму апартеида…. Эта женщина не испытывает никаких угрызений совести – какими только словами она не ругает девушек, которые обвиняли ее мужа в изнасиловании. А последние публикации ее электронных писем из «ВикиЛикс» показывают, что она считает выгодным для Израиля разрушение Сирии». В правящих кругах и в СМИ ближневосточных стран превалирующим было предположение, почти даже уверенность, что победу одержит Х.Клинтон. Именно из этого исходили многие политические деятели, руководители крупных экономических корпораций. Успех Д.Трампа был скорее неожиданным и многих поверг в состояние растерянности. Ныне внимание сосредоточено на изучении и анализе заявлений нового 45 президента США. Д.Трамп высказывался в том плане, что намерен быть по одну сторону с Россией и сирийским режимом в борьбы с ДАИШ, — отмечают многие СМИ, подчеркивая, что Х.Клинтон то и дело талдычила о свободной от полетов зоне в Сирии. Многие арабские издания особо выделили ту часть из выступления Д.Трампа на Национальном конвенте Республиканской партии в июле 2016 года, где он упрекал администрацию Обамы в том, что «Америка склонились перед Китаем, Мексикой, Россией и ДАИШ. Однако самое пристальное внимание привлечено к оценкам Трампа, связанным с исламом и беженцами-мусульманами. Сайт «Аль-Джазира» опубликовал статью под названием «Президент исламофобии», в которой утверждалось, что он поднялся к вершинам власти через исламофобскую кампанию и теперь исламофобия станет его официальной политикой. Отмечалось при этом, что поначалу, когда в одном из заявлений Трамп ратовал за запрет мусульманам на въезд в США, эта его позиция не встретила одобрения. Однако уже в марте 2016, по данным опроса, значительная часть американцев полностью поддержала эту линию Трампа. Отдельный болезненный вопрос для арабского мира — позиция нового президента США в отношении арабо-израильского конфликта. «Трамп, — пишет выше упомянутый журналист Х.Аль Маена, — также не принесет ничего хорошего для арабской линии: наивный и не опытный он будет делать только то, что полагает хорошим для себя. И действительно, — заключает он, — как можно относиться с симпатией к арабам, если они вцепились друг другу в глотки». Не только Х.Аль Маена, но и многие арабские комментаторы отмечают, что Трамп позитивно высказывался об Израиле и даже вроде обещал перенести посольство США в Иерусалим — объявленную, но не признанную столицу Израильского государства. «Джерусалем Пост» уже подчеркивало, что «израильские правые восприняли победу Д.Трампа как «конец эры Палестинского государства».

25273,Representative Government or Thugocracy?,"Print 
I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. ” 
– Hillary Clinton 
The first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News’ Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate) was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
Those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing “dog whistle politics,” rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clinton’s response to Wallace’s question (where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted) however, was representative of this tactic. 
While women’s rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court (since objectively, women wouldn’t appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population), Clinton’s answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
“Women’s rights” is of course “dog whistle” for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. “LGBT rights” is “dog whistle” for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. (at least not at present); however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
Let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clinton’s overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clinton’s stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
Clinton’s reference to “powerful corporations and the wealthy” and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for “dark, unaccountable money,” the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood , with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros , the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. 
One need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clinton’s debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date – and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office – should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press (mainstream media), there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obama’s rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
In recent days, we’ve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality that’s been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clinton’s popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. 
The bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans – not just voters, and not just Republicans – need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
The burning question is this: In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?",1
25274,Dunking With the No-Names? N.B.A. Fans Haven’t Minded Yet - The New York Times,"This is definitely not the way that announcers in New Orleans  —   or, for that matter, commentators on the TNT network  —   will introduce the   lineup for the N. B. A. ’s slam dunk contest on Saturday night. “Please welcome   …     Aaron Gordon, who has averaged 8. 8 points per game in three seasons for the Orlando Magic   …     “Derrick Jones Jr. who has scored a total of 11 points in seven games for the Phoenix Suns   …     “Glenn Robinson III, with his 4.  average over five seasons for three different teams . .. “And DeAndre Jordan, the one name casual fans should know, with his   averages of 8. 9 points and 10 rebounds in nine years with the titleless Los Angeles Clippers. ” You will not hear any such statistics cited on   Saturday night, even though it is absolutely true that none of the participants have managed to average 9 points a game over the course of a career. The N. B. A. which can no longer persuade its biggest names to participate in such a risky novelty event, seems to be doing just fine with its   and   players headlining the dunk contest. Last year’s event, in Toronto, for example, was an aesthetic and ratings success. Once airborne, the contest was a   showdown between Zach LaVine, the eventual winner, and Gordon that brought back memories of Michael Jordan versus Dominique Wilkins in the 1980s, minus the outsize reputations. LaVine passed the ball behind his back before one dunk. Gordon routed it through his legs on a reverse dunk. According to The Associated Press, the telecast drew seven million viewers at its peak, the highest total for any cable show that night. A dunk contest among LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin and John Wall would surely attract a larger audience. But the event requires too much rehearsal and too many hard landings for such a commitment by established superstars. LaVine has emerged recently as something of a dunk celebrity, and he might have given the contest in New Orleans a significant boost. But even before his season ended this month with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, LaVine announced that he would not vie for a third consecutive victory. There are only so many ways you can ram a basketball through a hoop. “I feel like I’ve accomplished everything I could in the dunk contest,” LaVine, 21, told reporters last month. “It would be hard for me to go back and outdo myself. I’m never saying I won’t ever do it again, but I’m focused on this year. Getting the rest and just focusing more on just the game is the main thing. ” While the cast of daredevils continues to change, there remains a core fan base that simply loves outrageous pretzel jams by relatively anonymous contestants. That theory will be put to its biggest test on Saturday, with the quartet of    ? If even this event manages to pull strong ratings, organizers should consider an even greater leap of faith: Do participants really need to be N. B. A. players, or basketball players at all? Couldn’t tall,   acrobats manage even trickier circus dunks? The league could include both players and nonplayers, calling the event “Dunking With the Stars. ” When it comes to luring big names to its   break antics, Major League Baseball has easily eclipsed the N. B. A. Baseball continues to showcase some of its biggest stars in its home run derby  —   which has attracted TV viewership similar to the dunk contest’s in recent years. But its audience appeal also seems more dependent on   names. Giancarlo Stanton beat such notables as Robinson Cano and Todd Frazier in 2016, when the derby drew 5. 5 million viewers, according to the Sports TV Ratings website. Viewership was higher in 2015, at 7. 1 million, when Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs joined the festivities. It may be that baseball’s stars are more easily persuaded to participate in the home run derby because the contest requires little practice and, unlike the dunk contest’s reliance on judging, is decided by a simple, objective standard  —   how many baseballs are knocked over the wall. Still, even such a straightforward event requires a great deal of energy and is not tailored for frazzled veterans. “The home run derby wears you out,” David Ortiz told WEEI. com when he decided not to participate in the 2016 event. “It’s good for the younger guys to do it, puts you on the map for a minute. It takes everything out of you. You definitely have to be in your 20s to do it. ” That goes double for the dunk contest. Double twist, with a reverse finish.",1
25276,"Park Geun-hye, South Korea’s Ousted Leader, Is Arrested and Jailed to Await Trial - The New York Times","SEOUL, South Korea  —   South Korea’s recently impeached president, Park   was arrested on Friday, becoming the first South Korean leader to be put behind bars since the mid 1990s, when two former military dictators were imprisoned on corruption and mutiny charges. Ms. Park’s dramatic downfall capped months of turmoil and intrigue, as huge crowds took to the streets to protest a sprawling corruption scandal that shook the interlocking worlds of government and business  —   including the leadership of Samsung, the nation’s largest conglomerate. A judge at the Seoul Central District Court issued the warrant early Friday morning, warning that if Ms. Park were not taken into custody quickly she might “destroy evidence. ” The charges against her include bribery, extortion and abuse of power. In December, the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impeach Ms. Park, and she was formally removed from office on March 10. Her removal rattled the delicate balance of relationships across Asia at a tense moment. Ms. Park’s conservatives, in power for four years, had joined the United States in pressing for a hard line against North Korea’s nuclear program. She had accepted Washington’s deployment of an advanced missile defense system that has angered China, which is fearful of an arms race in the region. Moon   the liberal opposition leader considered most likely to win the May 9 election to select a new president, has vowed to review that decision, as well as an unpopular deal she struck with Japan over the   comfort women, or Korean sex slaves, used by Japan’s army during World War II. Mr. Moon is also viewed as less confrontational toward North Korea and China, and has advocated dialogue to halt the North’s nuclear and missile threats. Ms. Park had spent the night in the prosecutor’s office waiting to learn if she would be placed under arrest. Shortly after 3 a. m. Judge Kang   issued the warrant and Ms. Park was taken to a jail outside Seoul, the South Korean capital. Prosecutors had already said that they would indict the former president on 13 criminal charges regardless of whether the judge issued an arrest warrant. Once her trial begins in the coming weeks, Ms. Park will commute from her cell to a Seoul courthouse. Ms. Park was accused of conspiring with a longtime confidante, Choi   to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses, including more than $38 million in bribes from Samsung. Both Ms. Choi and Samsung’s top executive, Lee   have previously been arrested and are standing trial on charges including bribery. On Thursday, hundreds of emotional supporters were gathered near her   red brick house in southern Seoul as her motorcade pulled out for the hearing. Some tried to push past police officers lining the road. “We can’t let you go!” they shouted, some of them trying to hurl themselves onto the road. Protesters also threw yellow plastic police fences at uniformed officers who tried to push them back. The   ride was nationally televised, with a fleet of television crews following her car. If she is convicted of bribery, Ms. Park, 65, could face between 10 years and life in prison, although her successor has the power to free her with a special presidential pardon. Ms. Park’s arrest added another tragic chapter to the story of her family, which has mirrored the country’s tumultuous modern history. Her father, Park   who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979, was considered the initiator of the country’s dramatic economic growth but was also vilified as a dictator who used martial law and torture to silence dissidents. In 1974, her mother, Yuk   was fatally shot by a   Korean assassin who had targeted her husband. Ms. Park’s father was assassinated five years later by his spy chief. After leaving the presidential Blue House, Ms. Park lived in seclusion, unmarried and without children. In the succeeding decades, while the country moved toward democracy, her family drew little attention. Then in the late 1990s, as the economy faltered in the financial spasms that engulfed Asia, and South Koreans began yearning for the kind of charismatic and stern leadership her father represented, Ms. Park was catapulted into political stardom. She seized the opportunity and won a parliamentary seat in 1998, casting herself as a faithful daughter on a mission to rebuild the nation and restore the honor of her father and his generation, whom she credited with fighting Communism and creating a vibrant,   economy from the ashes of the   Korean War. In 2013, she returned to the Blue House, her childhood home, after winning the presidential election. She was the first child of a former president to win the presidency. Older South Koreans were among her most fervent supporters, while critics warned that she was trying to take the country back to its authoritarian past. Four years later, her career ended in disgrace. In a speech last November, as the growing scandal paralyzed her government, she tearfully confided that she regretted ever becoming president. While a majority of South Koreans believe her ouster was merited, Ms. Park’s fall from grace has been hard to accept for many older, conservative South Koreans who still worshiped her father and family as Koreans once did their ancient kings. “Your highness, I am so sorry that I am powerless to protect you,” an old woman recently wailed on the pavement in front of Ms. Park’s home. “Please forgive me, your highness. ” Since she returned to her home on March 12, hundreds of supporters holding South Korean flags have been rallying daily outside the house to protest her impeachment and oppose her arrest. Ms. Park, who has never accepted the Constitutional Court ruling that ended her presidency, did not answer questions shouted from reporters as she walked into the courthouse on Thursday. But she had earlier denied any legal wrongdoing. Last fall, local news media and former associates of Ms. Choi’s began exposing lurid details of Ms. Park’s alleged conspiracy to abuse her presidential authority to help Ms. Choi, one of her few friends, to collect bribes or extort large “donations” from big businesses. With the economy slowing and youth unemployment rising, the allegations convinced people that Ms. Park had inherited the worst traits of her father: an authoritarian streak and corrupt ties with the business elite. They took to the streets in central Seoul, up to two million at a time, marching peacefully to demand her resignation. When she refused to step down, the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impeach her on Dec. 9, and she was formally removed from office on March 10. Ms. Park was the first South Korean leader to be forced from office in response to popular pressure since the country’s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960 after protests against his corrupt, authoritarian rule. Two former presidents  —   the military dictators Chun   and Roh    —   were arrested in 1995 on charges of each collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes. The two men, former army generals, also faced sedition and mutiny charges for their roles in the 1979 military coup that brought them to power and in the 1980 massacre of antigovernment demonstrators in the southwestern city of Gwangju. Mr. Chun was sentenced to life in prison while Mr. Roh was sentenced to 17 years. Both were pardoned and released in December 1997.",1

25279,Thousands March in Venezuela to Demand President’s Ouster - The New York Times,"CARACAS, Venezuela  —   Thousands took to the streets here on Thursday to demand the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro in what appeared to be the year’s largest display of frustration with Venezuela’s economic collapse and leadership. The march, which protesters called “the taking of Caracas,” was organized by political opponents of the country’s ruling leftists. The marchers took over a major highway and several avenues in Caracas, the nation’s capital, and poured into the city’s plazas in an effort to gain momentum for a referendum to recall Mr. Maduro. But the discontent was far greater than mere political frustration in a country that has spiraled into economic ruin. Some protesters traveled for hours from parts of Venezuela where they said they could no longer find enough food. Others said they could not find work, or that their cities were plagued by violence and suffering from a lack of government presence. Ivonne Mejías, 42, who wore a headband of yellow, blue and red, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, said the situation had become so difficult that she had not been able to bake birthday cakes for her children this year. Her family of four gets by on just $25 a week, Ms. Mejías said, and she has taken to making piñatas to earn extra money. “Sometimes I want to kill myself,” she said. “I am frustrated, I am out of control, I am fighting with this world. This isn’t my life. My soul splits in two when my kids beg for something  —   for an ice cream, for a cookie  —   and I can’t give it to them. The most difficult thing is getting food. ” Víctor Guilarte, 45, a mechanic from a Caracas suburb, said his work had vanished because his neighbors had become so poor they could not afford car repairs. Two weeks ago, he said, he visited his family in another state and found the situation even worse. “I came back feeling destroyed  —   they had no food,” he said. “I am tired of Maduro and his government, tired of crime, of hunger, of them telling us we have plenty to eat. I want a referendum, and if there is no referendum, I want him to resign. ” Mr. Maduro called on his supporters to take to the streets to stage a counterprotest, which drew crowds dressed in red, the color of former President Hugo Chávez’s leftist movement. The government also appeared to be cracking down on opponents. Days earlier, Daniel Ceballos, an opposition leader under house arrest on charges of inciting violence, was transferred to a jail cell. The government said he had planned to agitate for violence during the protest. Other opposition parties said members had either been arrested or gone into hiding. The authorities were also trying to tamp down foreign news media coverage. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group based in New York, said Wednesday that at least six journalists, including two from Al Jazeera and one from the French newspaper Le Monde, were barred from entering the country at the airport. Jim Wyss, a reporter for The Miami Herald, was allowed to enter, only to be forced to leave despite having a valid journalist visa, The Herald said. “He was doing his job when he was detained,” said Aminda Marqués Gonzalez, the paper’s executive editor. In a nation where the price of bread rises each week, along with the length of bakery lines, there has been no shortage of anger and desperation. The spring was characterized by droughts that stalled the nation’s hydroelectric system. Blackouts rolled across the country, shutting off the lights in homes and emergency rooms. Mr. Maduro announced a cut in the workweek, to four days  —   and later to two  —   to conserve electricity. By summer, the nation’s food supply was dwindling. The lines where Venezuelans had been accustomed to waiting for food turned into mobs that attacked bakeries, butcher shops and groceries. Delivery trucks were also attacked, their contents looted. The government ordered the food supply to be transported under armed guards. That dire situation led many to make long journeys to the capital to vent their complaints on Thursday. It was unclear how many participated in the march, and government officials had sought to forestall a large demonstration. Official roadblocks appeared Wednesday night at tunnels leading to Caracas, snarling traffic for hours as the police questioned passengers about their motives. Gerardo Molina, 21, a political science student from Zulia, a state in Venezuela’s far west, made a   bus journey to join the march, a trip he said would have taken eight hours if the police were not monitoring the roads. Mr. Molina expressed the worry typical of many young Venezuelans who fear they may never inherit the rich petro state that had given their parents assurances of a comfortable life. Many young people have simply packed their bags and sought a future in other South American countries where the economies are more prosperous. “Young people are the ones who suffer the most because we feel we have no future,” Mr. Molina said. “I don’t want to leave this country, which is why I came to this march. ” Marly Torrealba, 37, a single mother, came by bus from Barlovento, a city once known for its cacao production. Ms. Torrealba complained that the government had abandoned the city to organized crime, and it was now rocked by killings, extortions and kidnappings. “Farm workers have abandoned the crop because of crime,” she said, “and the criminals charge us protection money and rob everything in sight. ” While the Maduro government was the target of the protests, much seemed to be at stake for Venezuela’s political opposition, which has struggled to translate the anger of the country’s collapse into popular support. The opposition, riding a wave of discontent with Mr. Maduro, took over the National Assembly in January. Its members promised to enact   reforms that would revive the collapsing economy free a number of jailed political leaders and, most crucially, have a referendum that they said would remove Mr. Maduro from office within months. None of that has come to pass. Mr. Maduro, backed by a Supreme Court controlled by leftists, quickly managed to block the opposition’s reform measures, overturning a bill to free political prisoners and using the courts to grant himself expanded presidential powers over the objections of Congress. Even the movement to recall him has been stalled. Opposition politicians promised to hold a vote this year on the referendum, which would force leftists to hold a new election if Mr. Maduro lost. However, the country’s electoral body issued a timetable in which the vote would be held next year if Mr. Maduro were removed, his handpicked vice president would serve out the end of his term, which ends in 2019. Opposition leaders vowed on Thursday to redouble their efforts to remove the president. “Everyone wake up Maduro if he can manage to sleep,” Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader, wrote on Twitter. “All of Caracas is mobilizing itself for the referendum. To have a true homeland!”",1
25281,Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?,"Posted on October 29, 2016 by Michael Snyder 
Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a game changer into the mix . On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails “did not come from her private server”, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the “emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry”, and according to some reports there may be “potentially thousands” of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? 
Let’s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN … 
After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent” to the email probe. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote the chairmen. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton’s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton’s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered … 
We don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are… 
Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election. 
One thing is, it’s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her… 
If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? 
It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. 
So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. 
But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason… 
If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. 
But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. 
In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be “fair” until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. 
Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. 
And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November… 
An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. 
Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. 
So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. 
At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

25282,Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence,"Tweet Home » Headlines » World News » Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence 
There is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. Voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, it may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 

From Michael Snyder : 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let’s hope that it doesn’t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. 
Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned “about the possibility of violence” on election day… 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are “very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are “very confident” about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Famewas destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump’s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June… 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate’s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump’s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump’s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, “Why can’t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. “The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‘some thugs’ that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let’s certainly hope that we don’t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is “grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today… 
“Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I’ve been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan’s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to “declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960. 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month… 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome. 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. On Sale At SD Bullion… This Week Only…",1
25285,Trump on Syria’s Assad Following Chemical Weapons Attack: ’Something Should Happen’ - Breitbart,"(Associated Press) PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   The Trump administration hinted at military action against Syria Thursday as the president and top officials considered how to retaliate against President Bashar Assad for this week’s chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 people. Military leaders discussed options with the White House, likely including a missile strike. [President Donald Trump suggested that Assad may have to leave power, and his comments were strongly underscored by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told reporters “there’s no role for him to govern the Syrian people. ”  The administration has been put to the test this week amid an international outcry over the newly horrifying violence in Syria. Over the past seven years, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the nation’s civil war, triggering the worst refugee crisis since World War II. Trump’s tone has grown more grave with the passing days. On Wednesday, he said this week’s attack crossed “a lot of lines”  —   not just the “red line” of chemical weapons use that President Barack Obama once set as an ultimatum for the Assad government. Trump has shown a particularly emotional response to photos and video of dead children, and he said Thursday, “I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity. ” Asked if Assad should remain in power, he said that “he’s there and I guess he’s running things so something should happen. ” Trump commented aboard Air Force One en route to meet China’s President Xi Jinping at a Florida summit. Top defense leaders were discussing military options developed by the Pentagon with the president, U. S. officials said. They commented only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to address the sensitive information publicly by name. The range of options would be likely to mirror those shelved at the last minute by the Obama administration in 2013. Then, the U. S. was poised to launch missiles from ships in the Mediterranean, targeting military air fields, command and control facilities and other key locations. A precise missile strike, potentially against targets associated with the chemical weapons attack, could be considered an appropriate and measured response, especially in an area where there would be little possibility Russian troops would be present. The U. S. doesn’t want to start a war with Moscow, and there are Russian troops, aircraft and other equipment on most of the Syrian bases. Tillerson, who spoke almost simultaneously after greeting Xi in Florida, said there was “no doubt in our minds” that Assad’s government was behind the attacks and the U. S. was evaluating an appropriate response. “The process by which Assad would leave is something that will require an international community effort,” Tillerson said, adding that there needs to be a balance between defeating the Islamic State group and stabilizing Syria to prevent the civil war from escalating further. Tillerson also issued a warning to Russia that its support of the Assad government is something that it should “consider carefully. ” Late Wednesday, Trump advisers had huddled at the White House to discuss options for responding to the chemical attack, including both military action and economic sanctions, according to a senior administration official. It was unclear how fast the president planned to decide and implement a response, according to the official, who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive planning. Tillerson has been in contact with his Russian counterparts, the official said, but Trump has not spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump told reporters traveling with him to Florida Thursday that he may speak with Putin. In Moscow, Putin’s spokesman said Russia’s support for Assad has limits but there must be a full investigation of the attack before the United Nations takes any action. As for Russia’s influence, Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with The Associated Press that “it is not correct to say that Moscow can convince Mr. Assad to do whatever is wanted in Moscow. This is totally wrong. ” In Washington, two senior Republican senators called for Trump to strike at Syria’s air force as part of a swift and forceful response to the attack, which killed more than   children. Sens. John McCain of Arizona, who spoke to Trump on Wednesday, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement that Assad “must pay a punitive cost for this horrific attack. ” “This is a test of the new administration, but also for our entire country,” said Graham and McCain, who have been among Trump’s harshest congressional critics. “Assad is trying to see what he can get away with. ” Graham later told reporters he doesn’t believe Trump needs Congress to authorize the use of military force in Syria. He added that the Senate has become so dysfunctional it may be difficult to get Republicans and Democrats to agree on a resolution approving the use of force. “Hit this guy,” Graham said of Assad. “You’ve got my full permission. ” He said he has not talked to Trump about military options. But Sen. Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, took a more measured approach, saying he first wanted to hear from the White House what military options it may be considering. Asked if he supported grounding Syria’s air force, Corker told reporters he’d “like to see what the administration proposes. ” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce,  . said he was glad that Trump was meeting with national security advisers to consider options to hold Assad accountable. He encouraged Trump to consult with Congress, too. “The use of chemical weapons is abhorrent, and Assad’s brazen gassing of men, women and children cannot be tolerated,” Royce said.",1
25287,"Spaniards, Exhausted by Politics, Warm to Life Without a Government - The New York Times","MADRID  —   For the past 288 days, Spain has plodded along without an elected national government. For some Spaniards, this is a wonderful thing. “No government, no thieves,” said Félix Pastor, a language teacher who, like many voters, is fed up with the corruption and scandals that tarnished the two previous governing parties. Mr. Pastor, a wiry, animated    said Spain could last without a government “until hell freezes over” because politicians were in no position to do more harm. After two grueling national elections in six months, and with a third vote possible in December, no party has won enough seats or forged the coalition needed to form a government. For the first time in Spain’s four decades as a modern democracy, this country of 47 million people has a caretaker government. That has produced an unprecedented public spectacle: Politicians scheme and plot but reject the difficult compromises needed to form a government. Voters watch ruefully with a mix of fascination and contempt. On Saturday, the Socialists’ leader, Pedro Sánchez, stepped down in a move that could open the way for his party to agree to the   of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and a government led by his conservative Popular Party. But while the Socialists’ revolt could break the deadlock, it may do little to heal Spaniards’ frustration with a crisis that has further eroded their faith in politicians. Spain’s leaders warned that having no government would mean chaos and deprivation. Instead, more than anything, the crisis seems to have offered a glimpse of life if politicians simply stepped out of the way. For many here, it has not been all that bad. “Spain would be just fine if we got rid of most of the politicians and   of government employees,” Rafael Navarro, 71, said inside his tiny storefront pharmacy in Madrid. Too little government is better than too much, he said. In some ways, this is a phantom crisis for ordinary Spaniards. There has been no United   government shutdown. There are no mounds of uncollected garbage, no unpaid police officers, no shuttered ministries, no public trains or buses halted. Budget money is still flowing. Government ministries are functioning. Social service recipients and civil servants are being paid. Even if no new government has been formed when the 2016 national budget expires this fall, the old budget will simply become the new budget for 2017. But government is paralyzed in other ways. Nobody is proposing legislation, debating international affairs or even rotating Spain’s ambassadors. Funding for many infrastructure and government projects is frozen. And nationalist movements in Catalonia and the Basque region continue to roil national politics. Spain has been in political limbo since last October, when Mr. Rajoy called a general election while he held a parliamentary majority. His Popular Party then won the most votes in December and June, but did not win a majority. It now holds 137 of the 350 seats in Parliament. The stalemate has come at an opportune moment. After a severe recession ended in 2013, Spain’s economy rebounded. Growth is forecast to be 2. 9 percent this year, almost twice the 1. 6 percent eurozone average expected by the European Commission. Interest and energy rates are at historic lows. Spain, a tourism superpower, expects 74 million visitors this year, six million more than last year, as terrorism fears elsewhere send visitors here. Cafes and museums are crowded, and hotels are booked solid. But after trudging to the polls twice already in the last year, weary voters are in no mood to vote again. The political calendar dictates a vote on Christmas if no agreement to form a government can be reached by Oct. 31. The impasse has dragged on so long that “it’s like ‘Groundhog Day’ every day,” said Pedro Rodríguez, an assistant professor of international relations at a private university in Madrid. Until the recent and chaotic revolt within the Socialist Party, said Nacho Cardero, the editor of El Confidencial, a news website, reader clicks on stories about the crisis had dropped steadily. “People are exhausted,” Mr. Cardero said. “They don’t want to hear one more thing from these politicians. ” Spaniards were hopeful for better government in December, after two new parties, for the first time, won a third of the seats in Parliament. That set off a political    because no single party has been able to muster a majority. Nine months later, many voters complain that the new parties have adopted the same cynical and corrosive politics practiced under the entrenched   system. The two traditional parties  —   the conservative Popular Party and the Socialist Party  —   could have agreed on a new government, but they refused to talk to each other. “Negotiating or giving concessions is perceived as weakness,” said Antonio Roldán, a lawmaker from the upstart Ciudadanos party. Manuel de la Rocha Vázquez, an economic adviser in the Socialist Party, said Spain was so polarized that politics had turned almost into a brawl. “There are only insults and blame and arrogance,” he said. In one survey by the polling company Metroscopia, respondents chose the same few words to describe their feelings about the political deadlock: disappointment, indignation, shame, weariness and deception. In the same survey, Spaniards blamed politicians rather than the party system for the impasse, 58 percent to 20 percent. Other surveys suggest that a December election would produce the same result as the previous two: a Popular Party victory but no majority, according to Metroscopia’s president, José Juan Toharia. Angela Jover Pascual, 26, a waitress and mother of two, said she could not even remember which small party she had voted for in June. She said she had voted only as a protest against the bigger parties. Asked whether she would be ready to vote for a third time in one year, Ms. Jover Pascual replied: “No. It’s useless. ” Mr. Rajoy, the caretaker prime minister, has been able to sit back as the Socialist Party tears itself apart. His party’s powerful political machine and reliable conservative and elderly voters confer an advantage, especially if other frustrated voters stay home. While still a   fever for now, however, the crisis could yet flare into a debilitating illness. Some economists warn that a day of reckoning is coming. Spain’s debt and unemployment rates, for instance, are among the highest in Europe. Madrid faces a fine of 5 billion euros, about $5. 6 billion, if it fails to comply this year with its agreed deficit target from the European Commission of 4. 6 percent of gross domestic product. “We have really painted ourselves into a corner,” said José María de Areilza, a law professor in Madrid. For now, things are fairly stable in part because Spain grants considerable powers to its 17 regional governments. They have continued to provide health care, education and other pillars of daily life. “For a Spanish citizen, the most relevant government is the regional one,” said Santiago Lago Peñas, an economics professor in the Galicia region in northwest Spain. But deep within government institutions in Madrid, the crisis is inflicting pain. Joaquín Sánchez Sanz, the director of a nuclear fusion lab for the government agency Ciemat, said he spent about 40 percent of every day dealing with cutbacks imposed by the caretaker government. Just five days before a contract was to be signed to supply cooling equipment to a lab in Japan, the project was canceled, Mr. Sánchez Sanz said. Moreover, every agency contract not already signed was canceled. He does not blame the government crisis for every cutback, but it has created a climate of uncertainty. “If you cannot honor your contracts, next time they want collaboration, they might look somewhere else because now we are not credible,” Mr. Sánchez Sanz said. Many voters in outlying regions view the political fight in Madrid as a constant but distant irritant. “We already knew that politicians were corrupt, but now we also see that they can’t even make politics work,” said Ana Cancela, a civil servant who voted on Sept. 25 in Galicia’s regional elections in Santiago de Compostela, 370 miles from Madrid. Nationwide, wrangling over how to form the next government has many voters wondering: What is the point? “A lot of people said we would go to hell if we didn’t form a government,” said Ignacio Escolar, the editor of the news website eldiario. es. “But we’re still here. ”",1
25288,WikiLeaks Documents Reveal United Nations Interest In UFOs,"WikiLeaks Documents Reveal United Nations Interest In UFOs 11/02/2016 
HUFFINGTON POST 
Revelations in a set of hacked emails released by WikiLeaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about UFOs and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth. But a very significant ― and possibly overlooked ― group of WikiLeaks items relevant to the topic was released on May 18, 2015. 
WikiLeaks posted more than half a million U.S. State Department diplomatic documents from 1978 detailing America’s interactions with countries all around the world ― including Grenada Prime Minister Eric Gairy’s efforts to organize a United Nations-based committee to research and investigate global UFO reports. 
Many of the documents, written by American UN officials, indicated how closely they were monitoring Grenada’s UFO-related activities. 
One document , from Nov. 18, 1978, revealed my involvement in helping Grenada to produce a credible UFO presentation. 
I had an opportunity in early 1978 to meet Gairy in New York to present an idea about how I thought the UN would pay attention to his UFO crusade. Through his ambassadors, I gave him a copy of a documentary record album, “UFOs: The Credibility Factor,” that I produced for CBS Inc. in 1975. 
Gairy and I met, and after I convinced him I could bring a very credible group of speakers to the UN, he agreed to sponsor my proposal (see image below). Shortly after a handshake deal, he made me a temporary delegate-adviser of Grenada and the rest was, well, history. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL This 1978 letter from Grenada to Lee Speigel confirmed that country’s commitment to sponsor Speigel’s UFO presentation at the United Nations. 
The following image shows part of the group I brought together in July 1978 to meet with UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. He wanted to know what we were planning to do at our November event in front of the Special Political Committee, which included representatives from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL On July 14, 1978, producer Lee Speigel (now a Huffington Post writer) brought together a group of military, scientific and psychological experts to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to discuss Speigel’s upcoming presentation to the U.N. Special Political Committee later that year. Topic: The importance of establishing an international UFO committee. Pictured from left: USAF astronaut Col. Gordon Cooper, astronomer Jacques Vallee, astronomer/astrophysicist Claude Poher, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, Grenada Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy, Waldheim, Morton Gleisner of the Special Political Committee, Lee Speigel, researcher Leonard Stringfield and University of Colorado psychologist David Saunders. 
Another cable posted on WikiLeaks , from Nov. 24, 1978, refers to Ambassador Richard Petree’s meeting with Grenada representatives “to discuss their UFO resolution. Ambassador Petree acknowledged the high level of interest in UFOs among some elements of the private sector and scientific community … and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the U.S. and other countries.” 
On Nov. 28, 1978, the day after our presentation at the UN, this document was sent through official channels, detailing the actual UFO event, describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations. 
A few days after that, on Dec. 2, 1978, a follow-up cable was transmitted, including the following: 
Subsequent to the introduction of the Grenadian UFO resolution, Misoff [Mission Officer] has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions, which included representation from Austria, USSR and Grenada, in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem. 
A draft decision to be taken by the Special Political Committee (SPC) has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations, subject to concurrence of their respective capitals. We think referral of the [UFO] matter to the Outer Space Committee (OSC) without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken, provides the flexibility the OSC needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate. 
It will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution (and gamble on the results). 
The following week brought forth another document , on Dec. 8, 1978, which stated: 
“The General Assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects, and to inform the secretary-general of the observations, research and evaluation of such activities.” 
It was further suggested that Grenada’s views on UFOs could be discussed in 1979. Unfortunately, that didn’t come to pass, as Grenada Prime Minister Gairy was overthrown in a 1979 coup. 
Needless to say, without the Gairy-based initiative on UFOs, it was quietly relegated to Grenada’s back burner. 
This is the tip of the UFO-UN iceberg. It shows how the subject of UFOs wasn’t merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside. There was, and perhaps still is, some interest there, just waiting to emerge.",1
25292,Ted Cruz Announces Support for Donald Trump - The New York Times,"Senator Ted Cruz said on Friday that he would vote for Donald J. Trump for president, two months after Mr. Cruz pointedly declined to endorse his former rival in a speech at the Republican National Convention. “After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,” Mr. Cruz wrote in a statement on Facebook. For Mr. Cruz, who has fashioned himself as the unbending conscience of modern conservatism, the decision to endorse Mr. Trump is the latest remarkable gamble in a career defined by them, placing him in the corner of an ideologically elastic candidate who savaged Mr. Cruz  —   and, often, the senator’s family  —   at every turn during the nominating contest. But Mr. Trump’s rise in the polls, combined with a handful of political overtures from Mr. Trump and his team in recent days, left Mr. Cruz effectively boxed in, raising the possibility that a narrow Trump defeat could be laid at his feet. In his statement, Mr. Cruz said he had based his decision on two factors: a prior pledge to support the Republican nominee  —   which Mr. Cruz said in July had been “abrogated” by Mr. Trump’s personal attacks on him  —   and his desire to defeat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. “If Clinton wins, we know  —   with 100 percent certainty  —   that she would deliver on her   promises, with devastating results for our country,” Mr. Cruz said. “My conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop that. ” But Mr. Cruz’s statement went beyond the perfunctory, praising the policy aims and recent campaign promises of a man he once called a “pathological liar. ” Mr. Cruz did not address the personal attacks that Mr. Trump had leveled  —   always without hesitation, often without evidence  —   against the Texas senator and his family during the nominating fight. Among other slights, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Cruz’s eligibility for the presidency, citing his birth in Canada seemed to disparage the appearance of Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi, in a Twitter post and insinuated that Mr. Cruz’s father, Rafael, was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Then there was the   nickname: “Lyin’ Ted. ” In recent weeks, several former aides and allies to Mr. Cruz had urged him not to publicly back Mr. Trump, on both principled and pragmatic grounds. Such support could be seen as jeopardizing Mr. Cruz’s professed reputation for conservative ideological purity, given Mr. Trump’s   political views, which Mr. Cruz delighted in highlighting during his presidential campaign. And by voicing his support so late in the campaign, the senator also risks feeding a perception, rampant among Senate colleagues, that he is a cynical political operator, mindful only of his own interests. At his convention speech in July, Mr. Cruz urged Republicans to “vote your conscience,” leaving the stage in Cleveland to cascading boos. The next morning, as delegates from his home state jeered him at a breakfast, Mr. Cruz said he refused to fall in line like a “servile puppy dog. ” Mr. Trump, for his part, said this summer that he would not accept Mr. Cruz’s endorsement anyway. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he was “greatly honored” to have the backing of a “tough and brilliant opponent. ” As news of Mr. Cruz’s plans surfaced, first on Politico, some Cruz allies wasted no time registering their displeasure. “I’m just trying to get this Cruz sticker off my car,” Rick Tyler, the senator’s campaign spokesman, said shortly after the endorsement was announced. “I don’t want anybody to get the wrong idea and think I’m a Trump supporter. ” Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative radio host who had supported Mr. Cruz, called the senator’s decision “the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. ” Voters’ responses were often no kinder. “I am ashamed to have supported you,” one man wrote. “Conservatism is dead,” said another. While Mr. Cruz is widely expected to pursue the presidency again, he faces a 2018 Senate   campaign first. In recent days, signs of a tentative peace between the Cruz and Trump camps had begun to surface. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s campaign issued a news release that was supportive of Mr. Cruz’s latest Senate venture: his opposition to the federal government’s plan to end its oversight of the internet’s master directory of website addresses. Mr. Trump also included a close Cruz ally, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, on a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, which Mr. Cruz praised in his statement. Mr. Trump also now employs some members of the Cruz orbit: Jason Miller, who was a top adviser to the senator’s campaign, and Kellyanne Conway, who ran a   “super PAC” before becoming Mr. Trump’s campaign manager. “Hell froze over today,” Ms. Conway wrote on Twitter after the endorsement, “and it feels like heaven. ” Longtime Cruz supporters could be forgiven for experiencing whiplash. On Friday, Mr. Cruz cheered Mr. Trump’s vow to nominate justices “in the mold” of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. In the primaries, he regularly disparaged Mr. Trump’s judgment on judicial matters, holding forth on a “radical   extremist” federal judge who happens to be Mr. Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. On Friday, Mr. Cruz named Mr. Trump’s immigration policy as a bright spot. In the primaries, he attacked Mr. Trump’s proposals as “amnesty. ” On Friday, Mr. Cruz cited “national security” as a reason to to back Mr. Trump. In the primaries, the senator described Mr. Trump as so unsteady that he might even use nuclear weapons against a friendly country like Denmark on a whim. Though Mr. Cruz spoke warmly of Mr. Trump early in the primary season, telling donors he planned to “bearhug” him in the hopes of winning his supporters if Mr. Trump faded, he let fly a blistering critique of Mr. Trump’s personal and political integrity just before leaving the race. “I’m going to do something I haven’t done for the entire campaign,” Mr. Cruz told reporters in Evansville, Ind. hours before decisively losing the state’s primary in May. “I’m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump. ” He went on to call Mr. Trump “a pathological liar” “utterly amoral” “a serial philanderer” and “a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country has ever seen. ” If voters did not stop him, Mr. Cruz said, “this country could well plunge into the abyss. ”",1
25293,Have We Lost Sight of the Promise of Public Schools? - The New York Times,"In the days leading up to and after Betsy DeVos’s confirmation as secretary of education, a hashtag spread across Twitter: #publicschoolproud. Parents and teachers tweeted photos of their kids studying, performing, eating lunch together. People of all races tweeted about how public schools changed them, saved them, helped them succeed. The hashtag and storytelling was a rebuttal to DeVos, who called traditional public schools a “dead end” and who bankrolled efforts to pass reforms in Michigan, her home state, that would funnel public funds in the form of vouchers into religious and privately operated schools and encouraged the proliferation of   charter schools. The tweets railed against DeVos’s labeling of public schools as an industry that needed to adopt the   principles of competition and choice. #Publicschoolproud was seen as an effort to show that public schools still mattered. But the enthusiastic defense obscured a larger truth: We began moving away from the “public” in public education a long time ago. In fact, treating public schools like a business these days is largely a matter of fact in many places. Parents have pushed for   policies that encourage shopping for public schools that they hope will give their children an advantage and for the expansion of charter schools that are run by private organizations with public funds. Large numbers of public schools have selective admissions policies that keep most kids out. And parents pay top dollar to buy into neighborhoods zoned to “good” public schools that can be as exclusive as private ones. The glaring reality is, whether we are talking about schools or other institutions, it seems as if we have forgotten what “public” really means. The word derives from the Latin word publicus, meaning “of the people. ” This concept  —   that the government belongs to the people and the government should provide for the good of the people  —   was foundational to the world’s nascent democracies. Where once citizens paid taxes to the monarchy in the hope that it would serve the public too, in democracies they paid taxes directly for infrastructure and institutions that benefited society as a whole. The tax dollars of ancient Athenians and Romans built roads and aqueducts, but they also provided free meals to widows whose husbands died in war. “Public” stood not just for how something was financed  —   with the tax dollars of citizens  —   but for a communal ownership of institutions and for a society that privileged the common good over individual advancement. Early on, it was this investment in public institutions that set America apart from other countries. Public hospitals ensured that even the indigent received good medical care  —   health problems for some could turn into epidemics for us all. Public parks gave access to the great outdoors not just to the wealthy who could retreat to their country estates but to the masses in the nation’s cities. Every state invested in public universities. Public schools became widespread in the 1800s, not to provide an advantage for particular individuals but with the understanding that shuffling the wealthy and working class together (though not black Americans and other racial minorities) would create a common sense of citizenship and national identity, that it would tie together the fates of the haves and the   and that doing so benefited the nation. A sense of the public good was a unifying force because it meant that the rich and the poor, the powerful and the meek, shared the spoils  —   as well as the burdens  —   of this messy democracy. Achieving this has never been an easy feat. The tension between individual striving and the common good, between the beliefs that strong government protects and provides for its citizens and that big government leads to tyranny, has always existed in this country. As a result, support for public institutions and expansive government has ebbed and flowed. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in response to the Great Depression, ushered through the biggest expansion of federal programs in our nation’s history, he did so because he thought that government regulation was necessary to empower common people against corporations and banks but also that government should provide certain protections for its citizens. Under the New Deal, we got Social Security and unemployment insurance. Federal housing projects  —   public housing  —   meant quality dwellings for the nation’s working people. Federal works projects employed millions of    Americans and brought infrastructure to communities that had not been able to pay for it on their own. At the same time, the New Deal stoked the ire of a   antiregulation minority, who began to push back, though it would take some decades before their views became mainstream. They promoted   principles, deregulation and the privatization of functions normally handled by the government and sought to define all things  —   like the benefits of education  —   strictly in terms of their economic value. Nonetheless, Roosevelt’s government expansion was widely supported, and Americans elected him to an unprecedented four terms as president. But the broad support of public programs and institutions hinged on a narrow definition of who that public was: white Americans. To get his New Deal passed, Roosevelt compromised with white Southerners in Congress, and much of the legislation either explicitly or implicitly discriminated against black citizens, denying them many of its benefits. As the civil rights movement gained ground in the 1950s and 1960s, however, a series of court rulings and new laws ensured that black Americans now had the same legal rights to public schools, libraries, parks and swimming pools as white Americans. But as black Americans became part of the public, white Americans began to pull away. Instead of sharing their public pools with black residents  —   whose tax dollars had also paid for them  —   white Americans founded private clubs (often with public funds) or withdrew behind their fences where they dug their own pools. Public housing was once seen as a community good that drew presidents for photo ops. But after federal housing policies helped white Americans buy their own homes in the suburbs, black Americans, who could not get   mortgages, languished in public housing, which became stigmatized. Where once public transportation showed a city’s forward progress, white communities began to fight its expansion, fearing it would give unwanted people access to their enclaves. And white Americans began to withdraw from public schools or move away from school districts with large numbers of black children once the courts started mandating desegregation. Some communities shuttered public schools altogether rather than allow black children to share publicly funded schools with white children. The very voucher movement that is at the heart of DeVos’s educational ideas was born of white opposition to school desegregation as state and local governments offered white children vouchers to pay for private schools  —   known as segregation academies  —   that sprouted across the South after the Supreme Court struck down school segregation in 1954. “What had been enjoyed as a public thing by white citizens became a place of forced encounter with other people from whom they wanted to be separate,” Bonnie Honig, a professor of political science and modern culture and media at Brown University and author of the forthcoming book “Public Things: Democracy in Disrepair,” told me. “The attractiveness of private schools and other forms of privatization are not just driven by economization but by the desire to control the community with which you interact. ” Even when they fail, the guiding values of public institutions, of the public good, are equality and justice. The guiding value of the free market is profit. The   charters DeVos helped expand have not provided an appreciably better education for Detroit’s children, yet they’ve continued to expand because they are profitable  —   or as Tom Watkins, Michigan’s former education superintendent, said, “In a number of cases, people are making a boatload of money, and the kids aren’t getting educated. ” Democracy works only if those who have the money or the power to opt out of public things choose instead to opt in for the common good. It’s called a social contract, and we’ve seen what happens in cities where the social contract is broken: White residents vote against tax hikes to fund schools where they don’t send their children, parks go untended and libraries shutter because affluent people feel no obligation to help pay for things they don’t need. “The existence of public things  —   to meet each other, to fight about, to pay for together, to enjoy, to complain about  —   this is absolutely indispensable to democratic life,” Honig says. If there is hope for a renewal of our belief in public institutions and a common good, it may reside in the public schools. Nine of 10 children attend one, a rate of participation that few, if any, other public bodies can claim, and schools, as segregated as many are, remain one of the few institutions where Americans of different classes and races mix. The vast multiracial, socioeconomically diverse defense of public schools that DeVos set off may show that we have not yet given up on the ideals of the public  —   and on ourselves.",1
25295,"Donald Trump’s Inauguration, Women’s March: Your Weekend Briefing - The New York Times","Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first. ” Those were the words of President Trump at his inauguration on Friday, just as rain began falling in the capital. His forceful address offered a strikingly grim view of the United States, repudiated the establishment and alarmed leaders around the world  —   but also energized his supporters at home and abroad. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first to have never served either in public office or as a military general. _____ 2. Hundreds of thousands of women gathered to protest Mr. Trump in Washington on Saturday, above, and many more demonstrated in cities around the nation and the world. Here is a photographic roundup. On Friday, protests in the capital turned violent at times. Mr. Trump begins his term with less popular support than any new president in modern times. _____ 3. These photos show a much smaller crowd for Mr. Trump’s inauguration than for Mr. Obama’s in 2009. Both were taken 45 minutes before the ceremony. Our reporters noted a “peculiar sensation”  in Washington, where pockets of eerie quiet existed as residents and others skipped town. Mr. Trump and his press secretary falsely claimed that Mr. Trump drew “the largest inaugural crowd ever. ” Mr. Trump also said the media had invented his friction with the intelligence community and called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth. ” _____ 4. The mood among Mr. Trump’s supporters was jubilant and beyond. “My savior is born,” yelled Amy Azzo, an Iraqi immigrant who traveled from Michigan for the inauguration. “President Trump  —   I love it. ” Scattered chants of “Lock her up!” came from the crowd, but Hillary Clinton strode on stage with a practiced smile. _____ 5. One of Mr. Trump’s first acts as president was to sign an executive order aimed at scaling back the Affordable Care Act. A report earlier in the week estimated that as many as 18 million people could lose insurance if major provisions of the health care law are repealed. A full digital turnover of whitehouse. gov happened within moments of Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and the official White House Twitter handles also changed over  —   but whether the president will forgo using his personal Twitter account remains unclear. _____ 6. The Senate confirmed the first two cabinet nominees: James N. Mattis as defense secretary, above, and John F. Kelly as homeland security secretary. Democrats delayed a vote on Mike Pompeo’s confirmation as C. I. A. director until Monday. And the Justice Department cleared Mr. Trump’s appointment of his    Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser, saying that the president’s special hiring authority exempted such a position from antinepotism laws. _____ 7. President Trump now oversees  the intelligence agencies that are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions for possible links between his associates and Russian officials. Among those being scrutinized are Paul Manafort, above, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative. It is not clear whether the communications have anything to do with Mr. Trump, but he has the authority to redirect or stop at least some of the efforts. _____ 8. Mr. Obama left for a family vacation in Palm Springs, Calif. after saying goodbye to about 2, 000 political appointees at Joint Base Andrews. The Obamas pledged to build democracy through the Obama Foundation. They will live in Washington. Joe Biden and his wife are looking for a small house in the same neighborhood. As the Obamas and Bidens headed out of town, Mr. Trump and his wife made stops at three official inaugural balls. We   to provide a look at the festivities. _____ 9. And the world keeps turning. Here’s a quick rundown of other top stories: • The Earth hit a record high temperature in 2016, for the third year in a row. • Chelsea Manning was granted clemency and will be released from prison in May. • The Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo was extradited to the United States. • An avalanche buried a hotel in Italy. In Tehran, above, a burning skyscraper collapsed on live TV. • A swarm of tornadoes in the Southeast U. S. killed at least 15 people. • The United States bombed Islamic State training camps in Libya and carried out a punishing airstrike against Al Qaeda in Syria. • At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Britain’s leader argued that the country is committed to free trade and globalization. • In tennis, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic were both knocked out of the Australian Open, and Rafael Nadal advanced. N. F. L. playoffs continue Sunday. _____ 10. Finally, one of our   articles this week was about the thousands of letters mailed to Mr. Obama each day of his presidency. He read 10 a day, selected by staff members and interns tasked with reading every message that arrived. They told the unfiltered story of a nation. “I never thought about how powerful a letter was,” one of the staffers told us. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

25300,How Millennials Became Spooked by Credit Cards - The New York Times,"Kids these days: They just aren’t pulling out the plastic like they did in the past. Data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the percentage of Americans under 35 who hold credit card debt has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, when the Fed began collecting data in a standardized way, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Some older Americans have also been shedding credit card debt since the financial crisis that began in 2008. But for no other age group has the decline in the proportion holding credit card debt been more rapid than it has been for young Americans  —   who are often referred to as millennials  —   the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows. “It’s pretty clear that young people are not interested in becoming indebted in the way that their parents are or were,” said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a newsletter that tracks the payment industry. Their reluctance could have lasting repercussions for millennials, as well as for the financial system and the economy. Early use of credit cards has, in the past, helped young Americans develop a comfort level with credit that can last a lifetime and lead to a succession of big purchases financed by debt. Without a substantial credit history, it is much harder to take out a home mortgage, for example. “It will probably take them longer to get access to credit,” said Gregory Elliehausen, an economist at the Federal Reserve specializing in consumer finance. “In the meantime, their behavior and some of their habits will have already been formed. ” Over all, Americans’ use of credit cards has recently been creeping up again: Household debt in the United States increased by $35 billion, to $12. 29 trillion, during the second quarter of 2016, a 0. 3 percent rise from the previous quarter that was driven by credit cards and auto loans, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Banks say that their credit card operations are running at full tilt, and that in recent months the number of people having trouble paying their bills has been at record lows. But many younger people have been sitting on the sidelines, deterred by new laws passed after the crisis and big loads of student debt. They are also spooked by the temptation that credit cards offer to spend beyond one’s means. Jason Towner, a    who works at a private equity firm, cut up his last credit card, from Capital One, in 2010. He did not have any unruly debts, but he had just watched his father and sister close the family furniture store after a bank cut off their credit line in the middle of the financial crisis. “I was seeing what was happening around the world, and what was happening in my backyard, and I was thinking, ‘This is not a great idea,’” Mr. Towner said recently. The resurgence of overall credit card use in the United States over the last year or two has been driven largely by subprime borrowers, according to the Federal Reserve, which has not looked at the recent growth in borrowing by age. But it is clear to economists who study payment patterns that millennials are gravitating toward payment methods that skirt both cash and credit. Why carry cash when you can whip out a debit card for the smallest transaction  —   a sandwich or a bottle of soda  —   or use an app like Venmo or an online payment service like PayPal? All of those typically draw funds directly from a bank account. Mr. Elliehausen of the Federal Reserve said he expected the aversion to debt among young Americans to continue, potentially with a downside. Credit cards are frequently necessary for the bigger purchases  —   like washing machines and computers  —   that can make households more efficient and help the economy grow. And credit cards are usually an essential part of the credit history that allows someone to borrow to buy a house. Only 37 percent of American households headed by someone aged 35 and under held credit card debt in 2013, the most recent year for which data from the Survey of Consumer Finances is available, down by nearly a quarter from immediately before the financial crisis. That statistic may undercount young cardholders to some extent, as it excludes people under 35 who live with their parents. But more recent data has also suggested that millennials are using credit cards less than people of a similar age did in the past  —   and that they are taking on fewer auto loans and mortgage loans than people of similar age did before the financial crisis. Rebecca Liebman, 23, graduated from Clark University in 2015 with a load of student debt. She avoided getting a credit card until earlier this year, and did so then only because she kept hearing about how she would need to build up her credit history if she ever hoped to get a mortgage. “I don’t want to use a credit card irresponsibly, and because of that, it’s scarier to use,” she said. “I grew up  —   I saw 2008  —   I saw my dad get laid off. I don’t trust the financial market. ” Today Ms. Liebman is a founder of a financial literacy site for millennials, LearnLux, and the reluctant holder of a Discover card. Even after getting the card, it took her five months to overcome her ingrained aversion to debt and make her first purchase  —   a physical wallet. She understands what the aversion will mean for her and for her customers. “It’s going to make me buy a home a lot later in life,” Ms. Liebman said. “I think it will impact a lot of big decisions and push them further out. There are some things that are going to be specific to our generation around financial   for sure. ” The reasons for the shift are varied: Like Ms. Liebman, many young people carry burdensome loads of student debt, making it hard for them to take on any more debt  —   and giving them a sour taste in their mouths when it comes to credit of any sort. The average American under 35 now has $17, 200 of student debt, 182 percent more than Americans of the same age had in 1995, the Fed data shows. On a more practical level, laws passed after the financial crisis made it much harder for younger people to secure cards unless they could prove they had the income to pay the bills. The tents that credit card companies used to pitch all over college campuses  —   offering students free   when they signed up for cards  —   have largely disappeared. Then there are the young professionals who are able to get a card, but have seen the strain that debt put on their families and friends during the financial crisis. Mr. Towner, whose job in private equity involves lending money to small businesses, is a prime example. To him, the risks involved with debt outweigh the benefits, so he tends to use Venmo and PayPal, or, whenever possible, cash. When he bought his apartment in Berkeley, Calif. he chose a foreclosure and paid with money he had in the bank. “I don’t want to go out and buy, buy, buy, even though that’s what society wants me to do,” Mr. Towner said. “I want to save and invest for the long term. ”",1
25302,President Trump: We Will Take New Steps on ’Improved Vetting Procedures’ - Breitbart,"“It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values,” President Trump said in his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. [“That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe  —   and to keep out those who would do us harm,” the president promised.  President Trump is expected to reveal those new steps when he signs a new executive order on refugees and immigration on Thursday. The signing was originally scheduled for Wednesday, but press reports indicate that the reaction to the president’s speech has been so positive, the White House chose to delay the signing so as to not step on its own positive message. The executive order President Trump signed on January 27, 2017,  “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” dealt specifically with those issues, but implementation of that order was derailed when Federal Judge James Robart of the Western District of Washington issued a temporary restraining order on February 3, 2017 halting it nationwide. Rather than engage in a lengthy court fight over the details of that executive order, President Trump has decided the fastest way to safeguard the country from foreign terrorist attacks is to sign a new executive order that has a higher likelihood of surviving the certain judicial challenges which will be brought against it by Democrats and their allies on the left. The president made two key points in his speech Tuesday that offer clues as to what his executive order may contain to improve vetting procedures. (1) He opposes uncontrolled entry of foreign nationals into the United States   …     (2) From places where proper vetting cannot occur. (emphasis added) President Trump does not view controlled entry of foreign nationals from places where proper vetting occurs as the most important priority in protecting the nation from foreign terrorists. The term “vetting” has been used most frequently in the press to refer to security background checks conducted on a particular type of permanent immigrant to the United States —  those entering legally under the federal refugee resettlement program, authorized by the Refugee Act of 1980. That act, as spelled out in subsequent regulations and procedures established by the departments charged with its implementation  —   The Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services  —   has established a series of protocols to be followed related to the security background and health of potential refugees allowed to enter the country. Those protocols, though vigorously defended by the Obama administration, have been widely panned by critics of the program, as well as President Trump, as ineffective in ascertaining security risks posed by potential participants in the federal refugee resettlement program. In addition, the current protocols for determining the health risk posed by potential participants in the federal refugee resettlement program have been demonstrated by numerous articles at Breitbart News as being ineffective at preventing the importation of a number of diseases into the United States, the most glaring example being active tuberculosis (TB). Judge Robart’s temporary restraining order left standing several sections in President Trump’s January 27, 2017 executive order. In one section, President Trump limited the number of refugees who could arrive in the United States in FY 2017, which ends on September 30, to 50, 000. Robart did not attempt to stop that presidential directive, because every legal expert agrees the president can, on his own authority as defined in the Refugee Act of 1980, limit the number of refugees to any number  —   even zero. In FY 2016, under President Obama, 84, 995 refugees entered the United States. Two other sections left standing in Judge Robart’s temporary restraining order are specifically relevant to the executive order it is anticipated President Trump will sign on Thursday: Sec. 3 (a) Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern, The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or   threat. Sec. 4 (a) Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. Sec. 3 (a) directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine “information needed from any country” concerning the potential “security or   threat” of refugee applicants as well as visa applicants. Sec. 4 (a) directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to “implement a program   …     to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. ” These projects have been going on at both State and Homeland Security for over one month now. What that means is the Trump administration has likely developed a significant list of objective standards in both security and public health that refugees and other immigrants must meet in order to be granted entry into the United States. That list is likely to be included in the executive order and will be significantly more resistant to legal challenges. A surprise to look for will be a number of detailed public health standards as well as security standards. One possible new standard will be the implementation of a recommendation made recently by a number of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control that all refugee applicants be tested for latent TB, and that no refugee be allowed to enter the country if they test positive for latent TB, or have not successfully completed treatment for latent TB if they have tested positive for it.",1
25303,The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Julie Andrews and Henson Puppets - The New York Times,"On a wintry morning last month, Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton breezed into the Jim Henson Company’s Creature Shop in Queens, where they warmly greeted puppets hanging limply from a stand. “Why, hello there!” said Ms. Andrews, 81, hailing the foam and fabric creations as if they were close friends. They sort of are. The puppets  —   animated and voiced by skilled puppeteers  —   star alongside Ms. Andrews in “Julie’s Greenroom,” a new children’s show produced by the Henson Company and available on Netflix beginning March 17. She was particularly partial to Hugo the Duck, a character she created, stroking his feather head until her daughter gently chided her. “Mom, you shouldn’t keep touching him,” Ms. Hamilton said. “We’re not supposed to get oil on them. ” Ms. Andrews quickly apologized. “I just wanted to lift his feathers up a bit,” she said. Ms. Andrews, an     and   actress who is as warm and forthright in person as anyone who grew up loving “Mary Poppins” would expect her to be, has worked with puppets before. As a child actress in England, she serenaded a ventriloquist’s dummy in “Educating Archie,” a popular radio show. In “The Sound of Music,” she yodeled with marionettes. And on “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” she vamped with their   denizens. The difference now? She helped bring these latest puppets into existence. Besides starring in “Julie’s Greenroom,” Ms. Andrews helped create, write and produce the show with Ms. Hamilton and Judy Rothman Rofé, an   writer on “Madeline” and other kids’ programs. On the show, she plays Ms. Julie, who teaches a performing arts class to five puppet pupils. Over the debut season’s 13 episodes, Ms. Julie and celebrity guests (including Alec Baldwin, Idina Menzel, Josh Groban, Carol Burnett and David Hyde Pierce) inspire the eager young thespians to create and perform an original musical. Both mother and daughter want the show to champion the vital role they see the performing arts play in teaching children critical thinking, empathy, tolerance and communication skills. “It’s the bridge across all countries,” Ms. Andrews said, referring to drama, dance and music. “The hardest part for us with the show was not to get preachy but also to make it wildly entertaining. ” Ms. Andrews is keenly aware that her new show is entering a rapidly changing children’s television world. The traditional major networks and even the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon are losing young viewers to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, which are plumping up their kids’ programming with ever more offerings. Netflix currently streams more than 40 of its own children’s shows, including “A Series of Unfortunate Events” and “Trollhunters,” while Amazon offers 15 originals, such as “Annedroids” and “Tumble Leaf. ” And HBO, which streams via HBO Go and HBO Now, cut a deal a year ago to air new episodes of “Sesame Street” nine months before they appear on PBS. “When I was growing up, I watched ‘The Smurfs’ on Saturday morning,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst specializing in technology and media at BTIG Research, referring to the NBC cartoon show from the 1980s. “That was the definition of kids’ TV. Kids today don’t even think about turning on the TV networks or cable on Saturday. They want it on demand, and that’s how they’re used to getting it. ” For the streaming services, in particular, their treasure trove of data clearly show what their viewers crave: According to Netflix, more than half of its 93 million members in nearly 200 countries, for example, regularly watch its children’s shows. “Children’s content is important, because it’s our first opportunity to build brand love for Netflix that we hope will last a lifetime,” said Andy Yeatman, director of global kids content at Netflix. The real targets, of course, are parents who pay the subscription fees. “Kids’ content gives the household a reason to subscribe, because kids watch every single day,” Mr. Greenfield said. Following their schmooze with the puppets, Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton discussed the birthing process for their show over scones and coffee in a conference room at the Creature Shop. The women have an easy rapport, built up not only as mother and daughter but also as the   of more than 30 popular children’s books, including the “Dumpy the Dump Truck” and “The Very Fairy Princess” series. (Ms. Andrews has four other children, including two stepchildren, as well as 10 grandchildren and three  .) After the Henson Company approached Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton with the show’s concept, the project was shopped to Netflix in late 2015 Mr. Yeatman and his team quickly said yes. “One of the things that attracted us was not so much that Julie was attached, but that this was a topic she cared a lot about: building a love for the performing arts in kids,” Mr. Yeatman said. Then the real work started. Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton, together with Ms. Rofé, spent a week last winter mapping out the show’s narrative arc and writing the pilot episode at the actress’s home in Sag Harbor, N. Y. The peripatetic Ms. Andrews, a widow since the death in 2010 of the director Blake Edwards, now considers Sag Harbor, a former whaling village (where Ms. Hamilton also lives) her primary residence. Next came the creation and building of the show’s seven puppet characters (which include a dog and Hugo the duck). Ms. Julie’s five pupils are a true rainbow coalition, including one who is in a wheelchair and another who is seemingly gender neutral. “That’s Riley she loves all the technical backstage stuff,” Ms. Andrews said, pointing to an androgynous puppet sporting shortish red hair and round glasses. “She’s a girl. ” Ms. Hamilton, 54, an actress turned writer and arts educator, chimed in. “If pressed, we’d say that she’s a girl, but maybe not forever,” she said. “We wanted to be as diverse as possible. ” Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton weighed in extensively when the puppets were being designed and built at the Creature Shop. They helped choose hair color and texture, outfits, even nose shapes. “Mom, remember the 17 different fabric swatches we went through for Peri’s skirt?” Ms. Hamilton asked, referring to the    puppet. “Yes!” Ms. Andrews replied. “We wanted it as icing pink as possible. ” The women also sat in on final casting sessions to pick an actor to play Gus, Ms. Julie’s (human) assistant. Giullian Yao Gioiello (“The Carrie Diaries”) won the role after strumming his guitar and demonstrating his    prowess. “I was a bit in awe when I first walked in,” he said of meeting Ms. Andrews. But after spending six weeks of nearly   days shooting the series at Grumman Studios in Bethpage, N. Y. he came to regard his energetic   as his honorary grandmother. “She’d share stories and get me her favorite tea, a British brand called PG Tips. ” The biggest surprise? “That Julie Andrews at the end of the day wants a martini. ” Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton also lined up many of the show’s celebrity guest stars. In the first episode, Ms. Menzel introduces the pupils to Broadway musicals. Ms. Julie informs them that Ms. Menzel was the voice of Elsa in Disney’s “Frozen,” a credit sure to impress young viewers more than her Broadway credits from “Wicked” or “Rent. ” “You don’t say no to Julie Andrews,” Ms. Menzel said. After working with her on “Julie’s Greenroom,” Ms. Menzel said, she’s especially impressed by the veteran star’s polite perfectionism. “We would rewrite things on the spot to make them better. She doesn’t settle. She wanted to get things right, but she did it with grace. ” Several of the guest stars sing with Ms. Andrews, warbling original songs. Following a botched surgery on her vocal cords 20 years ago, her once   range is now reduced to one. These days, she  . “I touch what notes I can and say the others,” Ms. Andrews said. “I have about three or four good bass notes left. I could sing you a terrific version of ‘Old Man River. ’” Ms. Andrews said she despaired,   because her whole identity “was being able to sing and the joy of it. ” She eventually realized  —   “It was a great lifesaver”  —   that there were other ways to incorporate music into her life. Ms. Hamilton nodded. “In this show, Mom was very   with the songs and the underscoring,” she said. Ms. Andrews added, “The arrangements, the scoring  —   it’s something I’m so passionate about. ” It shows. In one of the most spirited scenes, cast members from the   Off Broadway show “Stomp” visit to teach percussion. In an extended jam session, filmed in one long take, the “Stomp” cast, Gus and the puppet pupils turn everyday objects in their classroom in an old theater into instruments. Ms. Julie joins in, picking up a china teacup and rhythmically whacking at it with a spoon. The action was unscripted. “Who better than an English mum to pick up a teacup and start banging away?” Ms. Andrews said, laughing. “That’s serendipity. ”",1
25304,"As Trump Signals Climate Action Pullback, Local Leaders Push Forward - The New York Times","The incoming Trump administration appears determined to reverse much of what President Obama has tried to achieve on climate and environment policy. In position papers, agency questionnaires and the résumés of incoming senior officials, the direction is clear  —   an   from eight years of policies designed to reduce   emissions and address the effects of a warming planet. The   Congress appears to welcome many of these changes. But mayors and governors  —   many of them in states that supported   Donald J. Trump  —   say they are equally determined to continue the policies and plans they have already adopted to address climate change and related environmental damage, regardless of what they see from Washington. “With a federal government that’s hostile to climate action, more and faster climate action work from cities, states and businesses will be required to stay anywhere near on track with our carbon pollution goals,” said Sam Adams, the former mayor of Portland, Ore. and current director of the World Resources Institute United States. “In many cases, the solutions that help address climate change are what you have to do anyway in a city  —   transit options so the city doesn’t get gridlocked, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions and unlocks a tremendous amount of economic competitiveness because you don’t have thousands of people stalled in traffic,” Mr. Adams added. In last month’s election, Seattle, Los Angeles and Columbus, Ohio, voted to expand mass transit. Portland, Ore. which many say is the most environmentally minded city in the country, began a new municipal waste program a few years ago, resulting in higher recycling and composting rates, and smaller amounts of trash headed to landfills. Miami Beach is raising roadbeds and building flood walls to hold back the rising seas. California, led by the Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, has adopted a    program, which limits carbon dioxide emissions and sets up a market for companies to buy and sell carbon allowances, so companies can meet or come under that carbon dioxide limit. The state has set one of the nation’s most ambitious climate targets  —   to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Hawaii is planning to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. Governor Brown delivered a fiery defense of his state’s environmental policies at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco last week. He scoffed at reports that some Trump transition officials wanted to eliminate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s system of   satellites. “If Trump turns off the satellites,” he said, “California will launch its own damn satellite. ” Though stymied by alternating bouts of congressional gridlock or    presidential administrations over the last two decades, cities and states have been able to take substantive action. They have fortified themselves against rising seas, switched to renewable sources of energy, expanded mass transit and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Whatever happens or does not happen in Washington, officials say, these projects will continue. Leaders in some cities feel that without presidential leadership it will be hard to achieve the swift transition that dealing with climate change requires. Many fear that they will not get federal funds or national policies needed to make it happen. Still, many mayors and state officials are optimistic about their plans already in motion and those that are scheduled over the next few years. “We feel really good, and we don’t see this election slowing us down,” said Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles. “We’re not going to wait for action from the federal government. We’re taking action now and securing our values. ” While experts caution that there are areas where federal regulations can determine what states and local governments are able to accomplish, they maintain that a   administration could not halt all the momentum generated locally over the last two decades. About 60 percent of Americans live in cities, which generate most of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. “Cities are where climate change problems originate, and therefore that’s where the solutions are,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City who is   of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and the United Nations’ Secretary General’s special envoy for cities and climate change. A number of cities have made substantial progress. In Miami Beach, where $400 million has been invested to deal with flooding, roads have been elevated and sea walls have been constructed. Susanne M. Torriente, the city’s chief resiliency officer, said the city had also recently completed its greenhouse gas inventory and now would aim to reduce its emissions, regardless of federal policy. Whatever policies the Trump administration adopts, she said, “won’t really be a big change for us. ” Republican mayors also govern some cities that are especially vulnerable to climate change. James C. Cason, the mayor of Coral Gables, Fla. is working to protect the city from some of the flooding it is already experiencing and to prepare it for more flooding that will most likely accompany rising sea levels. Florida has a Republican governor, Rick Scott, who has questioned the cause and extent of climate change, but that has not stopped Mr. Cason and other Republican mayors in South Florida from making pragmatic decisions on the issue. Cities have also seen lots of benefits from networks  —   the Compact of Mayors, which has been signed by more than 120 American cities, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Climate Mayors and others  —   most notably, information sharing and solutions, and reaffirming commitments to each other and to their citizens, as many mayors did in a recent letter to the  . Depending on their state, however, cities are somewhat limited in what they can do from a legislative or regulatory standpoint. Some policy experts and state officials maintain that state governments, if they are willing to act on climate or energy policy, are where the measurable progress is made. In most states, governors and legislatures have the authority to regulate the two biggest sources of emissions: power plants and transportation. States can set automotive   standards, and in the case of California, effectively set them for the whole country, experts said.   states require that a certain percentage of their electricity comes from renewable sources, known as a portfolio standard, and another eight have voluntary portfolio standards or targets. In addition to California, nine other states, grouped in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as R. G. G. I. and 17 governors, mostly from that group of 29, have also signed the Governors’ Accord for a New Energy Future, which commits their states to certain sustainability goals. New York has also enacted progressive climate policies, rivaling California, largely by engaging market solutions, in particular attempting to reform the state’s utility system.   states, which may not be favorable to climate policy, have still achieved meaningful progress, especially when it comes to renewable energy, because of the economics of the wind and solar industries. Texas, for instance, has more wind power than any other state, largely a product of deregulating the utility market, but also of subsidies from the federal government and tax credits. Robert Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said that there were areas where national policies could hamstring state efforts. The federal government, he said, can be helpful in getting states to work together, though it is not essential to those efforts, as demonstrated by R. G. G. I. or the Governors’ Accord. And while achieving meaningful reductions may not be without difficulty, Mr. Perciasepe said, “I’m comforted that we have so much momentum, though we still need to be going faster, and the fact that we need to continue to accelerate may be lost. ”",1
25307,Comment on Can The American People Defeat The Oligarchy That Rules Them? — Paul Craig Roberts by Debbie Menon,"By Paul Craig Roberts on November 3, 2016 The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let’s see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing another slew of emails pertinent to Hillary Clinton’s private server investigation. 
by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts 
Aren’t you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven’t blamed Putin for FBI director Comey’s reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary. 
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don’t need to worry about Hillary’s crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? 
The presstitutes’ cry is that Comey’s alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. 
A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation. 
In July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary’s violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls. Dare We Call It Oligarchy? Gary Hart is a former United States senator 
Actually, Hillary’s standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate’s public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election. 
Hillary’s problem has the ruling American Oligarchy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. 
What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn? Dominique Strauss Kahn indicted by Grand Jury and out on six million dollar bailout, but could he have been set up? 
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington succeeded in removing Strauss-Kahn as a challenge to its French vassal, Sarkozy. 
This is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans’ minds. 
The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let’s see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. 
While we wait, let’s concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. 
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent’s power makes them immune to law. Hillary’s crimes might cost her the election, but she won’t go to jail. 
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. 
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have “banks too big to fail,” unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. 
Not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists. 
In the article below, Rahul Manchanda, explains that “yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control” that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.",1
25308,"Where Jobs Are Squeezed by Chinese Trade, Voters Seek Extremes - The New York Times","COURTLAND, Ala.  —   In this forlorn Southern town whose   factories were battered in recent years by a flood of Asian imports, Rhonda Hughes, 43, is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump. Her   old mother is equally passionate about Senator Bernie Sanders. Disenchantment with the political mainstream is no surprise. But research to be unveiled this week by four leading academic economists suggests that the damage to manufacturing jobs from a sharp acceleration in globalization since the turn of the century has contributed heavily to the nation’s bitter political divide. Ms. Hughes avoids discussing the election with her mother, but their neighbor Benjamin Green, 83, knows just what Washington needs. “It’ll take a junkyard dog to straighten this country out,” he said.   congressional voting records and    patterns of job losses and other economic trends between 2002 and 2010, the researchers found that areas hardest hit by trade shocks were much more likely to move to the far right or the far left politically. “It’s not about incumbents changing their positions,” said David Autor, an influential scholar of labor economics and trade at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the paper’s authors. “It’s about the replacement of moderates with more ideological successors. ” Mr. Autor added: “In retrospect, whether it’s Trump or Sanders, we should have seen in it coming. The China shock isn’t the sole factor, but it is something of a missing link. ” In addition to Mr. Autor, the research was conducted by David Dorn of the University of Zurich Gordon Hanson, a professor at the University of California, San Diego and Kaveh Majlesi of Lund University in Sweden. “Exposure to import competition is bad for centrists,” Mr. Hanson said. “We’ve known that political polarization and income inequality track each other, but that pattern is simply a correlation. We’ve now found a mechanism for how economic changes create further political divisions. ” Parker Griffith experienced the move away from the political middle firsthand. A   Blue Dog Democrat who represented Courtland and the rest of Alabama’s Fifth Congressional District, he switched to the Republicans in 2009 and metamorphosed into a moderate Republican. But that wasn’t enough to save his seat. Dr. Griffith was beaten in the Republican primary in 2010 by Morris J. Brooks Jr. who has emerged as one of the most   members of Congress. “If you’re under economic stress and you can’t provide for your family, the easiest answer is to find someone to blame,” said Dr. Griffith. “Mexicans, illegal immigrants, Obama. ” Representative Brooks has said that he would consider “anything short of shooting” illegal immigrants to get them out of the country and that he favored imposing heavy tariffs on China to “level the playing field” and punish Beijing for what he sees as currency manipulation. In the case of the Fifth District, which includes Huntsville and its   and   industries, as well as more industrial Florence along the Tennessee River, the move has been to the right. But Mr. Autor and his colleagues found that in districts with heavy minority representation, similar shocks can push more Democratic districts in the opposite direction. While whites hit hard by trade tend to move right, nonwhite voters move left, eroding support for moderates in both parties, the study concluded. As the South industrialized in the second half of the 20th century, poor Alabamians who once toiled on farms were able to secure a toehold in the middle class. In the shadow of Tennessee Valley Authority dams that supplied cheap power, thousands of workers sewed jeans and   and could earn upward of $20 an hour in heavily unionized factories. But the collapse of the apparel industry here in the first decade of the 21st century, following China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, reversed that process. Nearly 10, 000 manufacturing jobs disappeared. At 7. 4 percent, the regional unemployment rate is well below its peak of 12. 8 percent in 2010, but remains far above the national average of 5 percent. The new paper underscores a broader rethinking among economists of the costs and benefits of policies aimed at encouraging industrial competition across borders. “There’s a deeper appreciation for the magnitude of the impact on workers who lose their jobs,” Mr. Hanson said. “But the nature of globalization changed after the end of the Cold War and it took a while for academics to catch up. ” Until the Nafta agreement with Canada and Mexico in 1994, and especially the entry of China into the W. T. O. trade deals were mostly multilateral and the rise in manufacturing imports to the United States came primarily from other advanced industrial nations like Germany and Japan. “China and the W. T. O. represented a shock that was way larger,” Mr. Autor said. “We hadn’t seen shocks like this because we were trading with rich countries, not highly productive developing countries with enormous labor reserves. ” To understand the connection between imports from China and political polarization, the researchers focused on the fact that manufacturers tend to localize in a specific region. “There are these concentrated pockets of hurt,” Mr. Autor said, “and we’re seeing the political consequences of that. ” Mr. Autor and Mr. Hanson emphasize that trade is only one factor among many that have contributed to a polarizing Congress (income inequality is another, as are attitudes toward immigrants). But it has been an important one, particularly over the last decade, when Chinese imports ramped up. This   polarization has had a significant effect on the overall ideological makeup of Congress. The authors found that voters in congressional districts hardest hit by Chinese imports tended to choose more ideologically extreme lawmakers. Between 2002 and 2010, districts in the top 5th percentile of trade exposure, on average, experienced a 19 percent greater drop in manufacturing employment relative to districts at the other end of the spectrum. Those   districts became, on average, far more conservative: the ideological equivalent of moving from Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz. Some very conservative members of Congress have been sympathetic to free trade arguments in the past, but Representative Brooks, who has welcomed support from the Tea Party, doesn’t mince words about where he stands. “We’re going to have to do whatever is necessary to ensure that a foreign country isn’t able to successfully attack and destroy significant parts of the economy,” he said. “I was in China two weeks ago and they are going to clean our plow if we don’t act. ” Mr. Autor, like most economists, is still persuaded of the   benefits that global trade confers on the economy as a whole. But he recognizes that angry voters have valid reasons to be frustrated. “It’s a matter of diffuse benefits and concentrated costs, but our political system hasn’t addressed those costs,” he said. Some staunch defenders of globalization, like Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, also acknowledge that the federal government has failed to adequately address the needs of workers dislocated by lowered import barriers. But the benefit of free trade is “10 times the size of the losses,” he said. “Free trade really helps   people in terms of lower prices for products. The benefits are skewed toward people with lower income because they spend a much larger fraction of their income on merchandise. ” Perhaps, but that’s cold comfort to people in northern Alabama, where wages are stagnant and manufacturing jobs are still disappearing. In nearby Decatur, the big Nucor steel plant is hanging on, but it is under intense pressure from Asian imports, said the company’s chief executive, John J. Ferriola. Nucor has a   policy, but pay and bonuses have been cut at the company’s five Alabama facilities. Does the steel industry in Alabama have a future? “Tell me what’s going to happen with imports,” Mr. Ferriola said. And in 2014, the giant International Paper mill in Courtland closed abruptly, costing over 1, 000 people their jobs. “Thirty years ago, it was booming,” Ms. Hughes said, pointing out where Courtland’s hardware store, the pharmacy and the    used to be. “But those days are never coming back. ”",1
25309,A South Korean Man Adopted by Americans Prepares for Deportation - The New York Times,"Adam Crapser was adopted from South Korea nearly four decades ago, but today he languishes in an immigration detention center in Washington State awaiting deportation because his American parents never filed citizenship paperwork for him. Mr. Crapser, 41, built a life in Oregon, got married and raised children but will soon be forced to leave the country in which he has lived since he was 3 for South Korea, where he plans to eventually reunite with his biological mother in a small town three hours outside of Seoul, the capital. His family will remain in the United States temporarily, and they hope to reunite in South Korea. “At this point I’m ready to just go back and try to make my life over there,” Mr. Crapser said on Monday night in a telephone interview from Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, a week after a judge denied his final request to stay in the United States. “There’s been some good things that came out of all this, surprisingly. ” Mr. Crapser’s sanguine attitude toward the wrenching dislocation that looms ahead is thanks in part to the media attention his case has attracted in both the United States and South Korea, he said. A South Korean documentary on his plight and the lives of other Korean adoptees led to his birth mother coming forward. “I do have a Korean family back in Korea,” Mr. Crapser said. “They’ve been informed that I am returning. It’s good, and it’s bad. It’s kind of bittersweet. ” That promising development is far from a universal experience, however. His lawyer, Lori Walls, said on Monday that Mr. Crapser’s case illustrates how easy it is for permanent residents to be placed in deportation proceedings, even when they entered the country lawfully as adoptees but were not naturalized by their adoptive parents. According to the Adoptee Rights Campaign, an advocacy group, there are about 35, 000 people in the United States who were adopted by American couples as children but who do not have citizenship. Mr. Crapser had been living legally in the United States under   documents given to adopted children, Ms. Walls said. In 2001, the Child Citizenship Act automatically made   holders citizens, but the law was not retroactive  —   it did not benefit adoptees who were already legal adults. “Adam was over 18 and so missed the cutoff date,” Ms. Walls said. Mr. Crapser said he first spoke to his family in Korea during a series of FaceTime conversations last winter. He communicated with his birth mother through an interpreter because he does not speak Korean. (He said he planned to bring a tourist phrase book with him when he is deported “so I can read signs and stuff. ”) His American family plans to join him in Korea next year after his wife, a Vietnamese immigrant, becomes a United States citizen. His stepfather in Korea owns a construction company where he hopes to work so he and his family can start a new life, he said. “That’s hopefully the plan, but it’s not written in stone yet,” he said. “We’re hoping that will end up working out. ” Mr. Crapser’s positive attitude belies the Kafkaesque nature of his life in the United States. The decision to deport him was just the latest trying experience in a span that has been, by any measure, exceptionally difficult. Mr. Crapser was adopted along with his sister by an American family that physically abused both children, he told The New York Times Magazine for an article that was published in April 2015. After six years, that family put both children up for adoption again. They were separated, and Mr. Crapser was adopted by new parents, Thomas and Dolly Crapser, who also abused him. They had several other foster and adopted children whom they also treated brutally. In 1992, they were both convicted of criminal mistreatment and assault, and Thomas Crapser was convicted of sexual abuse. Adam Crapser was kicked out of the Crapser home at 16 and later broke back in to retrieve his personal belongings. He pleaded guilty to burglary and served 25 months in prison. More brushes with the law followed. After his release, he was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm. A couple of misdemeanors followed, and he was later convicted of assault after a fight, The Times magazine reported. “Because of the chaotic nature of his upbringing, he was not able to document his status,” Lori Walls, his lawyer, said. Mr. Crapser said he did not realize there was a difference between being a permanent resident and a citizen until he was reunited with his sister, a naturalized citizen, in 2012. Deportation proceedings began that year, shortly after he applied for residency documents and the authorities learned about his criminal record. The final decision was made on Oct. 24 at an immigration court in Tacoma, Ms. Walls said. Mr. Crapser said Monday that he expected to be deported within the next 30 days. Mr. Crapser had never held down a steady job for more than 90 days because he could never prove his legal status, he said, something he always chalked up to a chaotic childhood. “I pretty much had to work under the table for most of my life,” he said. He hoped his fortunes might finally turn around in South Korea. “I guess in a sense the good thing is that I am a citizen of Korea so when I go back I will already be a citizen of some country,” he said. “I guess that’s where I belong. ”",1
25310,Cold Hands May Signal Raynaud’s Phenomenon - The New York Times,"The adage “Cold hands, warm heart” might describe me accurately if it also included “cold feet. ” Every autumn, even before the leaves begin to fall from their airy perch, I begin an annual search for better ways to keep my hands and feet from freezing during the coming winter. My investment in mittens and boots could stock a store and includes what is touted as the warmest of warm, but so far no product has been sufficiently protective. The popular advice, “Move to a warmer climate,” doesn’t mesh with my life’s interests, and so the search continues. I may or may not have a version of Raynaud’s phenomenon, but I can surely empathize with those who do. First described in 1862 by a French medical student named Maurice Raynaud, it is characterized by highly localized   spasms of small blood vessels that disrupt blood flow to the extremities, most often the fingers and toes and sometimes also the tips of the ears and nose. Viewed in the best possible light, it is a patriotic disorder: Affected areas typically turn white when vessels collapse and cut off blood flow, then blue for lack of   blood, then red as blood flow is gradually restored when the areas rewarm. While it is normal for blood to shift toward the body’s core to restrict heat loss when a person is exposed to cold, this reaction is exaggerated in the extremities of people with Raynaud’s phenomenon, also often called Raynaud’s syndrome or disease. Small vessels that supply blood to the skin of the fingers, toes, ears and nose overreact to cold, developing spasms that greatly reduce or completely shut down blood flow to these areas. The weather need not be cold to trigger an attack of Raynaud’s. Moving into an   room to escape summer’s heat will do it as well. The same reaction can occur when a person with Raynaud’s is under stress and the body undergoes the kind of    response that protects animals in danger by shunting blood to tissues needed to aid survival. In a recent review of the disorder in The New England Journal of Medicine, two professors at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Dr. Fredrick M. Wigley and Nicholas A. Flavahan reported that Raynaud’s affects between 3 percent and 5 percent of the general population. It occurs in two forms: primary, which is most common and has no known underlying cause and secondary, in which it is associated with another disorder, usually a connective tissue or autoimmune disease like scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis or Sjogren’s syndrome. People who work with certain chemicals, like vinyl chloride, or vibrating tools like a jackhammer are also susceptible to secondary Raynaud’s. Primary Raynaud’s typically begins relatively early in life, between the ages of 15 and 30, and up to half of these individuals have a   relative  —   parent, sibling or child  —   who also has the disorder. Women are more often affected than men. As uncomfortable as it can be, primary Raynaud’s is not dangerous and is not as severe as secondary Raynaud’s, which has a later onset, usually starting after age 35 or 40. In rare severe cases in which blood flow is chronically diminished, secondary Raynaud’s can result in skin ulcers and even gangrene that require surgery. A doctor can distinguish between the two by putting a drop of oil on the skin at the base of the fingernail and examining the area under a microscope. The presence of enlarged or malformed capillaries in this area, the nail fold, indicate an underlying connective tissue disease. Two blood tests, the antinuclear antibody test and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, can aid in diagnosing an underlying cause of Raynaud’s, which can then be treated. Raynaud’s affects parts of the body that have a characteristic circulatory pattern: a high density of direct connections between arterioles  —   small vessels that branch out from arteries  —   and venules, or small veins. These connections, called   anastomoses, govern circulation in the nonhairy surfaces of the body, bypassing capillaries that normally bring blood to the skin, Dr. Flavahan explained last year in Nature Reviews: Rheumatology. When people with Raynaud’s are exposed to cold or are under stress, normal nervous   constriction of the arterioles in these anastomoses is enhanced and may temporarily cut off blood flow to the affected parts, causing them to turn white and feel cold and numb. When the areas are rewarmed and the spasm resolves, blood flow resumes, often causing tingling or throbbing. There is no cure for Raynaud’s, and remedies supported by solid scientific evidence are few. But there are   measures that can minimize its effects. Most important of these is to stay warm. For me that means wearing multiple insulating layers, especially on my arms and legs, so that any extra heat generated can transfer to my hands and feet. It’s a trick I learned   and skiing and that I’ve applied to cycling and hiking in New York winters. Wearing a hat and neck gaiter and a   outer garment is also very helpful. Mittens keep hands warmer than gloves. I store my hand coverings on the radiator and my boots under it when not in use. My short arms have found a purpose, enabling me to further protect my hands by pulling sleeves down over them. This winter I will try heated gloves fueled by rechargeable batteries that last a lot longer than chemical  . I also keep gloves next to the freezer to use when removing frozen foods. Some people even wear gloves when they sleep, and from fall through   I wear socks to bed. If you smoke, don’t. Nicotine causes a drop in skin temperature that adds to the problem. Certain medications that constrict blood vessels can also make matters worse. They include   many cold remedies, especially those that contain pseudoephedrine some migraine remedies and some blood pressure medications. If undue stress triggers a Raynaud’s attack, try to avoid stressful situations and routinely practice   techniques like meditation, progressive muscle relaxation or the relaxation response. Regular physical exercise, while good for everyone’s   is said to be especially helpful for those with primary Raynaud’s. Any activity that increases heart rate fosters circulation of warm blood to the extremities. Although there are no drugs approved to treat Raynaud’s, calcium channel blockers, commonly used to treat high blood pressure, can be helpful. They dilate small blood vessels by relaxing the smooth muscles around them.",1
25312,Ex-Reporter Charged With Making Bomb Threats Against Jewish Sites - The New York Times,"A former reporter for a news website was charged on Friday with making more than a   bomb threats against Jewish community centers, schools and a Jewish history museum, federal authorities said. The man, Juan Thompson, 31, of St. Louis, made some of the threats using his own name and others implicating a former girlfriend as part of an effort to intimidate her, the authorities said in a federal complaint unsealed on Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. In one threat, made on Feb. 1 against a Jewish school in Farmington Hills, Mich. the complaint says, Mr. Thompson claimed he had placed two bombs in the school and was “eager for Jewish newtown,” an apparent reference to the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Conn. in which a gunman killed 20 students and six school employees. The website The Intercept confirmed in a statement on Friday that Mr. Thompson worked for the publication for a little more than a year, until he was fired in January 2016 after it was discovered that he had fabricated sources and quotes in his articles. The arrest came amid heightened tension involving more than 100 threats against Jewish groups that have been reported in dozens of states this year, resulting in a broad inquiry led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The threats, combined with vandalism at Jewish cemeteries, have prompted fears of an increase in  . Mr. Thompson is not believed to be responsible for most of the threats against Jewish centers around the country, according to federal law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. Investigators are still trying to identify who is responsible for those threats, which the officials said were made using sophisticated technology to mask personal details, like identity and the origin of the   calls. The federal complaint, which was signed by Christopher Mills, an F. B. I. special agent, says Mr. Thompson’s threats were “part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate” the former girlfriend. The harassment began shortly after she ended their romantic relationship last July, the complaint says. Mr. Thompson made at least eight threats against Jewish schools and community centers in New York, Dallas, Farmington Hills and San Diego, according to the complaint. In a threat made on Feb. 22 to the   League in New York, the complaint says, a caller, using an untraceable phone number and a tool that disguised the caller’s voice, said there was   an explosive material, in the group’s New York office, and that it would be “detonated within one hour. ” The office was immediately searched and no explosives were found. The accusations against Mr. Thompson were announced on Friday by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan William F. Sweeney Jr. head of the F. B. I. ’s New York office and James P. O’Neill, the New York police commissioner. “Threats of violence targeting people and places based on religion or race  —   whatever the motivation  —   are unacceptable,   and criminal,” Mr. Bharara said in a statement. “We are committed to pursuing and prosecuting those who foment fear and hate through such criminal threats. ” The F. B. I. said that its director, James B. Comey, and top bureau officials had held a meeting on Friday with Jewish community leaders to discuss the recent increase in threats to Jewish institutions around the country, and that the investigation into the threats was “a top priority. ” Mr. Thompson was arrested on Friday in St. Louis, where a federal magistrate judge ordered him held without bond pending a detention hearing on Wednesday. Mr. Bharara’s office will seek to have Mr. Thompson, who is charged with one count of cyberstalking, brought to Manhattan to face prosecution, an office spokeswoman said. Lucille G. Liggett, a federal public defender who represented Mr. Thompson in court on Friday, declined to comment when reached later in the day. Mr. Thompson worked at The Intercept from November 2014 to January 2016, when he was dismissed, according to a statement by Betsy Reed, the news organization’s editor in chief. In the statement, Ms. Reed said the organization was “horrified to learn” of Mr. Thompson’s arrest in connection with the bomb threats and cyberstalking allegations. “These actions are heinous and should be fully investigated and prosecuted,” she said. Mr. Thompson began making bomb threats in January after harassing his former girlfriend for several months, according to the complaint. She obtained a New York State order of protection against him last August it was renewed in October and again in December. As part of the harassment, Mr. Thompson, without using his actual name, had sent emails and faxes to the woman’s employer that made false allegations about her, including that she was   according to the complaint. He also sent her an anonymous email, attaching nude photographs of her and threatening to release them publicly. The bomb threat against a Jewish history museum in Manhattan, which the authorities did not identify, was made on Jan. 28, the complaint says. The phone threat against the   League on Feb. 22 was preceded a day earlier by an email to the organization that said that the former girlfriend was “behind the bomb threats against jews” and that she would be making more threats. At a news conference on Friday in New York, Oren Segal, director of the   League’s Center on Extremism, said Mr. Thompson had been on the organization’s radar since he was fired for fabricating quotes in articles. “While the motive is unclear, the impact is crystal clear,” Mr. Segal said of the bomb threats Mr. Thompson is accused of making. “While I cannot speak about what is in Thompson’s mind or certainly in his heart, threatening Jewish institutions is an   act. ”",1
25316,"Chipping Away at a List of Goals, and Bonding Over Cupcakes - The New York Times","Andie Gratereaux sat under the autumn leaves at DeSalvio Playground in Manhattan a year ago, peeled away the wrapper from a salted caramel cupcake and started to put her life back together. With the help of a mentor she had met that day, Andie, 12, started a list in a spiral notebook of what she wanted to do over the coming year. Visit a park, try to sew, play music, learn to bake, go ice skating. The list became a road map for a girl uprooted from her home in Virginia after her stepfather threw her and her mother, Arlene Gratereaux, out of the house one night in 2011. He did so during one of his fits of rage, episodes during which he would get so angry he would punch holes in the apartment walls that Ms. Gratereaux covered with her daughter’s drawings. Ms. Gratereaux’s brother drove from Manhattan that night to Petersburg, Va. near Richmond, and took mother and daughter immediately back to his place on the Lower East Side. They were safe then, but they had left everything behind. Without a permanent home, Ms. Gratereaux and Andie have shuffled since then between her brother’s apartment and her parents’ place in the East New York section of Brooklyn. They were not used to this lifestyle, especially Andie. It led Ms. Gratereaux to Catholic Big Brothers and Big Sisters, an affiliate of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. She worried about their depressing circumstances and thought Andie needed a mentor, someone who could show her a world that seemed beyond her grasp. Andie was matched with Darragh Wright, 33, who had turned to Big Brothers and Big Sisters about the same time. “I was looking for a way to get connected to the New York community in a   way,” Ms. Wright, who grew up in Atlanta, said. At DeSalvio Playground, Ms. Wright decided to break the ice over cupcakes. Together, she and Andie worked on the list of goals, and Ms. Wright snapped a photograph of it with her phone so that she would always have it with her. In the year that followed, she would refer to that photo to cross items off the list. She and Andie traveled to Garrison, N. Y. where they hiked in Arden Point State Park. “We had sore feet at the end,” Ms. Wright said. Andie sewed, making two blankets for homeless people as part of a community service project. And she got to bake  —   banana bread. “My uncle took two helpings,” she said. Ms. Wright and Andie see each other every other weekend, and their meetings start with a game of three questions. On a brisk afternoon in Prospect Park in Brooklyn a few days before Halloween, as children in princess and Spiderman costumes roamed around, Ms. Wright retrieved her questions for Andie from a plastic bag in her purse. What is your favorite food? (Cheeseburger with fries and ketchup.) What is your favorite day of the year? (Her birthday. Ms. Wright’s is Thanksgiving.) They also discussed Andie’s Halloween costume. (A zombie bride, with black eyes, a pale face and bloodied lips.) Then and now, the questions are never too serious. They do not discuss the trip Andie and her mother must make every week from the Lower East Side to East New York to stay for the weekend. They do not talk about the stress weighing on Ms. Gratereaux, a    college graduate who most recently found work as a poll worker on Election Day and is receiving job training through Grace Institute, another program affiliated with Catholic Charities. Instead, Andie uses the time as an escape, a chance to become more independent, her mother said. Those moments, along with the aid the family is receiving elsewhere, have started to help them rebuild their lives. Catholic Charities also provided the family with $360 from the Neediest Cases Fund so that Andie could purchase her first laptop. She and her mother spend many hours after school at the library so that Andie can complete her   homework. Andie also has lessons when she is with Ms. Wright. On the October day in Prospect Park, they got up from under a tree, and Ms. Wright handed Andie her phone with Google Maps open on it. They wanted to get a cup of hot cocoa, but it was up to Andie to navigate. “Andie, you lead us,” Ms. Wright said, bending over to look at the phone. “Can you find east? Show me on the map. ” Andie shuffled into position and began to walk. “Learning your way around a map is an important thing,” Ms. Wright said as they reversed course after a wrong turn under a bridge. The young girl looked back at the map, and they made their way out of the park. Soon, they would return to another park, the playground in Manhattan where their friendship was forged, to mark their   anniversary. “We’ll do the cupcake thing again,” Andie said. Ms. Wright agreed. “And we’ll make another list,” she said.",1
25320,"‘You Focus on the Good’: Women Who Voted for Trump, in Their Own Words - The New York Times","On Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, women from all over the country will be rolling into Washington for what promises to be an enormous protest against Donald J. Trump. But millions of women went to the polls for Mr. Trump on Election Day, including, according to surveys, 53 percent of white women. Why did they? Conventional wisdom that his behavior and remarks would disqualify him in the eyes of many women proved wrong. Interviews with more than a dozen women around the country showed a range of reasons for their support: worries about the economy, anger about the Affordable Care Act and the price of health care, protection of Second Amendment rights, fears about immigration and terrorism, and opposition to abortion. But many women also voted against Hillary Clinton, voicing deep suspicions about the American deaths in Benghazi, Libya her use of a private email server and the hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee as proof that she said one thing in public and another in private. Here are excerpts, condensed and edited, from their thoughts. Voter: Rebecca Gregory, 46. Nurse. Home: Roseville, Mich. In 2008 and 2012, I voted for Obama, I was   marriage, Planned Parenthood was very important to me. But after eight years, I saw there was much more racial divide than there had ever been, I didn’t like the way the economy is going and I didn’t like the stance he took on police. My husband is a court officer and volunteers in the police force. [President Obama] didn’t support law enforcement the way he did the community that felt they were being unjustly treated. I think he could have done a better job instead of pointing blame. Instead of saying we need to educate people on how to behave when they’re being pulled over by the police. I’m seeing a barrage of patients coming in from different countries. An Iraqi immigrant came in last night, he needs dialysis. He will never be productive in the U. S. he will always be dependent on Medicaid. I feel for him, I want to help him, but we have to take care of our own people first. Driving to work yesterday, I saw three homeless people. They need our help. If I turned down every candidate who objectified women, I’d vote for no one. _____ Voter: Sandy Pearson, 48. Studying to be a mortgage broker. Home: Chattanooga, Tenn. Trump’s not a perfect man, by any means. He kind of reminds me of my  . I think he’s a really good man, deep down. This guy has such potential, and I truly believe he cares about our country and wants to help everyone. I do read things on occasion that he tweets and I think, oh my word. I wish I could have had 10 minutes with him. Listen, Donald, you need to straighten up and stop with this foolishness. What he said about women was disrespectful. But I don’t get offended like some people do. You get through the bad and you focus on the good. Basically these were our choices, and I felt he was the better choice, and I had to overlook the negatives and focus on the positives. At the very beginning of this election, I was leaning toward Bernie Sanders. I looked at all the candidates, what were their ideas to help our country out of debt and make our military strong and be there for our vets. I have so many friends whose health care costs have doubled and are having to get extra jobs just to pay their insurance. And I read all these things about people where their religious liberties are not being taken seriously. _____ Voter: Deb Alighire, 44. Engineer and program manager at Mopar, a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Home: Clarkston, Mich. I’m very focused on bringing the plants back. In metro Detroit, waiters usually were younger people and during the time of hardship, the bankruptcies, it was very striking to me to go to a Papa Gino’s and have a   man being a waiter. Usually these people would have some kind of job related to the automotive industry. I’m super excited about Trump. I believe he knows how to build things. My dad worked at a coal power plant for 39 years and they’re freaked out about energy changing too quickly. I’m also concerned about immigration. I went to Minnesota and I had a Somali cabdriver who lectured me for 35 minutes to the airport about how women in America have too much freedom. My thought process on that is that I don’t like seeing people going through the hardship they go through, but I don’t want to go backwards in the feminist movement, either. _____ Voter: Taylor Davis, 27. Works in a small business. Home: Enfield, Conn. I helped campaign for Obama and I was a   Bernie supporter. When he backed Hillary Clinton, I couldn’t get behind it. Both my parents are engineers. My mom was an engineer long before many women in the field. When the economy started faltering, she went from a very high position at Pratt  Whitney to being unemployed for a year, and that was heartbreaking. I think that Trump really cares about having   jobs back here, not necessarily the service industry. Do I think Trump’s trying to send women back to the kitchen? No, his daughter is a great example. She ran the    campaign long before he ran for president. _____ Voter: Robin Mueller, 42. Preschool teacher. Home: Sterling Heights, Mich. I made up my mind for Trump at the last minute. Since my husband is in the military, I was concerned about having someone who didn’t have military experience, didn’t have the knowledge of dealing with world leaders. And I kind of thought he had a big mouth. But I had an    who was totally on the Trump train. He talked me into taking him to a Trump rally. I expected him to be like what I’d seen on the news, saying hateful things. But his presence was very calming and I liked his talking points. We really are the middle class, and we kind of get swept aside. The first time she ran against Obama, I was all on board for Hillary Clinton. I really wanted to have a female president. I think that’s important. But I’m not sure that’s her. In the past, her stance on abortion was more the way I feel, just for the first trimester, then she did a 360. She was here in the primary, having a debate with Bernie Sanders. He answered the question honestly. When they asked her the same question, she kind of danced around it. Then she went on “The View” and said she was for   abortions. Just take a stance, be honest. Same thing as with gay marriage, she wasn’t for it, then she was. I’m 100 percent for it. It’s ridiculous the way we tell people who they can and cannot marry. Don’t go back and forth. Don’t pander. I voted for Obama the last time. I don’t agree with a lot of what he said, but I felt he was honest. _____ Voter: Katie Holder, 39. Owns a   business. Home: Gulf Shores, Ala. I feel very, very badly for the people who are very scared for their way of life. From what I’m understanding, he’s only really wanting illegal immigrants that have committed crimes to be deported, which I agree with. I feel bad for the lesbian and gay and transsexual community that fear for their way of life. From what I understand, he says he’s not going to mess with that. Somebody called me a racist because I did vote for Trump. Hold on, you don’t know me. Doesn’t that make you a racist by calling me a racist when you don’t know me? I’m looking for a brighter future for me and my children, and honestly I felt l like our country was kind of at risk if we did elect Hillary. _____ Voter: Victoria Czapski, 45. Works in education. Home: Sterling Heights, Mich. I felt he had what it would take to get the country back on track. Being P. C. was going to kill the country. He speaks his mind and because of that, he’s not going to lie to you. I don’t want immigrants, accepting them without doing the background checks. Are these people terrorists? I don’t want to live in a country where we have to worry about going to the movie theater or the mall. Let’s be on the offensive, versus the defensive. We are a country based on immigrants. But I believe they should go through the process. My   came here, they had to learn English. This is a Christian country. The whole bending over backwards. He says what everyone’s thinking and is afraid to say. That doesn’t make anyone bigoted. I’m not saying there are people out there who shouldn’t be helped. I worked in the inner cities. They’re on welfare. They make a certain amount of money and everything gets taken away. That amount of money is so low that they have no incentive to work. Why don’t you allow them to gradually earn more money? Find a way to help people get over the hump. _____ Voter: Pam Cornett, 46. Formerly   now working in customer service. Home: Chattanooga, Tenn. I voted for Trump because I wanted change. I feel like our economy has totally tanked. People do not have disposable income. I feel the last eight years have been a joke. Obama was out for himself. I don’t think he really respected the office. I think it was more about him being a celebrity than a president. Trump’s a successful businessman, and I feel like that’s what America needs to bring our economy back. I don’t think Donald Trump is really Republican, to be quite honest with you. He’s not in a box. One of the most attractive things to me is he can’t be boxed. He wants to bring America back to what it was before. I don’t think it’s taking us back to women have no rights or slavery days. _____ Voter: Paula Filar, 71. Retired business owner. Home: Shelby Township, Mich. I thought if he would only have kept his mouth shut during the primary. About the way people looked, about their size. Really? About McCain. I mean, really? All of it was so egregious. I hated it, I cringed. All of that was bad, but it didn’t stop me. And it’s like Hillary has the right to talk about Trump when she stayed with a guy who was in the White House and took advantage of a young intern? Why would you stay with him? Benghazi. The emails. The I. R. S. She’s a liar. The Clintons got wealthy because of their position. I’d rather have someone there who doesn’t need the money. He’s got a message. He’s going to make a change. Her message was all him. All negative ads. I spent a long time in the staffing industry here, worked with the automotive industry. We weren’t competitive. That’s got to be turned around. We have to have incentives for companies to keep their work here. _____ Voter: Tangie Wooden, 44. Learning facilitator for Blue Cross of Tennessee. Home: Ringgold, Ga. When Trump became my only choice, I felt he was the lesser of two evils. I had major issues with Hillary as far as ethics was concerned. It seems she feels that she is above the law and nothing ever seems to stick. I didn’t particularly like everything he was saying as far as building a wall, and doing this to immigrants. I looked at that more as bravado, his audience needed that to get the applause. But there are allegations about killing people who get in her way  —   Vince Foster, people like that. Someone who has a big bravado is not as concerning to me as someone who might kill people who get in her way. _____ Voter: Kasia Riddle, 43. Substitute teacher. Home: Murfreesboro, Tenn. I run my household like a business, my classroom like a business. I expect him to run the country in such a manner. You don’t pay more money out than you have. You want to have your budget under control. You want to know the people you’re working with are above average. You want to pick the people based on what they can do, not on what they did for you. He’s not getting large amounts from donors based on what you’ll do for me later. _____ Voter: Guzin Karides, 49. Homemaker, former attorney. Home: Virginia Beach I laughed Trump off like everyone else did. Once I stopped laughing at him and started listening, I started to support him. I felt like once you got past the bluster, he really was interested in helping everyone. I do think having a secure border is very important. My father was a Muslim immigrant from Turkey, he went through the process. I don’t agree with a ban on Muslims, but my father was very wary of Muslims who came over if they didn’t have a reason to be here. He would support a full vetting, but not a total ban. I have always considered myself a feminist. For me, I want to be treated the exact same way. That’s not the feel I get from feminists today, they want extra privileges. I gave up my first marriage so I could be a law partner and then I had to give up on my partnership so I could be a better mom. To say women are going backwards would be wrong. Look at how much Trump hires women, how much he does rely on women, how much he relies on his own daughter. I’m sort of amazed by her. She may pull him more into the middle. She’ll be a good voice for women.",1
25323,Russia calls the War Party’s bluff,"by Pepe Escobar for Sputnik International 
Cold War 2.0 has reached unprecedented hysterical levels. From the Clinton (cash) machine – supported by a neocon/neoliberalcon think tank/media complex – to the British establishment and its corporate media mouthpieces, the Anglo-American, self-appointed “leaders of the free world” are racking up demonization of Russia and http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21709028-how-contain-vladimir-putins-deadly-dysfunctional-empire-threat-russia 
“Putinism” to pure incandescence. 
And yet a hot war is not about to break out – before or after the November 8 US presidential election. So many layers of fear and loathing in fact veil no more than a bluff. 
Let’s start with the Russian naval task force in Syria, led by the officially designated “heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser” Admiral Kuznetsov, which will be stationed in the eastern Mediterranean at least until February 2017, supporting operations against all strands of Salafi-jihadism. 
The Admiral Kuznetsov is fully equipped with anti-ship, air defense, artillery and anti-submarine warfare systems – and can defend itself against a vast array of threats, unlike NATO vessels. 
Predictably, NATO is spinning with alarm that “all of the Northern Fleet”, along with the Baltic Fleet, is on the way to the Mediterranean. Wrong; it’s only part of the Northern Fleet, and the Baltic Fleet ships are not going anywhere. 
The heart of the matter is that when the capabilities of this Russian naval task force are matched with the S-300/S-400 missile systems already deployed in Syria, Russia is now de facto rivaling the firepower of the US Sixth Fleet. 
To top it off, as this http://thesaker.is/making-sense-of-the-russian-naval-task-force-off-the-coast-of-syria/ comprehensive military analysis makes clear, Russia has “basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria”; and a US no-fly zone, viscerally promoted by Hillary Clinton, “is now impossible to achieve.” 
That should be more than enough to put into perspective the impotence transmuted into outright anger exhibited by the Pentagon and its neocon/neoliberalcon vassals. 
Add to it the outright war between the Pentagon and the CIA in the Syrian war theatre, where the Pentagon backs the YPG Kurds, who are not necessarily in favor of regime change in Damascus, while the CIA backs further weaponizing of “moderate”, as in al-Qaeda-linked and/or infiltrated, “rebels”. 
Compounding the trademark Obama administration Three Stooges school of foreign policy, American threats have flown more liberally than Negan’s skull-crushing bloody baton in the new season of The Walking Dead. 
Pentagon head Ash Carter, a certified neocon, has threatened “consequences”, as in “potential” strikes against Syrian Arab Army (SAA) forces to “punish the regime” after the Pentagon itself broke the Kerry-Lavrov ceasefire. President Obama took some time off weighing his options. And in the end, he backed off. 
So it will be up for the virtually elected – by the whole US establishment – Hillary Clinton to make the fateful decision. She won’t be able to go for a no-fly zone – because Russia is already doing it. And If she decides to “punish the regime”, Moscow already telegraphed, via Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov, there will definitely be “consequences” for imposing a “shadow” hot war. 
Sun Tzu doesn’t do first-strike 
Washington, of course, reserves for itself a “first-strike” nuclear capability, which Hillary Clinton fully supports (Donald Trump does not, and for that he’s also demonized). If we allow the current hysteria to literally go nuclear, then we must consider the matter of the S-500 anti-missile system – which effectively seals Russia’s air space; Moscow won’t admit it on the record because that would unleash a relentless arms race. 
A US intel source with close connections to the Masters of the Universe but at the same time opposed to Cold War 2.0 as “counter-productive”, adds the necessary nuance; “The United States has lost the arms race, indulging in trillions of dollars of worthless and endless wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and now is no longer a global power as it cannot defend itself with its obsolete missiles, THAAD, Patriot and Aegis Land Based Ballistic Defense System, against Russian ICBMs, even as the Russians have sealed their airspace. The Russians may be as much as four generations ahead of the US.” 
Moreover, in the deep recesses of shadow war planning, the Pentagon knows, and the Russian Defense Ministry also knows, that in the event some Dr. Strangelove launched a nuclear preemptive strike against Russia, the Russian population would be protected by their defensive missile systems – as well as nuclear bomb shelters in major cities. Warnings on Russian television have not been idle; the population would know where to go in the – terrifying – event of nuclear war breaking out. 
Needless to add, the ghastly possibility of US nuclear first-strike turns all these WWII-style NATO war games in Eastern Europe into a pile of meaningless propaganda stunts. 
So how did Moscow plan for it all? According to the US intel source, “they took out almost all the military budget from their stated federal budget, lulling the West into thinking that Russia could not afford a massive military buildup and there was nothing to fear from Russia as they were finished as a world power. The [stated] military budget was next to nothing, so there was nothing to worry about as far as the CIA was concerned. If Putin showed publicly his gigantic military buildup, the West could have taken immediate remedial actions as they did in 2014 by crashing the oil price.” 
The bottom line then would reveal the Pentagon as totally unprepared for a hot war – even as it threatens and bluffs Russia now on a daily basis; “As Brzezinski has pointed out, if this is the case it means the US has ceased to be a global power. The US may continue to bluff, but those that ally with them will have nowhere to go if that bluff is called, as it is being now called in Syria.” 
The US intel source is adamant that “one of the greatest military buildups in history has taken place right under the nose of the Russian Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina and the Russian Ministry of Finance while the CIA awaits what they think will be the inevitable Russia collapse. The CIA will be waiting forever and eternity for Russia to collapse. This MGB maneuver is sheer genius. And demonstrates that the CIA, which is so drowned by data inputs that they cannot connect the dots on anything, must be completely reorganized. In addition, the entire procurement system of the United States military must also be reorganized as it cannot ever keep up if new weapon programs as the F-35 take twenty years to develop and then are found obsolete before they even enter service. The Russians have a five-year development program for each new weapons system and they are far ahead of us in every key area.” 
If this analysis is correct, it goes against even the best and most precise Russian estimates, according to which military potential may be strong, asymmetrically, but still much inferior to US military might. 
Well-informed Western analysts know that Moscow never brags about military buildups – and has mastered to a fault the element of surprise. Much more than calling a bluff, it’s Moscow’s Sun Tzu tactics that are really rattling loudmouth Washington. The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world $27.95",1
25324,"As New York Breathes Sigh of Relief, Bomb Victims Cope With the Aftermath - The New York Times","One man’s front teeth were knocked out. Another blacked out when his car was hit by the force of the blast. And one woman had to have ball bearings tweezed from her flesh, metal fragments removed from her ear and wood shards extracted from her neck. When a   bomb exploded on Saturday night on West 23rd Street in Manhattan, more than two dozen people were hurt  —   most of them struck by shrapnel and flying debris and glass. Officials immediately assured they had only minor injuries, and when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Sunday morning that all the victims had been released from hospitals, there was a collective sigh of relief: In a city scarred by terror, not a single life was lost. But for the victims themselves, the injuries were nothing short of horrific  —   perhaps not life ending, but certainly life changing. In interviews, they described the shock of the explosion, then the strangeness of returning to daily life while carrying   injuries, from gashes with stitches to invisible wounds like ringing ears and nightmares. And while thankful to be alive, they experienced a paradox: One of the worst days of their lives is being referred to by practically everyone else as some kind of stroke of good luck. Four of those injured were recent graduates of Boston University, former roommates who had reunited for dinner and were walking to the subway. They were just feet from the trash bin believed to have concealed the explosive device when it detonated. The moment itself was a blur. “All of the sudden we were running out of there,” said one of the four, Noah McAskill, 22. As they joined other victims, they discovered they had all been hurt. Harris Gordon was bleeding from a cut in his back Luke Sorenson had a gash in his leg. Mr. McAskill had escaped with a few cuts and some hearing loss his hearing returned, though his ears were ringing for days. But his roommate, Joshua Lee, had been hit in the face and lost his two front teeth. His face was still swollen days later and he had been outfitted with temporary false teeth, said Mr. Lee, 22, originally from Los Angeles. An oral surgeon would repair his teeth permanently, but the process would take time. He planned to return to work soon. The young men all said they were focusing on resuming normalcy, but “these boys went to Boston University and lived through the Boston Marathon,” Mr. Gordon’s mother, Andrea, said. “They’ve lived through this twice. ” The criminal complaint filed this week against the suspect in the bombing, Ahmad Khan Rahami, listed the injuries suffered by the 31 victims  —   two more than originally reported  —   and included “lacerations in the face, abdomen, legs and arms caused by flying glass” and “metal shrapnel and fragmentation embedded in skin and bone. ” After being released from hospitals in the early hours of Sunday morning, those hurt dispersed into the city, and possibly beyond, left to deal with the aftermath on their own. Helena Ayeh, an architect who lives on West 23rd Street, in the Chelsea neighborhood, was swept off her feet by the blast and cut her right eye. Days later, her eye was still swollen and burning and she had trouble seeing through it, she said. “I’m affected for goodness knows how long, and it’s just sad,” she said. Ms. Ayeh tried to return to work on Monday, she said, but her limited eyesight made it too difficult. She was taken off a project that she was counting on for her income for the remainder of the year. “It’s a very heavy blow,” she said. “I’m sitting here wringing my hands asking, where I go from here?” It could have been worse. The   bomb, loaded with ball bearings, has been described as extremely powerful. Similar bombs at the Boston Marathon in 2013 left three dead and many injured, some requiring amputations. But that was a packed street, with spectators standing shoulder to shoulder and the bombs planted at their feet. While Chelsea is certainly crowded on Saturday nights, the pedestrians and cars were not as close together. At the same time, the placement of the bomb  —   believed to be beneath a   trash bin  —   may have contained the blast somewhat, though it sent the bin flying 120 feet. By sheer luck it did not strike anyone. Brenda Abreu and her boyfriend, David Martinez, 34, were driving past that spot at precisely the worst moment. “One second we were driving,” said Ms. Abreu, 32, who is seven months pregnant. Then the windows on the left side shattered completely, and the car was lifted onto its   wheels. “For a second I thought my car was on fire,” she said. Her boyfriend blacked out at the wheel and sprained his knee in the blast. Debris from the bomb struck him behind the ear, leaving him with burn marks. The next thing Ms. Abreu remembered, she was facing emergency responders near the ambulances. “Am I going to go into labor?” she thought. She was put on a stretcher. At Bellevue Hospital Center, one of four hospitals where victims were sent, the two were examined and released early Sunday morning both sustained mild concussions. Dr. Eric Cruzen, the medical director of emergency medicine at Lenox Health Greenwich Village, said his department treated nine patients, including one pediatric patient, for lacerations from shrapnel and glass, head injuries and mild concussions, and decreased hearing caused by the rapid change in pressure during the explosion. Many of the patients who experienced ear trauma had been inside cars at the time of the explosion, and said their windows had been blown out. The same pressure that shatters a window can also shatter an eardrum, Dr. Cruzen said. “It can burst like a window does,” Dr. Cruzen said. “It can be very alarming. ” He added, “I think the psychological effect of being bombed in your home city was probably the worst. ” Ms. Abreu missed two days of work at her job as an administrative assistant, and had rarely left the house. She has had nightmares and trouble sleeping. She refused to watch the news. “Every time I see his picture,” she said, referring to Mr. Rahami, “it just brings back everything. ” Victims of trauma might experience insomnia, irritability,   or a loss of or gain in appetite, said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. They might be easily startled by loud sounds. “These are effects that will linger for some period of time,” he said. Over the long term, people in the most extreme cases might have recurring memories of the event, or even lose the ability to concentrate or perform usual work tasks. A person’s psychological recovery does not depend on the scale of the event, whether it is the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, or a blast with no serious injuries. “If you’re the person affected, it doesn’t make a difference if it’s a mass tragedy,” Dr. Lieberman said. For those affected by the bombing in Chelsea, feelings are mixed. Since Saturday, Andrea Gordon, the mother of one of the Boston University graduates, has repeatedly thought of other terrorist attacks and found herself flooded with gratitude. “Thank God this guy was captured, and thank God he was an amateur,” she said. Asked if she had talked to her son about how he felt, she said, “I’m going to get there. ” For the moment, her son and his friends were looking to the future. “They don’t want to relive the night,” she said.",1
25326,Kerry Lists Obama Era’s Diplomatic Successes. (Trump Opposes Them All.) - The New York Times,"In an exit memorandum reflecting on eight years of United States foreign policy, Secretary of State John Kerry enumerated the Obama administration’s diplomatic accomplishments. But that record may be weakened or overturned by   Donald J. Trump, who has denigrated many of President Obama’s policies. Here is a look at how the secretary and the   see the major foreign policy issues differently. Kerry: Mr. Kerry praised the 2015 deal that the United States brokered with Iran to curtail that country’s ability to produce nuclear weapons. Mr. Kerry wrote that before the deal was struck, Iran was less than “90 days away from having the material necessary to produce one nuclear weapon,” but “today they are at least a year away. ” He wrote on Thursday, “In reaching and implementing this deal, we took a major security threat off the table without firing a single shot. ” Trump: Mr. Trump made criticism of the nuclear deal a major talking point of his foreign policy in the presidential campaign. He has called the agreement “the worst deal ever negotiated. ” At a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March, he said, “My No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. ” Later, he said he would renegotiate the agreement. Kerry: The secretary said that the United States tried to reset relations with Russia early in President Obama’s first term, but that a series of aggressions including “unprecedented cyber intrusions,” “military intervention in Syria,” and the “illegal occupation” of Ukraine impeded that effort. Trump: Mr. Trump has made improved relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a cornerstone of his future foreign policy. After American intelligence agencies provided evidence that Russians hacked Democratic National Committee systems to help tip the election in his favor, Mr. Trump criticized the reliability of the intelligence community. He has praised Mr. Putin and said he would work closely with him to combat the Islamic State. Mr. Trump also seemed to upend American nuclear weapons policy when he declared in December: “Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all. ” Kerry: Mr. Kerry devoted a significant portion of his memo to climate change, calling it “not just a threat to the future of our planet, but a growing and immediate threat to our national security. ” He lauded an agreement struck between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, which bolstered a global climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 that he called the most “ambitious, inclusive climate agreement ever negotiated. ” Trump: Mr. Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” said he would “cancel” the Paris accords and vowed to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency “in almost every form. ” His nominee to run that agency is Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry, who has led the legal battle against Mr. Obama’s   policies. Kerry: Though the Obama administration never fulfilled a promise to shutter the Guantánamo Bay detention center, Mr. Kerry wrote that ”no single action would do more to reaffirm our commitment to international human rights norms and remove a recruiting tool for terrorists than closing” the site. During Mr. Obama’s presidency, the number of detainees decreased to 59 from 242, with 20 approved for transfer. Trump: In a message posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Mr. Trump wrote: “There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield. ” Kerry: “It would be a moral failing of the highest caliber to turn our backs on those in need  —   including and especially from countries like Syria and Iraq,” Mr. Kerry wrote, adding that the United States had a “profound responsibility to help refugees. ” Trump: After the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. in December 2015, Mr. Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. ” Later in the campaign, he said: “We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place. ”",1
25327,The Roots of the Battle Over Neil Gorsuch: ‘They Started It’ - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   There was no filibuster for Clarence Thomas, whose Supreme Court confirmation hearings provoked a national uproar over sex, race and the behavior of powerful men. Antonin Scalia, for a generation the court’s irrepressible conservative id, earned 98 votes in the Senate. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now the patron saint of liberal jurisprudence, got 96. But with the Senate careering toward a   showdown over President Trump’s nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the body’s long history of relative collaboration on Supreme Court matters has come to this: Next week, the last bastion of comity is expected to fall over a plainly qualified,   nominee who had no major stumbles in his hearings. And each party’s justification can often be summarized with a schoolyard classic: They started it. “I worry for the institution,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who broke with her colleagues last year in calling for a hearing and a vote on Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s own plainly qualified,   nominee. “I think, at the risk of alienating everyone I have to work with here, that there’s real shortsightedness on both parts. ” Leaders of both parties seem largely resigned to the next act. With Republicans eager to vote on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination next week, he is seen as unlikely to attract the support of at least eight Democrats, which he needs to reach the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster. And the Republican majority, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has hinted strongly that it intends to change longstanding rules to elevate Judge Gorsuch with a simple majority vote if necessary. Mr. Trump has encouraged such a move. The specter of Judge Garland, whom Republicans refused to even consider in a presidential election year, has hovered over Judge Gorsuch’s nomination from the beginning, leaving Democrats and the party’s progressive base to stew over what they view as a stolen seat. But veteran lawmakers and scholars of the court have absorbed the present tumult in a deeper context: a prospective Senate nadir achievable only after years of creeping institutional shifts, a mutual recognition of the judiciary’s capacity to accelerate a party’s agenda, and a bipartisan embrace of hypocritical arguments and counterarguments, adopted and abandoned with the political winds. “This is more the coup de grâce than a new beginning,” said Jeffrey Rosen, president of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia and an author on Supreme Court matters. “It may indeed make it impossible for presidents to confirm any nominee at any point in their terms unless they also have control of the Senate. ” Some past flash points are familiar  —   charged enough to enshrine “Bork” as a verb and forever alter the connotations of Coke cans  —   rendered already in history as signposts of the electrified politics surrounding the court’s nominees. Other episodes, like the escalating partisan tensions over federal judgeships, served to erode Senate cooperation on judicial matters in less immediately perceptible ways. A surge in spending from outside groups, particularly on the right, has also increasingly lent the proceedings a   feel. Then there was the precursor in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate under Mr. Obama. Facing a blockade of the president’s appeals court and executive branch nominees, the party changed the rules to bar filibusters for such positions, but left the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations untouched. Republicans have not forgotten. “I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you’ll regret this,” Mr. McConnell predicted at the time. “And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think. ” The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, has indeed said he regrets his party’s choice then, when Senator Harry Reid of Nevada was the Democrats’ leader. But the Supreme Court was meant to be different. Under current rules, the minority party can still prevent a vote on a nominee if more than 40 members band together in the filibuster. If 60 senators invoke “cloture,” the filibuster is broken and a full vote can proceed, with only majority support required. In an interview on Thursday at his office in the Capitol, Mr. Schumer said his party’s efforts were about more than protesting the treatment of Judge Garland. He cited concerns over Judge Gorsuch’s record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence from Mr. Trump and conservative groups like the Federalist Society, which pushed for Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. “It’s not vengeance for us,” he said. “It’s not payback. ” There has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. In 1968, senators from both parties joined forces to block Justice Abe Fortas, whom President Lyndon B. Johnson sought to elevate to chief justice. Their obstruction  —   “ironically, in the middle of a presidential election year,” Mr. McConnell noted this week  —   centered on Mr. Johnson’s   status and ethical questions surrounding Justice Fortas, among other issues. The Senate’s rejection in 1987 of Judge Robert H. Bork signaled a newfound focus on judicial philosophy and temperament, not merely a nominee’s qualifications, as grounds for credible opposition. Four years later, Justice Thomas’s explosive hearings and narrow confirmation, by a vote of 52 to 48, cemented the process as inescapably political, even as the next   of Supreme Court confirmations often proceeded with a bipartisanship that has summarily vanished. And for all the outcry over Justice Thomas, no senator chose to filibuster him. “It was a function of norms of the Senate, not rules of the Senate,” said Martin B. Gold, a former senior Senate staff member who is considered an authority on the body’s procedures and protocols. “The rules would have permitted what the norms did not. ” Justice Thomas is one of two sitting justices, along with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to have fallen short of 60 votes, complicating Democrats’ recent claims that Judge Gorsuch must be held to a   “standard” for confirmation. There is likewise, with respect to Judge Garland, no rule prohibiting the consideration of Supreme Court nominees eight months before an election. Sanford V. Levinson, a Supreme Court expert at the University of Texas School of Law, said the present enmity stemmed as much from bitter quarrels over   judgeships as from past clashes over Supreme Court picks. He noted the series of filibusters against judicial nominees under President George W. Bush. “The Democrats did escalate,” Mr. Levinson said. “And the Republicans in turn escalated further with regard to doing what they could to delay Obama’s appointments  —   and then the kind of ultimate escalation with regard to Merrick Garland. ” In the interview, Mr. Schumer argued that the treatment of Judge Garland was “worse than a filibuster. ” And no one, he added, is forcing the Republicans’ hand. “If they change the rules, it’s their volition,” he said. It has been a trying moment for the   institutionalists of the Senate, members with a particular attachment to the body’s rituals and norms. At the same time, Republicans have generally declined to assign themselves any blame for the rancor. This week, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the   Republican in the chamber, said the Democrats’ pursuit of a filibuster had become “demeaning to the Senate and to this country. ” Last year, both Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that they might seek to keep Mr. Scalia’s seat vacant indefinitely if Hillary Clinton won the election. But there is perhaps no surer signal of the Senate’s lurch toward confrontation than Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the body’s   member. On Monday, Mr. Leahy was quoted as saying he was “not inclined to filibuster,” even as he expressed his opposition to Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. Hours later, as liberal activists scolded him, the septuagenarian senator issued a clarification on Twitter. “I am never inclined to filibuster a SCOTUS nom,” he wrote, leaving the requisite wiggle room. “But I need to see how Judge Gorsuch answers my written Qs, under oath, before deciding. ”",1
25328,6 Ex-Rikers Guards Sentenced to Prison in Attack on Inmate - The New York Times,"Six former New York City correction officers returned to Rikers Island  —   this time as inmates  —   after being sentenced on Friday to prison terms of from four and a half years to six and a half years for their roles in the brutal beating of an inmate there in 2012. The sentencing of the former officers in State Supreme Court in the Bronx came three months after they were convicted of   attempted gang assault, the most serious offense, and other charges. The case opened a window on a pervasive culture of violence at Rikers, the troubled city jail complex that houses 8, 000 inmates, at a time when many critics, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, have called for it to be closed. While there have been other instances of brutality against inmates, this case stood out because of the large number of officers involved, as well as the high rank of some of them. Prosecutors said Eliseo Perez Jr. an assistant chief for security, and Gerald Vaughn, a captain, ordered members of an elite squad to beat the inmate, Jahmal Lightfoot, after Mr. Perez decided Mr. Lightfoot was being insolent. Justice Steven Barrett sentenced Mr. Perez, Mr. Vaughn and four others  —   Jose Parra, Tobias Parker, Alfred Rivera and David Rodriguez  —   in a courtroom filled with their friends, relatives and fellow correction officers. Dozens of other supporters waited in a hallway outside. Each of the men had faced up to 15 years in state prison on the   attempted gang assault charge. The other charges on which the six were also convicted included attempted assault in the first degree, assault in the second degree, falsifying business records and official misconduct. “At Rikers Island one day several years ago, officers entrusted with the duty to maintain order and discipline without resorting to force succumbed to their worst instincts and to the casual violence that is too often prevalent among the prison population these men were entrusted to watch,” Justice Barrett said, describing a case he said involved a “dereliction of duty at Rikers Island. ” Justice Barrett gave the longest sentence  —   six and a half years  —   to Mr. Perez, whom he called the “most culpable” of the defendants the judge sentenced Mr. Vaughn to five and a half years in prison. The other four former officers each received terms of four and a half years. The six men were immediately taken into custody after being sentenced and were later sent to Rikers. They will eventually be transferred to state prison. Justice Barrett also sentenced two former officers not directly involved in the beating, Harmon Frierson and Dwayne Maynard, to conditional discharges and 500 hours of community service apiece. They were convicted in June on charges of official misconduct for their roles in efforts to try to cover up the attack. Mr. Lightfoot, who was released from state prison in 2014, was in the courtroom as one former officer after another was sentenced during a proceeding that lasted nearly three hours. Afterward, he declined through his lawyer to comment. Lawrence Piergrossi, a prosecutor, praised Mr. Lightfoot in court for coming forward to report the beating by the officers, which occurred in a cell used for searching inmates. “What was supposed to be left in that search pen  —   because of Jahmal Lightfoot’s courage  —   has been brought to light,” Mr. Piergrossi said. The former officers, none of whom testified at trial, were portrayed by their lawyers as devoted family men and dedicated public servants without criminal records. Mr. Perez, his lawyer said, had helped with rescue efforts after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Rodriguez’s youngest child was born during the trial. Others were described by their lawyers as caring for aging or sick parents, and serving in their churches. Several of the defense lawyers said their clients were appealing the guilty verdicts. Nine former and current correction officers were tried together last spring in connection with the beating of Mr. Lightfoot and subsequent effort to cover it up. Five were found guilty by a jury three, who chose a bench trial, were found guilty by Justice Barrett. The verdicts were a major victory for the Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, a Democrat, who has made prosecuting crimes committed by anyone at Rikers a priority. Law enforcement officials in New York and elsewhere have struggled to successfully prosecute correction officers accused of brutality, in part because of negative perceptions of, and credibility problems with, victims accused or convicted of crimes. Mr. Lightfoot testified during the trial that it was “open season” for the officers to pummel him mercilessly with their fists and boots even as he curled into a fetal position on the floor. The attack left him with injuries that included two fractured eye sockets. Defense lawyers, who rested their case without calling any witnesses, argued that their clients had committed no wrongdoing. They said Mr. Lightfoot had been found with a sharp metal object during a routine search of inmates, and had then disregarded the officers’ repeated orders to drop the object. Mr. Lightfoot, the defense lawyers said, was injured while being forcibly restrained by officers who were simply doing their jobs. The defense lawyers also sought repeatedly to undermine the credibility of Mr. Lightfoot, who was sent to Rikers in 2010 after being accused of stealing a woman’s pocketbook. They cited his ties to the Bloods street gang and his criminal history involving drugs and other minor offenses. They suggested that he had concocted a story about being singled out and beaten, and hoped to gain financially from a lawsuit against the city over the attack that is pending. Mr. Perez retired from the New York City Correction Department in 2013 Mr. Vaughn retired in 2014. The six other officers convicted of criminal charges have been fired, according to correction officials. Jeffrey Richard, the only officer to be acquitted, remains a correction officer. A 10th officer, Michael Pollard, has also been charged in the beating of Mr. Lightfoot. He will be tried separately because of medical problems. He retired in July, according to correction officials.",1
25329,Palestinian Authority Media Likens Trump to Hamas,"TEL AVIV  —   The American people made a historic mistake in democratically electing President Donald Trump just as the Germans did when they elected Hitler and Gaza Palestinians did with their election of Hamas, a Palestinian columnist said, joining a chorus of Palestinian commentators who are slamming the new president as a “fascist,” “lunatic,” and “megalomaniac. ”[Bassem Barhoum, a columnist for Palestinian daily     expressed the importance of keeping the “resistance” movement alive. The   demonstrations that took place in the wake of the president’s inauguration were protests, he said, of the “savage capitalism and unprecedented greed that he represents, and to the dangers he could bring upon the world. ”  “What gives me hope is that Trump’s insistence on repeating his mistakes and his provocative and   statements will nurture this awakening [movement and keep it alive],” he wrote in the paper translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) in a new report highlighting the Palestinian mood regarding Trump’s presidency. It is puzzling that nations, no matter how civilized, keep repeating the same mistakes when exercising their right to hold democratic elections.   …     The Palestinian people made this mistake in 2006 when it elected Hamas in a moment of frustration, despair and rage [while] the civilized and educated German people elected Hitler and his Nazi party. Barhoum decried Trump’s “use of the threat of radical Islam as a bogeyman. ” Meanwhile, Hassan Khader, a columnist for the Palestinian Authority’s   paper, made the following morbid prediction: “If the Americans do not manage to drive Donald Trump out of the White House, he will drive democracy out of their land. ” Khader echoed Barhoum’s comparisons with Nazi Germany, save for one important distinction. While Hitler regarded Jews as the source of all of Germany’s problems, Trump regards immigrants and Muslims as “an enemy responsible for all the problems that plague the U. S. and its citizens. ” PLO Executive Committee Secretary and former negotiator Saeb Erekat said Trump’s “rightwing extremism” was reminiscent of   War II Europe. Also in the official Palestinian rag     Omar   asserted that “Trump suffers from megalomania and narcissism stemming from unbelievable arrogance. This dangerous tendency does not bode well for the U. S. and its people. ” He added that the new president was “a reckless, arrogant and racist man for whom tact and respect for the other are foreign concepts. ” “That the billionaire Trump has been elected U. S. president poses a tangible danger to [America’s] status and role [in the world, and endangers] the capitalist West, since his positions and statements reveal that he means to divide the capitalist West and turn the world and its international institutions upside down,”   concluded. “This can change the entire system of international relations. Hence, the [world’s] leaders and countries must take precautions and [prepare for] various scenarios so as to avoid [being harmed by] surprising decisions that the new U. S. president might take. The logical conclusion to draw regarding the future is that, in the Trump era, the U. S. will be at a crossroads. ” As soon as Trump came into power, Palestinian officials expressed their fear that the new administration would be biased towards Israel, supporting settlement expansion and a possible embassy transfer to Jerusalem. Maen Erekat, chief of the PLO delegation in Washington, said that any credibility the U. S. has left in the Middle East will suffer greatly if “Trump takes positions that are clearly biased towards Israel and its policy that violates international law and the UN resolutions. ” Fatah official Nabil Sha’ath told the Hamas publication  : “The coming period is dangerous for the Palestinians in the shadow of the Trump administration and of an extremist government in Israel headed by Netanyahu. ” Fatah Central Committee Member Abbas Zaki criticized Trump’s pick for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who is an open supporter of the settlements. He further warned that if Trump follows through with his promise to move the embassy it would “open the gates of hell. ” He added that the Americans will “lose if they do not back down. ” “No one can divide the Muslims,” he wrote. Fatah Central Committee Member Nasr   said that an embassy transfer would be a “clear assault” against the Palestinian people and would result in the closure of the Palestinian mission in Washington. “The Palestinian side will sever its ties with the official staffers of the U. S. Embassy that will be illegally situated in Jerusalem,” he wrote. He added that the move would instigate “popular action,” an apparent euphemism for mass violence, and added that he predicts “a great deal of fury” from the Muslim and Arab world. Speaking on the official Palestinian Authority TV channel on January 18, Fatah Central Committee member Jibril Rajoub referred to Trump as a “lunatic” and said that the embassy relocation was a “declaration of war” against the whole world. Rajoub said, “We want the confrontation to be between this new Fascist in the White House and the whole world  —   Christians as well as Muslims. ”",1
25330,CDC vaccine science covers up giant conflict of interest,"Jon Rappoport 
If you wanted to buy a product, and the main source of research on the product was the company selling it, would you automatically assume the product was safe and effective? 
But you see, that’s the just the beginning of the problem. Suppose the company’s research was cited thousands of times in the press, as the authoritative standard of proof—and anyone who disputed that research was labeled a conspiracy theorist and a quack and a danger to the community and an anti-science lunatic. 
Would you begin to suspect the company had some awesome media connections? Would you suspect some very powerful people were backing the company? 
This is exactly the situation with the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Read these two quotes: 
The government’s Vaccine for Children Program (a CDC organization) purchases vaccines for about 50 percent of children in the U.S.” (The Atlantic, February 10, 2015) 
“The CDC currently spends over $4 billion purchasing vaccines [annually] from drug makers…” (Health Impact News, October 24, 2016) 
However, the CDC is also the gold standard for research on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. It turns out an unending stream of studies on these subjects. And the results of those studies are dutifully reported in the mainstream press. 
Do you think, under any circumstances, the CDC would publish data showing vaccines are ineffective and dangerous? They’d be cutting their own throats. 
“Well, we spend $4 billion a year buying vaccines from drug companies, but guess what? These vaccines are often dangerous…” 
Every time you read about a CDC study on vaccines, keep this obvious conflict of interest in mind. 
When, in 2014, William Thompson, a long-time CDC researcher, publicly admitted he and his colleagues had buried data that would have shown the MMR vaccine increases the risk of autism, he was throwing a stick of dynamite into the whole CDC operation. He was also saying, in recorded phone conversations, that the CDC was lying about vaccine safety in other studies. 
This is why major media refused to cover or investigate Thompson’s claims. This is why they spread a blanket of silence over his revelations. 
Thompson was threatening a $ 4-billion-a-year enterprise. 
The CDC is both a PR agency for, and a buyer from, Big Pharma. 

Speaking of PR, would you like to see an example of how the CDC promotes the yearly flu vaccine by lying egregiously about flu deaths in the United States? 
In December of 2005, the British Medical Journal (online) published a shocking report by Peter Doshi, which created tremors through the halls of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), where “the experts” used to tell the press that 36,000 people in the US die every year from the flu. 
Here is a quote from Doshi’s report, “Are US flu death figures more PR than science?” (BMJ 2005; 331:1412): 
“[According to CDC statistics], ‘influenza and pneumonia’ took 62,034 lives in 2001—61,777 of which were attributable to pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.” 
Boom. 
You see, the CDC has created one overall category that combines both flu and pneumonia deaths. Why do they do this? Because they disingenuously assume that the pneumonia deaths are complications stemming from the flu. 
This is an absurd assumption. Pneumonia has a number of causes. 
But even worse, in all the flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus. 
Therefore, the CDC could not say, with assurance, that more than 18 people died of influenza in 2001. Not 36,000 deaths. 18 deaths. 
Doshi continued his assessment of published CDC flu-death statistics: “Between 1979 and 2001, [CDC] data show an average of 1348 [flu] deaths per year (range 257 to 3006).” These figures refer to flu separated out from pneumonia. 
This death toll is obviously far lower than the parroted 36,000 figure. 
However, when you add the sensible condition that lab tests have to actually find the flu virus in patients, the numbers of flu deaths plummet even further. 
In other words, it’s all promotion and hype. 
“Well, uh, we say that 36,000 people die from the flu every year in the US. But actually, it’s closer to 20. However, we can’t admit that, because if we did, we’d be exposing our gigantic psyop. The whole campaign to scare people into getting a flu shot would have about the same effect as warning people to carry iron umbrellas, in case toasters fall out of upper-story windows…and, by the way, we’d be put in prison for fraud.” 
The CDC must turn out a steady stream of outrageous lies about the need for vaccines. If they didn’t, they’d have no way to justify the billions of dollars they spend every year buying the vaccines from drug companies. 
Since the sold-out major media won’t connect these dots, I and others need to.

25331,Rabbi Complains of Pope Francis’ ‘Daily’ Use of Anti-Jewish Rhetoric,"A prominent Italian rabbi has denounced what he sees as a growing Catholic undercurrent “of resentment, intolerance, and annoyance” toward Judaism, exacerbated by the Pope’s “careless” repetition of   stereotypes. [In an open letter, Rabbi Giuseppe Laras, the former chief rabbi of Milan, expressed his dismay that despite important advances in   relations, the Pope seems to repudiate them with his use of   rhetoric in his homilies.  “What a shame,” Rabbi Laras writes, that the official documents of the Catholic Church regarding the Jewish faith “should be contradicted on a daily basis by the homilies of the pontiff, who employs precisely the old, inveterate structure and its expressions, dissolving the contents of the aforementioned documents. ” As one example, the rabbi referenced the Pope’s preaching on the law of “an eye for an eye,” which, he said, the pontiff recently evoked “carelessly and mistakenly,” leading to a misrepresentation of the meaning of the law for Judaism. Rabbi Laras is not the first Jewish leader to voice his displeasure over the pope’s frequent references to the “hypocrisy” of the Jewish Pharisees and the “legalism” of the Jewish doctors of the law. Already in 2015, the chief rabbi of Rome, Riccardo di Segni, said that he had taken his complaints about the Pope’s preaching directly to the pontiff himself, explaining exactly what he found offensive about his homilies. In his letter, Rabbi Laras associates the Pope’s treatment of Judaism to what he sees as a broader problem with contemporary Catholic discourse involving the Jewish faith. Laras wrote that he was not alone in this impression, identifying a number of “disquieting facts,” which “many of us have felt in the air for quite some time. ” These “disquieting facts” include “a substantial distrust of the Bible and a subsequent minimization of the Jewish biblical roots of Christianity,” which, he said, seemed to indicate a new form of the ancient Christian heresy of Marcionism, which held that the God of the Old Testament was fundamentally different from the God worshiped by Christians. The biblical dichotomy between Old and New Testaments, Laras argues, signals “the resumption of the old polarization between the morality and theology of the Hebrew Bible and of Pharisaism, and Jesus of Nazareth and the Gospels. ” The rabbi also underscored the Church’s “embracing of Islam, which is all the stronger as the Christian side is more critical toward Judaism, now including even the Bible and biblical theology. ” He also identified an undercurrent “of resentment, intolerance, and annoyance on the Christian side toward Judaism. ” These and other troubling signs were made very apparent by a recently published event guide for the upcoming fall conference of the Italian Biblical Association (ABI) Rabbi Laras contended. “I observe with the highest displeasure and concern that this ABI program is substantially a defeat for the presuppositions and contents of   dialogue,” he wrote, “which for some time now has been reduced, sadly, to fluff and hot air. ” “I am, and this is a euphemism, very indignant and embittered!” he said. Some Vatican observers have suggested that the Pope’s remarks that have angered the Jewish community stem not so much from any   on the Pope’s part as from his “carelessness in speech” allied to his dislike of doctrinal precision. “He is possessed of so negative an attitude toward theology that he fails to frame his comments with the requisite precision,” wrote Father Peter Stravinskas, author of The Catholic Church and the Bible, in a recent essay. At the core of the issues that have so distressed Rabbi Laras, he contends, is the Pope’s deep dislike of doctrine, theology and Canon Law. “Francis consistently pits ‘the Law’ against ‘the Gospel,’” Stravinskas writes, and his “allergic reactions to law make him see stark differences where complementarity is more in order. ” “Francis rails against law because of his predisposition against canon law and canon lawyers  —   as well as moral theologians who represent the consistent trajectory of Catholic morality,” he wrote. As a result, the Pope’s “uninformed and tendentious statements risk setting   relations back decades, if not centuries,” Stravinskas claimed. Follow Thomas D.

25333,They Finally Got Paid. Now They’re Ready to Play. - The New York Times,"PLYMOUTH, Mich.  —   The United States women’s hockey team is going from one tough battle off the ice to a big challenge on it. On Tuesday, the players reached an agreement for wages and increased support from U. S. A. Hockey, the sport’s domestic governing body, after threatening to boycott the 2017 world championship, which begins here on Friday. The landmark deal means that the United States will have a lineup of the best American players at its disposal. But the tense wrangling over the past two weeks has left the team, the   defending champions, with only two days to prepare for its opening game  —   a   clash with archrival Canada on Friday night. Meghan Duggan, the American captain, acknowledged that the short turnaround between   was not ideal, but she said the team had been energized by the wage fight. “What we just went through is just going to elevate our game that much more,” said Duggan, who led the push for more financial, marketing and training assistance from U. S. A. Hockey. “I’m so excited to carry the momentum into this week and kick off the tournament. ” The team’s first skate on Wednesday evening, she added, “was electric, very energetic, awesome practice. ” Monique   said groups of players have been training and skating on their own to maintain conditioning and competitiveness since the planned boycott was announced two weeks ago. “We only have two days to prepare, but we’ve been doing everything at home to be ready, so we’re not that concerned about only having two days together as a team,” she said. “We’ve been preparing all year for this tournament. ” Robb Stauber, who has been head coach of the team for just four weeks, said he used part of the team’s limited practice time to focus on critical situations, like power plays and penalty kills. “I’ve never faced a situation like this, but our players are resilient,” he said. “They showed that in their stance on what they believed in. We expect them to carry that resilience over to the ice. ” The national team players had been negotiating with U. S. A. Hockey for the past 15 months, seeking more financial assistance that would allow them to support themselves while training to compete at a   level. Many work two or more jobs while trying to fit in training camps and workouts. They sought, and received, travel and insurance provisions that equal those of the men’s team. Previously, U. S. A. Hockey gave the women $1, 000 a month in the six months leading up to Olympic tournaments. Now, each player will be guaranteed at least $2, 000 per month   and will be eligible for more generous performance bonuses. The women also pushed U. S. A. Hockey to put more effort into promoting the game among women and girls. The organization spends around $3. 5 million a year on the National Team Development Program, which grooms elite teenage boys to play college, professional and Olympic hockey. This year’s world championship is being played at U. S. A. Hockey Arena, perhaps the starkest example of the support the organization gives to teenage boys. U. S. A. Hockey acquired the rink in 2015 as a home for the development program, which fields two teams of players under the age of 18. Among its alumni are some of the top American players in the N. H. L. including Patrick Kane, Jack Eichel, Auston Matthews and Phil Kessel, the older brother of Amanda Kessel, a star on the women’s team. The rink includes a lavish training facility, with an indoor track, a weight room, a skating treadmill and a shooting cage  —   amenities few college teams can boast. “This is a pretty great facility for the N. T. D. P. program to be playing in,” Jocelyne   said. “We want the   girls and the younger generation to have a home like this and to be able to play in a place like this. That’s what we strive for. This is obviously a great facility for the boys’ teams and hopefully in the future for some girls’ teams. ” The players’ stand drew support from N. H. L. players as well as representatives from several other top sports leagues, celebrities and Billie Jean King, who fought for equal pay for women’s tennis players long before any of the women’s hockey players were born. A group of United States senators also issued a letter calling on U. S. A. Hockey to reach an agreement to ensure that the women’s team received equitable resources. “It was amazing the people we heard from,”   said. “When you get senators writing a letter, you know it’s become a big deal. ” U. S. A. Hockey unsuccessfully attempted to recruit a replacement team from the professional, college and high school ranks. Duggan and other national team members made dozens of phone calls and sent emails and texts asking players to decline to join a replacement team. While Tuesday’s agreement boosted the national team, Wednesday brought a fresh reminder of the challenges that remain for women’s hockey. The University of North Dakota, where the Lamoureux sisters played and worked as members of the coaching staff, announced that it was dropping its women’s hockey program. Eight North Dakota players participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics. “Tuesday was a big step forward and Wednesday, for my sister and me and girls in the Grand Forks region, it was two steps backward,”   said. “There’s so many girls in that area, that team is the only team they have access to, so it’s really unfortunate. ” For now, though, there is work to be done on the ice. Friday’s game will match the two giants of women’s hockey. The United States and Canada have met in the final of all 18 world championships that have been played since the International Ice Hockey Federation organized the first tournament in 1990. The United States has won six of the last seven world championships, although Canada has won 10 over all. Canada has four Olympic gold medals in women’s hockey to the Americans’ one. “We love kicking off the tournament against them the atmosphere is going to be great,”   said. “The last few weeks, I think we’re a more cohesive group. There’s 100 percent trust in every player. These last two weeks was kind of its own team building. ” Kessel said the Americans were fired up to face Canada. “Every time it’s a lot of pride and it’s a hard game,” she said, “and it’s the most fun game. ”",1
25335,Freedom Rider: How Not to Protest Trump,"2016 elections by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
Donald Trump’s many evils are manifest and obvious. But let’s stop pretending that some historical line has been crossed in U.S. political and social relations. “The dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small.” Newly outraged Democrats act like they’ve never seen a fascist. “There is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms.” Freedom Rider : How Not to Protest Trump by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley 
“ There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. ” 
Thousands of progressives are taking to the streets in opposition to the Donald Trump presidency. After eight years of Obama induced slumber they awoke with quite a start. Many of these individuals and organizations protested as part of the anti-war, Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements, but others weren’t concerned about very much until the reality show host became president elect. 
The awful Hillary Clinton should be inaugurated the 45 th president of the United States because she won the popular vote. But for the second time in less than twenty years a Democrat preferred by the people will instead be an historical footnote. If nothing else the Electoral College is rightly condemned. 
But where else should protesters direct their anger? If they are concerned about fascism they could protest police killings, or United States government murders committed during numerous interventions abroad. They might have risen up against the mass incarceration state. The list of outrages that should get people moving is quite long. 
White liberals here in New York City didn’t care very much when black and brown residents were subjected to nearly one million police encounters. Mayor Bloomberg’s infamous stop and frisk program was a tailor made opportunity for public anger. Yet every poll indicated that white people were in favor of this very fascist 21 st century slave patrol. Those same people are now upset but what exactly has raised their ire? 
“Trump is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was.” 
They say they are concerned about the rights of undocumented people but they didn’t say much when Obama acted as the Deporter-in-Chief. The so-called Muslim registry of men from 25 countries under the auspices of the NSEERS program lasted from 2002 to 2011. That is to say during two years of the Obama administration. They may be concerned about climate change and Trump’s promise to end America’s participation in the most recent climate agreement. But that agreement allows for a rise in carbon production and thus in world temperatures. They would have been smarter to challenge the phony climate change process itself. 
They say they are afraid that Trump will muzzle the press. His shouting match with network executives should not be a cause for alarm. Eventually they’ll start saying good things about him so he was foolish to be so hostile. But he is no more hostile to the rights of the press than Obama was. When he used the Espionage Act to punish leakers and whistle blowers many of the now distraught progressives didn’t say much. 
So what has gotten progressives so angry? There is nothing new about the so-called alt-right movement. There is always a way to brand white nationalism. They may be the Tea Party one day and alt-right the next but it all amounts to the same thing. The dictates of white supremacy are ever present and the numbers of white people who do anything serious about it are small. 
If the sight of naziesque salutes to Trump are upsetting just keep in mind that there is an ample supply of domestic fascists. They are the people who wear police uniforms. They may not “hail Trump” or anyone else but they kill three people in this country every day. 
“ Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed.” 
Donald Trump should be given credit for providing so much low hanging fruit. His appointment of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions to the post of attorney general provides ready made ingredients for fear and anger. Sessions was once denied a federal judgeship in part because of racist remarks directed at a black attorney. And who can ignore the glorification of the Confederacy in his name. But what did Obama and his two black attorney generals do? There were no prosecutions of killer police. That fact is a curious one in the age of murder caught on video. The Obama Justice Department argued against giving the right to request resentencing for those convicted during the years of draconian drug crime prosecution. Barack Obama and Eric Holder quite literally kept thousands of black people in jail who could have been freed. 
It is difficult to take protesters seriously when they won’t even direct their anger at the party which displayed such gross incompetence during the recent campaign. The inability to defeat the man who seemed so unsuited to the presidency should stir anger towards the people whose hubris brought him to the White House. 
There is always a need to engage in struggle, whether a Republican or Democrat is president. There are many unique characteristics to the Donald Trump story but the institutional evils that permeate this country persist no matter who sits in the oval office. We can gauge the true level of concern about justice when a Democrat next emerges victorious. A president who provides a greater opportunity for scorn should not be the last one who faces opposition.

25336,Johnson & Johnson Ordered To Pay $72 Million In Another Ovarian Cancer Case Caused By Baby Powder,"  
This is one out of several cases raising concerns about the health consequences of using regular talcum powder use. Approximately 1,000 more cases have been filed in Missouri state court, and another 200 in New Jersey, but this may well be the tip of the iceberg. 
As Global News reports: “The jury ruling ended the trial that began Sept. 26 in the case brought by Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. The suit accused Johnson & Johnson of “negligent conduct” in making and marketing its baby powder.” 
Unfortunately, a statement from Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman with Johnson & Johnson, said in the statement to Global: “We deeply sympathize with the woman and families impacted by ovarian cancer…We will appeal today’s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder.”   Obviously, if these are the decisions being made by a court of law, there is ample amounts of science and evidence suggesting the baby powder was indeed the cause. Earlier in the year, a decision was made last by a Missouri state jury that awarded the family of Jacqueline Fox $10-million of actual damages and $62 million of punitive damages. In this case, we saw the exact same response from the company as the case noted above. These cases show how people are using something they thought was perfectly safe, but clearly wasn’t. One of the most painful revelations, as Bloomberg notes, is that: In the 1990s, even as the company acknowledged concerns in the health community, it considered increasing its marketing efforts to black and Hispanic women, who were already buying the product in high numbers. Fox was black. The jury foreman, Krista Smith, says internal documents provided the most incriminating evidence: ‘It was really clear they were hiding something.’ She wanted to award the Fox family even more. Imerys Talc America, the biggest talc supplier in the country and the sole source of the powder for J&J, was also named as a defendant. The company wasn’t found liable. The ‘scientific evidence’ to which she refers clearly have not withstood the scrutiny of either this trial or concerned members of the public; it also fails to account for who funded the research. Her remark also makes plain a disturbing trend amongst big corporations, which is the blind trust of their employees. Many clearly believe what they are told about the products they represent, without questioning or doing their own independent research. Scientific fraud induced by major corporations in this field is no secret, and various medical experts around the world have been speaking out against it for decades. Dr. Richard Horton, current Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet , one of the largest medical journals in the world, has publicly and unequivocally called out the scientific community for this negligence and outright fraud: The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. ( source ) The sheer volume of statements from very credible people, along with the documents and evidence, attesting to this disturbing trend, is simply overwhelming. (You can find more information and view more examples/statements in an article we recently published about anti-depressant drugs here .) Yet the unfortunate reality is that employees of these big corporations stand behind their products, working under the assurances of corporately-funded science which, obviously, has profit in mind rather than safety. This is a widespread and alarming problem, and it’s great to see more people raise their voice against these shady practices. Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), is another such professional to do so: It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. ( source ) It’s no secret that many household products are toxic to our health. Science has been confirming their dangers for years now (not that many of us needed this confirmation); these products are literally littered with a number of hazardous harmful chemicals. Researchers in the UK, for example, found that domestic products such as anti-insect sprays, deodorants, cleaning products, cosmetics, and more contain a number of cancer causing chemicals. The researchers, from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who concluded that these types of everyday household products maybe be contributing to 100,000 deaths every single year in Europe, warn that the public remains unaware of these risks. Another example of an insider speaking out against the industry is Foster Gamble, the direct descendant of one of the founders of Procter & Gamble (a company similar to Johnson & Johnson). He himself explains that he was groomed for the establishment, but his ethical concerns prompted him to change direction. To the left you will see a picture of him with Gerald Ford. Foster decided to leave the business and instead raise awareness about many issues, including the hazards associated with everyday household products that the corporations like his father’s manufacture. He’s had an interesting life to say the least, and you can watch a documentary he released a few years ago here .

25338,"Munich Killer Was Troubled, but Had No Terrorist Ties, Germany Says - The New York Times","MUNICH  —   He had been bullied at more than one school. He played violent video games, and developed a fascination with mass shootings. He kept a copy of the German edition of “Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters,” a study by an American academic psychologist, and he was treated for psychiatric problems. Somewhere along the way, Ali Sonboly got his hands on a   Glock handgun, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition for it. And at 5:52 p. m. on Friday, at a McDonald’s in Munich a few miles from where he lived with his mother, father and brother, he started shooting. Mr. Sonboly, 18, moved on to a shopping mall across the street, then to the top level of an adjacent parking garage. By the time his rampage was done, he had killed eight other young people and one   person. Then, in front of two police officers, he killed himself with his own gun, the police said. It was the third mass attack in Europe in little over a week, after the killings of 84 people in Nice, France, and an attack by a young refugee wielding an ax and a knife in Germany that left five people wounded. But unlike those two attacks, the one in Munich appeared, based on initial evidence, to have no overt links to the Islamic State or other terrorist groups, officials said Saturday. Nor did it seem to be directly linked to the wave of migration that has fueled racial, ethnic and religious tensions in Germany and across Europe. Instead, according to accounts by the police, prosecutors, and neighbors and schoolmates of Mr. Sonboly, this most recent assault appeared to be of a less ideological and more personal sort: a sudden, violent outlet for a quietly troubled young man. There were indications that Mr. Sonboly’s rampage might not have been entirely without political overtones. It was carried out on the fifth anniversary of a massacre in Norway by Anders Behring Breivik, a   extremist who killed 77 people. Asked about a possible link based on the date, the Munich police chief, Hubertus Andrä, said that “this connection is obvious” and was part of their investigation. “We must assume that he was aware of this attack,” Chief Andrä said. But the initial picture of Mr. Sonboly that emerged in the hours after police officers found him dead, less than a mile from the shopping mall with a backpack full of ammunition and a single bullet wound to his head, was of a young man whose concerns were much closer to home. Born and raised in Munich, he held both German and Iranian citizenship. His parents immigrated to Germany, and his father drives a cab. A student at a nearby public school, he was known to adult neighbors as a polite boy who delivered newspapers. He grew up in a secular household, neighbors said, and the family took pleasure in celebrations like birthdays and the Iranian New Year. Some news reports identified him as David Ali Sonboly, though he was known to everyone as Ali. “He was always friendly, very friendly,” said Tovaiau Edo, 32, who lives in the family’s apartment building. “When I saw him and saw the story, it’s like two different people. Not the same people. I cannot believe this. ” But officials and neighbors said Saturday that Mr. Sonboly had been struggling on several levels. He had two previous encounters with the police, both times as a victim, once having been bullied by three other young people and once having been robbed. He spent considerable time playing violent online video games. He had been getting psychiatric treatment, possibly for depression, officials said. “He was always nice, kind, helpful,” said a    neighbor who attended the same school on Alfons Street as the attacker and asked to to be identified only by her first name, Safete. Safete said that she had seen the attacker at their apartment building around midday on Friday and that “he didn’t greet me, like he normally does. ” “He was focused on the papers he was holding,” she added. “He didn’t look up. ” Safete said the gunman had argued at one point with a schoolmate, “and said that he was going to go on a shooting rampage. ” She added that she could not remember the name of the schoolmate, or the date of the altercation. Safete’s    cousin, who gave her name as Majlinda and attends the same school, said the gunman had been bullied at his current school and a former one. “This has nothing to do with Islam,” she said. “It’s because he was bullied. ” A woman in a neighboring building, whose balcony faced the Sonboly family’s balcony, said she and her    son had become friendly with Ali. But the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Paulina, said she and her son had both noticed something off about him. “Ali was somehow closed up on the inside,” Paulina said. “He had something. I don’t know what it is, but something was wrong. ” There were hints that his rampage had been premeditated. In a raid at 3:30 a. m. Saturday on his family’s apartment in the Maxvorstadt neighborhood, which includes some of the city’s renowned art museums and is adjacent to the city’s historic center, the authorities found newspaper articles on police responses to other shooting rampages, as well as the book on school gunmen. The police also removed computer equipment, documents and other materials. Officials said they were investigating reports that the gunman might have hacked a girl’s Facebook page and promised food at an especially low price to lure people to the McDonald’s shortly before the first shootings. They were also investigating whether he had specifically targeted young people. Three of those killed were 14 years old, two were 15, and the others were 17, 19, 20 and 45. Three of the nine were female. All lived in the Munich area, officials said. Of the 27 people injured, 10 were in critical condition, including a    boy. After carrying out the shootings in the shopping mall, Mr. Sonboly retreated to the parking garage. From the top level, he engaged in a shouting match with one or more people at a distance, with the   exchange recorded on video. One of the bystanders fumed at “Turks,” and the gunman replied, “I am German,” “I was born here,” and “I grew up here in a Hartz IV area,” a reference to a tier of unemployment and welfare benefits  —   meaning that he was from a bottom rung of society. He seems to have eluded the police at that point, while the authorities were scrambling to respond to reports, later proved unfounded, of gunfire elsewhere and that there might have been as many as three attackers armed with long guns. At the height of the emergency, 2, 300 officers were deployed throughout the city. When the police found Mr. Sonboly’s body, they feared that the backpack he was carrying might contain a bomb. It did not, but it held 300 more rounds of ammunition. “We are assuming at the moment that we are talking about only one perpetrator, one perpetrator who committed suicide,” said Thomas   the chief state’s attorney in Munich. Among the many questions facing the authorities on Saturday as Munich slowly returned to normal was how Mr. Sonboly had gotten a handgun and so much ammunition, despite Germany’s strict gun laws. The serial number of the Glock had been scratched off, complicating the authorities’ ability to trace the firearm, said Robert Heimberger, the chief of the Bavarian State Criminal Police, at a late morning news conference. The teenager did not have a license to own a gun. There will also be questions about whether schools, social services and Mr. Sonboly’s family failed to take sufficient notice of his problems, and about the degree to which other attacks and violence in popular culture might have influenced him. “We cannot ignore  —   and I don’t know the solution, but without a doubt, and this was the case in this instance  —   that the glorifying of violence in internet games has a damaging effect on the development of young people,” Thomas de Maizière, the German interior minister, said on Saturday. Chancellor Angela Merkel, after meeting with top officials in Berlin, told the nation that the “night of horror” was traumatic for a Europe already reeling from attacks this month in Nice and on a train headed to Würzburg, Germany. “We are in deep and profound mourning for those who will never return to their families  —   the families, the siblings, the friends for whom everything will be void and empty today,” she said. Klaus Hurrelmann, a professor of public health and education at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, who wrote the introduction to the Germany edition of the academic study found in the gunman’s room, said the book examined 10 school killers in the United States. It found that they had mental illness, had been exposed to violence and had access to weapons  —   all of which appear to be the case for the Munich teenager. “It bears noting that the perpetrator had an academic book at his home,” Mr. Hurrelmann said. “He appears to have recognized a familiar suffering among the 10 men in the book, who were in a similar situation. ”",1
25342,"Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones - The New York Times","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   President Trump on Saturday accused former President Barack Obama of tapping his phones at Trump Tower the month before the election, leveling the explosive allegation without offering any evidence. Mr. Trump called his predecessor a “bad (or sick) guy” on Twitter as he fired off a series of messages claiming that Mr. Obama “had my ‘wires tapped. ’” He likened the supposed tapping to “ ” and “McCarthyism,” though he did not say where he had gotten his information. A spokesman for Mr. Obama said any suggestion that the former president had ordered such surveillance was “simply false. ” During the 2016 campaign, the federal authorities began an investigation into links between Trump associates and the Russian government, an issue that continues to dog Mr. Trump. His aides declined to clarify on Saturday whether the president’s allegations were based on briefings from intelligence or law enforcement officials  —   which could mean that Mr. Trump was revealing previously unknown details about the investigation  —   or on something else, like a news report. But a senior White House official said that Donald F. McGahn II, the president’s chief counsel, was working to secure access to what Mr. McGahn believed to be an order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing some form of surveillance related to Mr. Trump and his associates. The official offered no evidence to support the notion that such an order exists. It would be a highly unusual breach of the Justice Department’s traditional independence on law enforcement matters for the White House to order it to turn over such an investigative document. Any request for information from a top White House official about a continuing investigation would be a stunning departure from protocols intended to insulate the F. B. I. from political pressure. It would be even more surprising for the White House to seek information about a case directly involving the president or his advisers, as does the case involving the Russia contacts. After the White House received heavy criticism for the suggestion that Mr. McGahn would breach Justice Department independence, a different administration official said that the earlier statements about his efforts had been overstated. The official said the counsel’s office was looking at whether there was any legal possibility of gleaning information without impeding or interfering with an investigation. The counsel’s office does not know whether an investigation exists, the official said. Last month, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, came under fire for asking a top F. B. I. official to publicly rebut news reports about contacts between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that the “White House counsel is reviewing what options, if any, are available to us. ” Mr. McGahn did not respond to a request for comment. He was traveling on Saturday to Florida to join the president at his estate,   . The president’s decision on Saturday to lend the power of his office to accusations against his predecessor of politically motivated wiretapping  —   without offering any proof  —   was remarkable, even for a leader who has repeatedly shown himself willing to make assertions that are false or based on dubious sources. It would have been difficult for federal agents, working within the law, to obtain a wiretap order to target Mr. Trump’s phone conversations. It would have meant that the Justice Department had gathered sufficient evidence to convince a federal judge that there was probable cause to believe Mr. Trump had committed a serious crime or was an agent of a foreign power, depending on whether it was a criminal investigation or a foreign intelligence one. Former officials pointed to longstanding laws and procedures intended to ensure that presidents cannot wiretap a rival for political purposes. “A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,” said Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. “As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. ” Mr. Trump asserted just the opposite in a series of five Twitter messages beginning just minutes before sunrise in Florida, where the president is spending the weekend. In the first message, the president said he had “just found out” that “Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower” before the election. Mr. Trump’s reference to “wires tapped” raised the possibility that he was referring to some other type of electronic surveillance and was using the idea of phone tapping loosely. The president was adamant in conversations with several people throughout the day on Saturday that he believed he was right about the wiretaps, according to three people with direct knowledge of those conversations. Two people close to Mr. Trump said they believed he was referring to a Breitbart News article, which aides said had been passed around among his advisers. Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, had also embraced the theory recently in a push against what   commentators have been calling the “deep state. ” The Breitbart article, published on Friday, claimed that there was a series of “known steps taken by President Barack Obama’s administration in its last months to undermine Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and, later, his new administration. ” Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, once led Breitbart News. If Mr. Trump was motivated to take to Twitter after reading the Breitbart article or listening to Mr. Levin, he was using a presidential megaphone to spread dark theories of a broad conspiracy aimed at undermining his presidential ambitions, and later his presidency. Even with the Breitbart article circulating, several of Mr. Trump’s advisers were stunned by the president’s morning Twitter outburst. Those advisers said they were uncertain about what specifically Mr. Trump was referring to one surmised that he may also have been referring to a   news report about a secret surveillance warrant for communications at his New York offices. One senior law enforcement official from the Obama administration, who has direct knowledge of the F. B. I. investigation into Russia and of government wiretapping, said that it was “100 percent untrue” that the government had wiretapped Mr. Trump. The official, who asked for anonymity to discuss matters related to investigations and intelligence, said the White House owed the American people an explanation for the president’s allegations. Ben Rhodes, a former top national security aide to Mr. Obama, said in a Twitter message directed at Mr. Trump on Saturday that “no president can order a wiretap” and added, “Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you. ” The House and Senate Intelligence Committees are moving forward with their own investigations into Russia’s efforts to influence the election, and they have said they will examine links between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said on Friday that he believed there were “transcripts” that would help document those contacts, though he said he had not yet seen them. “There are transcripts that provide very helpful, very critical insights into whether or not Russian intelligence or senior Russian political leaders  —   including Vladimir Putin  —   were cooperating, were colluding, with the Trump campaign at the highest levels to influence the outcome of our election,” Mr. Coons told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC. “I believe they exist. ” In a written statement on Saturday, a spokesman for Mr. Coons said that the senator “did not imply that he is aware of transcripts indicating collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. ” The spokesman, Sean Coit, said Mr. Coons had “simply stated that a full review of all relevant transcripts and intelligence intercepts is necessary to determine if collusion took place. ” The New York Times reported in January that among the associates whose links to Russia are being scrutinized are Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman Carter Page, a businessman and foreign policy adviser to the campaign and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who said he was in touch with WikiLeaks at one point before it released a trove of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, last August. Mr. Stone later said he had communicated with WikiLeaks through an intermediary. Mr. Trump appeared on Saturday to suggest that warrants had been issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. He claimed that the Obama administration had once been “turned down by court” in its supposed efforts to listen in on conversations by Mr. Trump and his associates. In the fall, the F. B. I. examined computer data showing an odd stream of activity between a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s biggest banks, whose owners have longstanding links to Mr. Putin. While some F. B. I. officials initially believed that the computer activity indicated an encrypted channel between Moscow and New York, the bureau ultimately moved away from that view. The activity remains unexplained. There is no confirmed evidence that the F. B. I. obtained a court warrant to wiretap the Trump Organization or was capturing communications directly from the Trump Organization. During the transition, the F. B. I.  —   which uses FISA warrants to eavesdrop on the communications of foreign leaders inside the United States  —   overheard conversations between the Russian ambassador to the United States and Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump had named national security adviser. Mr. Trump has pointedly and repeatedly questioned in conversations how it was that Mr. Flynn’s conversations were recorded, and wondered who could have issued a warrant. After The Washington Post reported that Mr. Flynn and the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, had discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia, Mr. Flynn was pushed out of his post by the White House because he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls. The Breitbart article cited mainstream news reports and concluded  —   going beyond the public record  —   that the Obama administration had “obtained authorization to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found then relaxed the N. S. A. rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government. ” Mr. Levin, a day earlier, railed about what he called a “much bigger scandal,” claiming  —   again with no proof  —   that Mr. Obama and his aides had used “the instrumentalities of the federal government, intelligence activity, to surveil members of the Trump campaign and put that information out in the public. ” Several senior members of Mr. Trump’s White House staff did not respond to an email requesting    responses to more than a   questions about Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, denounced the “willingness of the nation’s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them. ” Even some Republican lawmakers questioned Mr. Trump’s accusations. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a statement demanding that the president reveal everything he knows about any wiretaps or warrants. “The president today made some very serious allegations, and the informed citizens that a republic requires deserve more information,” Mr. Sasse said, adding that “we are in the midst of a   crisis of public trust. ” Taping calls seems to hold a spot in Mr. Trump’s consciousness. He spent many years taping his own phone calls as a businessman. During the campaign, Mr. Trump’s staff members told reporters they feared that their offices were being bugged. But Mr. Trump’s latest allegations represented a sharp change in his tone toward Mr. Obama. The current president has frequently spoken about how much he admires Mr. Obama for the gracious way he handled the transition. But since taking office, Mr. Trump has frequently clashed with the intelligence agencies over the Russia inquiries, including efforts to examine the attempts by that country to influence the presidential election and the contacts between Mr. Trump’s aides and the Russian government. In recent days, the president has appeared increasingly angry about leaks of information that he believes are coming from law enforcement and intelligence officials who are holdovers or recently departed from Mr. Obama’s administration. People close to Mr. Trump have described him as determined to stop those people from sabotaging his administration. One adviser said on Friday that the president had been discussing a possible plan to try to prevent leaks from occurring. The adviser declined to elaborate on what the plan might entail. Two senior administration officials said Mr. Trump had tried for two days to find a way to be on an offensive footing against the news articles resulting from leaks one person close to Mr. Trump said his explosive claim was a result of that. Mr. Trump’s mood was said to be volatile even before he departed for his weekend in Florida, with an episode in which he vented at his staff. The president’s ire was trained in particular on Mr. McGahn, his White House counsel, according to two people briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump was said to be frustrated about the decision by Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, to recuse himself from participating in any investigations of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Trump has said there were no such connections. Mr. Trump, who did not learn that Mr. Sessions was recusing himself until after the decision was made, told aides that it gave an opening to his critics on the Russia issue.",1
25343,Muslims and Christians in French Town Pray Old Bonds Survive Priest’s Murder - The New York Times,"ST.    France  —   It was the first time since a childhood school trip that Anissa Latroche had set foot in a church. Ms. Latroche, a sociology student who is Muslim, came to Mass in the Rouen Cathedral on Sunday to pay tribute to the Rev. Jacques Hamel, the priest who was killed last week by two young men acting in the name of the Islamic State. “They welcomed us very nicely, me and my friend,” said Ms. Latroche, who was wearing a pale blue veil as she entered the church with a mixture of respect and shyness. She said she was shocked about what had happened to the priest, and even more so by the age of one of the killers, Adel Kermiche: 19, just like her. “I have not even started my life yet, and he basically ruined his and so many others’,” Ms. Latroche said. “I don’t get it. ” In the wake of Father Hamel’s murder, Muslim and Christian communities around France came together over the weekend to show solidarity by attending each other’s religious services, in churches and mosques alike. But the services in Rouen, and in St.    a nearby suburb where Father Hamel was killed, took on a special resonance. For people in this part of Normandy, the exchange served as a reminder that long before Father Hamel was killed, he and many others from both faiths had worked together to build bonds. In fact, the only mosque in St.    was built on land adjacent to one of the town’s churches after the church sold it for a symbolic price of one euro. The church where the priest was killed is in the city center. In the north of the city, members of the St.  du Madrillet church and the   Yahya Mosque prayed together after the killing. “This event should help us strengthen the links which already exist between us,” the Rev. Auguste   said on Friday in the mosque, where several Christian worshipers also attended. “As believers, we must show the example to build bridges between us and not walls, and this could be one of the solutions to fight what is happening right now. ” The imam, Abdellatif Hmito, emphasized the special links between the communities. “You don’t know, you the murderer, the history of this town, who was Father Hamel, and the history of this mosque,” the imam said. “You mistook the community you attacked, you mistook the city and the target, and I would even say you mistook the country. ” St.    was a small countryside village until the 19th century, when several waves of immigration transformed it into a   community of nearly 29, 000 today. Belgians first built a cotton and textile factory. Portuguese and Spanish people came after World War I and brought a strong Catholic community. North African immigrants first arrived in the 1950s, and Kurdish refugees in more recent years. “St.    has always been a melting pot of nationalities and immigrants,” said Pierre Ménard, a local historian. It was also one of the poorest cities in France, he noted, and has been a Communist Party stronghold for more than 50 years. The poverty helped forge ties between religious communities. Still, many inhabitants fear the attack’s potential impact on the social connections that have frayed considerably in recent years. In St.    young Muslims are increasingly worried about the radicalization of people they know, the high unemployment rate and a future in which no one is safe. “We all heard about how crazy Adel Kermiche was, and yet we just never took him seriously,” said Leïla Meterfi, 21, who is of Algerian descent. “We are so upset of how they so easily become brainwashed. ” Stéphane Meterfi, 44, emphasized that instead of being upset, young people needed to act, as he once did. Mr. Meterfi, born and raised in St.    lost one of his brothers at the age of 19 in a fight between rival neighborhood gangs. “It was in the ’90s I decided to create an association to help young people to get out of the quartier mentality and the violence,” Mr. Meterfi added, referring to something akin to a street mentality. “Then, when I created my association, the priest of the parish of St.  was the only one who gave us a place for meetings,” he added. “Nobody trusted the young petty thugs of the town, except for him. ” “The sisters used to be nurses for our mothers, and they planned every cultural activity in the town,” Mr. Meterfi said, referring to local nuns. Years later, Mr. Meterfi used to gather all of the neighborhood’s Muslim mothers and Abbé Pierre, a famous French priest who helped the homeless, for a giant couscous to celebrate interreligious dialogue in St.   . “I can’t believe that 20 years afterwards, a guy would kill the symbolic figure of the people who helped us at the time,” Mr. Meterfi said. Near the red and beige Yahya Mosque, the church of St.  du Madrillet with multicolored windows was welcoming believers on Friday for a prayer. Some were silently crying, others writing down messages in memory of Father Hamel. Sister Marie Wandrille, 71, came to pay a tribute to the man she had worked with for 20 years. “He was so attached to interreligious dialogue,” she said. “He and I used to give tutoring classes for children after schools. Muslims and Catholic children used to come to our parish every day. ” Near the church, Muslim women and Christian women set up an association to collect clothes for poor people. “The link between the two communities is very strong here,” Sister Wandrille said. “At the end of Ramadan, we still celebrate together,” she added, referring to the Muslim holy month. “I am sure that this attack will bring us closer, not the reverse. ” In front of the mosque, a group of young men from a Salafist group distributed leaflets condemning the attack, but they refused to speak to reporters. For Mr. Meterfi, it was an example of the two faces of the new generation in St.   . “They might be doing this peaceful distribution, and at the same time, they would hide their real intentions,” he said. “The truth is, we don’t really know or control our youth anymore. ” According to the local   department, 140 people in the region were considered “radicalized” last year. At St.   ’s City Hall, which faces the house of Father Hamel, people have left several messages calling for peace between members of different faiths. Hubert Wulfranc, the mayor, said he still believed that the town would “stand up” in the wake of the murder. “It must stand up” he added. But he recognized that recent violence might exacerbate tensions. He said he would be vigilant about reports of verbal aggression against Muslims, as well as other cases of “radicalization. ” “There were 2, 000 people gathered in the local stadium on Thursday to pay a tribute to Father Hamel,” Mayor Wulfranc noted. “We must ask ourselves where the other inhabitants were and why they did not come. ”",1
25345,Re: Voting Machine Problems Are Being Reported All Over America,"Voting Machine Problems Are Being Reported All Over America By Michael Snyder, on November 8th, 2016 
After what happened in the last election , people seem to be more alert to signs of potential election fraud this time around. And right now the Internet is buzzing with reports of voting machine problems in some of the most important swing states. In some areas officials were forced to make emergency switches to paper ballots due to voting machine issues, and in other cases voters that intended to vote for Donald Trump were having their votes registered for Hillary Clinton instead. The mainstream media is insisting that these are “isolated instances”, and hopefully that turns out to be true because the integrity of our elections is of the utmost importance. 
Voting machines are supposed to make voting easier and more efficient, but instead they are once again causing major headaches all over the country. The following summary of technical issues that we have seen so far comes from the New York Daily News … 
In Utah, voting machine problems in the southern part of the state forced poll workers to use paper ballots, with some residents sent to alternate voting locations. 
Voters in Colorado received provisional ballots after officials reported computer problems state-wide, though at least one county said that the state electoral system was back up Tuesday afternoon. 
Machine issues were reported in Wilson County, Tenn. — and at one point all of the county’s machines went down, according to local reports . Voting later resumed manually. 
In Texas, a computer used by election clerks malfunctioned at a polling place, so officials briefly diverted voters to another polling place more than two miles away. 
In Louisiana, some early voters were forced to wait as correct machines were installed. 
In Durham County, N.C., paper poll books were being used Tuesday due to “tech problems at a few sites.” 
But much more troubling is what has been happening in Pennsylvania. Numerous voters have been reporting that their votes were switched by the voting machines from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The following is an excerpt from one local news report … 
“Every time I would push a candidate for the Republican party, it would come up for the Democratic candidate,” said voter David Drane. 
Election judges in Clinton Township, Butler County confirmed there were issues with two of their eight automated voting machines. Most of the issues came when people tried to vote straight party ticket. 
However, others said they specifically wanted to vote for Republican Donald Trump only to see their vote switched before their eyes to Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
“I went back, pressed Trump again. Three times I did this, so then I called one of the women that were working the polls over. And she said you must be doing it wrong. She did it three times and it defaulted to Hillary every time,” Bobbie Lee Hawranko said. 
And USA Today is reporting that vote switching is also being reported in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania… 
And in one of the few glitches with political overtones, a problem with the calibration of electronic voting machines in Lebanon County, Pa., caused about a half dozen machines to display what voters thought were straight Republican tickets as straight Democratic tickets. Poll workers alerted the county elections bureau, and voters were able to change their ballots, said Michael Anderson, director of the Lebanon County Bureau of Elections. 
If you recall, this exact same kind of thing happened in the all-important swing state of Ohio in 2012 . 
So if Pennsylvania ends up being the difference in a Hillary Clinton victory, this will need to be looked at very, very closely. 
Reports of vote switching in Pennsylvania are already getting so much attention that they are even making television news … 
In other parts of the state, a different type of problem has emerged. One African-American voter that tried to vote for Trump was extremely frustrated when the voting machine that he was using remained completely stuck on a selection for Hillary Clinton. This particular voter captured this on video and uploaded the video footage to Twitter … this is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first. pic.twitter.com/GO5Y9FCnYN

Voter turnout is very heavy all over the nation, and it looks like we may shatter voter participation records all over the nation. 
So that is a good thing. 
And we can get an idea of what voters are thinking by what they are searching for on the Internet … 
When looking at searches of “Who is ____ voting for,” these names are the most popular: 
Taylor Swift",1
25356,"Obama in Vietnam Will Focus on Future, Rather Than the Past - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The pictures will be unavoidable, and the flood of painful memories unstoppable. When President Obama lands next Sunday in Hanoi, his visit will be chronicled by photographers, cameramen and journalists who will track every public move of only the third presidential visit to Vietnam since the end of the American war there. Mr. Obama’s former defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, said he is already bracing for the onslaught of recollections those pictures and articles are likely to inspire. “I know those images will hit me,” said Mr. Hagel, whose 12 months as a soldier in Vietnam remain the defining period of his life, despite the subsequent years as both a senator and a cabinet secretary. “They’re going to make it all come back. ” For Mr. Obama, the trip to Vietnam offers an opportunity to help solidify not only his promised pivot of American policy toward Asia, but also to deepen economic and security ties with an increasingly important regional player. But for the United States’ Vietnam War veterans, a presidential trip to the country where many of them lost their youth, innocence and some of their closest friends is weighted with powerful emotions and   debates about that war’s consequences. “There are still a lot of ghosts around,” Mr. Hagel, 69, said in an interview. “There is still a great deal of debate about Vietnam and what it meant for this country. ” “It still haunts us,” he added. “That terrible waste of lives, and the lessons we learned there, the terrible lessons that still hang over us. ” Mr. Hagel said that every decision he made as defense secretary and every piece of advice he gave Mr. Obama was informed by his experience in Vietnam. He now finds himself thinking more and more about the year he spent there in the 1960s. And he said he is certain to closely study the pictures from Mr. Obama’s trip: the lush green background, the people and their iconic conical hats. One of the stumbling blocks between the two nations is the continuing belief by some in the United States that there may still be captive American soldiers held there, the kind of mythology that was fueled by 1980s movies like “Missing in Action” starring Chuck Norris and the “Rambo” series starring Sylvester Stallone. A black P. O. W. . I. A. flag still flies above the Capitol and state capitols around the country, and the military and many lawmakers choose to focus on the retrieval of the remains of dead service members as fulfilling those concerns. But some leaders of veterans organizations insisted in a meeting on Friday at the White House that Mr. Obama ask Vietnamese leaders whether there are living prisoners, according to Frank Francois III, the chief executive of Service Disabled Veteran Enterprises, who attended the meeting. “One of the questions that has to be asked is whether there is anybody in jail or captivity or someone living in the area we need to know about,” Mr. Francois said. For other veterans, Mr. Obama’s trip will serve as a welcome reminder to two generations of Americans who have come of age since the war’s end, illustrating that conflict’s importance to the United States. For these men, the ghosts of the war should not have been so easily laid to rest. “Vietnam is a totally forgotten issue nowadays,” said Bobby Muller, a disabled veteran and antiwar activist whose life helped inspire the 1978 movie “Coming Home,” starring Jane Fonda. “To have gone through those times and have something as huge and powerful and affecting and tragic in our lifetimes wind up nonexistent in the consciousness of the country today is stunning. ” Mr. Muller lives in Washington in an apartment that is filled with books on the war, and his anger at two wartime leaders  —   President Richard M. Nixon and his closest adviser, Henry Kissinger  —   remains undiminished. Mr. Obama is unlikely to focus as much on combat deaths during his trip as President Bill Clinton did when he visited in 2000. Mr. Clinton took the two sons of a missing airman, Lt. Col. Lawrence G. Evert, to a rice paddy in a tiny town 17 miles northeast of Hanoi and searched, along with scores of villagers, for the remnants of an     that had crashed in 1967. Remarkably, they found Colonel Evert’s bones. Mr. Obama is more likely to hail cooperation between the two countries to clean up the remnants of Agent Orange, one of the wartime issues still important to Vietnam. But as a president who came of age after the war ended, he is unlikely to be a symbol of healing of the psychological wounds that some veterans suffered upon returning home, when many of their countrymen disdained them for fighting there. “That lack of a welcome home is still a national shame,” said Senator John McCain, a Vietnam veteran who, because he was a prisoner of war, did receive a hero’s welcome. “You had   or    draftees who did their duties and were literally spat upon by their fellow citizenry when they returned. ” Mr. McCain said the country has learned that lesson, and service members and veterans are routinely celebrated at sporting events and public occasions nowadays. But for some veterans, Mr. Obama’s visit is likely to stir bitter memories of their rejection, he said. Mr. McCain, a Republican of Arizona, said his efforts to help normalize relations between Vietnam and the United States were among the proudest accomplishments of his life, and he said he had been to Vietnam so often since the war’s end that “I’m recognized more in the streets of Hanoi than I am in Phoenix. ” Those efforts long ago helped Mr. McCain put the worst of the war and his captivity behind him, so he is unlikely to be moved by the photos of Mr. Obama’s visits, he said. Mr. McCain said he had other ways of stirring his wartime memories. “To this day, I’ll get up real early sometimes and go down to the Vietnam Memorial just as the sun is coming up,” Mr. McCain said in an interview. “It’s always a great experience for me to think and remember. ”",1
25359,"Wikileaks Releases “DoJ, FBI, Huma Special” Podesta Emails","
Moments ago, after teasing its twitter followers to “stay tuned for our FBI-DoJ #PodestaEmail special circa 4pm EST” Wikileaks released what appears to be part 28 of its Podesta dump, dubbed the “DoJ/FBI/Huma special” and includes some 1,308 emails, bringing the total to 45,526 in total emails released.

On August 27, 2015, an email from Lanny Davis, special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues, appears to suggest that both Fox news and Megyn Kelly were part of the campaign’s pre-coordination with journalists. Davis tells Jen Palmieri the following “personal” thoughts, which suggest getting a guarantee from Megyn Kelly that she won’t be “tough on Hillary ” in a proposed interview – which could be a “ratings and media bonanza” – meant to explain why Hillary “wiped” her server.
Dear Jen,
I know what I’m about to propose is very risky and will be instinctively viewed negatively on the first reaction. But because of the high advantages that I see, perfectly aware of the risks, I think this proposal should be considered.
I propose that the Secretary be on the Megyn Kelly File show for at least 30 minutes. I believe I can reduce the risks, since I know Megyn and Roger Ailes very well, by ensuring that the Secretary will have an opportunity to answer tough questions on emails and other issues without interruption. 
In fact , I believe it is in the interest of Secretary Clinton as well as Fox for the questions to be tough , something we should not fear as long as she has an opportunity to answer. I know she will do well with adequate preparation, and especially after yesterday’s excellent statement taking full responsibility for mixing personal an official business on a single email device.
I still believe the issue of the wiping out of uthe private server still needs to be dealt with – e.g., simply stating that was done primarily to protect personal privacy on personal emails but she made the mistake of mixing personal with official on the server because she was using a single device, and she should have been more transparent shortly after she left office. 
This interview has the potential to be a ratings and media bonanza. I have confidence she would hit a political home run and have a massive audience to deliver her message without a filter. 
Of course there is a risk that Megan will try to show how tough she can be, even tougher than on Trump. I am assuming the worst case on that risk. But if we have a guarantee, which I believe We will get, that she will have an uninterrupted chance to respond to every question, and we have time to prepare, I think this could be a major plus and even a game changer in the various negative narratives about the Secretary being largely inaccessible and sometimes testy with the media. 
It would be so much better to be able to talk to you on the phone about this and discuss the pros and cons. If you are willing and available, what would be the best time in the best telephone number?
With warmest regards, and thanks as always for your consideration of my ideas,
Lanny

He follows up four days later with the following:
Would love a chance to talk on phone – a few additional background points re conversation I had with Roger Ailes and Megyn some time ago on the subject of HRC pre – announcement.

25362,"Tied to Europe, Britain’s Car Industry Is Vulnerable After ‘Brexit’ - The New York Times","BURNASTON, England  —   On Toyota’s brightly lit assembly line here, workers guide wheel and engine assemblies into unfinished sedans. Driverless carts carry parts through narrow aisles to work stations. The assembly line moves with clockwork precision, able to pop out a vehicle every 72 seconds. Britain’s automotive industry, once ailing and plagued by strikes, now hums with the vibrancy of a global manufacturing hub. Most of the cars made in Burnaston, models like Auris and Avensis, will make their way beyond the British borders. Toyota buys parts and hires workers from across the European Union. But the level of integration, previously lauded, has made the carmakers especially vulnerable after Britain’s vote to leave the bloc. If a messy divorce follows, Toyota and others face the prospect of higher tariffs, a smaller labor pool and less access to the 500 million potential customers in Europe  —   all of which will be negotiated in the coming months and years. The drop in the British pound since the vote has not been much help, either. Many of the carmakers’ contracts here are priced in euros, even with suppliers in the same country like Johnson Controls, which makes seats for Toyota. “We have made clear that if we lose some of these elements, it will make making cars in the U. K. less competitive,” said Anthony J. Walker, deputy managing director of Toyota Manufacturing in Britain. “We would have to reduce costs, which would be very hard. ” Carmakers like Toyota are now in   defense mode. Toyota and others are telling the government that they need continued, unfettered access to the European Union, for exports, imports and engineering talents, which they say is in short supply in Britain. Toyota is particularly concerned that its    manufacturing system  —   which requires that parts arrive at the plant in a certain order just a few hours before assembly  —   should not be disrupted. “It is absolutely suicidal,” said Peter Tsouvallaris, the plant’s senior representative for the union, Unite, which also represents workers at other carmakers. “I am concerned about the   future of the plant because we don’t know what Brexit means. ” The British government understands the stakes for the country, which is home to a cluster of   plants for overseas automakers like Nissan, General Motors, BMW and Honda. The sector employs about 169, 000 and accounts for about 12 percent of the value of British exports, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers  Traders, an industry group. Already, the British prime minister, Theresa May, has shown a protective streak. The government has promised to invest 390 million pounds, or $485 million, to encourage advanced,   vehicles, including driverless and electric cars. It has said it will continue to fund training for Toyota and other auto companies, as well as encourage development in component makers based in Britain. Britain also offered assurances to Nissan, whose plant in Sunderland became a flash point in the time before the vote over the   Brexit. Although specifics have not been made public, Nissan said in October that it would build a new version of its popular Qashqai and another model at the plant. “The support and assurances of the U. K. government enabled us” to make the investment decision,” Nissan’s chairman and chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, who had recently met Mrs. May, said at the time. That clout has been hard won for an industry that was struggling not so long ago. Britain always had a flair for car design, producing such classics as the Jaguar XKE and   Sprite. But the industry in the 1960s and 1970s suffered from underinvestment, dated models, poor quality and frequent strikes. The outlook began to change in the 1980s, as Japanese automakers began to look for a foothold in Europe to gain access to the single market. Britain beckoned. Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it was increasingly welcoming to foreign investment, unions were in retreat, and Britain’s own auto industry was not much of a competitive threat. Toyota came in the early 1990s, finding a large site in central England that could be cleared and built to the company’s specifications. The Japanese companies brought efficient production methods. The nearby industrial center of Derby welcomed the new manufacturing jobs at a time when jobs at other companies were being lost. “The Japanese completely reversed what was going on,” said Garel Rhys, a professor emeritus of motor industry economics at Cardiff University. “They showed that Britain was not a place that was out of control. ” The Japanese carmakers brought a more   approach to   British manufacturing. Workers at the Toyota plant, who make more than 30, 000 pounds on average a year ($37, 360) are called “members. ” To avoid delays when snags arise on the line, they pull a cord summoning help from a team leader, denoted by two yellow stripes on the navy blue baseball caps all workers wear. Toyota’s collegial approach has helped with labor relations at the plant, which is unionized. Toyota says it has lost no time to strikes in about a   of manufacturing in Britain. “The main reason is their philosophy,” said Mr. Tsouvallaris, the union representative. “There is always a channel open for communication. ” Other automakers soon followed their Japanese rivals. In the early 2000s, BMW of Germany began building a new line of Mini cars in Oxford. Later that decade, Tata of India took over the old British brands Jaguar and Land Rover. It has helped grease Britain’s economy. Over all, the country made about 1. 6 million cars last year. The figure, though much smaller than in powerhouses like the United States and Japan, leaves it roughly level with France as Europe’s   automaker, after Germany and Spain. Toyota has invested £2. 2 billion in the Burnaston operation and an engine plant in Wales. Together, they employ around 3, 200 people. Britain remains a heavyweight for Toyota, producing about 30 percent of the company’s cars in the region. The industry is now plagued with uncertainty. The British prime minister wants to start negotiations in early 2017 on the terms of the country’s exit from the European Union, talks that could last two years or more. The spectrum of possibilities is broad, from Britain remaining part of the single market to the country facing high barriers to trade with the Continent. Both sides have their own competing interests with carmakers, putting the industry in the middle of a potential fraught negotiation. “The car industry really did take the prospectus of the E. U. at face value,” said Stephen Adams, a partner at Global Counsel, a political risk firm in London. “It relies on the free circulation of goods in the E. U. not just to sell products but to make products. ” Toyota has options if the Burnaston plant ultimately proves unprofitable. The carmaker has more than 30 vehicle manufacturing plants around the world and, like many of its rivals, pits them against each other to bid for the right to make various models. Toyota also has a string of plants across the region, including large   hubs in France and Turkey. The company has had to trim operations at Burnaston before, closing an assembly line in 2010. Annual production is down to 180, 000 from a peak of 282, 000 in 2006. Mr. Walker, the Toyota executive, says a new model for Burnaston is under consideration, although no decision has been made. The plant has already handled several changes to models in its history. On display in the reception area is the Avensis, versions of which are exported to Japan. “This is the only plant in the world that sends cars back to Japan,” Mr. Walker said. “We are very proud of that. ”",1
25364,"Among Deaths in 2016, a Heavy Toll in Pop Music - The New York Times","Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn’t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  —   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  —   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona  —   androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  —   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  —   I hesitate to say merry  —   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song. ” It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can’t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind  Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man’s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis’s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf’s first media star. The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  —   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor’s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  —   his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  —   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women’s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer’s disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball’s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan’s death evoked the 1980s White House, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn’s had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War’s roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly’s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing’s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elián González, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro’s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and,   Edward Albee  —   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  —   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the “Star Wars” tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief. Devotees of the “Harry Potter” movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape’s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor’s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics’ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (“Adventures of Superman”) Alan Young (“Mister Ed”) Robert Vaughn (“The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ”) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on “The Patty Duke Show”) Dan Haggerty (“The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams”) Florence Henderson (“The Brady Bunch”) and Alan Thicke (“Growing Pains”). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork  Mindy,” “Laverne  Shirley” and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  —   what a picture!  —   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music’s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ’80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.",1
25365,You’d Be Surprised at How Many Foods Contain Added Sugar - The New York Times,"You may know there’s added sugar in your Coke or cookies. But did you know that it’s in your salad dressing, pasta sauce and bread? The Food and Drug Administration came out Friday with its new template for nutrition labels. One big change was the addition of a line for “added sugar,” to be placed below a line for total sugar. The change is designed to distinguish between sugars that are naturally occurring in a food  —   like the milk sugar in a plain yogurt  —   and the sugars that food manufacturers include later to boost flavors  —   like the “evaporated cane juice” in a Chobani Kids strawberry yogurt. A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina conducted a detailed survey of the packaged foods and drinks that are purchased in American grocery stores and found that 60 percent of them include some form of added sugar. When they looked at every individual processed food in the store, 68 percent had added sugar. Some of those products are more obvious sugary foods, but not all. The list includes many sauces, soups, fruit juices and even meat products. You might think it’s easy to figure out whether the food manufacturer added sugar to your food, but it isn’t always so. While some foods include “sugar” in their ingredients, many use different words for products that are nutritionally similar. Most of us have heard of   corn syrup, a sugar made from processing corn. But there are also things like the “evaporated cane juice” in the yogurt, and “rice syrup” and “” which are less obvious and amount to the same thing. Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, and one of the paper’s authors, said that the wide variety of sugars is not always meant to confound consumers. Instead, he said, the many sugar types are chosen by food scientists to give their products the best flavor and texture. Some sugars are better for baked goods, while others are better in soft drinks. Some are also cheaper than others. Sugar tariffs and import laws make it expensive to bring in too much foreign sugar. But not all of the sugar formulations count toward the laws’ quotas. There’s also the matter of fruit juice concentrates, which are juices that have been stripped of nearly everything but sugar and evaporated. A lot of seemingly natural foods include ingredients like “apple juice concentrate. ” That’s sugar. That will be a lot clearer when the labels are updated. “It’s going to really surprise people who go to organic and whole foods stores, when they find that all this natural food they’ve been buying is full of added sugar,” Mr. Popkin said. “It’s full of fruit juice concentrates, and they thought it was all good stuff. ” The emphasis on added sugar comes from new nutrition guidelines that urge Americans to consume a “healthy dietary pattern” containing certain types of foods. According to the regulation, hidden added sugars make it difficult to understand whether the food you are eating is part of that healthy pattern. Medical evidence shows that high sugar consumption is linked to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay  —   though not all of that work distinguishes between added sugar and total sugar. Many of the big food industry trade groups and lobbyists were satisfied with the new label rules, as my colleague Sabrina Tavernise recently wrote. But the sugar industry and the corn refiners are upset. Critics of the policy argue that the difference between natural and added sugars is not nutritionally meaningful, and that the science establishing health harms from added sugar is weak. The new label will kick in for large food companies in 2018, and for smaller companies a year later. The U. N. C. research used its master list of sugar code words to measure how many grocery store foods include sugar. But measuring the precise amount of sugars that are added with the current label is quite difficult. Mr. Popkin said consumers would be surprised by recent research from his team revealing the large amounts of added sugars in products that are generally thought of as healthy  —   foods like infant formula, protein bars and yogurt.",1
25368,Republicans Stonewalled Obama. Now the Ball Is in Their Court. - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   It’s   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party, Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House, Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation’s health care delivery system, restructure the tax code, drive job creation, muscle up American foreign policy, rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way, constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. “When you have both houses and the presidency, there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation,” said Representative Tom Cole, a senior Republican from Oklahoma. “There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. ” That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump, leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, in a climate that is, in many respects, even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama, including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland’s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations, they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  —   at least for now. Perhaps most important, Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result, Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now, if they can assemble the votes, their ideas will become law  —   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit, approve annual budgets, endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans, the Republicans who belonged to the “vote no, hope yes” caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isn’t the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections, and in the Senate in 2014, this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled, not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades, newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate, only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time, Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now, with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office, it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges, Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. “A Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress,” Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, said in the party’s weekly radio address on Saturday. “We assume that responsibility with the promise that we’ll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. ” “I am pretty giddy,” said Mr. Cole as he looked ahead. Republicans have won their chance. Now it is time to see what they can do with it.",1
25375,BIGGEST MUSLIM LIE OF THE DAY: “White supremacists are openly threatening Election Day violence…so the FBI is hassling Muslims”,"BNI Store Nov 7 2016 BIGGEST MUSLIM LIE OF THE DAY: “White supremacists are openly threatening Election Day violence…so the FBI is hassling Muslims” Is it the inbreeding? Or just that they think they can promote any fantastical lie or obfuscation and the Kardashian-worshipping American public won’t notice. It’s been reported for days that The Islamic State/al-Qaeda is calling for the “slaughter of U.S. voters” on Election Day. But that didn’t stop officials from designated terrorist group CAIR from inventing a fake potential threat against Muslims…to deflect the fact that the FBI is questioning potential terror-linked suspects in the Muslim community. USA Today Ritz Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group, said Saturday on Twitter that the threats appear in an essay carried by the Islamic State’s Al Hayat media center that declares militants “have come to slaughter you and smash your ballot boxes.” 3) #ISIS urges Muslims to refuse participate in #Elections2016 & to announce that they “have come to slaughter you & smash your ballot boxes” 
— Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) November 5, 2016 “May Allah make this year’s U.S. presidential election a dreadful calamity like no other to have struck America throughout its pathetic history,” the seven-page manifesto, entitled “The Murtadd Vote ,” read. Murtadd is an apostate who turns his back on Islam. The essay, which uses lengthy religious arguments in an effort to justify such attacks, also declares there is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties in their “policies against Islam and Muslims” In an article from the perpetually Muslim-sympathizing Fusion website: As if Muslim Americans haven’t had it hard enough during this presidential campaign—what with Donald Trump’s steady drumbeat of Islamophobic racism–now comes reports that federal agents are paying surprise visits to Muslims across the United States ahead of the November 8 election. According to officials from the Council on American Islamic Relations, representatives from the FBI have questioned Muslims living in at least eight states leading up to November 8, reportedly searching for information pertaining to a possible Election Day al Qaeda threat . Over the weekend, the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) received reports from Muslim-Americans in eight states, who said they were approached by FBI agents who wanted to speak to them about the alleged threat. Those states included California, Washington State, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas Oklahoma, Florida and Texas. Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR’s Florida offices, called the reported questioning “completely outrageous,” and “borderline unconstitutional,” telling the Washington Post : “That’s the equivalent of the FBI visiting churchgoing Christians because someone overseas was threatening to blow up an abortion clinic. It’s that preposterous and outrageous.” The people who were interviewed this weekend were asked if they knew anyone who might want to harm Americans at home or abroad. Shibly said all of those interviewed appeared to be of Afghani or Pakistani descent. Shibly says such sweeps are dangerous to Muslim-American relations.’Unfortunately we’re dealing with an environment that’s not very friendly to American Muslims,’ he said. ‘The environment is very hostile to the American Muslim community.’ On Twitter, CAIR’s Dallas-Fort Worth director Alia Salem posted a short video updating her followers about the FBI visits, and offering a series of resources for anyone approached by law enforcement. “It was made apparent to us that the FBI has a list of a couple hundred people they are wanting to visit,” Salem told the Dallas Morning News . “And ask a series of eight generic questions intended to drum up information about the attacks.” The FBI’s sudden scrutiny of Muslim Americans comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in white nationalism and militia groups , fueled in no small part by Donald Trump’s KKK-backed candidacy . Militant Trump supporters have, in fact, explicitly stoked fears of violence come Election Day. (But it’s Muslims who actually carry out terrorist attacks on Americans) “Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,” Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the anti-American, Muslim-funded Southern Poverty Law Center told Reuters . “Now these ideas are legitimized.” Perhaps while the FBI is questioning Muslim Americans over vague international threats, they should check in with some of the no-longer-fringe radicals on America’s far right wing, too.",1
25376,What Pneumonia Experts Say About Clinton’s Case - The New York Times,"If Hillary Clinton brushed aside medical advice to rest after getting a diagnosis of mild pneumonia, she was risking developing a more serious case, medical experts said Monday. Pneumonia  —   which leads to infiltration of fluid into the lungs, leaving a patient short of breath and often feverish but still able to function  —   can become serious or even fatal if it is not properly treated, doctors said. The illness can be caused by viruses, bacteria or, less often, fungi or damage from toxic fumes. Without extensive testing, which is not normally needed, it is impossible to know what caused Mrs. Clinton’s case. Mrs. Clinton’s doctor released a statement saying that the illness was diagnosed on Friday morning and that she was advised to “rest and modify her schedule. ” Her team has released very little information about her condition: exactly how it was diagnosed what antibiotics she is taking the results of any blood work, chest   or other diagnostic tests that may have been performed or whether she has any underlying condition that made her vulnerable to the illness. On Monday, a campaign spokesman said that more medical information would be released this week and that those records would show she had “no other undisclosed condition. ” As a result, doctors asked about her case said they could only speculate. “Hillary is sick, but she had two days of activities after she was diagnosed, so she’s not that sick,” said Dr. Paul A. Offit, the chief of infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He said he doubted she was infected with “the really serious bacteria that put you in a hospital. ” It is not uncommon for a doctor to diagnose pneumonia merely after listening to a patient’s chest through a stethoscope and hearing “rales,” which sound like tissue paper being crinkled, said Dr. William Schaffner, the chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical School. A doctor can also order a chest   a sputum sample and blood tests, “but she could be getting perfectly good medical care even if these things were not done,” Dr. Schaffner said. Normally, patients are started on antibiotics immediately, and the test of whether the diagnosis and treatment were right is whether they quickly improve. Elevated white blood cell counts could indicate a bacterial infection, and a sputum sample and nasal swab can be taken to see what bacteria are present. But growing bacteria in culture can take days, “and in half of all pneumonia cases, even with tests, we aren’t able to identify the cause,” said Dr. Charles S. Dela Cruz, a lung specialist at Yale medical school. If a patient does not get better after taking antibiotics, more testing should begin, Dr. Schaffner said. Only then do doctors begin to worry about a more serious underlying cause, such as leukemia. Several doctors said they did not think Mrs. Clinton posed any infection risk to others. Adults “are very, very rarely carriers of bacterial pneumonia,” Dr. Schaffner said.   outbreaks in rare cases occur in close quarters like submarines and prisons, but adults do not normally carry pneumonia bacteria in their noses and throats as children do. “That’s why patients admitted to hospitals with   pneumonia aren’t put in isolation,” he said. “There’s no need. ” Dr. James M. Musser, the head of pathology at the Houston Methodist Medical System, said, “Most people are not infectious if they have pneumonia, and being on antibiotics makes them even less infectious. ” Dr. Dela Cruz differed, saying he felt patients should limit contact with others the first few days of treatment when the source of a pneumonia is unknown. Dehydration, which Mrs. Clinton’s team blamed for her apparent collapse at Sunday’s memorial service, could be caused by a combination of standing outdoors on a hot, humid day and any fever she might have had, Dr. Schaffner said. Like sweating during exercise, fever causes the body to lose moisture, which can lower blood pressure and cause fainting. Mrs. Clinton’s normal blood pressure is   according to a description of her  health released July 28, 2015, by Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, her internist. That is on the low side of a normal range, and could contribute to a tendency to faint, Dr. Schaffner noted. Allergies, which typically cause sneezing, not coughing, rarely trigger pneumonia, experts said. “In retrospect, that coughing episode looks more like a possible viral infection,” Dr. Schaffner said, noting that on the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has come close to many people and has shaken many hands. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just warned doctors that flu season appeared to be starting unusually early this year, he added. Since both are over age 65, Mrs. Clinton and Donald J.

Although “pneumo shots” protect against several bacterial strains that are the most common causes of pneumonia, they do not protect against all of them.",1
25377,Must Read of the Day – The Clinton Presidency Is Going to Be a Miserable Slog,"at 2:52 pm 2 Comments 
For a long time now, I’ve felt that no matter who wins this election, the U.S. is in for extremely difficult times over at least the next 4 years. The reason is twofold. First, when you combine Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders supporters (the latter didn’t just disappear), a majority of the population is in full on revolt against the status quo. This mood isn’t going anywhere. Combine this backdrop with the very high likelihood of an economic downturn, and you have a recipe for mayhem. This isn’t even taking into account the possible end to a multi-decade secular bull market in sovereign bonds, the ramifications of which represent a financial extinction-level event for much of the Western world. 
When I look at the financial markets and note that they appear totally unwilling to even flirt with the very real possibility of a Trump victory, I conclude that the current status quo assumption is not only that Hillary will win, but that after she wins, the social mood will get better. I, on the other hand, think it will get far, far worse, as disgusted Trump and Sanders supporters push back relentlessly from day one. As I noted earlier today on Twitter: Sorry but if Clinton wins country becomes completely ungovernable. I don’t mean gridlock. I mean total madness.

Of course, I’m not the only one. Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote an excellent piece earlier today published at The Week titled, The Clinton Presidency is Going to be a Miserable Slog , which is my must read of the day. 
Here it is: Being on the cusp of electing the first woman president, and defeating a snarling, newly crass, and nationalist Republican Party should feel energizing for the American left. But it’s been tiring. The Democrats aren’t just electing a woman. They’re stuck electing this woman, Hillary Clinton. It’s been a slog . Clinton could not easily put away her socialist challenger Bernie Sanders. She would not release the transcripts of the paid speeches she gave to Wall Street banks. She could not name her accomplishments as secretary of state. She could not quite escape her own role in managing the political fallout from her husband’s affairs, or the appearance of corruption in the Clinton Foundation’s pioneering work in the field of do-gooder graft. When FBI Director James Comey gave us a healthy reminder of Clinton’s email scandal last week, liberals must have realized: It’s not just the campaign. The Clinton presidency is going to be a slog , too. The Clinton standard of political behavior has always had a lawyerly slipperiness to it. When the scandals come, it depends on your definition of “is.” When the headlines erupt, suddenly we discover that all of Clinton’s friends signed an affidavit contradicting the latest accuser or whistleblower. And, really, what difference, at this point, does it make? Partisans will note that Clinton’s ethical lapses and faults are minor compared to Donald Trump’s. Those comparisons are not going to matter in a few days. Some may object. They’ll reply that the only problem is the aggressive prosecutorial zeal of the Republicans. And it is true that Republicans have an ongoing grudge against Clinton. But let’s posit the existence of a vast right wing conspiracy that hates President Obama just as much as it hates the Clintons. Why is it only able to turn up news-driving scandals on the latter? Could it be that Obama, however detested by conservatives, conducts himself with higher ethical standards than Bill and Hillary? Clinton’s scandals and misdeeds often have little to do with the Democrats’ battle with Republicans. Clinton played fast and loose even with the Obama administration’s own rules. Obama had forbidden Clinton from giving a government job to the Clinton’s on-demand schemer Sidney Blumenthal — yet Clinton kept him on the payroll of her “charity” and kept up correspondence with him about Libya, even as he had business interests in a post-Gadhafi state. Despite explicit rules set by the Obama administration, the Clinton Foundation continued to operate as a bank in which foreign leaders and governments could deposit their quids, while Clinton was at the head of the State Department, able to distribute pro quos in return. Beyond the propensity to generate scandal, there is a larger reason that Clinton’s administration will be a slog. The 2016 election has been characterized by a demand for great change. And Hillary Clinton has run as the defender of the way things are, the way they’re going, and who they’re going for. Hillary Clinton received a vigorous challenge from a left wing that isn’t afraid to label themselves socialists. America’s center-right party ditched its commitments to establishment doctrine on free trade and liberalized immigration, and challenged the wisdom and justice of America’s post-Cold War political order. But Hillary Clinton will enter the White House as the caretaker for the status quo in American political life. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders were not the men to carry forward this message of discontent to real political triumph. Both candidates represented their cause poorly. Trump was at once too crude and unethical himself. And Sanders had none of the political instincts and savvy to really go after Clinton in the primaries. Clinton is the face of a prosperous, grasping establishment that won’t bear challenge from the left or right. Her ability to survive scandal after scandal will not be received as some testament to her political canniness or some deep integrity. It will be received as just the system defending its own from attack. Her survival and her ability to win is a a tribute to the power and self-regard of our political class. And this class has no plausible solution for the nation’s foreign policy, for its immigration system, or for an economic system that abets the elite’s secession from their own nation. Clinton’s presidency will be a slog because she is exactly like the system she defends. She can point to the great wealth this system produces for its top clients. But neither she nor her cheerleaders can really claim that it looks like wisdom or justice to anyone else. Well done, Mr. Dougherty.",1
25381,What Should We Expect From the Supreme Court’s Showdown Over Immigration? - The New York Times,"This morning, the United States Supreme Court will hear arguments in United States v. Texas, a challenge to President Obama’s attempts to grand relief from mass deportation to undocumented immigrants. Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for the magazine, and Eric Posner, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, have been exchanging emails about what’s at stake in the case and how the court might approach its decision. Hi, Eric, As its name suggests, United States v. Texas, the blockbuster immigration case that the Supreme Court will hear this morning, pits federal executive power against state authority. The case also pits the Obama administration’s view  —   that it’s time to grant relief from deportation to a substantial fraction of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants  —   against conservative opposition to any reform that smacks of amnesty. If you like Donald Trump’s wall, you probably won’t like Obama’s program. The doubts about it aren’t confined to the border: Joining Texas in challenging the president are 25 other   states. The case is obviously drenched in politics. Back in his first term, when immigration reform appeared to have a shot in Congress, President Obama said, “With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that’s just not the case. ” But after Congress failed to pass the Dream Act, which would have provided a path to permanent residency for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, in the summer of 2012 Obama found the executive power he previously denied having and signed an order called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, modeled on the Dream Act. More than a million people qualified. In 2014, the Department of Homeland Security expanded DACA and added DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) making as many as four million more people eligible to stay here and work if they met certain requirements, including having no criminal record. There’s a    view of these orders, which you’ve expressed in the past: The government chooses how to enforce laws, and whom to deport, all the time. It’s called prosecutorial discretion. Obama’s orders merely formalized one form of that, allowing millions of people to breathe easier and to plan, while allowing the government to retain the power to make    determinations and exceptions. By announcing a new route to permanent residency, the Obama administration didn’t write a new law or even substantially change an old one. The president’s order merely led to a kind of news bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security (or a “general statement of policy,” in the language of administrative law) to let the public know that its enforcement priorities had changed. There’s also a less sanguine view of DACA and DAPA: When Obama signed these orders after failing to get his plan through Congress, he acted dictatorially  —   or at the very least, expanded his executive authority at the expense of Congress, a bad habit in a democracy that depends on the separation of powers. Obama’s critics also accuse him of wielding his magic pen for partisan gain. In 2008 and 2012, Latinos voted for him in high numbers, with high hopes, only to watch him preside over a record number of deportations.   relief is Obama’s bid to spruce up his legacy with a key voting bloc, one that Democrats need to win in November. This political debate intersects with some of the legal arguments before the Supreme Court. Texas says the president has failed to fulfill his constitutional obligation to “faithfully execute” federal immigration law. (This obligation comes from the charmingly named Take Care Clause in Article II.) Am I right that the Supreme Court hasn’t often laid out what it means for the president to “faithfully execute” a dense body of law, like the statutes that set immigration policy? It’s the kind of   concept that could become a bottomless pit, if the court jumps in. Where does prosecutorial discretion end and unfaithful execution begin? I wonder if the court included this question for review in part, at least, at the urging of Justice Antonin Scalia, and whether his death leaves his colleagues with a diminished appetite for answering it. What do you think? Emily Hi, Emily, It’s hard to make sense of this case. The idea that the president can refrain from enforcing the law is baked into the Constitution that is what the separation of powers means. To protect us from the might of the federal government, the founders agreed that any coercive action must be authorized both by Congress (which passes a law) and the executive (which enforces it). Anything else is “tyranny. ” Thomas Jefferson himself called off prosecutors who were enforcing the Sedition Act, a law that prohibited criticism of the federal government. Moreover, both DAPA and DACA largely codified the longstanding practice of Democratic and Republican presidents. Because Congress has never given immigration authorities enough money to catch and deport all undocumented immigrants, presidents have sensibly chosen to direct or allow agencies to focus resources on criminals and other dangerous people  —   not on children, the elderly and others who stay out of trouble. It is true that DAPA and DACA also entitle beneficiaries to work permits, welfare benefits and the like, but the immigration law itself authorizes the executive branch to confer those benefits on anyone whom it decides not to deport, for whatever reason. Many critics have cited the “Take Care” clause of the Constitution, which, as you say, directs the president to “faithfully execute” the laws. But if Congress deprives the president of the resources necessary to deport everyone, then the president faithfully executes the laws by executing the ones he can afford to execute. In law as in ethics, “ought” implies “can. ” But this case does reflect deep and understandable anxieties about our constitutional system in an age of political polarization. Republicans have woken up to the alarming powers of the president to make policy by choosing which laws to enforce, and how much. The founders did not anticipate the growth of the federal bureaucracy, which enables the president to make policy by emphasizing some programs and neglecting others. Republicans are right that the question of who gets to stay in the country is traditionally a policy matter for Congress  —   and when millions of people are affected by a unilateral decision by the president, we might be troubled about the magnitude of the president’s power. The administration’s response  —   that Congress has authorized DAPA and DACA by giving the president so much discretion in the first place  —   is a legalistic argument that avoids rather than addresses the problem. The Democrats, by contrast, have woken up to the weakness of Congress. The rules and traditions of that august body give small groups of representatives, acting on behalf of a tiny segment of the population, the power to block reform that nearly everyone agrees is needed. Here, too, we detect the fingerprints of the founders, who feared tyranny by legislative majorities. But the founders expected state governments to do most of the governing in the modern era, vast swaths of policy have been given over to the feds. For most of our history, majorities in Congress bought off the minority with logrolling, pork and the like. But in recent decades, complex demographic and institutional changes have yielded a polarized Congress in which payoffs are hard to arrange. In the face of congressional paralysis, the public  —   most of it  —   looks to the president to solve its problems, enabling the president to call upon his latent legal powers with full force. This naturally enhances support for the president among his constituency and magnifies the distrust of his opponents, causing further polarization. Can the Supreme Court clean up this mess? Definitely not. The judges on the lower courts  —   a     judge, and two   Circuit Court judges who outvoted a   colleague  —   held that the president should have gone through the administrative procedure called     . If the Supreme Court upholds this ruling, it won’t shift the balance of the power back to Congress it will simply make it somewhat more   for the president to exert his or her will. Only if the Supreme Court announces broad and unprecedented restrictions on the president’s discretion to enforce the law could the ruling impose a meaningful constraint on future presidents  —   and the court won’t do that. The liberal justices can block a ruling with precedential effect by ensuring a   tie that would uphold the lower court’s decision but not create new constitutional restrictions on the president. We could even see a   vote in favor of the president, with Chief Justice Roberts joining the liberals in an opinion that reverses the lower court and leaves our creaky system of governance intact. He may think that a powerful president  —   even a powerful liberal president  —   is not as big of a problem as a government that doesn’t work. Eric Hi, Eric, I suspect the court’s four   (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan) will reject Texas’s challenge, as you predict. They were a remarkably disciplined voting bloc last term, and they must be emboldened by the court’s new composition, which evens the ideological sides. I wouldn’t count Roberts’s vote yet, though. You’re right that he cares about the court’s institutional reputation, and he has become a whipping boy of the right for his two votes to uphold Obamacare. But the idea that Roberts is a traitor to the conservative movement is hugely unfair to him. His votes for Obamacare served the interests of the Republican Party, even if many of its leaders can’t admit it, by preventing another hugely divisive fight over how to replace Obamacare. The G. O. P. is much better at calling for its demise than at explaining what would come next. Roberts has also come through for the right in cases with a clearer payoff for Republicans, like his decision to strike down a crucial element of the Voting Rights Act. If he can deny a prize to Latinos that they fought for, and that President Obama promised them, he could do more than hand the Democrats a   defeat. He could disillusion a crucial voting group that historically has low rates of voter registration and turnout. Roberts could do this with a   decision that affirms the Fifth Circuit’s decision, 4 to 4. A tie would set no national precedent, but it would avoid handing the Democrats a victory. I suppose it’s possible that a split along party lines at the court, with the effect of killing DACA and DAPA, could fuel the naturalization and   drives among Latinos that have already begun. Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders could use it as one more argument against electing Donald Trump or Ted Cruz: Don’t put filling the next Supreme Court vacancy (or the current one?) in their hands. But I’m skeptical. Fairly or unfairly, I think this will resonate more deeply as Obama’s unfulfilled promise. If the Supreme Court says Obama blew it, the majority will write an opinion that makes it look as if he’s to blame. It’s also possible that the justices could decide this case in Obama’s favor by deciding that Texas and the other states lack standing to sue, because the president’s immigration policy doesn’t cause them harm. That argument has a certain appeal. The real power struggle, as we’ve discussed, is between the president and Congress. So why give the states center stage in the fight? Texas argues that it has standing because it will suffer the harm of paying for driver’s licenses for the people entitled to them because of the president’s order. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed. But immigration is an arena in which courts generally give the feds far more latitude than the states, for the sake of national sovereignty and coherent, unified policy making. What do you think? Emily Hi, Emily, Standing doctrine is a famously incoherent area of the law. The doctrine started off innocently enough, as a means of making sure that the right people brought disputes to a court. If I run over your dog, then you can bring a suit against me. Your neighbor can’t, even if he loves your dog or belongs to the A. S. P. C. A. In the law’s view, I haven’t injured him you have standing to sue me, but if you don’t bother, he doesn’t have standing to sue in your place. (Nor does your dog, for what it’s worth.) When the government acts, however, things become more complicated. If a police officer runs over your dog, you have standing to sue (and your neighbor still doesn’t). But what if the government refuses to deport undocumented immigrants who loiter in your neighborhood, and you think the president has violated the Take Care clause or some other law? Can you sue now? No, says the courts: you haven’t suffered an injury. Maybe you feel injured, but the injury isn’t “individualized” because it’s shared by others, it doesn’t count for standing. With a bunch of exceptions not relevant here, citizens can’t sue the government for doing things they don’t like, or not doing the things they want to see done  —   and this is true even if it turns out that the government’s actions or inactions violate the law. The “injury” analysis becomes more complicated for governments. Is Texas “injured” if the federal government refuses to deport undocumented immigrants on Texas soil even though no specific Texan is? Is an injury that is general to all Texans “individualized” to Texas? Maybe or maybe not. In the 2007 case Massachusetts v. E. P. A. the Supreme Court tried to clear this up. The court held that Massachusetts had standing to sue the Environmental Protection Agency in order to compel it to issue   regulations (but not, unlike in our case, to actually enforce the law against violators). What was the injury that gave Massachusetts standing? Rising sea levels, which will erode Massachusetts’ territory, said the Court. Citing this case, the Fifth Circuit majority in our current case argued that the cost of supplying driver’s licenses would erode Texas’s budget. The dissenting judge argued that in the Massachusetts case, the Supreme Court relied on a special provision of the Clean Air Act that authorizes lawsuits there is nothing similar in immigration law. Nor did she think that shuffling around items in the state budget is the sort of injury that the Supreme Court had in mind for standing. Whomever the Supreme Court sides with, the interesting thing here is the way in which the usual ideological lines have been scrambled by this case. Conservatives normally want to limit standing, to keep busybody liberal   groups from using lawsuits to compel agencies to regulate. Liberals usually go in the other direction. The Texas case is a rare one in which an effort is made to stop the government from conferring a benefit. Now it’s the conservatives who want to bring suit. Not surprisingly, in the Fifth Circuit, it was the liberal dissenter who argued that Texas lacked standing and the conservative majority that argued that Texas possessed standing. Did I mention that commentators are skeptical about how courts use standing doctrine? Justice Roberts, who dissented in Massachusetts v. E. P. A. argued in his opinion that Massachusetts lacked standing because it couldn’t really connect the dots from E. P. A. ’s failure to regulate and the disappearance of another chunk of Cape Cod into the Atlantic Ocean. He complained bitterly about the majority’s statement that Massachusetts’ “ ” interests entitled it to “special solicitude” in standing analysis. “The constitutional role of the courts,” he thundered, “is to decide concrete cases  —   not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates. ” The Texas case, which puts the court in a difficult position if it wants to avoid being embroiled in a serious political fight, gives him an opportunity to tell his colleagues, “I told you so!” Some people think Justice Roberts plays the long game, accepting   losses for Republicans in order to establish principles that will advance conservative goals in the long term. If so, he could offer the liberals a fifth vote for the president in return for an opinion that shrinks standing doctrine back to its  ’’Massachusetts’’ size. This tempting bit of legal jujitsu might just do the trick. Eric",1
25384,Comment on Elijah Wood Just Exposed Hollywood’s Organized Pedophilia Ring by Rebecca Healy,"Home / Be The Change / Elijah Wood Just Exposed Hollywood’s Organized Pedophilia Ring Elijah Wood Just Exposed Hollywood’s Organized Pedophilia Ring “The Number one problem in Hollywood was and always will be pedophilia.” -Corey Feldman, During interview with ABC News 
Up until now, Corey Feldman’s attempt to blow the whistle on pedophilia and child abuse in Hollywood, have fallen on deaf ears. The actor’s troubled past made him easily dismissable in the mainstream, and his bombshell accusations were simply swept under the rug. 
However, Feldman’s claims have now been backed up by another Hollywood child star. 
Hollywood is in the midst of a massive sexual abuse scandal, which can be compared to that of Jimmy Savile in Britain, childhood star turned adult actor Elijah Wood has claimed. 
Coming onto the silver screen for the first time in Back to the Future Part II in 1989, Wood has been a critically acclaimed actor for decades. 
At age 35, Elijah has now come forward in a recent interview to blow the lid off of the dark underground world of child acting in Hollywood. 
In an interview with the Sunday Times , Wood dropped a bombshell, noting how child actors were regularly “preyed upon” by industry figures. 
“Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood,” said Wood. “It was all organized.” 
What Wood is talking about is the rampant sexual abuse of childhood actors which has been previously exposed by Corey Feldman as well as Corey Haim. 
In an episode of their reality TV show, The Two Coreys, a candid fight broke out during which Haim claimed Feldman stood by and watched as a person Feldman “still hangs out with” and is “best friends with” proceeded to “rape” the 14-year-old Haim. 
“There are a lot of vipers in this industry, people who only have their own interests in mind,” continued Elijah Wood in his interview. “There is a darkness in the underbelly – if you can imagine it, it’s probably happened.” 
When noting how he was able to escape the molestation during his childhood in Hollywood, Elijah noted that he had good parents who protected him and who did not let him attend these parties. 
“She was far more concerned with raising me to be a good human than facilitating my career,” he said. 
Wood says the abuse runs unchecked because the victims “can’t speak as loudly as people in power.” 
“That’s the tragedy of attempting to reveal what is happening to innocent people,” he said. “They can be squashed but their lives have been irreparably damaged.” 
What Wood is referring to is the immense power of Hollywood elites to control the narrative and quash any allegations of abuse before they even happen. 
The same owners of Hollywood also own the majority of other mainstream media. While none of them are specifically implicated, a handful of people, News Corp. President Peter Chernin, Paramount Pictures Chairman Brad Grey, Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger, Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton, Warner Bros. Chairman Kevin Tsujihara, CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves whose great uncle was the first prime minister of Israel, MGM Chairman Terrence Lanni, and former NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker, who is currently the president of CNN Worldwide, all run the movie industry as well as the television and news scenes. 
With the massive resources of the mainstream media, covering up the allegations of rape of dozens of children would be a simple task. 
“If you’re innocent you have very little knowledge of the world and you want to succeed,” explained Elijah of the poor children and their parents who become easy prey as they seek out their dreams of becoming Hollywood stars. 
Another sad facet to this underground world of child predation is the fact that police not only look the other way, but they’ve often been exposed for participating in it. 
Last year, an abuse survivor bravely broke her silence to tell her horrific childhood story. In an interview with Sky News, Esther Baker, 32, explained how she and other children were raped by the elite and politicians as uniformed police officers stood guard. 
Also last year, Jessa Dillow-Crisp testified at the Colorado State Capitol, during Human Trafficking Awareness and Advocacy Day, about the horrible experiences that she had in her past. 
“I was a little girl and was sexually abused by family members. I had to pose for pornographers and was sold to countless men on a daily basis,” she said. 
To make matters even more hopeless for the woman, she was unable to report the abuse or go to the police because there were a number of police officers who were actually involved in the kidnapping and abuse. 
“There was gang raping, the police officer who handcuffed me and raped me, told me I would be put in jail if I opened my voice,” she said. 
Sadly, positions of power, whether state-backed or not often attract society’s worst. Knowing they are above the law, these sickos are allowed to target innocence for their own disgusting desires. 
In his interview, Elijah Wood summed up this notion perfectly when he said, “People with parasitic interests will see you as their prey.” And, unfortunately, they continue to get away with it. Share",1
25385,Start-Ups Once Showered With Cash Now Have to Work for It - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   When Jeremy Hitchcock raised money for his technology   in 2012, he barely had to break a sweat. He was flooded with emails from venture capitalists who wanted in. Two months after meeting an investor over cocktails at a technology conference, he scored $38 million. But last year, as valuations of tech   wobbled and public tech stocks gyrated, Mr. Hitchcock, 34, was faced with a different dynamic. As he tried to garner new capital for his company Dyn, which monitors and reroutes Internet traffic, potential investors peppered him with questions others had once glossed over. How would Dyn produce a return for them? Did Dyn have the size and scale to go public? Dyn announced this month that it had raised $50 million from a private equity firm. But as part of the discussion, Mr. Hitchcock, who has not run a public company, agreed to step down as chief executive so Dyn could find a leader skilled in developing a business. “The talks were much more thorough” with investors this time, Mr. Hitchcock said, adding that he had been thinking about resigning as chief executive before the   round. The balance of power is shifting across tech   land. Not long ago, entrepreneurs had the upper hand. With investors eager to get a piece of the next Uber or Airbnb, entrepreneurs often just lifted their little fingers to get financing. Some investors let the entrepreneurs choose their own terms, while others gave   paydays to   founders long before their companies were a success. Now investors have the advantage. Instead of venture capitalists begging to be allowed to invest, entrepreneurs are coming to them begging for cash. Investors are exerting their newfound power by asking more questions about a  ’s prospects and taking more time to invest. Some are pushing for management changes or for financing terms that would help cushion any losses they might face. “Venture capitalists are putting founders through everything short of a proctology exam before they invest,” said Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm. The changing balance of power is evident in the numbers. Venture capitalists have put less money into   in the United States in the last two quarters, according to the National Venture Capital Association funding dropped 11 percent to $12. 1 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. With a smaller capital pie, entrepreneurs have to work harder for a piece. Investors have also been better able to negotiate financing terms that benefit them. According to a survey from the law firm Fenwick  West, investors of richly valued   have been getting more provisions such as guaranteed payouts and minimum investment gains. Such terms are still relatively rare, but tend to become more common after the number and size of deals decline, said Barry Kramer, a Fenwick  West partner. Above all, investors are no longer paying any price to invest in a  . Since the beginning of this year, about 30 companies have had to settle for lower valuations than they previously received when they raised money, according to the research firm CB Insights. That is nearly as many as in all of 2015. “Investors have materially more time to do diligence than before,” said Ben Ling, a partner at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. “Across our portfolio, even for the best companies,   is a longer process. ” Mr. Ling added that while particularly strong companies were being funded as always, valuations for others were generally flat to about 20 percent lower than this time last year. One   whose valuation was recently reduced was CARD. com, an online banking  . The Los   company closed a $5. 5 million financing round in February that valued it lower than its last funding round in December 2014, something known in industry parlance as a down round. Ben Katz, CARD. com’s chief executive, said it was growing by 3, 000 new accounts a day, had its first month with $1 million in revenue in February and should have $1 billion in new deposits this year. Even so, Mr. Katz, 37, was pragmatic about taking money at a lower valuation. “Entrepreneurs shouldn’t be too stressed by a down round as long as they are getting the capital they need to build their vision,” he said. Venture capital firms that might have invested outside of their comfort zone in boom times have now reverted to form, said Justin Langseth, chief executive of Zoomdata, a data analytics  . When he tried to raise money at the end of last year, many venture capitalists deemed Zoomdata, which is four years old, too big or too small for their liking, he said. “Before, they would have probably tried to stretch to accommodate a company of my size,” said Mr. Langseth, 41, who landed $25 million from a group led by Goldman Sachs in February. As venture capitalists have become pickier, some entrepreneurs are looking for money from nontraditional financiers. Jon Stein, who runs the financial advisory   Betterment, found that many venture capitalists were telegraphing that they wanted a piece of his company for a lower price. So he looked beyond venture capitalists, turning to a Swedish investment firm, Kinnevik, to lead his  ’s latest financing of $100 million. Mr. Stein, 36, said some   were postponing   in the hope that they would have more leverage later. “They’re trying to build more traction,” he said. With the shifting power balance come shifting messages from investors. Whereas investors once worshiped growth at nearly any cost at a   many are now more concerned about profitability, entrepreneurs said. Justin Yoshimura, 25, who invests in young companies and is chairman of the online jewelry business Ice. com, said his   had generally eschewed raising large amounts of money to control spending. Yet some investors in recent years encouraged him and the companies he has invested in to take a lot of money and spend it on marketing and other growth tactics. Now he is bemused to hear that investors are suggesting smaller rounds, less spending and a focus on not losing money. “Everyone told us we were wrong last year, that we needed to spend,” Mr. Yoshimura said. “Now when you say you’re profitable, everyone wants to invest. ”",1
25388,20 States Accuse Generic Drug Companies of Price Fixing - The New York Times,"A   investigation into generic drug prices took its most significant turn yet on Thursday, as state attorneys general accused two industry leaders, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Mylan, and four smaller companies of engaging in brazen   schemes  —   and promised that more charges were coming. A civil complaint filed by 20 states accuses the companies of conspiring to artificially inflate prices on an antibiotic and a diabetes drug, with executives coordinating through informal industry gatherings and personal calls and text messages. Officials said the case was a small example of broader problems in the drug business. “We believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg,” George C. Jepsen, Connecticut’s attorney general, whose office started the inquiry that led to the charges, said in an interview on Thursday. “I stress that our investigation is continuing, and it goes way beyond the two drugs in this lawsuit, and it involves many more companies than are in this lawsuit. ” The accusations, as well as continuing investigations at the state and federal levels, have left a cloud of uncertainty over the industry. While several other big generic drug companies have received subpoenas, it is unclear where the inquiries will eventually lead. The generic drug business is already on the defensive and struggling to recover from a barrage of public criticism in the past year over high prices. The complaint on Thursday describes a cozy industry culture defined by regular dinners and social outings, and argues that those events often cross the line to violate antitrust rules. Generic drug makers hoping to begin selling a new drug first seek out rivals, the suit says, in hopes of reaching an agreement on how to maintain market share and avoid competing on price. “These agreements had the effect of artificially maintaining high prices for a large number of generic drugs and creating an appearance of competition when in fact none existed,” the lawsuit says. Teva, an Israeli drug maker, is the world’s largest manufacturer of generic medicines. Mylan faced intense criticism this year after it sharply raised prices on EpiPen, a severe allergy treatment. The charges filed on Thursday are not related to EpiPen, a branded product that has little competition. Both Teva and Mylan, the suit says, engaged in anticompetitive behavior, but not with each other  —   coordinating instead with smaller companies. A Teva spokeswoman said, “We have not found evidence that would give rise to any civil or criminal liability. ” A spokeswoman for Mylan offered a similar statement, saying the company knew of “no evidence that Mylan participated in  . ” The suit’s focus is two drugs, a   form of the antibiotic treatment doxycycline hyclate, and glyburide, a commonly used diabetes drug. The price of doxycycline has surged in recent years, and it was singled out by members of Congress and others as a prime example of unexplained price increases for generic drugs. One form of doxycycline, for example, went from an average market price of $20 for a bottle of 500 pills in October 2013 to an average market price of $1, 849 in April 2014, according to a congressional report. The suit filed by the attorneys general says the investigation began in Connecticut in July 2014 and “uncovered evidence of a broad,   and   series of schemes to fix the prices and allocate markets for a number of generic pharmaceuticals in the United States. ” On Wednesday, federal prosecutors made similar claims against two former executives at Heritage Pharmaceuticals, a small company, accusing them of engaging in a   scheme for the same two drugs. Heritage was also one of the companies named in the complaint on Thursday. That complaint, in Federal District Court in Connecticut, identifies Heritage as the “principal architect and ringleader” of the activities involving the two drugs, and said that employees of the company, including the two former executives, Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, contacted competing companies and sought to make illegal deals over pricing before entering the market for the two drugs. Heritage fired Mr. Glazer, the former chief executive, and Mr. Malek, a former president, in August and is suing the two men, claiming that they “looted” tens of millions of dollars from the company. Heritage, which has said it is cooperating with the authorities, declined to comment on the lawsuit filed Thursday. Other companies named in the suit, including Aurobindo Pharma, Citron Pharma and Mayne Pharma, did not reply to requests for comment. The court actions this week could have wide implications, particularly if, as officials suggest, they are just the beginning. More than 80 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United States are for generic drugs, which have been credited with saving consumers and taxpayers billions of dollars by introducing competing products to a drug losing patent protection. “It blows that entire assumption out of the water when you hear that generic companies are getting together to increase prices,” Michael A. Carrier, an antitrust professor at Rutgers Law School, said. The lawsuit, filed by Democratic and Republican attorneys general, portrays a   circle of generic drug executives and sales representatives who regularly socialize at conferences and gatherings like golf outings, cocktail parties and “girls’ night out” events in the New Jersey area, where many of the companies are based. But the collegial relationships, while common in many industries, veered into more overt anticompetitive tactics, Mr. Jepsen, Connecticut’s attorney general, said. “It’s very damning,” he said. “It reveals a culture of cronyism where, whether it’s over a game of golf or a dinner or drinks, there’s just systematic cooperation. ” He described the behavior as deliberate. “There’s nothing hidden about it,” he said. In the case of doxycycline, the complaint says that in 2013 Heritage contacted Mylan, the only other maker of a   version of the product at the time, and told executives there that Heritage planned to release its own version. According to the complaint, Mylan agreed to “walk away” from at least one major wholesaler and one large pharmacy chain to allow Heritage to gain a foothold in the market. The complaint quotes from emails that are redacted in the publicly available version and that the suit says show how Mylan and Heritage executives hammered out the details. When a third competitor, Mayne, planned to enter the doxycycline market in 2014, it contacted Heritage and Mylan to negotiate details of how prices would be set and customers would be allocated, the suit says. A spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, the industry’s lobbying group, declined to comment on the investigation. But he said that the group supports laws that promote competition, and “believes competition is the key to providing affordable and accessible medicines to patients, while also constraining costs. ”",1
25390,"Donald Trump Is Sworn In as President, Capping His Swift Ascent - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called “this American carnage. ” In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by “the ravages” of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his   approach to turn around. “I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,” Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of   admirers and onlookers in a forceful   Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol. “America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. ” Mr. Trump’s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system. “We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he said. “The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. ” Mr. Trump’s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address  —   a country where mothers and children are “trapped in poverty in our inner cities,” where “  factories” are “scattered like tombstones across the landscape” and where drugs and crime “have stolen too many lives. ” “This American carnage,” he declared, “stops right here and stops right now. ” He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to “ease the burden” of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law. More orders are planned for next week. Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a   suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the   oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon. Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas. Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history. It was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president. The Senate confirmed two cabinet nominations  —   James N. Mattis as defense secretary and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security  —   but Democrats temporarily held up Mike Pompeo’s confirmation as C. I. A. director. Throughout the day, there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president. Sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine, while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas. More than 200 people were arrested. Liberal groups prepared for a women’s march on Saturday that they said could draw hundreds of thousands. Mr. Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats beyond thanking Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition. “They have been magnificent,” he said in his speech. He later praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, at a    luncheon with congressional leaders, asking her and former President Bill Clinton to stand for applause. “I have a lot of respect for these two people,” he said. Democrats were not impressed. “I was pretty shocked by how dark it was,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said of Mr. Trump’s Inaugural Address. “I love this country, and I don’t understand how a president of the United States that loves his country could paint a picture of its failures. ” He added, “It was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was. ” The National Mall was filled with supporters, many wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!” But the lingering animosity from the presidential campaign was on display, too. When Mrs. Clinton arrived, some in the crowd chanted, “Lock her up,” mimicking Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies. As he took the oath, a cluster of people blew whistles and screamed, “Not my president,” before being escorted out. While large, the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at Mr. Obama’s first inauguration eight years ago, according to aerial photographs. The Washington Metrorail system recorded fewer than half as many rides on Friday morning as in 2009, and knots of bystanders along the inaugural parade route were not as thick. In a city that gave just 4 percent of its vote to Mr. Trump, many residents left town and about 60 House Democrats boycotted the event. Mr. Obama made his exit after the ceremony, flying by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet, no longer designated Air Force One, to fly to Palm Springs, Calif. for vacation. He will return to Washington to a rental house while his daughter Sasha finishes high school, the first president to stay in the capital since Woodrow Wilson. Hours before his departure, Mr. Obama posted on Twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away. “I won’t stop,” he said. “I’ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love. ” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, rode an Amtrak train to Delaware and the home they have there. But they, too, planned to return, at least part time, to Washington, where Mrs. Biden teaches at a community college in the Virginia suburbs. The United States has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids. Never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with   business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country’s begin. He arrived in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf. But Mr. Trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency. An Ivy   mogul who lives in a New York tower named after himself with an    living room, he transformed himself into the unlikely leader of a   movement anchored in rural areas far removed from the coasts. His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing   to many Americans disenchanted with Washington elites. For the nation’s 58th inauguration, though, the untraditional president opted to follow tradition. He and Mrs. Trump, a former model from Slovenia who became the first   first lady since John Quincy Adams’s wife, Louisa, started the day with a service at St. John’s Episcopal Church adjacent to Lafayette Square, then joined the Obamas, Bidens and Pences for coffee at the White House. From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump’s election. Former President George Bush remained hospitalized in Houston, recovering from pneumonia, but a spokesman said he watched the ceremony on television. Mr. Pence, 57, was sworn in at 11:54 a. m. placing his hand on Ronald Reagan’s Bible, which was held by his wife, Karen, as their three adult children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey, watched. For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013. Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr. Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany. Also there was Barron, his    son with the first lady. Joining them was Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser. As Mr. Trump approached the podium, rain began to fall. It was not a conventionally Republican speech, with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government. Instead, he laid out a protectionist agenda, saying his rule will be “buy American and hire American. ” He did pledge to “eradicate from the face of the Earth” Islamic terrorism. Responding to charges that he demonized Mexicans and Muslims, Mr. Trump said, “There is no room for prejudice. ” Mr. Trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another. “We are transferring power from Washington, D. C. and giving it back to you, the people,” he said. “For too long,” he continued, “a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in the wealth. ” He added, “That all changes starting right here and right now. ”",1
25391,Michael Flynn Is Harsh Judge of C.I.A.’s Role - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Long before Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn became Donald J. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, he believed that the Central Intelligence Agency had become a political tool of the Obama administration  —   a view now echoed by the   in his mocking dismissals of C. I. A. assessments that Russia sought to tip the election in Mr. Trump’s favor. “They’ve lost sight of who they actually work for,” Mr. Flynn said in an interview with The New York Times in October 2015. “They work for the American people. They don’t work for the president of the United States. ” He added, speaking of the agency’s leadership: “Frankly, it’s become a very political organization. ” Mr. Flynn’s assessment that the C. I. A. is a political arm of the Obama administration is not widely shared by Republicans or Democrats in Washington. But it has appeared to have been internalized by the one person who matters most right now: Mr. Trump. In the past few days, Mr. Trump has sought to portray reports of the agency’s assessments that Russia actively tried to interfere in the election as a desperate attempt by sore losers to taint his presidency before it begins. His denigration of C. I. A. officials as “the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction” has opened up an extraordinary rift between the   and the nation’s intelligence community that is unlikely to be bridged anytime soon. Although it is unclear how much Mr. Flynn, 57, is responsible for Mr. Trump’s response to the C. I. A. assessment, during the presidential campaign he had substantial influence on the  . He brought to the campaign views on Muslims and national security that tended to hew far closer to the   fringes than the mainstream of the Republican Party. Mr. Flynn also appears to have helped set the tone for Mr. Trump’s testy relationship with the intelligence community. In August, when the Trump campaign received its first intelligence briefing, Mr. Flynn was so combative with the briefers that another person in the room had to urge him to settle down, according to a person familiar with the episode who was told about it in confidence. On any number of issues  —   from the Obama administration’s failure to foresee the rise of the Islamic State to Mr. Flynn’s ouster as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the intelligence arm of the Defense Department  —   he has made it clear in recent years that he sees the political hand of the C. I. A. at work. As director of the D. I. A. from 2012 to 2014, he pushed hard for his agency, long treated as   by the C. I. A. to be given greater access to the trove of documents and other materials seized during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011. The C. I. A. controlled the material, and Mr. Flynn became convinced that the agency was refusing to share or declassify much of it because of fears that it would undermine the administration’s narrative about Al Qaeda’s waning strength at the time Bin Laden was killed. “It’s all political with” the C. I. A. leadership, Mr. Flynn said in the 2015 interview, which focused on the rise of the Islamic State and American national security. “If they put out what we knew, then the president could have not said, in a national election, ‘Al Qaeda’s on the run and we’ve killed Bin Laden,’” he said, referring to Mr. Obama’s 2012   campaign. “Even today, he talks about Bin Laden as though that was a stroke of genius. ” Mr. Flynn also questioned the decision to kill Bin Laden. “Killing Bin Laden was the wrong thing to do,” he said. “They could have captured him. ” In killing Bin Laden, he said, “we created a new version of Allah. ” “What we should have done is shown him to be a decrepit old guy, put him in a freaking cage, in a cell, and put him on trial,” Mr. Flynn added. “Make it a big messy trial, make it global. ” Mr. Flynn has also said that the C. I. A. at the urging of the White House, was playing down warnings from the D. I. A. about the resurgence of Al Qaeda in Iraq, which would later become the Islamic State. “I’m telling you, the C. I. A. has a lot to reflect on because of this,” he said. A number of current and former officials dispute Mr. Flynn’s account, saying concerns about the resurgence of Islamist militants in the midst of Syria’s civil war were widespread in the intelligence community. Mr. Flynn, who was fired from the D. I. A. after serving only two years of a   appointment, has described his dismissal as an act of political retribution by the C. I. A. and Obama administration officials who did not want to hear what he was saying. Other officials, including some with direct knowledge of the decision to dismiss Mr. Flynn, said he was forced out for a more straightforward reason: He was not a good manager, and his efforts to reform the agency left it in chaos. It was not Mr. Flynn’s first   with the civilian intelligence community. The ill will stretches back years, current and former officials said, and it transformed into open hostility when Mr. Flynn was running military intelligence under Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in Afghanistan. In January 2010, after less than a year on the job, Mr. Flynn released a paper, “Fixing Intel,” that was highly critical of American intelligence work in Afghanistan. It bluntly stated that “the U. S. intelligence community is only marginally relevant to the overall strategy,” and said that it had only itself to blame because it had failed to understand Afghanistan’s cultural complexities. The paper was widely praised in defense circles as insightful. But at the C. I. A. officials were furious at what they saw as a direct attack on the aptitude and professionalism of the roughly 1, 000 agency personnel who were serving in Afghanistan at the time. They were also incensed at the timing of the paper, which became public five days after a suicide attack that killed seven C. I. A. officers at a base in eastern Afghanistan. Mr. Flynn’s searing critique was seen at the agency as the height of insensitivity. Mr. Flynn has been unapologetic about his views of not only the C. I. A. but other national security agencies, including the D. I. A. under his leadership. “They’ve really been lying to the American public,” he said in the interview, referring to the Obama administration and much of the national security and intelligence establishment. “The Department of Defense and those of us that have allowed this sort of a happy talk  —   ‘We’re moving in the right direction, things are working.’ It’s not. The Taliban are going to come back into power, or ISIS is going to come back into power. ”",1
25393,FBI reopens Clinton investigation as new emails found,"
The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation.
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent” to Clinton’s investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. “I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”

The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesn’t know how long that will take.
The Clinton campaign has yet to comment, but an aide told CNN: “We’re learning about this just like you all are.”
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine was asked about Comey’s letter while campaigning at an early voting site in Tallahassee, Florida. “Gotta read a little more, gotta read a little more,” he told reporters.
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case.
“Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,” he said in a statement. “The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.”
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September, but it’s unclear if the announced investigation relates to them or other correspondence. The newly discovered emails are not related to Wikileaks or the Clinton Foundation, law enforcement sources told CNN’s Evan Perez.
The messages were not found on the private email server in the Clintons’ New York residence, a government source told Reuters.
The emails were apparently discovered as part of the sexting probe into former Representative Anthony Weiner (D-New York), the New York Times reported. His electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that investigation.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) renewed his call for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to “suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.”
“Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,” Ryan said in a statement. “This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators.”
Kellyanne Conway, Republican nominee Donald Trump’s campaign manager, applauded the decision.
“That is superb. That is extraordinary news for the American people,” she told Yahoo News. “A great day in our campaign just got even better,” she tweeted.
“They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,” Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire, 10 minutes after learning about the reopening of the case. “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.”
“I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,” he said. “This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand, and it is everybody’s hope that it is about to be corrected.”
“With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?” he joked before turning to his prepared remarks.
The “FBI reopening investigation isn’t an October surprise, it’s an October nuclear explosion,” conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro wrote as part of a tweetstorm, adding that “Comey [is] trying to cover his a** 11 days before [the] election” and wondering if a “pre-emptive impeachment of a president elect” is possible because “the odds on President Tim Kaine just rose substantially.”
An ‘October Surprise‘ is a major event that happens in the month before the election that affects the outcome of the vote.
In response to the announcement, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice against Comey.
“It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, said in a statement. “It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.”
Stocks fell after Comey’s announcement, CNBC reported.

25399,"Marijuana Arrests Outnumber Those for Violent Crimes, Study Finds - The New York Times","Arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana exceeded those for all violent crimes last year, a new study has found, even as social attitudes toward the drug have changed and a number of cities and states have legalized its use or decriminalized small quantities. And a disproportionate number of those arrested are   who smoke marijuana at rates similar to whites but are arrested and prosecuted far more often for having small amounts for personal use, according to the study. The arrests can overwhelm court systems. Dianne Jones, 45, who was arrested in New Orleans in 2014 on charges of having a small bag of marijuana, spent 10 days in jail because she could not put up a $2, 500 bond. She was able to get enough money together only after her daughter sold the family’s television set at a pawnshop for $200. Later, when Ms. Jones, who is   was unable to pay   fees and fines, a judge issued a warrant for her arrest. With marijuana use on the rise, law enforcement agencies made 574, 641 arrests last year for small quantities of the drug intended for personal use, according to the report, which was released Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch. The marijuana arrests were about 13. 6 percent more than the 505, 681 arrests made for all violent crimes, including murder, rape and serious assaults. The report comes in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott last month in Charlotte, N. C. Mr. Scott, 43, had attracted police attention in part because, the police said, he was smoking marijuana. The report is the latest study to highlight the disparate treatment   often receive in the criminal justice system, including disproportionate numbers of blacks who are sent to jail when they are unable to pay   fees, or stopped by the police during traffic stops or while riding bicycles. People arrested for marijuana possession or other minor crimes often have a more difficult time finding work, including Cory, 31, who declined to give his last name out of concern his comments could affect his parole. He said in an interview that he had failed to find a job after 14 months in a Louisiana prison for his fifth offense involving a small quantity of drugs. He said he had been turned down by a   restaurant because of his marijuana conviction, as well as at the restaurant where he worked before his last arrest as a fry cook and dishwasher. “I’ve kind of stopped trying,” said Cory, who is  . Tess Borden, a fellow at Human Rights Watch and the A. C. L. U. who wrote the report, found that despite the steep decline in crime rates over the last two decades  —   including a 36 percent drop in violent crime arrests from 1995 to 2015  —   the number of arrests for all drug possessions, including marijuana, increased 13 percent. The emphasis on making marijuana arrests is worrisome, Ms. Borden said. “Most people don’t think drug possession is the No. 1 public safety concern, but that’s what we’re seeing,” she said. Criminologists say that   are arrested more often than whites and others for drug possession in large part because of questionable police practices. Police departments, for example, typically send large numbers of officers to neighborhoods that have high crime rates. A result is that any offense  —   including minor ones like loitering, jaywalking or smoking marijuana  —   can lead to an arrest, which in turn drives up arrest rate statistics, leading to even greater police vigilance. “It is selective enforcement, and the example I like to use is that you have all sorts of drug use inside elite college dorms, but you don’t see the police busting through doors,” said Inimai M. Chettiar, director of the Justice Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice.   may also be more apt to face arrest, according to researchers, because they might be more likely to smoke marijuana outdoors, attracting the attention of the police. The report, which advocates the decriminalization of small quantities of illegal drugs intended for personal use, found that while whites are more likely than blacks to use illicit drugs  —   including marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and prescription drugs for nonmedical purposes  —   black adults were more than     times as likely to be arrested. In terms of marijuana possession, black adults were more than four times as likely to be arrested as white adults in the 39 states in which sufficient data was available, according to the report. The disparities, the analysis found, persist whether there are few or many   in a given area. In Iowa, Montana and Vermont  —   places with relatively small populations of    —   blacks were more than six times as likely to be arrested on drug possession charges than whites. In Manhattan, where blacks make up about 15 percent of the population,   are nearly 11 times as likely as whites to be arrested on drug possession, according to the report. Ms. Jones, who was arrested in New Orleans with a $10 bag of marijuana, said the warrant for her arrests had been dismissed only after a community group for which she is a volunteer raised the remaining $155 of the $834 she owed the court. “What happened to me shouldn’t happen to anybody,” she said.",1
25401,Comment on Shocking Insinuation About Carl Sagan & Extraterrestrials Made By X-NASA Astronaut by Is This What You Think They Would Look Like? Supposed Pictures of Real Extraterrestrials - New Earth Media,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter A few years ago, Neil deGrasse said that yes, extraterrestrials may be visiting our planet, and people do see Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), but he also stated that it is a big leap for one to assume a UFO is of extraterrestrial in origin. ( source )   As you will see from the information below, it’s not a big leap, which is why so many other scientists around the world support the extraterrestrial hypotheses. It’s also important to note that this article is not implying that Carl Saga is a ‘bad’ person. If this information is indeed true, we still do not know the circumstances and details of it. It is a common occurrence for ‘UFO’s to be tracked on military radar , and more and more people are starting to believe that these objects are of extraterrestrial origin. and there is a good amount of evidence to believe that. One reason for this is the disclosure of evidence supporting such a hypothesis in recent years. If you want to see a fraction of that evidence, you can check out this article or the one pertaining to military radar linked above, or you can visit the exopolitics section of our website, here . If you really want to go in depth and read some proper studies on this topic, you can check out Richard Dolan’s books . They are a great place to start, he is a brilliant academic and one of the world’s leading researchers on the topic of UFOs. Sagan’s Close Colleague Apart from the congressional hearings on this subject, and the fairly recent citizens hearing that took place, along with the release of official documentation, there has been a surge in people believing that ETs are real because of the work of scholars like Dr. Brian O’Leary. Brian was a close colleague of Carl Sagan, who recruited him to teach at Cornell University in the late 1960’s, where he researched and lectured in the department of astronomy and physics. After Cornell, he taught physics, astronomy, and science policy assessment at various academic institutions, including the University of California Berkeley, Hampshire College, and finally at Princeton University from 1976 to 1981. After this he went on to Washington, where he would become an advisor to various political leaders, presidential candidates, and the United States Congress.   Before all of this, Dr. O’Leary was a NASA astronaut and a member of the sixth group of astronauts selected by NASA in August of 1967. One year after that, as mentioned above, Sagan recruited him to teach at Cornell. O’Leary was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as secretary of the American Geophysical Union’s Planetology Section. Furthermore, he was the team leader of the Asteroidal Resources Group for NASA’s Ames Summer Study on Space Settlements. He was a founding board member of the International Association for New Science as well as founding president of the New Energy Movement. “Carl Sagan called me from Cornell and asked me to join the faculty. I accepted the offer and spent many years at Cornell in the astronomy department, planetary science department. And I became very creative in research then, but still within the bounds of western science, but in the planetary exploration program. That was for a period of about a decade.” ( source )( source ) As you can see, his resume is more than extensive, and O’Leary is just one out of hundreds of people with this type of distinguished background to blow the lid on the extraterrestrial phenomenon. I use his video below in a lot of my extraterrestrial/UFO related articles, and I apologize to our regular readers, but I feel it’s always useful to share with readers who have yet to come across it. The clip is taken from the Thrive documentary which, if you haven’t seen yet, I highly recommend. You can read his entire biography — though I’ll warn you it is quite large — HERE . Above I’ve provided only the highlights of his impressive career. Brian passed away shortly after this video was taken. Apparently it happened shortly after having a heart attack and a diagnosis of intestinal cancer. What He Said Carl Sagan Did He had some interesting things to say during a live interview with Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot (view full live interview here , read transcript of video here ). O’Leary and Sagan were close for a number of years, but had a little bit of a falling out when O’Leary decided to leave Cornell. In the interview, he remarked: It was… One very cold snowy day in May, I landed in Syracuse, and there was a horizontal blizzard — in May — and I said: That’s it for upstate New York . And Carl thought that was very frivolous. Because, of course, he was kind of an empire-builder kind of guy; and he also had a huge ego. After he left, O’Leary started to examine some of Carl’s work. He said that the famous “Face” in Cydonia on Mars — photographed by Viking in 1975, this enormous formation (about a mile across) resembled a human face and created a major buzz at the time — was tampered with by Sagan before being released to the public: It was very, very disappointing to me, because not only was Carl wrong, he also fudged data. He published a picture of the “Face” in Parade Magazine , a popular article, saying that the “Face” was just a natural formation, but he doctored the picture to make it not look like a face. At this time, Sagan and O’Leary were arguably the world’s two leading experts on Mars, and they entered into many disagreements over that face. This rift was made clear in O’Leary’s publication in 1998, “Carl Sagan & I: On Opposite Sides of Mars.” It can be found in The Case for the Face: Scientists Examine the Evidence for Alien Artifacts on Mars , eds. Stanley V. McDaniel and Monica Rix Paxson. Kempton, IL: Adventures Unlimited Press. In May of 1990, O’Leary released a paper titled “ Analysis of Images of the Face on Mars and Possible Intelligent Origin ” which only further demonstrated his skepticism. It was published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Vol.43 No.5. O’Leary also went on the record and stated: I began to realize, just directly from the scientific point of view, not only hearsay, that this man was colluding with NASA, that there might be more to this than before. . . . Carl was on a committee with a number of notable people. There was a report issued by the Brookings Institution in 1961 — and that’s about when I knew Carl, during those years; the ’60s mostly was when I worked closely with him — that he and this other group said: Well, if any ETs ever showed up on the Earth, it has to be covered up. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to manage this, because if we can’t, then it would be too much of a culture shock. Quite a shocking statement from someone of Brian’s stature, isn’t it? In the interview, he goes on to say that Carl and his colleagues recommended that the governments cover up the UFO phenomenon, and that he believes this provided justification for the ongoing cover-up It’s important to note that this does not make Sagan a ‘bad guy.’ He was clearly the opposite of that, and his love for science and educating humanity was quite clear. If he was in favour of covering this up, if he did know about it, there is a very good chance it was done for what they perceived to be, good reasons. Sure, there might be some corporate reasons, and some other not so pleasant reasons the cover-up remains today, but it’s plausible to assume that in the beginning, perhaps there was no I’ll intent. “Behind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.” Former head of CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, 1960 (source) Why It’s Time To Listen To Contactees, Abductees & Experiences/ A Psychological Standpoint Just to clarify, ‘contactees’ are usually those who have reported ‘friendly’ contact experiences with extraterrestrials, ‘abductees’ are those who have had what they perceive to be fearful experiences, and experiencers are those who neither view the experience as ‘good’ or ‘bad,” but simply just an experience. It’s important to note this, because various people have reported different types of experiences with different types of beings. “Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered… We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time.” – Dr. Edgar Mitchell, ScD, 6th man to walk on the Moon ( source ) ( source ) The reality is that some people who claim to have had contact with intelligent extraterrestrial beings actually have. John Mack, A Harvard professor, psychiatrist and Pulitzer Price recipient stresses that: “Yes, it’s both. It’s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it’s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.” ( source ) We published an article earlier this year regarding John Mack, and more than 60 school children witnessing non-human beings and a large craft landing. The children were interviewed by him, and it was quite a remarkable story with all of the children providing very similiar stories. Until this day these children have been speaking of it, an event occurred more than 20 years ago…. “They describe these events like a person talks about something that has happened to them. I can tell that these are people of sound mind telling me something…” (quote continued and taken from the video linked below) -Dr. John Mack, professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School You can watch THIS video of Mack Interview the children, and you can read THIS article that goes more into detail on that case. According to retired McGill University professor in the Department of Psychology (research areas beings cognition and cognitive Neuroscience), Dr. Don Donderi: “Some of what people report as UFOs are extraterrestrial (ET) vehicles. Some of those extraterrestrial vehicles actually have ET crews, and some of those ET crews catch and release humans.” ( source ) Academicians like these, and others like Richard Dolan , David M. Jacobs and more have been studying this phenomena for decades, and the reports of beings and examining why they are here, what they are doing, what they look like and more has been documented by their (and others) research. What I find most fascinating about these stories is how many of them seem to compliment each other instead of contradicting each other, which just adds to the mystery. As far as physical research goes: “There are a great many photographs of such body marks, many of which are in an equilateral triangle pattern of red dots on the wrist or near the ankle. Also common are scoop marks,” in which it appears as if a small amount of tissue was removed from beneath the skin, leaving an indentation.” -Richard Dolan (taken from his book, UFOs for the 21st century mind ) Below is a clip of Dr. Roger Leir. a doctor of podiatric medicine, and arguably the best known individual with regards to extracting alleged alien implants. He has performed more than fifteen surgeries that removed sixteen separate distinct objects. These objects have been investigated by several prestigious laboratories, including Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, and many others. Unfortunately, he passed away in March 2014, but his legacy lives on. 
Truth is, as former NASA astronaut and Princeton Physics Professor puts it, “there is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been visiting us for a vary long time.” ( source ) Interesting Quotes About The UFO Phenomenon (A Few Out Of Many) ***Please keep in mind, the documentation regarding this phenomenon can be found from links that were mentioned in the very first paragraph of this article ” Everything is in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain, as well as the rest of the world. The nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data.” – General Carlos Castro Cavero (1979). From “UFOs and the National Security State, Volume 2,″ written by Richard Dolan. “There is a serious possibility that we are being visited and have been visited for many years by people from outer space, by other civilizations. Who they are, where they are from, and what they want should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not be the subject of ‘rubishing’ by tabloid newspapers.” ( source ) – Lord Admiral Hill-Norton, Former Chief of Defence Staff, 5 Star Admiral of the Royal Navy, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee “There is another way whether it’s wormholes or warping space, there’s got to be a way to generate energy so that you can pull it out of the vacuum, and the fact that they’re here shows us that they found a way.” ( source ) – Jack Kasher, Ph.D, Professor Emeritus of physics, University of Nebraska. “This thing has gotten so highly-classified… it is just impossible to get anything on it. I have no idea who controls the flow of need-to-know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I’ve never tried to make it to be my business since. I have been interested in this subject for a long time and I do know that whatever the Air Force has on the subject is going to remain highly classified.” – Senator Barry Goldwater, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee (source) “Yes, it’s both. It’s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it’s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.” – John Mack,Dr. John E. Mack, a Harvard University psychologist and Pulitzer prize winner” ( source ) “An extraterrestrial influence is investigating our planet. Something is monitoring the planet and they are monitoring it very cautiously.” — 2008 Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel ( source )( source ) “Some of what people report as UFOs are extraterrestrial (ET) vehicles. Some of those extraterrestrial vehicles actually have ET crews, and some of those ET crews catch and release humans.” — Dr. Don Donderi, a retired McGill University Professor of 40 years in the Department of Psychology ( source ) “Intelligent beings from other star systems have been and are visiting our planet Earth. They are variously referred to as Visitors, Others, Star People, Et’s, etc…They are visiting Earth now; this is not a matter of conjecture or wistful thinking. – Theodor C. Loder III, Phd, Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University of New Hampshire ( source ) “Decades ago, visitors from other plants warned us about where we were headed and offered to help. But instead, we, or at least some of us, interpreted their visits as a threat, and decided to shoot first and ask questions after.” – Paul Hellyer, Former Canadian Defense Minister ( source ) My people tell of Star People who came to us many generations ago. The Star people brought spiritual teachings and stories and maps of the cosmos and they offered these freely. They were kind, loving, and set a great example. When they left us, my people say there was a loneliness like no other.” – Richard Wagamese , Ojibway Author ( source ) I’m skeptical about many things, including the notion that government always knows best, and that the people can’t be trusted with the truth. The time to pull the curtain back on this subject is long overdue. We have statements from the most credible sources – those in a position to know – about a fascinating phenomenon, the nature of which is yet to be determined.

25402,BBC’s Children Show ‘Just a Girl’ is About a Transgender Child Taking Hormone Blocking Drugs,"Support Us BBC’s Children Show ‘Just a Girl’ is About a Transgender Child Taking Hormone Blocking Drugs 0 
The BBC series aimed at children as young a six describe how Ben became Amy by taking hormones to halt puberty. It is yet another example of the agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. And they are now aiming children. 
Last year, I published an article entitled The Agenda Behind Bruce Jenner’s Transformation where I explained how Jenner’s sex change was intentionally publicized and celebrated because it was part of a larger agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. This agenda is even more obvious and insidious this year because there’s a conscious effort to reach children. A child with the word ‘Transgender’ stamped across the screen. This sums up what mass media has been about these past years. Although ‘Amy’ is played by an actress, the story claims that she used to be boy named Ben. 
– Advertisement – 
CBBC’s series Just a Girl is the latest baffling attempt at normalizing, trivializing and even celebrating the completely unnecessary process that is childhood sex change. Freely available online on CBBC’s website, the series even teaches children about taking hormones and puberty-halting drugs. Do we truly know the effects of such drugs on one’s developing body and brain chemistry. Of course not. Why is this radical and aberrant process promoted to children? Do children need to know about hormone blockers? AND WHERE ARE THE PARENTS?! 
In my humble opinion, parents who subject their children to radical treatments such as hormone blockers and sex change surgery should be trialed for child abuse. Instead, these things are actually encouraged in shows aimed at children and society is following suit. 
Some NHS clinics (such as the Tavistock Centre in North London) have been prescribing hypothalamic blockers to children as young as nine. In another case, a seven-year-old boy was ordered to be removed from his mother’s care because ‘she was raising him as female’. This is what the elite wants to see: Confused children wondering about their gender. HOW ABOUT YOU GO OUTSIDE AND RIDE A BIKE OR SOMETHING? 
Here are quotes taken from Just a Girl . In Just A Girl, Amy says: ‘When I was born, Mum said Dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football. But Mum knew I was different. She realised early on that I was born in the wrong body.’ She adds: ‘My Mum supported me when I did a PowerPoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that I wasn’t going to come to school in boys’ clothes any more, but girls’ clothes. I wasn’t Ben, I was Amy.’ Later Amy is shown telling a friend, Josh – a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl – that she is on hormone blockers, saying it took ‘ages’ to get them after ‘loads of tests and talks at the clinic’. ‘Once they realised I was trans for real, [I] got them,’ she says. In another entry, Amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called Liam, but confides: ‘Liam thinks I’m just a girl, but I’m not. I’m trans. And what’s he going to say if he finds out? Stop being my friend? Why? I’m still me, aren’t I?’– Daily Mail, Does your child really need to know how ‘Ben’ became ‘Amy’? Furious parents slam ‘damaging’ BBC sex change show aimed at six-year-olds This last bit appears to be taken straight from a neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) handbook. The goal: To confuse young minds about sex and gender. Backlash 
The show was accused by several groups of ‘sowing the seeds of confusion’. Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: 
‘The more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girl’s body and a girl can be born into a boy’s body, and that drugs and surgery can put things right, the more children will become utterly confused. Respecting and preserving a child’s birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue. It is irresponsible of the BBC to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex.’’– Ibid. 
The BBC defended its series, releasing a statement which claimed the program dealt with “universal themes that many children relate to”. 
“Just a Girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to, make sense of the world, deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends, which are universal themes that many children relate to, and which has had a positive response from our audience. 
“CBBC aims to reflect true life to our audience, providing content that mirrors the lives of as many UK children as possible – you only have to look at programmes such as The Dumping Ground or our BAFTA winning and ground-breaking transgender story ‘I am Leo’ to see that is the case.” 
The BBC mentions I Am Leo which is another CBBC production. It is a documentary following a 13-year old teen’s process to become a boy. Leo (born Lily) is one of the youngest children in the UK to be given hormone therapy. 
In short, the BBC and the rest of mass media are fully committed in pushing the gender blurring agenda to children before they even reach puberty.",1
25405,What do Russian experts expect from Donald Trump?,"November 9, 2016 - Fort Russ -  RT - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On November 8th, Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. The results of the elections are still being summed up, but Trump has the undisputed advantage in electoral votes - 279 against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s 218 - and has therefore practically won.  
Russian political circles are displaying a cautious attitude towards Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections. Politicians interviewed by RT expect that Russia and America will build more constructive relations, but no warming should be counted on. Russian deputies and senators have noted that they are awaiting a “competent” reaction by Trump to Syria, Crimea, and Ukraine. 
The deputy chairman of the Federation Council’s Committee on International Affairs, Arsen Kanokov, expects Trump to find a common language with Vladimir Putin and Russia overall. The senator said: “There is great hope for a thaw. We all want to have friendly relations with America. The question is how these processes are happening. I think that we will sit at the negotiating table and Russia’s reasonable voice will be heard by America. We hope that they will understand the actions and aid that we are affording to Syria. The political vector will change in this regard.” 
The first deputy chairwoman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Svetlana Zhurova, recalled that Donald Trump repeatedly spoke of the need for cooperation with Russia even during his election campaign.  
Zhurova believes: “This does not mean that tomorrow Trump will rush to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin or that our representatives will rush to America to negotiate with him. They will work out orderly, constructive relations. Trump will pay more attention to internal problems rather than the showdown between the two countries. He believes that America should pay attention to economic cooperation with Russia, political dialogue, and the joint struggle against global terrorism. In these spheres, our countries can truly be useful for each other. Trump spoke about all of this in his campaign speeches. He is not the kind of person who breaks his word. Yes, Trump will look to the opinion of the US population, which has some doubts concerning Russia, but there won’t be such aggression in policies towards Russia like the Obama administration did.” 
Dmitry Novikov, also a member of the State Duma’s international committee, suggests that no radical changes in the US' foreign policy course should be expected.  
“Trump has been elected president of his country, so he will undoubtedly defend the interests of the US and its ruling circles. If Trump will fulfill his promises on how the administration in Washington should focus on solving domestic problems, then maybe his foreign policy won’t be so aggressive. As for what concerns Russia, more common sense approaches to such issues as Syria, Crimea, and Ukraine might prevail in the White House’s policies. In these cases, the preconditions for the normalization of relations between Russia and the United States could be expressed,” Novikov posited. 
Novikov also added that no warming of relations like in the days of Kennedy and Khrushchev should be expected, since Russia’s geopolitical position has dramatically changed.  
“The Soviet Union had much more formidable starting capabilities to be on an equal footing in the world arena. The country had economic weight and a system of alliances. In this sense, modern Russia has a somewhat weaker position. Nevertheless, the US has enough domestic problems, and if Trump really zeros in on solving them, then we could see more reasonable foreign policy,” he added. 
In turn, the first deputy chairman of the Federation Council’s Committee on International Affairs, Vladimir Dzhabarov, believes that Trump’s victory will positively impact Russian-American relations. According to him: “One shouldn't wait for any dramatic warming [in relations], or worsening, for that matter, which was expected if Hillary won.” Dzhabarov remarked that Trump, during his election campaign, behaved with dignity and did not spew out any negative statements towards Russia and the Russian president. 

The politician also expressed hope that the billionaire’s victory would affect Europe’s position on relations with Russia: “No wonder they have taken a cautious position on sanctions. I hope that they will become more independent,” Dzhabarov said.

25407,"Sessions DOJ Ends ’Holder Memo’ Era, Resumes Strict Drug Sentencing - Breitbart","The Department of Justice announced Friday the end of former Attorney General Eric Holder’s controversial policy preventing certain offenders being charged with crimes that trigger mandatory minimums. [The office of Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memorandum titled “Department Charging and Sentencing Policy” to all 93 U. S. Attorney’s offices around the country. As the nation’s leading federal law enforcement official, the Attorney General has the authority to direct charging policy for all DOJ employees. This “Sessions Memo” expressly voids the August 2013, ‘Holder Memo‘ by   General Holder that governed charging decisions until now.  AG Memo on Department Charging and Sentencing Policy by Breitbart News on Scribd,  Most controversially, the Holder Memo forbade federal prosecutors from pursuing charges that would trigger mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain categories of drug offenders, even when prosecutors felt those charges were justified by the facts. Specifically, those caught even with large amounts of drugs were to be charged with less serious offenses that did not trigger mandatory minimums if the defendant was “” not a member of a drug cartel, did not have a long criminal history, and met certain other requirements. It is important to note that, unlike some state systems, most defendants charged with “ ” drug crimes in the federal criminal justice system are not arrested with personal use or even   sale quantities. The Holder Memo became relevant only when federal mandatory minimums for drug offenses kicked in. According to U. S. Sentencing Commission materials the smallest amounts needed to trigger these minimum   sentences were one kilogram of heroin (approximately 10, 000 doses) five kilograms of Cocaine, 280 grams of crack cocaine, or a metric ton of marijuana. Proponents saw the Holder Memo as a “safety valve” for “ ” drug offenders. The memo itself cites the need to reserve mandatory minimum sentences for the highest level of drug offenders and the prosecutor’s role in doing so given federal case law that requires judges follow mandatory minimums enacted by Congress when criminals are convicted under those statutes. Opponents of the Holder Memo felt it demanded federal prosecutors ignore the will of Congress and deliberately circumvent the sentencing structure imposed by the legislature. In this view, U. S. Attorneys were prevented from charging offenses they could readily prove and instead were instructed to conceal from juries the actual amounts of drugs defendants were alleged to have possessed or sold. In any event, the Holder Memo was a radical departure from the previously governing “Ashcroft Memo,” named for its putative author George W.   Attorney General John Ashcroft, which demanded federal prosecutors must, in all criminal cases, charge the most serious offense they had a strong likelihood of proving beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. For example, most people charged with murder could also be charged with manslaughter. Most charged with armed robbery could also be charged with theft. And most of those charged with selling 10 kilograms of drugs could also be charged for selling 1 kilogram of drugs. The Ashcroft Memo, from which Eric Holder departed, forbade U. S. Attorneys from ever charging the lesser included offense and always charging the most serious readily provable offense. Friday’s Sessions Memo reinstates this policy as the default instruction for all federal prosecutors effective immediately. The Sessions Memo, however, is not a mere restatement of the Ashcroft Memo. While the duty to charge the most serious offense is   on line prosecutors, the memo recognizes the need for prosecutorial discretion in certain charging decisions. Only   supervisors such as the 93 U. S. Attorneys and the 12 Assistant Attorneys General may approve deviation from the “most serious offense” requirement. This allows a degree of autonomy and discretion for individual offices not available in the Ashcroft years. This discretion is perhaps most important in securing the cooperation of criminals to bring down larger criminal enterprises. “” whereby prosecutors agree to charge defendants with less harsh sentencing guidelines in exchange for cooperating with the authorities in other investigation, is a powerful “carrot” available to some state prosecutors. The Sessions memo will   that tool to the federal justice system, but only in the hands of   DOJ officials and only when they’ve made their reasoning for doing so clear to the relevant court.",1
25411,Why Do People Who Need Help From the Government Hate It So Much? - The New York Times,"STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LANDAnger and Mourning on the American RightBy Arlie Russell Hochschild351 pp. The New Press. $27. 95. Arlie Hochschild’s generous but disconcerting look at the Tea Party presents a likable fellow named Lee Sherman, who once worked for a Louisiana chemical plant where his duties included illegally dumping toxic waste into the bayou. Sherman did the dirty work then the company did him dirty. After 15 years on the job, he was doused with chemicals that “burned my clothes clean off me” and left him ill. But rather than pay his disability costs, his bosses accused him of absenteeism and fired him. Sherman became a fledgling environmentalist and got his revenge after a giant fish kill threatened the livelihood of nearby fishermen. Company officials feigned innocence, but Sherman barged into a public meeting with an incriminating sign: I’M THE ONE WHO DUMPED IT IN THE BAYOU.   a couple of decades and Sherman, still an environmentalist, is campaigning for a Tea Party congressman who wants to gut the Environmental Protection Agency. Sherman still distrusts chemical companies, but he distrusts the federal government more, because it spends his tax money on people who “lazed around days and partied at night. ” In “Strangers in Their Own Land,” which has been nominated for a National Book Award, Hochschild calls this the “Great Paradox”  —   opposition to federal help from people and places that need it  —   and sets off across Louisiana on an energetic,   quest to understand it. A distinguished Berkeley sociologist, Hochschild is a woman of the left, but her mission is empathy, not polemics. She takes seriously the Tea Partiers’ complaints that they have become the “strangers” of the title  —   triply marginalized by flat or falling wages, rapid demographic change, and liberal culture that mocks their faith and patriotism. Her affection for her characters is palpable. But the resentments she finds are as toxic as the pollutants in the marsh and metastasizing throughout politics. What unites her subjects is the powerful feeling that others are “cutting in line” and that the federal government is supporting people on the dole  —   “taking money from the workers and giving it to the idle. ” Income is flowing up, but the anger points down. The people who feel this are white. The usurpers they picture are blacks and immigrants. Hochschild takes care not to call anyone racist but concludes that “race is an essential part of this story. ” When she asks a   mayor to describe his politics, his first two issues  —   or is it one in his mind?  —   are welfare and race: “I don’t like the government paying unwed mothers to have a lot of kids, and I don’t go for affirmative action. ” In welfare politics, this is déjà vu all over again. It’s been two decades since Bill Clinton signed a tough welfare law aimed in part to end the politics of blame. “Ending welfare as we know it” would recast the needy as workers, he said, and build support for a new safety net. The rolls of the main federal cash program have fallen by 80 percent from their 1990s highs  —   in Louisiana, by 95 percent. But reverse class anger is more potent than ever. Liberals have long wondered why    voters support policies that (the liberals think) hurt the working class. Why would victims of pollution side with the polluters? Theories abound. Thomas Frank accuses the G. O. P. of luring voters with social issues but delivering tax cuts for the rich. Others point to the political machines built by   donors like Charles and David Koch. Still others emphasize the influence of conservative media like Fox News. Hochschild sees these as partial explanations but wants a fuller understanding of “emotion in politics”  —   she wants to know how Tea Partiers feel, on the theory that the movement serves their “emotional  ” by providing “a giddy release” from years of frustration. Six characters dominate the book, including Harold Areno, who lives on a swamp so polluted even the rugged cypress trees are dead. He and his wife have had cancer. Yet Areno supports politicians hostile to environmental regulation because he cares more about banning abortion. “We vote for candidates that put the Bible where it belongs,” he said. Mike Schaff lost his neighborhood to the Bayou Corne sinkhole, which started to swallow 37 acres in 2012 after a lightly regulated drilling company punctured an underground salt dome. But he remains a “free market man,” because “Big Government” threatens “community. ” Many Tea Party adherents warn that more regulation will cost them jobs. (A   mayor says the pungent chemical plant “smells like rice and  gravy. ”) But Hochschild detects other passions and assembles what she calls the “deep story”  —   a “feels as if” story, beyond facts or judgment, that presents her subjects’ worldview. It goes like this: “You are patiently standing in a long line” for something you call the American dream. You are white, Christian, of modest means, and getting along in years. You are male. There are people of color behind you, and “in principle you wish them well. ” But you’ve waited long, worked hard, “and the line is barely moving. ” Then “Look! You see people cutting in line ahead of you!” Who are these interlopers? “Some are black,” others “immigrants, refugees. ” They get affirmative action, sympathy and welfare  —   “checks for the listless and idle. ” The government wants you to feel sorry for them. And who runs the government? “The biracial son of a   single mother,” and he’s cheering on the line cutters. “The president and his wife are line cutters themselves. ” The liberal media mocks you as racist or homophobic. Everywhere you look, “you feel betrayed. ” Hochschild runs the myth past her Tea Party friends. “You’ve read my mind,” Lee Sherman said. “I live your analogy,” Mike Schaff said. Harold Areno’s niece agrees, and says she has seen people drive their children to Head Start in Lexuses. “If people refuse to work, we should let them starve,” she said. Actually, anger this raw may depart from the 1990s, when welfare critics often framed their attacks as efforts to help the poor by fighting dependency. The resentments Hochschild presents are unadorned, and they have mutated into a broader suspicion of almost everything the federal government does. “The government has gone rogue, corrupt, malicious and ugly,” one Tea Partier complains. “It can’t help anybody. ” Did welfare really “end”? Conservatives say no. Cash aid plummeted, but food stamp usage soared to new highs and the Medicaid rolls expanded. There’s room for debate, but the grievances Hochschild presents feel immune to policy solutions. As long as larger forces are squeezing whites of modest means, it’s going to “feel as if” people are cutting in line. In Lexuses. None of Hochschild’s characters appear to have been directly hurt by competition from people of color. Their economic problems lie elsewhere, she argues, in unchecked corporate power and technological transformation. Still there’s no denying that demographic and cultural change have robbed white men of the status they once enjoyed. Hochschild doesn’t buy the racial   but she can see their pain. Whatever racial or class resentments she finds, Hochschild makes clear that she likes the people she meets. They aren’t just soldiers in a class war but victims of one, too. She mourns their economic losses, praises their warmth and hospitality, and admires their “grit and resilience. ” While her hopes of finding common political ground seem overly optimistic, this is a smart, respectful and compelling book.",1

Jennifer Hoffman – As we end another rather challenging month it’s tempting to ask when it will all be over. That’s not a good question to ask right now because it implies that we’re the passenger on this ride and we have no control over the outcomes. But we are the driver and we have all of the control, as we’ll see in November. 
From October’s 1 energy we move into the 2 of November but this is 2 reduced from 11 (November is the 11th month) which is the integration of spirit and matter, of human and divine. Are we ready to reap the rewards of our efforts now, or are we waiting for permission to sit at life’s victory banquet? It’s up to us and we’ll find out in November that the rewards are there but we have to step up to the podium and claim them for ourselves. November can be a ‘joy ride’ if we’re willing to let go, lift off, and shine on. 
November begins with a new moon which happened at the end of October. Nevertheless, the energy is still resonating with us and this was a very busy new moon. It really brings forward November’s theme of spiritual integration, with the Sun, Moon, and Mercury all trine (120 degrees) Neptune in Pisces. Here we have both lights (sun and moon), as well Mercury, the planet of karma, all interfacing with Neptune in Pisces, the final house of the zodiac. The message for us is to become spiritually mature – accept ourselves as powerful spiritual masters and let go of any thoughts or beliefs about not deserving or being ‘good enough’. 
But it gets better because Jupiter is close by (it’s the traditional Pisces ruler) so it amps up the spiritual energy we have to use for our transformation and transition to the ascension vibe. This continues the Jupiter effect from September 2015 as we move forward into phase two of our spiritual awakening cycle that began then.

Then there is the tricky Venus/Saturn conjunction happening too. What happens when you put the planet of beauty, love, and partnership in the same small space with the zodiac’s disciplinarian and reality teacher, Saturn? Either a lot of heated discussion or stony silence. The energy of this union is a reality check for us in the relationship area, starting with the one we have with ourselves, as well as our relationships with others. 
Are we being ‘real’ with ourselves, giving ourselves the same level of caring, compassion, and consideration that we give others? 
Where are we focusing our energy and what do we want to create in our lives, separating our needs, wants, and desires from those of others? 
Venus wants it all and not always in a balanced or achievable way. Saturn strives to focus our enthusiasm on what we really want and to eliminate the limitations, distractions, worries, and fears that prevent us from realizing our dreams. Venus is like the 3 year old who wants the cookie, and Saturn is the mother who says “No, not before dinner”. The mother is doing it to benefit the child but it doesn’t feel that way. Our response here is important, to do we keep pushing against the ‘no’ or do we figure out why the ‘no’ is there and then make other plans? Are we in denial of anything in our reality or are we willing to take off the ‘rose colored glasses’ and start doing what we need and want to be happy? 
Have you been feeling less motivated, a little slow and unconsciously taking a very deep, detailed look at your life? You can blame Mars for that during the past several months as he has been aspecting the heavy hitters, Saturn in September and Pluto in November, as well as squaring the Uranus/Eris conjunction this past week. We’re used to Mars energy being very fast moving (except when it was moving back and forth through Scorpio from January to August this year) and jumping over hurdles. But we have had to adapt to a new, more mature Mars energy this year, that takes its time, digs deeply, considers, reconsiders, and assesses the terrain before moving forward. While this is a more deliberate Mars energy, we prefer the fast moving Mars, although we won’t have it until 2017. 
The Mars/Pluto action ends the first week of November but its energy has been rather depressing lately. And here’s why, we have Mars, which rules the firgrandparents-1017825_1280st house of the zodiac, Aries, walking with Pluto, which is (supposedly) the last planet in our solar system (ignore the planetary demotions and astronomy games) and rules Scorpio. 
Mars is also the traditional Scorpio ruler, so we have double Scorpio energy here. (yes, the Scorpio energy just continues). But, the Mars/Pluto conjunction is like what happens when a little child spends time with an elderly grandparent – the child slows down to accommodate the grandparent’s age, while the grandparent adjusts their conversation to the child’s age. It’s the best of both worlds, the slowing down to reflect, consider, assess, and connect on a shared level. 
But when that’s happening in your personal life and you need things to be done or to get done, and don’t have any time for esoteric ‘navel gazing’ because you need action happening now, it can be frustrating. And yet, this is part of taking action because we must get used to aligning energetically before we leap into unknown territory without ensuring that it’s right and best for us and is something we want to integrate with and put into our reality. 
All of this activity in October, the ‘1’ month, had a purpose, to bring us into the ‘2’ of November. This is not about relationships, romance, and revelry, although there is an opportunity for that. This is first and foremost about our central relationship, with ourselves. We are either alone in our humanity or partnered with our divinity, where the human ‘1’ becomes the ‘2’ divine human. 
What do we need to embrace about ourselves, including our beauty, perfection, wisdom, and potential, to allow this to happen?divinity-is-your-destiny 
What do we need to release, shed, and turn away from, including our need for approval and validation, beliefs in unworthiness, fears about the future, and inability to acknowledge our power, to make room for our divinity? 
The opposite of divinity is not evil (which is the word ‘live’ backwards), it is profanity, which is the absence of divinity. A profane reality is not one filled with four letter words; it is one which has no room for the divine; therefore, it will always feel incomplete because divinity makes us whole, complete, and congruent in our individual energy and brings us closer to being in congruence collectively. 
Many things in the past few months, including the ridiculous antics of the US presidential election, have shown us what a ‘profane’ world resembles and this has pushed many people in the opposite direction, seeking the wisdom and empowerment of divinity. ‘Every dark potential does have a light purpose’, when we remember that the light is always there and the darkness always gives way to it. If the events of this year have revealed the profane to you, make an intentional choice to integrate the empowerment of divinity into your life. This is the month to do that. 
Moving the profanity of 3D to the divine energy of 5D in November compels us to take action, which begins energetically. The process starts with the intention to allow new beliefs, new perspectives, and new alignments to become our energetic partners. Do we desire to have higher frequency energies, like joy, in our life? These are created when we agree to align with 5D energies. 
I do have to mention the full moon of November 14, which is involves the Sun/Moon in Taurus/Scorpio and it’s at 22 degrees, echoing the eclipse degree of November 13, 2013, just after Saturn first entered Scorpio. If it feels like that pesky Scorpio energy won’t go away, it will hang around through the end of the year. It is part of the profound transformation that is in place to push us through these final stages of resistance to our ascension. 
Then in 2017 we will have the occasional Scorpio reminder (it is, after all, one of the zodiac signs) but it won’t be the same intensity we have experienced since 2012. This is a very special full moon because the moon will be closer to the earth than it has been since 1948, so it will have extra impact. If you’re out and about you may want to pay extra attention to your driving and people may be very emotional and distracted. 
We have the usual ongoing energies happening this month too, including the ongoing Uranus/Eris square, and the wounded healer Chiron energy, but with a new focus, how do we put things together to create the new paradigms we have been wanting to align with and integrate? So much of our time has been spent in taking things apart this year, now it’s time to put them together – not in the same way, unless that’s what we want, but in new and different ways that serve our intention for joy, peace, love, abundance, fulfillment and, our theme for 2016, congruent harmony.November is a month for spiritual maturity, where we set aside the regrets of the past and begin to look forward to taking action in new directions, fully embracing our power to create a reality, and a world, in which spirit and human work together, in partnership, which is the only way we’re going to allow 5D energies in to stay. If we keep our focus on 5D integration – 3D is not disappearing or going away, ascension is an integration, not a takeover – we will start seeing progress this month. 
But November is not all work and no play, it’s also a month for joy and it can be a ‘joy ride’ if we are willing to stop working so hard to get the rest of humanity to align with the ascension energies and have some fun. That is going to be one of our missions in 2017, to lead from the lighter energy and frequency of joy, to be less of a light ‘worker’ and more of a light ‘beacon’, enjoying our own journey while we do the work of fulfilling our individual and collective transformation and ascension missions. 
And remember we are already in the energy of 2017, the switch began in September so you don’t have to wait until January for your joyful new beginnings and fresh starts, you can put that into action right now. Ready, set, and let’s soar into our new 5D paradigms, it’s all set to go. And get in the driver’s seat, you are not a passenger in these new paradigms. Plus, being the driver means you control the speed and how fast you get to your destination. Time to put the ‘pedal to the metal’ and put all of our learning into action. Have a wonderful month.

25418,Matt Lauer Loses the War in a Battle Between the Candidates - The New York Times,"The NBC presidential forum on Wednesday night in Manhattan brought together the candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump to try to determine who has the strength, preparation and presence of mind to lead during a time of crisis. It sure wasn’t Matt Lauer. In an event aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid, the “Today” host was lost at sea. Seemingly unprepared on military and foreign policy specifics, he performed like a soldier sent on a mission without ammunition, beginning with a disorganized offensive, ending in a humiliating retreat. Mr. Lauer interviewed the candidates in turn for a   each. He began by asking Mrs. Clinton to defend her use of a private email server as secretary of state. And asking again. And again. Roughly a third of his questioning dealt with the emails  —   a matter certainly connected to national security, but also a staple issue of this year’s   reporting. It suggested, as the rest of the forum confirmed, that Mr. Lauer was steadiest handling issues familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the morning politics headlines. That emphasis left relatively little time for the forum’s   and military subjects. Mr. Lauer and the audience asked about complex topics  —   the Middle East, terrorism, veterans’ affairs  —   and Mr. Lauer pressed for simple answers. “As briefly as you can,” he injected when an audience member asked how Mrs. Clinton would decide whether to deploy troops against the Islamic State. There’s a difference between an interviewer who has questions and one who has knowledge, and Mr. Lauer illustrated it. He seemed to be plowing through a checklist, not listening in the moment in a way that led to productive  . Short on time, he repeatedly interrupted Mrs. Clinton in a way he didn’t with Mr. Trump. (“Let me finish,” she protested at one point.) Candidates should expect to be challenged. They’re applying for a challenging job. But where Mr. Lauer treated Mrs. Clinton like someone running for president, he treated Mr. Trump like someone running to figure out how to be president, eventually. That interview was the apotheosis of this presidential campaign’s forced marriage of entertainment and news. The host of NBC’s morning show interviewed the former star of its reality show “The Apprentice,” and the whole thing played out as farce. Like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has had a few controversies related to the military. You might recall him feuding with a Gold Star family, or mocking Senator John McCain of Arizona for being captured in Vietnam, or likening his   attendance to military experience. Mr. Lauer evidently didn’t recall any of that. He kicked off by asking Mr. Trump what in his life had prepared him to be president, the kind of whiffle ball   question you ask the boss’s nephew you know you have to hire anyway. Mr. Lauer did press the Republican candidate on his claims of a “secret plan” to defeat the Islamic State and his repeated praise of Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia, leading Mr. Trump to cite the Russian authoritarian’s poll numbers and compare him favorably with President Obama. In general, though, Mr. Lauer’s questioning of Mr. Trump was like watching one student quiz another to prep for a test neither had done the reading for. The host asked soft   questions that invited the candidate to answer with word clouds. Mr. Lauer prefaced one question by saying that “nobody would expect you” to have read deeply into foreign policy before running for president. He asked Mr. Trump if he would be “prepared on Day 1,” a    question that will elicit only one answer from any candidate not about to drop out. Most egregiously, Mr. Lauer allowed Mr. Trump to repeat, unchallenged, the false claim that he had opposed the war in Iraq when, as reported by BuzzFeed, he supported the invasion on record in 2002. Any minimally prepared interviewer would have been ready for that claim, even if Mrs. Clinton had not earlier rebutted it in front of Mr. Lauer’s face. NBC News has a vast staff of anchors and reporters. Why turn over the grilling to a guy who had a hard enough time questioning Ryan Lochte? Giving a showcase to your top morning host works only if you’re showcasing something the host does well. Maybe the thinking was that Mr. Lauer would have sufficient training wheels in a format that wasn’t a debate. In fact, he asked each candidate not to attack the other in answers, an absurd request that neither one followed anyway. (Though again, Mr. Lauer criticized only Mrs. Clinton for it.) But the forum was a sort of introductory skirmish before the debates. It gave the candidates a chance to practice, to scout each other  —   and above all, to test the current news media waters, to see how willing a network anchor is to challenge and correct. Mr. Lauer, fortunately, is not going to moderate a presidential debate. But Fox News’s Chris Wallace is, and he recently said that he did not consider it his job to   candidates as a moderator. Let’s not mistake who this helps most: the   website PolitiFact has found far more false statements from Mr. Trump than from Mrs. Clinton. Why would a journalist be allergic to verifying the truth? On an MSNBC panel, Chris Matthews guessed that Mr. Lauer didn’t correct Mr. Trump on Iraq because of perceptions. “You have to call the guy a liar when you do that,” he said. “That’s the difficult thing for a Matt Lauer to do, because it sounds like an opinion. ” But it’s not. When a candidate says he didn’t say something that he did, that’s a matter of fact. Here’s what an opinion looks like: It’s a travesty to be steamrollered by a candidate because you’re worried that doing your job will look bad. To put it in military terms, weakness is an invitation to attack. Going into the debates, what we saw at NBC’s forum should make you very, very worried about our first line of defense.",1
25419,"Jailed by Egypt, Honored for His Photojournalism - The New York Times","Photographs capture mere fractions of seconds, but a series of them taken by an Egyptian journalist has cost him more than three years of his life. Mahmoud Abou Zeid, known as Shawkan, has been in Tora Prison in Cairo for more than 1, 100 days. He has been detained without trial since he was arrested while photographing the deadly antigovernment protests that roiled Egypt in the summer of 2013. “My passion is photography, but I am paying the price for my passion with my life. Without it, a part of me is missing,” Mr. Abou Zeid wrote in a letter published by the Committee to Protect Journalists in March 2015 to mark his 600th day in detention. “Tora prison is like a cemetery. It is a place where dreams come to die. ” On Tuesday, the committee honored Mr. Abou Zeid with an International Press Freedom Award, presented in New York  —   in absentia. The group started a   campaign, asking supporters who attended its annual gala to photograph themselves holding a placard saying #FreeShawkan and post it to Twitter. Among the journalists who posted selfies at the event was Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post. Since President Abdel Fattah   took power more than three years ago, he has been criticized for cracking down on the press. The Committee to Protect Journalists recorded the imprisonment of 23 journalists in Egypt in 2015, second only to China. Mr. Abou Zeid’s mother, Reda Aly, who visits him in prison once a week, said of the award: “I am looking forward to talking to him about it, because I know he will be happy and he deserves it. ” Mr. Abou Zeid, 29, was arrested with two other journalists, one from France and one from the United States, on Aug. 14, 2013. He was covering clashes between the military and supporters of Mohamed Morsi, the Islamist who had been ousted as Egypt’s president a month before. Hundreds of protesters were also arrested, and more than 1, 000 people were killed, including four journalists, according to Human Rights Watch. The foreign reporters were quickly freed, but Mr. Abou Zeid  —   who was on assignment for Demotix, a British website and photo agency  —   was charged with weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder. Such charges have since been regularly levied against protesters and political opponents of Mr. Sisi’s government. Mike Giglio, the American journalist who was detained at the same time as Mr. Abou Zeid and who works for BuzzFeed, has written that he saw the Egyptian carrying only his camera before his arrest. A freelancer who made his living on the streets of Cairo studying the subtleties of light, Mr. Abou Zeid has been kept in a small, dark cell with more than a dozen other inmates since his arrest, his family said. He tested positive for hepatitis C before his arrest, and his lawyer says he has been denied treatment. “He is severely anemic and looks skeletal,” said his father, Abdel Shakoor Abou Zeid. Mahmoud Abou Zeid is an Egyptian citizen who grew up in Kuwait, where his parents worked as teachers. He moved back to Cairo in 2009 to study and practice journalism. The timing was fortuitous: Within less than two years, he was at the epicenter of months of upheaval that toppled leaders across the region, including President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. “Photography was always his passion and his hobby,” said Ahmed Abu Seif, a childhood friend who now runs a Facebook campaign called Freedom for Shawkan. “Since the Nokia mobile phone with the camera, he was always really into photography, Mr. Abu Seif added. “He was not a political or a religious person,” Mr. Abu Seif said. “He was there just to do his job. ” Ms. Aly, his mother, brings him   food on her weekly visits, and sometimes slips into the package a piece of fresh fruit, like a mango, which she said was not allowed. “I only get to see him for one hour once a week, and there are always officers coming and going,” she said. Sometimes, she said, the prison guards allow her to slip her son bits of chocolate: “The boy just loves chocolate. ”",1
25421,North Carolina Republicans Sued For Rigging the Election For Trump,"By Rmuse   10:00 am The voter suppression tactic is right out of the GOP [election rigging] playbook to suppress the Black vote in North Carolina.”   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Some Americans are likely aware of the psychological term “projecting” that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else; as an ‘unconscious’ form of transferring guilt for one’s own actions. As soon as the Republican primaries concluded, Donald Trump projected Republicans’ guilt for election rigging, either through vote obstruction or suppression, onto Democrats and his opponent Hillary Clinton. Republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of Barack Obama in 2008, and they have only ramped up their ‘ election rigging’ activities over the past eight years; and yet Trump accuses Democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath. 
Yesterday, the North Carolina conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a lawsuit against North Carolina Republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the “ coordinated effort to suppress the Black vote in the state .” What the NAACP rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was “ right out of the GOP [election rigging] playbook to suppress the Black vote in the state. ” 
The election rigging amounts to three counties in North Carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of, mostly African American, Democratic residents a week before the presidential election. The lawsuit charged election officials in Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland counties of denying primarily African American voters’ eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were “ bounced back as undeliverable. ” 
Most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging, such as James Edward Arthur Sr. had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots. Many of the purged voters lived at their “ original registration address ” and were victims of a “ simple postal service error. ” 
Mr. Arthur is an African American who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last 14 elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue. Arthur testified that he, like thousands of other African American Democratic voters, never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied, or that if he didn’t attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy. Mr. Arthur said, 
“ If I knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, I would do whatever I could to protect it. I want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but I am concerned that since my registration has been canceled I will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted .” 
It is what any sane human being would consider “ election rigging ” simply because the tri-county ploy targeted primarily African Americans who typically vote for Democrats. It is also something North Carolina Republicans have been guilty of for the past six years. 
According to the NAACP lawsuit, North Carolina Republicans are in violation of the National Voter Registration Act which “ bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final 90 days before an election .” Republican election officials State officials defended their “ election rigging ” and said they were justified in “ purging tens-of-thousands ” of mainly African American Democratic voters’ eligibility, the definition of systemic, on an individual basis. 
However, the NAACP also accused Republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly African American voters’ eligibility who did not receive the mailing. One Republican who ran for a local office last year, Shane Hubers, challenged the registration of voters, the majority who are them Democrats,  in Beaufort County. 
In one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit, Cumberland County, one “ individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of 3,951 mostly Democratic voters .” In Moore County, the secretary of the local Republican Party, N. Carol Wheeldon, challenged approximately 400 mainly African American registered voters; likely because they do not vote for Republicans. 
The lead attorney for the NAACP’s lawsuit, Penda Hair, said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted Republican “ election rigging ” conspiracy; 
“ We know that in two of the counties, the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local Republican Party. We also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties .” Ms. Hair also noted that, “ in Moore County the return address of a right-wing group called the Voter Integrity Project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters. This is a very pernicious treatment of voters ,” she said. It is also a deliberate act of “ election rigging ” by Republicans. 
The president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend Dr. William Barber said, 
“ We are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in North Carolina that we’ve seen since the days of Jim Crow. The Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters. These attempts are a direct affront to our Constitution .” 
The NAACP lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since 2012 using this “election rigging ” process back on the rolls immediately. The organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters, and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on Election Day. They have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case. 
It might be the case that the NAACP’s request for a hearing may be granted; especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that North Carolina Republicans violated the National Voter Registration Act in yet another manner; failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a DMV office over the past few years. 
Last Thursday U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs ordered North Carolina Republicans to permit those tens-of-thousands of voters to cast provisional ballots. It is highly doubtful that North Carolina Republicans will obey the Federal Judge’s orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their “election rigging” actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the Republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters. 
Republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the American people first elected Barack Obama as President, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with Republicans to suppress, or obstruct, the voting rights of primarily people of color because they don’t support Republicans. To be perfectly clear, it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression, obstruction, or disenfranchisement; it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections. And it is only Republicans and the Koch brothers’ outfit the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), who are behind each and every attempt in Republican-controlled states to kill democracy by doing what the Republican Party standard bearer Donald Trump is guilty of projecting; rig elections.",1
25423,F.B.I. Says It Needs Hackers to Keep Up With Tech Companies - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. defended its hiring of a third party to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in last year’s San Bernardino, Calif. mass shooting, telling some skeptical lawmakers on Tuesday that it needed to join with partners in the rarefied world of   hackers as technology companies increasingly resist their demands for consumer information. Amy Hess, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s executive assistant director for science and technology, made the comments at a hearing by members of Congress who are debating potential legislation on encryption. The lawmakers gathered law enforcement authorities and Silicon Valley company executives to discuss the issue, which has divided technology companies and officials in recent months and spurred a debate over privacy and security. The hearing follows a recent standoff between the F. B. I. and Apple over a court order to force the company to help unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple opposed the order, citing harm to the privacy of its users. The F. B. I. later dropped its demand for Apple’s help when it found a   alternative to hack the device. Yet that has done little to quell the controversy. The encryption debate has continued with new hearings, proposed legislation and other cases that involve locked iPhones and law enforcement demands that the devices be opened to aid investigations. In Tuesday’s hearing, Ms. Hess did not provide details on how the F. B. I. ultimately gained access to the San Bernardino iPhone but said the agency had come to rely on private sector partners to keep up with changes in technology. She said that there was no   solution and that the agency generally should not use third parties to hack into systems but lacks the expertise to break past encryption. “These types of solutions that we may employ require a lot of highly skilled, specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us,” Ms. Hess said. The focus on third parties at the hearing illustrates a growing discomfort by some in Congress and in the tech industry with the use of “gray hat” hackers, who are hackers who may push the boundaries of the law and anger companies but whose intentions are not malicious. “I don’t think relying on a third party is a good model,” said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado. She questioned if the use of   hackers was ethical and whether it could open up greater security risks because sensitive and valuable data could be accessible to outside groups. Ms. Hess did not answer directly when asked about whether there were ethical issues in using   hackers but said the bureau needed to review its operation “to make sure that we identify the risks and benefits. ” The F. B. I. has been unwilling to say whom it paid to demonstrate a way around the iPhone’s internal defenses, or how much, and it has not shown Apple the technique. Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said at the hearing that encryption did not prevent the authorities from solving crimes. “As you heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information to them,” Mr. Sewell said. “But technologists and national security experts don’t see the world that way. We see a   world that seems to be full of information. Information that law enforcement can use to solve  —   and prevent  —   crimes. ” Mr. Sewell also defended Apple’s security practices, saying the company always aimed to keep its devices safe from prying eyes. Within the last two years, he said, the Chinese government has requested Apple’s source code but the company has refused to hand it over. In a public report on Monday, the company said American law enforcement officials made 4, 000 requests for customer data covering more than 16, 000 devices in the second half of last year. Law enforcement officials testifying before the committee on Tuesday expressed frustration over their inability to run a number of cases to ground  —   particularly sex abuse and child pornography cases  —   because of encrypted phones. They said the recent publicity over the issue could end up helping criminals. “Make no mistake  —   criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it,” said Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. The F. B. I. said there has been an increase in the number of devices it has acquired through investigations but was unable to gain access to because of encryption. Ms. Hess said that since October, 13 percent of the devices obtained by the F. B. I. were impenetrable by the agency. When asked at Tuesday’s hearing if the relationship between the tech industry and law enforcement had become adversarial, Ms. Hess responded, “I hope not. ” The encryption debate is continuing in other quarters. Apple is fighting an order in a federal court in New York  to provide access to a phone involved in a criminal drug investigation. And last week, Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, released a draft version of a bill that would require tech companies to decrypt data if requested by a court. Tech companies, which have largely banded together in support of Apple’s   position, are lobbying against the draft bill. Timed to the Tuesday hearing, trade groups representing top technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft sent a letter to Senators Burr and Feinstein, opposing their bill. “We believe it is critical to the safety of the nation’s, and the world’s, information technology infrastructure for us all to avoid actions that will create   security vulnerabilities in our encryption systems,” the groups, which include the Reform Government Surveillance and Computer and Communications Industry Association, said. “Any mandatory decryption requirement, such as that included in the discussion draft of the bill that you authored, will to lead to unintended consequences. ” Michael Petricone, senior vice president for government affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, added, “This is urgent because the one thing you don’t want is Congress coming in a   fashion and doing something with all sorts of negative consequences, which is what we may be seeing happen now. ” City and state law enforcement officials support the Senate draft bill, but it faces strong opposition from many in Congress. President Obama has done little to assuage concerns by the tech industry. In a speech in March, the president warned against “fetishizing” encryption and urged more compromise between tech companies and the F. B. I.",1
25425,Victims Seek Mercy for a Wall St. Scion Who Defrauded Them - The New York Times,"Some of the people that Andrew Caspersen bilked out of millions of dollars are asking a federal judge to show mercy on the   scion of a   Wall Street family. In letters to the judge, Mr. Caspersen’s mother, friends and former colleagues on Wall Street paint a picture of a modest man who had a “firm grasp of the ‘right’ thing to do. ” Even his wedding photographer and the doorman in the Upper East Side apartment building where Mr. Caspersen lives wrote in support. Their depictions are at odds with the government’s, which has detailed how Mr. Caspersen ran a   scheme to steal nearly $40 million, only to lose it all in   bets on the stock market. He pleaded guilty to one charge of security fraud and one charge of wire fraud in July. The most important letter of all, however, may be one from Dr. Marc N. Potenza, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine, who called Mr. Caspersen’s “severe gambling” a mental illness. The lawyer for Mr. Caspersen contends that it was an extreme compulsion to trade stock options that drove his client with an Ivy League pedigree to lie and steal from his friends, family and a hedge fund foundation. In an unusual departure from the typical   sentencing, Judge Jed S. Rakoff has agreed to hear testimony from Dr. Potenza on what constitutes a gambling addiction before imposing a sentence on the    Mr. Caspersen. Judge Rakoff is set to sentence Mr. Caspersen at the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday. It is not known whether federal prosecutors in Manhattan will call any witnesses of their own or simply look to   Dr. Potenza. The testimony could be critical to Mr. Caspersen’s attempt to persuade Judge Rakoff to impose a more lenient sentence than the more than 15 years in prison that federal prosecutors have said is appropriate. Mr. Caspersen was arrested in March at La Guardia Airport in New York as he was returning from a family vacation to Florida. He pleaded guilty in July, telling Judge Rakoff he was “ashamed for my crimes” and for causing harm to people close to him. Shortly before the arrest, Mr. Caspersen drafted a suicide note to his wife and a “letter to his ‘creditors,’” in which he said he was “deeply ashamed” and said he had “engaged in an ‘outright fraud,’” his lawyer said in a court filing. The suicide note was an eerie reminder of his father, Finn M. W. Caspersen, who killed himself in 2009 while battling cancer. The elder Mr. Caspersen made his fortune running what used to be known as Beneficial Finance and later gave a good deal of money to Harvard Law School. The elder Mr. Caspersen and all of his sons, including Andrew Caspersen, attended Harvard Law. Andrew Caspersen’s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, has likened his client’s urges to trade tens of millions of dollars worth of stock options as an addiction no less gripping than one to alcohol or drugs. Although such addictive behavior does not excuse Mr. Caspersen’s conduct, he said, it is a mitigating circumstance that Judge Rakoff should take into consideration. “He never intended for them to lose, yet he could not stop,” Mr. Shechtman said in a filing accompanying the letters from Dr. Potenza and other associates of Mr. Caspersen. Mr. Shechtman has said that his client has undergone treatment since his arrest. The lawyer’s call for leniency has not moved prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan. They are asking Judge Rakoff to impose a stiff sentence that is within the range established by federal sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors, in their own court filing, are taking a tougher position than the probation department for the federal courts, which has recommended a sentence of seven years. Some federal judges have expressed frustration with the guidelines because they potentially hamstring jurists and do not take into account mitigating circumstances. One such critic has been Judge Rakoff, who called the guidelines “irrational” in July, when Mr. Caspersen pleaded guilty. But not all of Mr. Caspersen’s more than a dozen victims have submitted letters of support. Notably, Mr. Shechtman’s filing did not include a letter from Louis Bacon, the billionaire hedge fund manager, whose foundation had given nearly $25 million to Mr. Caspersen. Mr. Caspersen’s tale has confounded Wall Street, where he was known and liked, blending in with many of his associates who came from   backgrounds. In many ways, his privileged background (he attended Groton and Princeton before Harvard) helped him to keep up a scheme for years before anyone noticed. The stock trading addiction began at Princeton, Mr. Shechtman said, but was amplified by a $2. 7 million distribution that Mr. Caspersen received from a family trust in 1999, when he was at Harvard. Over the following years Mr. Caspersen received another distribution, which he lost as well. Soon, he turned to friends and family for investments, getting a million dollars here, several million dollars there. Money came easily from his network, and for years, he papered over the losses by bringing in new money. As recently as February, Mr. Caspersen  —   who was at that point a successful executive working at the Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners  —   made so much money trading stock options that he could have paid back everyone and still had as much as $60 million left for himself. Instead, he continued to trade, losing it all. Mr. Caspersen kept his compulsive stock trading from friends and families. He even persuaded his wife that they should file separate tax returns, largely to keep his frequent trading a secret, according to court filings. But Mr. Caspersen’s facade began to unravel this year. A former Wall Street options trader who reviewed Mr. Caspersen’s trading records at Mr. Shechtman’s request said the option trading “lacked rationality. ” “If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results,” said Bruce Rosen, a former managing director at Tiger Ventures Capital, “then Mr. Caspersen’s options trading was not that of a sane person. ” Still, Mr. Caspersen has his defenders. “Andrew has always treated me with respect,” wrote John Colby, a doorman at the Manhattan apartment building where Mr. Caspersen lives with his wife and their two children. Mr. Colby described how during a shift on Thanksgiving several years ago, Mr. Caspersen and his wife brought Mr. Colby Thanksgiving dinner “on a real plate, with a real glass and napkin and silverware,” adding that the gesture was “very touching to me. ”",1
25432,"In College Roommate David Panton, Ted Cruz Finds Unwavering Support - The New York Times","On a break during a business trip to Washington last year, David Panton hailed a cab to take him to the Capitol. He told the driver he was going to see the Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz. “He’s racist,” the cabdriver replied, according to Mr. Panton. Mr. Panton, taken aback, informed his driver that Mr. Cruz had a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the right side of his desk, that he was the only senator to attend the funeral of Nelson Mandela and that he had a “black guy” as a college roommate and best man at his wedding. “I don’t believe that,” the cabby said, as Mr. Panton tells it. “Well,” Mr. Panton replied, “you’re talking to him. ” Everyone seems to have an opinion of Mr. Cruz, and usually it is not a good one. He has repeatedly come under attack from Donald J. Trump and other rivals as being eminently unlikable, having antagonized even members of his own party. Hillary Clinton joined that chorus this month when she described Mr. Cruz as a “meanspirited guy. ” The New York primary last week, in which he finished a distant third, may have been the low point in his   struggle with popularity. But through it all, he could depend on Mr. Panton  —   his former roommate, debate teammate, business partner and political booster  —   as a source of unconditional support, the guy who extends a hand when the whole world seems to offer a  . “The media has caricatured Ted as this     guy,” Mr. Panton, 44, said with some irritation in an interview during his business trip to Washington last fall. “Ted is principled, but he is actually a good guy and was a great friend to me. ” Their friendship dates back to their freshman year at Princeton. Indeed, college contemporaries considered Mr. Panton, a native of Jamaica, to be the more likely of the two to run a nation. But he become better known back home for   romances with beauty queens than for his leadership qualities. At first, Mr. Cruz’s freshman roommate at Princeton was Craig Mazin, a screenwriter who has provided a stream of   insults about the candidate’s personality. (“He wrote ‘The Hangover III,’” Mr. Panton said archly of Mr. Mazin.) But midway through freshman year, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Panton, who enrolled in Princeton at age 16, moved in together. “Ted and I just hit it off,” Mr. Panton said, adding that his friend schooled him on conservative politics. “Ted was very kind to me he took an interest in what I was doing in my life and in my background. ” They both picked subjects for their senior theses while still freshmen. Mr. Cruz wrote about the Constitution’s Ninth and 10th Amendments, Mr. Panton about a Jamaican politician. They were best known around campus, and beyond, as debate partners. When Mr. Cruz was elected president of the Clio, or conservative side, of the American   Society, the umbrella group for all of the school’s debating activities, Mr. Panton was his whip. Mr. Panton continued on to be a Rhodes scholar at Oxford and joined Mr. Cruz at Harvard Law School, where Mr. Panton, like Barack Obama before him, became president of the Harvard Law Review. Former debate team members said Mr. Panton used to duck out of pictures if he determined them to be potentially damaging to his chances of becoming prime minister of Jamaica. Born to a prominent businessman turned Anglican priest in the Jamaican town Mandeville, Mr. Panton had connections to and a familiarity with the island’s political elite, including the former prime minister of the conservative Jamaica Labour Party. He returned to Jamaica as a businessman after his studies and in 1998   with Mr. Cruz a fund that was created to draw investments for Caribbean ventures. Mr. Cruz put $6, 000 into the firm, and ultimately left with $25, 000 in cash and a $75, 000 promissory note from Mr. Panton that Mr. Cruz had never cashed in. In 2013, Time magazine revealed the venture and noted that Mr. Cruz had failed to disclose the profit on two years of Senate ethics forms. Mr. Cruz called it an oversight. Days before the Iowa caucuses this year, The Washington Post published an unflattering report on the   Caribbean investment fund Mr. Panton founded with Mr. Cruz. Mr. Panton was mortified that the article would do harm to his friend, according to a person who discussed the matter with him but declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the campaign. A year after Mr. Cruz and Mr. Panton went into business, Mr. Panton married Lisa Hanna, a former Miss Jamaica and Miss World who is now a member of Jamaica’s Parliament, in a New York ceremony during which Mr. Cruz gave the toast. Mr. Panton soon made the move to politics, leading a youth wing of the Jamaica Labour Party, which Mr. Cruz addressed in 2001, and taking a seat in the country’s Senate. That year, he and Ms. Hanna had a child Mr. Cruz was named godfather. But then things stopped going so well for Mr. Panton. In 2004, he and his wife moved to Atlanta, where they divorced months later, touching off an international custody battle that became tabloid fodder in Jamaica. There was more sensational coverage to come. In 2006, Wendy Fitzwilliam, a former Miss Universe from Trinidad, caused a media storm when, unmarried, she announced her pregnancy by Mr. Panton to an audience of teenage girls at Corpus Christi College, a Catholic school in Trinidad. The couple split up and, in 2009, she published a   book, “Letters to Ailan”  —   the name of her son with Mr. Panton  —   that offered an at times unflattering portrait of Mr. Panton. In 2012, she and others who had formed BQ Girls, a   musical group, sang and danced to their big song “Runway” for Mr. Trump, who then owned the Miss Universe franchise, in his Trump Tower office. “He was tickled pink to see Wendy,” said A. ’u2009T. Dunn, the group’s manager. “He asked her about Trinidad and asked her about her son. He knew about her son. ” By then, Mr. Panton had established himself in the private equity business in Atlanta where he is the chairman of the Jamaican Chamber of Commerce of Atlanta. Behind the scenes, Mr. Panton set up one of the first “super PACs” supporting Mr. Cruz’s campaign, donating $100, 000 to it, though it has been eclipsed by much larger ones. Since disassociating himself from the super PAC, Mr. Panton has aided his old debate partner by critiquing his performance at debate preparations, according to the person who has spoken with him. Mr. Panton also urged Mr. Cruz, with whom he remains in regular contact, to relate more emotional stories about his upbringing and his late half sister’s battle with drugs. Mr. Panton and Mr. Cruz declined to speak in further depth last week about their friendship. But back in Jamaica, that friendship has at least created a reflected glory for Mr. Panton that many once expected to shine directly onto him. “Now a major playmaker in his friend’s quest for the White House” The Jamaica Observer wrote last year, for Mr. Panton “the possibility now exists that one of Jamaica’s brightest sons could be a close friend to the most powerful human being on earth. ”",1
25434,Trump’s Vow to Repeal Health Law Revives Talk of High-Risk Pools - The New York Times,"Joanne Fitzgerald was getting divorced and was stressed out. When stomach pain kicked in, she saw a doctor to have it checked out. That was her mistake. The doctor diagnosed a mild form of gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining, and recommended some    medicine. But when the divorce became final, in 2008, she lost health coverage from her husband’s employer, and insurer after insurer refused to cover her because of the condition. She was finally offered a policy that excluded coverage for anything related to her gastrointestinal tract. “I thought I was being smart in going to the doctor and getting checked out,” Ms. Fitzgerald, 55, who currently lives in Washington, D. C. said recently. “Then I tried to go get insurance and everyone denied me. ” Her fortunes changed under the Affordable Care Act, the major health law signed by President Barack Obama that required insurers to cover   medical conditions. She was one of the millions of people who jumped at the opportunity and bought a policy available under the new law. Now, after President Trump and the   Congress have vowed to repeal and replace the health law, one of the most vexing questions is whether people like Ms. Fitzgerald will be covered. About 27 percent of people under 65 are thought to have some sort of   condition that will most likely leave them without individual insurance if the law is repealed, according to a recent study. The guarantee of coverage has already become a rallying cry for people who want to keep the law. The issue “is the third rail” for the Republicans, said Michael Turpin, a longtime health industry executive. Before the law, a fairly typical life event  —   like a divorce or the loss of a job  —   and a relatively minor medical condition could upend a person’s health coverage options. Stories of sick people unable to get coverage when they needed it most were legion. Mr. Trump insists he wants to keep the   requirement for insurers, and other top Republicans say people who want coverage should not be turned away. Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged, but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea  —   known as   pools  —   that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past. The challenge for lawmakers is this: How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care  —   and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone? The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty. That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance, distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population. The thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up, the costs of sick people will be offset for insurers. Top Republicans, though, say the system is not working and point to   price increases for premiums. “There is a better way to fix that problem without giving everybody else all these massive premium increases,” the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said at a recent televised forum. Finding a fix is far from simple. Before the law was passed, insurance companies evaluated the health of each person applying for coverage before offering a policy, and priced the plan to reflect the possible cost of care. The companies wanted to minimize the risk of losing money by paying for costly medical care for too many of their customers. Often, insurers offered no options to people with   conditions, because they considered the potential costs to be too high. As a result, 35 states had   pools, the program again on the lips of top lawmakers, including Mr. Ryan. The   programs offered a separate insurance pool for people with potentially expensive medical conditions. The idea is that by separating sick people from the majority of people who are healthy, insurers could offer cheaper rates to the healthy people. Insurers could charge higher prices to those with existing medical conditions, but they would also rely on other sources of funding, including from the government, to cover their costs. The system worked for Dan Nassimbene and his wife, who had breast cancer but is in remission. They enrolled in Colorado’s   pool for three years. She paid about $375 a month for a plan that covered most of her treatments. In 2014, though, the   pool was closed, and Mr. Nassimbene bought a plan that met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The cheapest plan he could buy for himself and his wife cost around $900 a month and came with a family deductible of around $12, 000, much higher than it was before. His income was too high for him to receive any government subsidies, which help about 80 percent of people buying such plans. “I had coverage but no access,” said Mr. Nassimbene, 55. He has since switched to a Christian health care sharing ministry, in which members cover one another’s medical bills. It does not qualify as coverage under the law. In many cases, the   pools were overburdened financially, leaving many people without insurance or with tight restrictions on coverage. Insurers refused to cover the individuals who were likely to have the highest expenses, like those who had H. I. V. or serious kidney disease, and the pools lost money. Many states had to turn applicants away  —   in some states, only a small percentage of those who applied received coverage  —   and the insurance was sharply limited to control spending. In Washington, over 80 percent of the people referred to the state’s   pool never got health insurance, said Mike Kreidler, the state’s insurance commissioner. In California, which relied on lawmakers to allocate money as part of the state budget, there was a waiting list, recalled Richard Figueroa, who was a senior administrator for the program. The pool operated on a     basis, Mr. Figueroa said, without regard to people’s income or the severity of their medical condition. “There were people literally dying on the waiting list,” he said. In addition, most of the states offering coverage had caps on payments for medical care. Washington’s annual maximum was $2 million, while California’s limit was $75, 000 a year. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans cannot have such a limit. In California, the program dwindled away until it served only 6, 300 at the end of 2011. Dennis Carr, for example, worked as an independent real estate agent when the financial markets crashed in 2008. He had savings, but he eventually had to drop his Blue Cross plan because his income had tailed off and he could not afford it. Mr. Carr, who is now 51, said his goal was to resume coverage as soon as he was financially secure. When he reapplied to the same insurer a few months later, he was rejected  —   and then rejected again by another insurer because of his asthma and a sinus condition. “It was just a real, real slap,” Mr. Carr said. He was directed to California’s   pool but found the premiums too high. He moved to Mexico as a way to afford his medications. He now lives in Phoenix, where he has coverage through an employer. “For all the thousands of people who   out because they couldn’t afford it, it broke our hearts on a daily basis,” Mr. Figueroa, the California official, said. For others, the coverage offered by the   pools was too limited for them to receive the care they needed. Beth Martinez, 40, who has multiple sclerosis, was forced to join Texas’   pool when she and her husband moved to Austin. Only six visits to the doctor were covered, and she found she could not afford the annual M. R. I. recommended to monitor her disease because of her high deductible. At one point, she said, she went four years without an M. R. I. She and her husband now live in California and are covered through private plans offered through that state’s marketplace, which meet all the health law’s requirements for   conditions. Because she can work only part time, she is eligible for federal subsidies, which bring the couple’s costs to $70 a month. Ms. Martinez had paid $275 a month in the Texas pool to cover herself, and her husband was uninsured. She now gets the M. R. I.s she needs under her plan, and her policy even pays for physical therapy, which allows her to put in longer hours at her job as a hairstylist and makeup artist. That sort of quality coverage, Ms. Martinez said, is a big departure from what she had through the   pool, adding that “it was definitely some of the worst insurance I had in my life. ”",1
25435,"About Time! CNN Fires Donna Brazile for Rigging Debates, Giving Hillary Questions in Advance","Email 
CNN made it official Monday, firing commentator Donna Brazile (shown) for giving Hillary Clinton questions in advance of debates with Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries. The avidly pro-Clinton network was virtually forced to sever ties with Brazile by the new revelations from the latest WikiLeaks dump of John Podesta’s hacked e-mails. Podesta, the longtime adviser/crony/fixer for Bill and Hillary Clinton, and currently chairman of Hillary’s election campaign, has now seen over 39,000 of his e-mails released by the WikiLeaks hacktivists, and they have been very revealing indeed, exposing the corruption, dirty tricks, and criminality of the Clinton political machine . 
Brazile, a veteran Democratic Party hack, has been serving as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) since July, when then-DNC chair Rep. Deborah Wasserman Schultz, was forced to resign in an e-mail scandal that exposed Wasserman Schultz and other DNC officials blatantly taking sides with Clinton and sabotaging Sanders, in violation of DNC rules to maintain neutrality in primary campaigns. 
As the Podesta e-mails reveal, Brazile was involved in those same ethics violations, extending to violating the rules for the televised debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), which sponsored the debates, states on its website : “All debates will be moderated by a single individual and will run from 9:00-10:30 p.m. Eastern Time without commercial breaks. As always, the moderators alone will select the questions to be asked, which are not known to the CPD or to the candidates.” 
However, that obviously was not the case, as Brazile was providing Team Clinton with a heads-up of debate questions in advance. The first Brazile e-mail to leak out concerned the televised CNN-TV One Town Hall event on March 13 of this year. The day before, Brazile sent an e-mail to Clinton’s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri, saying she’s worried about “HRC” (Hillary Rodham Clinton) facing a question on the death penalty. The subject heading of her e-mail was: “Re: From time to time I get the questions in advance.” 
Here is the e-mail, as provided by WikiLeaks: On Mar 12, 2016, at 4:39 PM, Donna Brazile <   >; wrote: Here's one that worries me about HRC. DEATH PENALTY 19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty? Sent from Donna's I Pad. Follow me on twitter @donnabrazile 
The following day, on the CNN-TV One Town Hall, co-moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper and TV One’s Roland Martin, Hillary Rodham Clinton was indeed asked a question about the death penalty, by audience member Ricky Jackson — and HRC had a scripted answer ready and waiting. We, the public, did not find out that the game had been rigged until months later, when WikiLeaks released the incriminating e-mail on October 11. Nevertheless, even after the WikiLeaks release, most of the establishment media ignored the Brazile-Podesta-Palmieri skullduggery in favor of bashing Donald Trump over unsubstantiated, sensationalistic charges of sexual harassment. For nearly two weeks, Donna Brazile was allowed to wave off the e-mail evidence with diversionary tactics and charges that the e-mails are fabrications by WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence. 
However, on October 20 Brazile was skewered on Fox News by a relentless Megyn Kelly, who refused to let her weasel her way through another interview. Not that the DNC chair didn’t try; Brazile kept going to script, using every diversion she could muster to avoid answering the direct, careful questions put to her by the Fox anchor. 
She tried the Christian/persecution diversion: “As a Christian woman I understand persecution, but I will not sit here and be persecuted,” Brazile told Megyn Kelly. 
She tried the “poisoned fruit” diversion: “Podesta’s emails were stolen. You’re so interested in talking about stolen material, you’re like a thief that wanna bring into the night the things that are in the gutter.” 
She tried the motor-mouth/repetition diversion, the total innocence diversion, and much more. 
It was still more of the same patently absurd denial and rehearsed propaganda by Brazile when Kelly confronted her with the undercover video stings of top Democratic dirty tricks operatives Scott Foval and Bob Creamer, who were caught red-handed boasting of rigging elections and admitting to inciting violence at Trump rallies . 
Incredibly, Brazile insisted to Megyn Kelly that “I always play ‘straight up’ and I’m going to be ‘straight up’ with you.” However, it was painfully clear by the end of the Fox “interview” that “straight up” Donna Brazile is as weasely and deceitful as “Crooked Hillary.” 
It is noteworthy that during her Fox News interview, when Megyn Kelly repeatedly asked her where she got the advance debate questions, Brazile fatuously insisted that she had “never” received any questions from CNN. She continued repeating the same lines even when Kelly asked her directly if the questions had come not from CNN itself but from Roland Martin, the former CNN commentator who now works for TV One and co-moderated the Town Hall event. 
In the same e-mail thread of March 12 cited above, Brazile responded to a reply from Jennifer Palmieri. Brazile told Palmieri: “I'll send a few more [debate questions]. Though some questions Roland submitted.” That would seem to be a very solid “clue” that Roland Martin was the source and Brazile was the conduit to Podesta and the Clinton Campaign. 
Politico reporter Hadas Gold reported on October 12 that Politico had obtained an e-mail of March 12 from Roland Martin to CNN debate producers with the identical death penalty question that appeared in Brazile’s March 12 e-mail to Palmieri. What’s more, it was Roland Martin who introduced Ricky Jackson, the pre-selected, pre-scripted “audience” member who asked the rigged question about the death penalty. 
As Gold reports, Martin initially denied that he had shared his questions “with anybody.” However, after being confronted with the fact that Politico possessed e-mail evidence to the contrary, he began walking the denial back to more ambiguous ground. 
Media “Uncomfortable” but not Outraged — Deceit, Propaganda Continue 
In an October 13 interview, Jake Tapper said he has “tremendous regard” for Brazile, but said the WikiLeaks revelation was “very, very troubling.” “It’s horrifying,” the CNN anchor said. “Journalistically it’s horrifying, and I’m sure it will have an impact on [CNN] partnering with this organization [TV One] in the future.” 
The following day, on October 14, CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas stated that CNN hadn’t given Brazile the debate questions in advance and announced Brazile had resigned from the network. “CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate,” Pratapas said in a written statement. “We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.” 
The October 30 WikiLeaks release contains another Brazile-DNC-Podesta debate revelation, concerning the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan, where Democrat Party operatives and their media allies have transformed lead poisoning into a false national issue with which to clobber Republicans. The Clinton-Sanders Democratic primary debate was hosted by CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper. (See the full debate here .) 
The event was held in Flint at Clinton’s request, as she herself pointed out during the course of the debate. A Brazile e-mail from March 5 of this year to Podesta and Palmieri, is entitled: “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.” 
“Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint” Brazile’s e-mail goes on to alert Hillary’s debate coaches. Sure enough, the lead poisoning question came up on cue, and HRC slammed in another easy homerun answer. 
Yes, many in the pro-Clinton media industry are “uncomfortable” with the WikiLeaks revelations, but, judging from their continued overwhelmingly slanted coverage, the discomfort comes from being exposed, not from being disgusted with the serial cheating and lying of the Clinton camp and their media allies. There has been precious little outrage expressed by the pro-Clinton mainstream media elites of the kind and volume that would have gushed forth if the same rigging had been perpetrated by the Trump Campaign. There have been no media-orchestrated calls for TV One to fire Roland Martin, nor for the DNC to fire Donna Brazile, nor for Hillary Clinton to fire John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri. 
The Brazile-Podesta-Palmieri debate e-mails are damning, but, arguably, not as serious as the many other revelations concerning the Clinton family’s rampant criminality on national security matters such as Uranium One, and the “pay-to-play” wheeling-dealing at the HRC State Department and the Clinton Foundation. However, the WikiLeaks e-mails released thus far have shown an alarming willingness and ability of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her DNC-Big Media allies to rig the election debates. And the ones we’ve seen may be only the tip of the iceberg. If this is the case in the primaries, are Donald Trump’s charges about rigging the November 8 election really all that outlandish, as the pro-Clinton media choir would have us believe?

25436,DONNELLY: How California DMV Could Settle the Question of Voter Fraud - Breitbart,"California AB 60 driver’s license holders  —   who are admittedly in the country illegally by virtue of applying for this class of license  —   are concerned that the Trump administration may use their AB 60 licenses to identify them for deportation, according to an AP story picked up by Oregon Live. [According to Jessica Gonzalez, spokeswoman for the Dept. of Motor Vehicles (DMV) illegal aliens in California have nothing to fear. She told the AP that although the department makes “databases available to   entities,” that information would not include the legal status of driver’s license holders.  In response to   questions from Breitbart News, Gonzalez may have inadvertently provided the Trump administration a way to get to the bottom of allegations of massive voter fraud. Breitbart News: When you state that “that although the department makes “databases available to law enforcement entities,” that information would not include the legal status of license holders,”  is that because DMV withholds that info. or doesn’t have it? Or is it because DMV treats the AB 60 Drivers license like every other driver’s license that once in the DMV database and there is no way to distinguish them? DMV Response:  AB 60 driver license information is kept in the same DMV database as every other driver license.  The fact that someone is an AB 60 driver license holder, isn’t available to law enforcement when they access a driver record. So the California DMV can internally differentiate within their database who holds an “illegal alien” AB60 license  —   which contradicts what is being pushed by   activist websites that have reassured illegal aliens that once the driver’s license is entered in the database, the entry is indistinguishable. In a state like California, where every regular driver’s license holder is automatically registered to vote, and where almost a million illegal aliens have received these “  drive only” licenses  —   it’s critically important that additional safeguards be in place to prevent   from being “accidentally” registered to vote. When asked about how the DMV prevents this from happening, Gonzalez said “[t]he programming blocks AB 60 applicants from having the option to register to vote. ” How is the California voter assured that voter fraud is not happening, given that the only safeguards in place are a computer program and the honor system? If someone returns a voter registration card and fails to affirm they are a U. S. citizen, his or her registration is treated as normal and placed on the voter rolls without any further verification, per the California Secretary of State’s official website. Gonzalez also said that “state laws forbid police from discriminating based on a person showing an   license,” but there is nothing to stop the U. S. Attorney General from subpoenaing the database to determine if votes were cast illegally in a federal election. It is a very serious crime in California to vote illegally or to vote on behalf of someone who is not qualified to vote  —   punishable by up to 3 years in prison, with fines from $1, 000 up to $25, 000 (if the particular offense is a felony). It is also a federal crime for a   alien to vote in any federal election, according to US Code 18 U. S. C. § 611  —   punishable by up to one year of imprisonment. If Attorney General Jeff Sessions wanted to investigate voter fraud in California  —   which California Secretary of State Alex Padilla vehemently condemned as “dangerous,” “impossible” and “a lie”  —   all he has to do is subpoena the databases and cross reference voter files with AB 60 driver’s license holders. And if Padilla wants to put the “lie” to President Trump’s allegations of widespread, massive voter fraud, he should put up or shut up. When a similar verification audit was done in Prince Williams County, Virginia last year  —   cross referencing jury duty exemptions for   with voter registrations  —   the result was astonishing. According to a Breitbart News report in 2016, 1, 046   were found to be registered to vote in just three counties where elections are often decided by a few hundred votes. California Democrats have a great opportunity to embarrass President Trump  —   which seems to be their official mission  —  and at the same time prove the integrity of the vote in the largest, most populous state in the union.

25441,Mississippi District Ordered to Desegregate Its Schools - The New York Times,"A federal court has ordered a town in Mississippi to desegregate its high schools and middle schools, ending a   legal battle over integrating black and white students. The ruling by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, made Friday but announced Monday, means the middle and high school programs in the Cleveland School District, in the western part of the state, will be combined for the first time in their   history. In her decision, Judge Debra M. Brown said, “Although no court order can right these wrongs, it is the duty of the district to ensure that not one more student suffers under this burden. ” Judge Brown rejected two alternatives proposed by the district as unconstitutional and ordered it to adopt a Justice Department desegregation plan, and to provide a timeline for doing so. The head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, Vanita Gupta, said in a statement Monday, “This victory creates new opportunities for the children of Cleveland to learn, play and thrive together. ” School officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. But a statement on the Cleveland School District’s website Tuesday said it was examining the decision and “considering its options for appeal. ” Government data released Tuesday suggested that segregation was creeping back in some school districts, with poor, black and Hispanic students increasingly isolated from white peers. The report, by the Government Accountability Office, showed that 16 percent of public schools had high proportions of poor and black or Hispanic students in the   school year, up from 9 percent in  . It said 75 to 100 percent of those students were eligible for free or   lunches, a commonly used indicator of poverty. The schools offered fewer math, science and college preparatory courses and had higher rates of students held back in ninth grade, suspended or expelled. Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, who requested the G. A. O. report in 2014 with Representative John Conyers Jr. Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement that it confirmed that the nation’s schools were still largely segregated by race and class. “What’s more troubling is that segregation in public   schools isn’t getting better it’s getting worse, and getting worse quickly, with more than 20 million students of color now attending racially and socioeconomically isolated public schools,” Mr. Scott said in a statement. The Mississippi case began with an action filed on July 24, 1965, on behalf of 131 children. The suit accused the Bolivar County Board of Education and some of its members of operating public schools on a racially segregated basis. The Cleveland School District is part of Bolivar County. A Justice Department motion filed in 2011 illustrated the inequities between the poor and   in Cleveland, a Mississippi Delta town with a population of about 12, 000. Before 1969, schools on the west side of the railroad tracks that run through Cleveland were white and segregated by law. Schools on the east side of the tracks were originally black. “More than 40 years later, these schools maintain their character and reputation as white schools, with a student body and faculty that are disproportionately white,” the department said. The court ruled that the district must consolidate the virtually   D. M. Smith Middle School with the historically white Margaret Green Junior High School. It must also consolidate the mostly black East Side High School with the historically white Cleveland High School, and review educational programs to identify new ones for the consolidation. The decision came six decades after the United States Supreme Court declared in Brown v. Board of Education that “separate but equal has no place” in public schools. But on the 62nd anniversary of that decision, which was Tuesday, it is still struggling to take hold. Segregation is not just a characteristic of Southern states. Some of the most severely segregated conditions for Latino and   students occur in New York, Maryland and Illinois, the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a report on Monday.   percent of New York’s black students attend overwhelmingly nonwhite schools, compared with 45 percent in Mississippi, the report shows. Erica Frankenberg, an author of the report, said in a telephone interview that, decades after the Brown decision, some school districts had lagged in ending segregation because doing so requires separate legal challenges to policies that are enforced and enacted at the local and state levels. Factors such as school board decisions, political opposition and discriminatory housing policies can hinder progress in districts, Ms. Frankenberg said. “It is asking the perpetrators of segregation to be in charge of fixing the segregation,” she said. She added that she believed there were several hundred legal school desegregation cases nationwide. The Justice Department is still monitoring and enforcing 178 open federal desegregation court cases, many originating 30 or 40 years ago, the G. A. O. report noted.",1
25444,"Trump, Davos, Martin Luther King Jr.: Your Weekend Briefing - The New York Times","Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. By the end of this week, the U. S. will have sworn in a new president. Ahead of Donald J. Trump’s inauguration on Friday, more of his cabinet nominees will appear before Senate committees for confirmation hearings. Last week’s hearings revealed that many of the people he’s chosen have strong disagreements with his policies. If his appointments are confirmed, he’ll put in place a team that is more white and male than any cabinet since Ronald Reagan’s. _____ 2. We spoke with some of the millions of women who voted for Mr. Trump, like Taylor Davis, above, who said she was a “  Bernie supporter. ” “When he backed Hillary Clinton, I couldn’t get behind it,” she said. The women gave a range of reasons for their support for Mr. Trump, including concerns about the economy, immigration and Mrs. Clinton. _____ 3. Mr. Trump lashed out at Mrs. Clinton after the Justice Department said it would investigate James Comey, the F. B. I. director, over his decision to tell Congress about a new review of her emails just days before the election. Mr. Trump called her “guilty as hell. ” He was also mad about a sensational but entirely unverified dossier on his ties to Russia. “Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives,” he tweeted. _____ 4. Congress moved quickly last week in its efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which was one of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. He also promised it would be replaced by “something terrific,” but Republicans are far from reaching a consensus on what that would be. Here’s a look at the major changes Obamacare brought to health care, which of those changes may now disappear, and what might replace them. _____ 5. Secretary of State John Kerry will spend his last week in office in much the same way as he spent a lot of it: traveling. The trip began with a stop in Vietnam on Friday, above. On Sunday, he’ll be in Paris for peace talks. Also on Sunday, Vice President Joe Biden will be in Ukraine to meet with that country’s president. Later in the week, they’ll both be at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Kerry will end his term as the   secretary of state in U. S. history, having logged more than 1. 3 million miles. _____ 6. “Have you heard? This screws up all your lives. ” That’s what one youth in Cuba yelled to crowds of people shortly after Mr. Obama announced the end of a U. S. policy that allowed Cubans who reach American soil to obtain legal residency. The decision was long sought by the Cuban government. But younger Cubans, forced to envision a future with fewer options, seemed crushed. _____ 7. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday honoring the life of the civil rights leader, is observed in the U. S. on Monday  —   a day after what would have been his 88th birthday. We reviewed “My Life, My Love, My Legacy,” a posthumous memoir by Coretta Scott King, his wife, who died in 2006. “Living with terror is the thread that runs through ‘My Life,’” our reviewer wrote. Here’s a look at how tensions across the country prompted President Obama to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. _____ 8.   victories in a row.  That’s the tally for the Connecticut women’s basketball team, the Huskies, which shattered its own N. C. A. A. record winning streak with Saturday’s win against Southern Methodist in Dallas. In the N. F. L. playoff games continue: Sunday’s lineup pits the Steelers against the Chiefs in Kansas City (8:20 p. m. Eastern, NBC) and the Packers against the Cowboys in Dallas (4:40 p. m. Eastern, Fox). (Earlier we had an outdated time for the   game. It was moved to 8:20 p. m. because of weather.) _____ 9. One of our reporters has a big, dumb, deep, goofy voice  —   at least that’s how he perceives it. “But I’m reminded of it only when I hear a recording of myself while playing back an interview,” he wrote. He asked experts why so many of us are unpleasantly surprised at the sound of our recorded voices. The answer has to do with how sounds are perceived by the inner ear. Above, the musician Mitski Miyawaki, who said she’s often surprised at the sound of her speaking voice. _____ 10. Finally, let’s talk about the Impossible Burger. It looks like beef. It has the texture of beef. It even appears bloody, but it is definitely vegan. Does it taste like beef, though? We asked a butcher, a cardiologist, a vegan and a technology reporter to weigh in. The consensus: not really. “But I think it’s really good as a   option,” the butcher said. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

25448,"The Weekly Standard’s Arsenal to Fight Falsehoods: ‘Facts, Logic and Reason’ - The New York Times","“When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro. ”   —  Hunter S. Thompson, 1972 When Breitbart News ran a blaring headline last week suggesting that new evidence “vindicates” President Trump’s   claims that former President Barack Obama put him and his team under surveillance   …     When a Fox News contributor reported that Fox had “learned” that the British government spied on Mr. Trump at Mr. Obama’s behest, though the network later said it had learned no such thing (because there’s no evidence it happened)   …     When the White House press secretary repeated that flimsy (or, as the British put it, “utterly ridiculous”) claim from his powerful lectern   …     It’s the end result  —   if not necessarily the intended result  —   of a dream that American conservatives began pursuing more than 60 years ago: to break the informational hegemony of the mainstream news media. For the purposes of this column, I’m starting the count in 1955 when William F. Buckley Jr. founded National Review, declaring it an outsider’s antidote to the controlling influence of “the United Nations and the League of Women Voters and The New York Times. ” Mr. Buckley designed National Review to win the larger argument through “logic and superior command of the subject,” as his biographer Sam Tanenhaus (a former writer for The New York Times) told me last week  —   through facts. And it inspired successive generations of conservative journalists to get in the game, too. One of them was Stephen F. Hayes, who, as a conservative Gen   growing up in Wauwatosa, Wis. got ideological ammunition from National Review for the Friday night political fights he and his friends waged over Pabst Blue Ribbons and hot wings. Mr. Hayes wanted to be a journalist. But he had solid conservative beliefs and viewed the mainstream news media as a liberal monolith that wasn’t for him. So in 1995, when William Kristol, Fred Barnes and John Podhoretz, with money from Rupert Murdoch, started The Weekly Standard as a new conservative competitor to National Review  —   and an answer to the   Nation and New Republic  —   Mr. Hayes set about trying to get a job there. After graduating from Columbia University’s journalism school and reporting for the political tip sheet “The Hotline,” he succeeded in 2001. Sixteen years later, just a few weeks shy of Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Hayes, 46, became The Weekly Standard’s editor in chief. The Weekly Standard had been associated with the #NeverTrump movement throughout the campaign, just as the Trump movement had been   given the magazine’s support of free trade and support for the interventionist Republican foreign policy that helped lead to the Iraq war. With Mr. Kristol moving to an   role in December, it fell to Mr. Hayes to navigate Trumpian politics as editor in chief while leading the magazine into the next era. When he looked around the conservative news media landscape and assessed The Weekly Standard’s place in it, he made a determination. The movement he joined had succeeded in breaking the mainstream news media’s informational hegemony (something the mainstream media had a hand in, too, he said). But as it evolved, grew and splintered, something else broke: any universal sense of truth. “That’s a problem for our democracy,” he told me last week. He determined to make The Weekly Standard part of the solution. The solution was more real journalism. And The Weekly Standard was going to need a bigger newsroom. When I caught up with Mr. Hayes last week he was in the process of staffing up. He had poached The Wall Street Journal’s books editor, Robert Messenger, to be an executive editor alongside Mr. Barnes. He had hired Rachael Larimore, a former managing editor of the   Slate (though her politics lean to the right) and recruited a former deputy business editor of The Charlotte Observer, Tony Mecia. He said he was on the verge of hiring five additional journalists, having gotten the   from The Weekly Standard’s billionaire owner, Philip Anschutz, to grow his team by a third. Mr. Hayes said he made a simple case to Mr. Anschutz, who bought The Weekly Standard from Mr. Murdoch in 2009: “Let’s add more resources and make sure that we’re basing our arguments on facts, logic and reason. ” Mr. Hayes shares the viewpoint of another prominent Wisconsin conservative, Charlie Sykes, the #NeverTrump talk radio host who declared last year that he and his fellow conservative media stalwarts had been too successful in delegitimizing the mainstream news media. “We destroyed our own immunity to fake news while empowering the worst and most reckless voices on the right,” Mr. Sykes wrote in The Times last year. Mr. Hayes said he put more of the onus for that on the mainstream news media than Mr. Sykes does (though Mr. Sykes certainly puts some there). It has undercut itself with   readers, he said, through “the questions that aren’t asked and aren’t covered” in a way that seems to favor liberal viewpoints. Yet the effect remained: There are   voters who “don’t believe what they’re getting from the networks and the   cable outlets” and therefore may be open to false or unsubstantiated content that provides affirmation at the expense of true information, he said. In some parts of the conservative news media sphere, winning the intellectual argument has been replaced with winning the war, by any means necessary. That was the ethos the Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart seemed to promote for several years before his death in 2012. He had vowed to “weaponize the conservative movement’’ and to “rectify the   long problem that has been absolute media bias. ” This new media, he declared in Wired in 2010, “provides the tools. ” It certainly did for Breitbart News. Despite having “some good people,” Mr. Hayes said, it was generally “pushing a political line and taking shortcuts and taking shots. ” (Some of those shots have been at Mr. Hayes.) As Mr. Breitbart predicted, new media has also provided the tools for anyone to start a website. No commitment to truth is required. So now you have increased prominence for the   “Gateway Pundits” and “InfoWars” of the world  —   the latter a promoter of the false     conspiracy known as PizzaGate, which InfoWars’ chief, Alex Jones, apologized for late last week. Mr. Hayes and I were speaking during a week in which the conservative news media was going through a   between   reporting and wild speculation and falsehoods. Fox News temporarily sidelined Andrew Napolitano, the contributor who spawned the unsubstantiated claim that Mr. Obama had used British intelligence to spy on Mr. Trump. The conservative Independent Journal Review told Oliver Darcy of Business Insider that it had disciplined journalists involved in a report suggesting that a Hawaii judge had blocked the revised version of Mr. Trump’s immigration order under pressure from Mr. Obama. The report, based solely on the fact that Mr. Obama had been in the state around the time of the ruling, helped hasten another IJR journalist’s decision to quit in protest, as Hadas Gold of Politico reported. With Time magazine posing what should have been a bizarre question, but wasn’t, on its cover  —   “Is Truth Dead?”  —   it felt as if a time of choosing had arrived. But the internet is faster to reward the fantastical than the factual, which is where Mr. Hayes sees potential risks in his strategy. “You can make an argument that the people who pay the price are the people who do the real reporting  —   not the hot takes, and not the clickbait  —   and who aren’t extreme and ranting,” Mr. Hayes said. The Weekly Standard, he said, will continue to have its conservative perspective. And just as it will call out Mr. Trump when he speaks falsely, it will avoid jumping to conclusions that every Trump move is false  —   which he said mainstream news organizations were too quick to do. That means fewer opinionated takes that get ahead of what the reporting shows. So The Weekly Standard didn’t jump to the conclusion that Mr. Trump’s surveillance claims were vindicated by comments about “incidental” surveillance from Representative Devin Nunes of California last week  —   which Mr. Nunes appeared to temper on Friday. Mr. Hayes is gambling that audiences will reward such prudence. There’s no guarantee. It was the only option he saw during this “weird time for journalists. ” That is, time to go pro.",1
25449,Gay and Lesbian High School Students Report ‘Heartbreaking’ Levels of Violence - The New York Times,"The first nationwide study to ask high school students about their sexuality found that gay, lesbian and bisexual teenagers were at far greater risk for depression, bullying and many types of violence than their straight peers. “I found the numbers heartbreaking,” said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, a senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes a division that administered the survey. The survey documents what smaller studies have suggested for years, but it is significant because it is the first time the federal government’s biennial Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the gold standard of adolescent health data collection, looked at sexual identity. The survey found that about 8 percent of the high school population described themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, which would be about 1. 3 million students. These adolescents were three times more likely than straight students to have been raped. They skipped school far more often because they did not feel safe at least a third had been bullied on school property. And they were twice as likely as heterosexual students to have been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. More than 40 percent of these students reported that they had seriously considered suicide, and 29 percent had made attempts to do so in the year before they took the survey. The percentage of those who used illegal drugs was many times greater than their heterosexual peers. While 1. 3 percent of straight students said they had used heroin, for example, 6 percent of the gay, lesbian and bisexual students reported having done so. “Nations are judged by the health and   of their children,” said Dr. Mermin, who is the director of the National Center for   Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at the C. D. C. “Many would find these levels of physical and sexual violence unacceptable and something we should act on quickly. ” These comparisons have emerged because the federal survey, which looks at more than 100 health behaviors, included two new questions last year. It asked how students identified themselves sexually, and also the sex of those with whom they had “sexual contact”  —   leaving students to define that term. While transgender youth have increasingly appeared on the national radar, most recently in debates about school bathroom access, this survey did not include an option for teenagers to identify themselves as transgender. But that possibility may be coming. The C. D. C. and other federal health agencies are developing a question on gender identity to reliably count transgender teenagers which, a spokeswoman said, might be ready for a pilot test in 2017. Some 15, 600 students across the country, ages 14 to 17, took the survey. The population who identified as a sexual minority is in line with estimates from other state or local surveys, and with national studies of young adults. While the figures paint a portrait of loneliness and discrimination that is longstanding and sadly familiar, they are important because they now establish a national databank. Dr. Debra Houry, an emergency medicine physician who directs the C. D. C. ’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said the numbers argued for more comprehensive intervention and prevention programs. She praised programs like Green Dot, which trains students how to support a victim of bullying or a physical altercation. Other programs teach coping skills to vulnerable students. As the data suggests, she said, these students need better access to mental health care, and support from families, schools and communities. The report does not delve into why these students are at such risk for so many types of harm. Dr. Elizabeth Miller, the chief of adolescent and young adult medicine at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said, “The intensity of homophobic attitudes and acceptance of   victimization, as well as the ongoing silence around adolescent sexuality, marginalizes a whole group of young people. ” And such marginalization, added Dr. Miller, who writes extensively about dating and sexual violence, “increases their vulnerability to exploitative and violent relationships. ” Dr. Miller also pointed out that the report implicitly underscores the fluidity of adolescent sexual identity. When asked to identify themselves sexually in the survey, 3. 2 percent of students chose “not sure. ” Among students who said they had “sexual contact” with only people of the same sex or with both sexes, 25 percent identified as heterosexual and 13. 6 percent said they were not sure of their sexual identity. Among students who had sexual contact only with someone of the opposite sex, 2. 8 percent nonetheless described themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual. Dr. Miller, who is also a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said that   can begin at home. “We have to start conversations early with young people about healthy sexuality, attraction, relationships, intimacy and how to explore those feelings in as safe and respectful a way as possible,” she said. Any survey has limitations. In this one, the respondents were students in school and so the research would not have captured dropouts or others who were not attending, a disproportionate percentage of whom are lesbian, gay and bisexual. How students interpreted “sexual contact” or why some defined themselves as “not sure” could also be open to interpretation.",1
25450,Never-Trump Confidential - The New York Times,"My brother heard I’d been saying bad things about Donald Trump. A retired police officer with a cop’s   sense of humor, he still lives in our hometown, a small New England city hammered by deindustrialization and visibly altered over the past few decades by an influx of   immigrants. Trump has a lot of supporters there, and my big brother is one of them. When a local radio host mentioned a recent column I’d written criticizing Trump, he called and asked me about it. I laughed. “Yeah, I wrote it. Does this mean I shouldn’t come home to visit?” “I wouldn’t advise it,” he deadpanned. Brothers can share that kind of joke, but for many people now in Trump’s camp, criticizing their leader is a serious offense, and I’ve been hearing from plenty of them. I am a   Republican, as we’ve come to be known, part of the alliance of conservatives implacably opposed to the idea of Donald J. Trump becoming president of the United States. It’s a position that has estranged me from a plurality of my own party and put me at odd with friends, family, colleagues and a political movement that increasingly has taken on the character of an angry cult. Trump has encouraged a      mentality among his voters, and it is an especially sharp division between Trump’s base and the Republican apostates who oppose him. “You are probably a Democrat and a socialist with literally half a brain,” one recent email from an angry Trump admirer began. “You are most likely wealthy, with no true commitment to God, but of the devil. ” Another correspondent, in a common refrain, told me I was unfit to call myself an American. Yet another wished me a pleasant stay in Guantánamo in the near future. On Twitter, I’ve been barraged with words like “traitor” and “treason” along with a fair number of less printable terms. During the primaries, it was easier to find common ground among Republicans and   voters. At the outset of this election season, I knew very few people who were behind Trump more often, I found myself in arguments about whether Marco Rubio was too young, whether Ted Cruz was too annoying, whether Jeb Bush was too   …     well, too Jeb Bush. Even in those more amicable days, however, when I voiced my categorical opposition to Trump, I would see a head shake slowly or eyes look away for a moment. The same phrases would pop up: “We’re tired of political correctness. ” “He says it like it is. ” “He’ll shake things up. ” And always: “You don’t understand. ” This last charge, with its implication of detached elitism, always rankles. Although today I am a professor at a graduate institution and a practicing national security expert, I grew up in a Massachusetts factory town, in a modest home not far from the mills and the railroad tracks. Both of my parents were   dropouts from impoverished backgrounds, and they worked hard to make a life after a series of tough breaks and more than a few terrible personal choices. I worked my way through my education, sometimes two and three jobs at a time. As a young man, I cut my teeth in local and state politics, and so I was fully and painfully aware of how badly our area was hurt by the collapse of industry and the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the Northeast. So I understand perfectly well how Trump is appealing to those voters. He’s promising to turn back time, to restore factories that were demolished years ago and to deport the Hispanic arrivals who turned the local barbershop into a storefront church. Trump is offering my friends and my family a buffet of economic impossibilities served up with sides of bitter racism and fantasies of revenge. And because I will not join them in their absolute belief in Trump, many of them now see me as an outsider. I’m no longer one of us. I’m now one of them. I am not a natural choice for the part of Republican rebel. I spent a lifetime in the party, despite a short separation in 2012 when I quit it after Newt Gingrich and his plan to build Moon Base Alpha won South Carolina. For some time, I’d been concerned that the party was heading into a dead end of largely symbolic extremism, and Gingrich’s surge in a pack that included unelectable eccentrics like Herman Cain and Ron Paul, for me, clinched it. But I remained a conservative, and I never felt comfortable about leaving America’s conservative party. Trump claims that he has expanded the ranks of the Republican Party. He’s right, at least in my case: I registered Republican once again this year specifically to vote against him. That might be quixotic  —   one of my fellow conservatives told me he admired my “John McClane in Nakatomi Plaza mentality”  —   but I came back because I felt that Trump’s capture of the Republican nomination was an existential threat to the future of American conservatism itself. Trump’s victory, if unchallenged from the right, would force conservatives to replace their own principles with his rancid stew of racism and sexism, along with his slew of various crackpot theories on politics and economics. If he wins, conservatism could be dead for a generation, if not longer. Still, I had no intention at first of publicly planting a flag over Trump, in part because I never expected him to get this far. I lived through the unsuccessful 1992 nativist insurrection within the Republican Party led by Pat Buchanan and the   challenges mounted by Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996. I assumed that Trump was just another populist virus that would pass after the American people got some rest and drank plenty of water. And I admit that like many conservatives, I had at least a small reservoir of empathy for Trump voters at the start, especially in their nearly universal complaint about political correctness. Many of us had an   admiration for a candidate who vowed to brush away what many conservatives (and even some liberals) saw as the heavy hand of the language police on open and honest debate. What soon became apparent, of course, was that Trump was not just politically incorrect: He was an uncontrollable fire hose of offensive lunacy. There was the endless sexual innuendo  —   during news coverage about Trump, I’ve taken to turning off the television when my young daughter is in the room  —   and his ghastly jibes at John McCain, a war hero tortured so badly that to this day his injuries prevent him from tying his own shoes or combing his hair. I assumed that every new straw would be the last one. I was wrong. The hits kept coming. From his flirtation with   conspiracy theories to his promises to order the American military to commit war crimes, nothing seemed to matter to voters who believed in him and who would support him, as Trump himself said, even if he shot someone dead in broad daylight. Soon, Trump started rolling up enough delegates to become an actual threat to win the nomination, and I had to make a decision: What would I do if actually faced with a choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton? The facile dodge would be to say “neither,” since I live in a reliably Democratic northeastern state where my vote would never be the deciding ballot. Instead, I decided to be honest about it, and to confront the full implications of opposing the Republican nominee. I formally came out as a Never Trump Republican in February, when I wrote a column for the conservative online publication The Federalist titled “I’ll Take Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump. ” I made the case that Republicans could tough out four years of Clinton, but that neither the party nor the American conservative movement could survive even a single year of Trump. There is no editorial line on Trump or anything else at The Federalist, and my article was paired with one by a talented young writer named Nicole Russell who wrote in favor of him. Nicole and I made a friendly bet on whose argument would be more persuasive, and we left it at that. I assumed I’d get some hate mail, because anyone who’s ever written an   about anything gets hate mail. Sure enough, streams of rage poured into my email inbox and across my Twitter feed. I was sent everything from pornographic images featuring Hillary Clinton to   propaganda. Young white supremacists (who adore Trump despite his weird orange hue) told me I was a race traitor. Others, especially older people, thundered at me that Hillary murdered Vince Foster and then left our men to die in Benghazi, and that I was an accomplice to murder myself if I did anything that helped Clinton win. Conspiracy theories were rampant in these complaints: I was secretly on the Republican payroll I was secretly on the Democratic payroll I was slated for a job in the Clinton, Cruz, Rubio or Bush administrations. The cynicism of the angry Trump supporters was so deep that my criticism of all these people in print was either dismissed or taken as evidence of an elaborate effort to conceal my true agenda, whatever it was. There is also a triumphalist streak among the Trump supporters, who never tire of crowing about how   Republicans like me have “lost,” that the party has changed hands and that my kind needs to get in line or get out. Friendlier critics may not tell me I have to leave the party, but instead plead with me to understand how Trump’s primary victories were an important step toward getting even with the “elites” whom they believe control their lives. That term  —   the “elites”  —   slips from the mouths of not just casual acquaintances but also from friends and family. Even if they’re not trying to offend, the meaning is clear: They’re referring to people like me. It’s not an entirely new line, of course. One of my uncles was a retired factory worker who for most of his life resented almost anyone who didn’t work with their hands. At dinner one evening many years ago, he issued the blanket declaration that everyone who works in Washington is corrupt. When I pointed out that I  —   someone he’s known for my entire life  —   was working in Washington as a Senate aide at the time, he blurted out: “I don’t care! Then you’re corrupt too!” What he meant, of course, is that he saw me as part of system that was rigged against him. He saw the government as the servant primarily of rich corporations on one side and of unemployed minorities on the other. Like many of today’s Trump voters, he saw no middle ground, no connection between his own life and the many government programs like Social Security and Medicaid of which he was a beneficiary. For him, the government was just a group of bureaucrats stealing his money and then giving it away again  —   after taking their cut. Today, I don’t even have to work in Washington to be accused of being corrupt. I just have to be someone who doesn’t love Donald Trump. If   Republicans are targets of rage to strangers and sources of disappointment to some of our friends and family, we are also objects of curiosity, especially among Democrats. Many people to my left see my opposition to Trump in the Oval Office as so obviously correct that it is ludicrous even to call attention to it, as though I have just bravely declared that I object to driving while blindfolded or to further wars with Britain. They treat me, somewhat condescendingly, as though I have finally come to my senses after years of misguided fraternization with the Republican enemy. For many liberals, of course, Trump is merely the natural endpoint of Republican evolution since the late 1960s. They might regret that it took the extremism of Donald Trump to make me finally see it, but better late than never. Except that I don’t see it that way at all. To me, Trump is an alien presence in the Republican Party, an opportunist who could just as easily have hijacked white   voters among the Democrats or as part of a   bid. Nonetheless, strangers on social media and friends in my daily life mistakenly assume that my opposition to Trump equates to some sort of new sympathy for liberalism in general or for Hillary Clinton in particular. Some of them actually send me   talking points, as though I might find them useful. The reality is that in any other year, I would be arguing that Clinton not only should be disqualified from elected office but driven from our public life along with the rest of her insufferable family. But not this year. The Republicans and unaffiliated conservatives who have remained outside of the party’s civil war this year are less hostile to the Never Trump coalition than the Trump loyalists, but they are still conflicted about us. Whatever their feelings about the party’s nominee, they cannot endure the idea of Hillary Clinton in the White House (again). While many of them have vowed either to abstain or to vote for a third party, they still probe those of us who are determined to resist the Donald at all costs. This can make conversation with fellow conservatives even more frustrating than with liberals or Trump supporters. They ask why we suddenly love Clinton. They wonder how we could possibly forget or forgive her manifest political sins. They demand to know if we understand the danger of allowing her to control the next nominations to the Supreme Court, as if this had never occurred to us. Repeatedly, we’re asked if we’re serious about never voting for Trump. This is when a   Republican winces, because only we can hear the silent scream inside our heads. I have lost count of the tweets and emails asking me, over and over, what I mean by “never” Trump. Do I mean “never,” as in “not during the primaries?” “Never” unless Clinton had been indicted? What if Clinton pulls off her skin and reveals herself to be an alien cyborg or one of our lizard overlords? Could I vote for Trump then? My answer is always the same. Never means never. Even now, conservatives continue to ask me if I’m serious  —   mostly, I suspect, because they’re wrestling with their own consciences. Soon after I made my stand as a   Republican, however, I found that I was not alone. When my piece in The Federalist appeared, I had several media inquiries, including from   programs. At first, I assumed the worst. Talk radio is the natural habitat of many Trump supporters, and surely the hosts would want me to show up covered in barbecue sauce just to save time. Some of them were indeed gunning for an argument, but many actually agreed with me. “Maybe my audience will listen to you,” one host told me before the show, “because they’re sure as hell not listening to me. ” Going public against Trump was also heartening because it allowed me to see how many Republicans are in fact Never Trump themselves. In this sense, at least, to be a Republican in the Age of Trump is exhilarating, if also enervating. To oppose Trump from within the party means a real fight on the terrain of principles and ideas, which is what drew us to the party in the first place. To me, it feels like the 1980s, which for many of us of a certain age was our introduction to a Republican Party that was about ideas.   and evangelicals and Cold Warriors had competing priorities in those years, but there was an underlying consensus that were we all, in some larger and more important sense, on the same side. After the chaos of the 1960s and the stagnation of the 1970s, conservatives finally had a shot at governing, and nothing was   for honest debate among us. That feeling is in the air once again, especially now that the Republican convention’s Rules Committee has voted to shut down any formal challenge to Trump in Cleveland. This effectively ends fruitless parliamentary maneuvers. Instead, Republicans must now stand in the open and argue, right through to November, over the virtue of the party’s nominee (such as it is) and the quality of his ideas (such as they are). In the end, to be a   Republican is to feel a sense of relief, even of liberation, after the surreal craziness of the primary season. Donald Trump’s hijacking of the party is now no longer a threat but a fact, and to oppose him is to feel normal again by embracing clarity and principle against opportunism and crass huckstering. Bracing as it is, this is not always a comfortable place to be. Not long ago, an old friend came to visit. We grew up together, and he’s now a working man who made a life in our hometown, eventually owning a home and raising children there. He understood how I felt about Trump, he told me, but “things had to change. ” I asked him what, exactly, he would change. This is a question I’ve posed to many of my friends who are Trump supporters, because they’ve done well in postindustrial America and yet still see themselves as disadvantaged. He admitted that his life had worked out, despite a few bumps along the way. But things are different now, he said. Worse than ever. A crisis, even. Pressed for details, he only shook his head. You could see what he was thinking: that I would never understand, that I’d become one of them, the educated and distant elites whom the common people must teach a lesson by electing Donald Trump, a billionaire scam artist from New York City, as the President of the United States. I shook my head too. We embraced when he left. He might never know it, but I’ve always been on his side. I still am.",1
25451,"Is Alex Jones Covering for Trump’s Jewish Mob Ties? Israeli Press Says “YES,” Sort of…","By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on October 28, 2016 Radio Host and Trump supporter claims 'Jewish mafia' controls US 
[Editor’s note: The insanity has hit, Trump mouthpiece and Arch Zionist Alex Jones is on the warpath against the ‘Jewish mob’; Israel’s newspaper’s are shocked, as you can see below – or are they? Trump, grandson of a brothel owner, son of a slum lord, grew up in Meyer Lansky’s mob-run New York and by his 30s became the ingenue/money boy of Jewish mob kingpin Roy Cohn; it was Roy Cohn and the Jewish mob that built Trump’s empire and ran interference for him with the Gambinos, John Gotti & company. Now, covering this up seems to be really important, but to whom and why? 
The article below was published in today’s Jerusalem Post. Not a word of it is true, moreover, it is an obvious deflection piece written to save Trump’s Nazi supporters backing in face of VT’s slam dunk assertions of Trump’s Zionist fanaticism. 
After all, Trump has pushed for war on Iran, for clearing out the West Bank and for a one state solution in Israel with Palestinians going through the chimney’s. 
But why then are America’s Jew haters, the human filth that would gas America’s Jews the big Trump lovers? Some of it comes from the Nazi movement itself, largely begun as a fundraiser by the ADL/JDL/AIPAC/SPLC lobby. You see, no swastikas painted on synagogues, no big corporate donations. On Alex Jones by Brother Nathaniel , a long accused rabid anti-Zionist: 
THE CONTROVERSY OF ALEX ‘BULLHORN’ JONES being an alleged Zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent Zionist-Jewish connections on his 1) Personal Staff 2) Website Advertisers 3) Link To Time Warner President, Edgar Bronfman Jr. 
Jones’ seeming allegiance to Zionism, which explains why he virtually never targets Zionist Jews or the racist, Zionist rogue state of Israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks , may well stem from a Protestant-Zionist belief system, and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a Jew –– which makes his two children Jewish under Talmudic law and eligible for the Israeli Law Of Return . 
With additional information on Jones which this site is now providing, Alex Jones’ Zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global Zionism, becomes ever more obvious. 
Trump has played the hate card from day one, building his base on hatred of blacks/African Americans, “Messicans” and, of course, he has played the terror card, the “yellow hordes” card and the “elite liberal” card as well. 
That one is aimed at the Jews. Trump, whose empire was built by Roy Cohn and who has been supported and financed by Jewish organized crime and now by Vegas boss Shelly Adelson, who can buy and sell Trump out of his “trump change,” has always been a front for the Jewish mob. Jewish mobsters, as oft pointed out by Ian Greenhalgh, have surrounded Trump and embarrassed him, if you can imagine that, more than once. 
Years ago, during nasty litigation, radio host Jeff Rense, former partner of Alex Jones, tracked Jones and his backing to the Jewish mob and the Bronfman crime family, accused of their complicity in financing 9/11. 
Now we see the Zionist press pulling out the “anti-Semite card” on Alex Jones, one of Israel’s strongest supporters in the US. Is this a joke? Of course, this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead Jew hating Nazi’s that have flocked to Trump. With Trump’s effusive love of everything Israel and everything Zionist, one might ask why the Nazi’s flock to him, but Nazi’s have never been thinkers and are great followers, even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings. 
Comment boards at VT have been inundated with paid trolls, some who track back to Israel, others employed by Trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign. Toads and trolls get up to $50 for a comment placed even on wrong articles. Thus, we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money Trump pays out except for hookers. 
When are American Jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at, well, at Israel, the ADL and the rising tide of Naziism in the US paid for by their donations? 
If the read below doesn’t have you laughing, we are sorry. Humor is where we find it and this is humor at its best. G]",1
25452,How Private Equity Found Power and Profit in State Capitols - The New York Times,"PHOENIX  —   Inside a cramped committee room on the   campus of Arizona’s Capitol, Kelsey Lundy stepped to the podium to detail new legislation and the higher costs it would impose on struggling borrowers. But Ms. Lundy is not a lawmaker, a government employee or even a statehouse intern. She is a lobbyist for one of the nation’s largest lenders. That lender  —   controlled by the Fortress Investment Group, one of Wall Street’s most powerful private equity firms  —   wrote the bill. Months later, in 2014, the state’s legislators passed the law, making it easier to charge interest of 36 percent to borrowers living on the financial margins. The political access in Arizona was just one component of a broader effort to loosen consumer protection laws, according to emails obtained through public records requests. In nine other states, Ms. Lundy’s client helped win legislative changes, persuading lawmakers that it needed to raise costs to stay in business and serve borrowers. Since the 2008 financial crisis, Fortress and other private equity firms have rapidly expanded their influence, assuming a pervasive, if    role in daily American life, an investigation by The New York Times has found. Sophisticated political maneuvering  —   including winning government contracts, shaping public policy and deploying former public officials to press their case  —   is central to this growth. Yet even as private equity wields such influence in the halls of state capitols and in Washington, it faces little public awareness of its government activities, The Times found. Private equity firms often don’t directly engage with legislators and regulators  —   the companies they control do. As a result, the firms themselves have emerged as relatively anonymous conglomerates that exert power behind the scenes in their dealings with governments. And because private equity’s interests are so diverse, the industry interacts with governments not only through lobbying, but also as contractors and partners on public projects. Fortress, which manages more than $70 billion of investor money, encapsulates this new power dynamic. While little known outside Wall Street, Fortress covers a cross section of American life through companies it owns or manages. It controls the nation’s largest nonbank collector of mortgage payments. It is building one of the country’s few private passenger railroads. It helps oversee a company that manages public golf courses in several states. And it controls Ms. Lundy’s client, Springleaf Financial Services, a huge provider of subprime loans to borrowers with few other options aside from payday lenders often charging 300 percent. The Times’s investigation  —   based on thousands of pages of government records, court papers and securities filings, as well as interviews with borrowers, regulators and executives  —   pieced together how these seemingly disparate companies fall under the umbrella of one powerful private equity firm. The investigation also shed new light on the tactics these companies have used to reshape laws that hindered their growth. In Texas, Springleaf helped persuade lawmakers to allow for higher administrative fees. Springleaf won permission elsewhere to charge the maximum allowable rates  —   36 percent in Arizona and Indiana, higher than some credit cards  —   to a greater number of loans than ever before. And it pushed legislation allowing it to sell various insurance policies, including life and accidental death and dismemberment, which it lumps into the balance of its loans. In Arizona, Springleaf forged such cozy ties with lawmakers that the two sides became all but inseparable in the   process. One legislative official emailed Ms. Lundy: “If there is a specific statute that you want to mirror, please tell me the statute number. Thank you so much!” Another Springleaf lobbyist, when   listed the sponsor of the Springleaf bill as an employment reference. In Florida, where Fortress is building the passenger railroad, the firm took advantage of   politics: political aides becoming lobbyists, and vice versa. When an adviser to the governor moved into the private sector, he advocated for the train project, then returned to the governor’s office as chief of staff. Fortress’s interaction with Los Angeles County was rockier, and it reflected the firm’s complex web of financial interests. Los Angeles County officials believed that Fortress was buying the company responsible for upkeep of public golf courses. The county, swayed by Fortress’s long track record in owning golf courses, approved the deal. There was one problem: Fortress was not the buyer. The Times investigation found that the buyer was the Newcastle Investment Corporation, a different company with no golf experience and a history of financial problems. County officials were surprised to learn the buyer’s identity from The Times. Fortress said there was no need for county officials to worry. Newcastle pays Fortress to manage its business and investments. Wesley Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who   Fortress and is now its   also emphasized the positive effects of Fortress’s companies across the American economy. Fortress has replaced poorly performing banks, he pointed out, and has funded projects that no government could afford. “We are proud of the impact that   companies have provided to the individuals and communities that they serve,” Mr. Edens, who is also an owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, said in a statement. In an interview, Mr. Edens said that Fortress did not create Springleaf’s lobbying campaign, but supported it. Springleaf said it needed to raise costs to modify outdated laws and compete with less regulated lenders. And although Springleaf wants to raise costs on borrowers at a time of historically low interest rates, he said that the company was “so much more humane” than others offering   loans. Some customers agree. Joseph King, a Springleaf customer in Glendale, Ariz. said, “They’ve done right by me,” offering him credit when few others would. Some public agencies also applaud Fortress for creating jobs  —   the firm estimates as many as 10, 000 with the Florida railroad alone  —   and for investing in fields that others abandoned after the financial crisis. Private equity firms, onetime “corporate raiders” that made their name taking over distressed companies, have pushed into activities previously dominated by banks and local governments. This shift has upended the definition of private equity as the industry expands into real estate, infrastructure and lending. Although that transformation granted private equity new influence over government, Mr. Edens disputed that political connections generated special favors for the firm. “There is nothing surprising about support these companies have received, given the benefits they deliver to a broad cross section of Americans,” he said. Surrounded by his business partners and his daughters, Wes Edens stepped onto the balcony at the New York Stock Exchange, rang the opening bell and walked away a billionaire. It was Feb. 9, 2007, the day Fortress became the first Wall Street firm with a big private equity business to go public. It was a pivotal moment for Mr. Edens, a Montana native with a mop of blond hair. For private equity, a relative newcomer to modern capitalism, it showed that the industry had arrived. Today, six other private equity firms are publicly traded, and over 7, 500 are in operation worldwide, according to the data provider Preqin  —   more than ever before. Private equity firms “are ubiquitous, they are everywhere,” said Eileen Appelbaum, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research who studies private equity. Everywhere includes the government. The amount the private equity industry spent on lobbying in 2015 was more than triple what it had spent a decade earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. At the peak of the financial crisis, the figure was even higher. Political donations have increased nearly sixfold. Former House Speaker John Boehner’s chief of staff is now president of the industry’s lobbying group. That group, the American Investment Council, argues that the public has benefited from private equity. Pension funds have reaped 12 percent net returns from private equity over a recent   period, the group said. “Private equity funds have an aligned interest with their investors to produce strong returns,” said Bronwyn Bailey of the American Investment Council. The group also noted that the   Act, passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, subjected private equity fund managers to additional oversight from regulators. Yet the group is lobbying the House to pass legislation that would unwind some of those requirements, government records reviewed by The Times show, underscoring the industry’s newfound influence. Fortress’s 2010 takeover of Springleaf, the subprime lender, further illustrates private equity’s evolution from niche industry into one of Wall Street’s most influential players. It also shows how a firm’s influence can flow from the companies it owns. Springleaf’s businesses were previously in the hands of the American International Group and Citigroup, two Wall Street powerhouses that needed billions of dollars in government bailouts to survive. Since buying Springleaf, Fortress has turned its $124 million investment into a stake valued at $1. 9 billion. The lender’s lobbying underpins some of that growth. In state house after state house, Springleaf lobbyists secured legislative victories, allowing the company to raise costs on borrowers. Springleaf argued that its successes were not particularly sweeping, noting that it lost in at least two states. “Because many state legislators don’t have sufficient legislative staffs or staff members with   expertise, if you want something done, you sometimes have to write the first draft yourself,” said John Anderson, an executive vice president at Springleaf. “It is unusual for legislation we propose to be enacted verbatim. ” One of Springleaf’s arguments to lawmakers has been that, without legislative changes, it would need to close more branches  —   driving borrowers to payday lenders. In 2008, Springleaf said, it had 21 Arizona branches, and at the time of the 2014 legislation seven remained. In contrast with   payday lenders, Springleaf offers installment loans that typically are larger and last longer. After buying its largest competitor last year and rebranding as OneMain Financial, the company is now the nation’s largest installment lender. Springleaf charges more than banks because its customers are riskier bets. According to Mr. Anderson, who says he reads every complaint that customers submit to regulators, Springleaf caps rates at 36 percent. The average Springleaf loan totals about $6, 093 and costs 26 percent, plus fees. At a Springleaf branch in a Phoenix strip mall, Gary Hundley agreed to pay nearly 36 percent on much of his roughly $4, 500 loan. He also took out unemployment and life insurance policies from Springleaf. Mr. Hundley repaid an earlier Springleaf loan, he said, and planned to chip away at the second, when medical problems forced him to miss work. About a month after taking out the second Springleaf loan, Mr. Hundley filed for bankruptcy, largely because of other debts unrelated to Springleaf. Springleaf then sued him, arguing that he had never intended to repay. As a result, Mr. Hundley is still liable for part of the debt, according to his lawyer, Anthony Clark, who said Springleaf “is no stranger to bringing these kinds of suits. ” “I was overwhelmed, but I planned to pay,” said Mr. Hundley, who had no trouble obtaining Springleaf loans despite previously declaring bankruptcy. Springleaf noted that in other bankruptcy cases it has agreed to lower payments. And it is within the company’s rights to sue. But Springleaf has occasionally straddled a legal line, records and interviews show. Consider the company’s insurance business. Although Springleaf’s life insurance and other policies are voluntary  —   and the company fully refunds premiums to borrowers who cancel their policies within 30 days  —   some policies are opened without customers’ approving them at the time. For instance, if a borrower pledges a car as collateral for a loan, but the auto insurance appears to have lapsed or is insufficient, Springleaf can impose its own insurance. Although Springleaf warns borrowers beforehand, and routinely cancels its coverage once they obtain an adequate policy, Springleaf acknowledged in a public filing that “because our customers do not affirmatively consent” to the insurance when it is purchased, “regulators may in the future prohibit” it. Some borrowers have separately complained to regulators that Springleaf embellished the collateral underpinning their loans. Lisa Williams, a    administrative assistant in   N. C. noticed an irregularity after receiving a roughly $3, 700 Springleaf loan: A lawn mower she posted as collateral was valued at $800. “There’s no way that that old thing was worth $800,” she said, giggling. A similar new mower retails for about $300. Loren Finnell, a mechanic in Tempe, Ariz. said he obtained a loan in 2014 after Springleaf listed a Dell computer and accessories worth $2, 000. “I didn’t even have a Dell. They were making it up. ” For Sheila Fargnoli, of Tucson, getting a loan from Springleaf was like a game of Mad Libs. A Springleaf employee, she recalled, asked questions like, “You must have a computer, right?” The employee also asked about musical instruments, but Ms. Fargnoli said she had previously sold her guitar for $1 at a yard sale. Nonetheless, Springleaf listed the guitar as collateral in the loan documents, Ms. Fargnoli noticed. She accused Springleaf in court papers of pressuring her to “misrepresent the value” of collateral, which Springleaf did not dispute. Springleaf said that the problems were isolated and that it had curtailed the use of household items as collateral. It also now prohibits using anything of immaterial value  —   say, a $1 guitar  —   to secure loans. The complaints have emerged as Springleaf presses its statehouse lobbying campaign. “Just in case you needed a little light reading, attached is the draft legislation that Springleaf would like to move forward,” Ms. Lundy, the Arizona lobbyist, emailed a Republican aide. Springleaf asked Representative T. J. Shope, a Republican, to sponsor the bill. And when a consumer advocate, Cynthia Zwick, published an   article opposing the bill, Ms. Lundy contacted Mr. Shope to say, “You should do a response. ” Later she added, “Let’s work on one tomorrow. ” Ms. Lundy also testified at hearings alongside Mr. Shope. Unable to answer a question, Mr. Shope deferred to Ms. Lundy. The lobbyist, he added, was “here to answer a lot of the technical questions. ” Not all of Ms. Lundy’s statements were accurate. In a “fact sheet” to lawmakers, she claimed that “similar legislation has passed in numerous states” with “only one state having opposition from one consumer advocacy group, none from AARP. ” Yet consumer advocates opposed the legislation in Florida and Indiana, and AARP attacked it in North Carolina. Springleaf said it was unaware of the opposition at the time. Ms. Lundy and Mr. Shope declined to comment. Their bill’s passage coincided with what Representative Debbie McCune Davis, an Arizona Democrat who opposed the bill, called “wining and dining. ” Springleaf’s lobbyists treated Mr. Shope to “food or beverages” soon after the bill passed, lobbying records show. And about a week after the Arizona bill passed, an email circulated in the House, alerting staff members that “dinner is courtesy of” Ms. Lundy. After similar legislation passed in North Carolina, Springleaf held a dinner for more than a dozen state lawmakers and their staff members. Still, some Democratic officials lamented the bill’s impact on borrowers. “It’s like needing a life preserver and getting an anvil,” said Roy Cooper, the North Carolina attorney general. Around the country, local officials opened letters from the American Golf Corporation, which managed their public golf courses. Fortress was buying the company, the letters announced. That seemed to be good news. American Golf’s letters, which Fortress helped draft, promoted Fortress’s “considerable experience with companies like ours. ” Some officials also received a document, stamped with Fortress’s logo, citing the firm’s ownership of other golf courses and its “firsthand experience” owning companies that form partnerships with local governments. To seal the 2013 deal, the letters included Fortress’s annual report showing its “substantial resources. ” The pitch worked. Parks department officials in New York City, and in Ventura County and San Dimas, Calif. promptly signed off on the deal. Los Angeles County took longer to scrutinize Fortress’s background before granting approval. But none of the officials had the full story. The buyer was not Fortress, but Newcastle Investment Corporation, The Times found in filings. The distinction  —   Newcastle is a different company with a close business relationship to Fortress  —   suggests that complex corporate structures can confuse governments and benefit private equity. All four parks departments said they were not told about Newcastle until contacted by The Times. Fortress and American Golf “should have fully disclosed accurate and complete information,” Los Angeles County officials said in a statement. If they had examined Newcastle, officials might have seen red flags. Newcastle had suffered a “material weakness” in internal controls two years earlier and received a “financial health grade” of D from the independent investment research firm Morningstar. In securities filings Newcastle acknowledged, “We have never owned or operated a golf business. ” Under Newcastle, American Golf took over some courses from competitors that were failing to pay rent. And yet, during Newcastle’s tenure, American Golf may not always benefit Los Angeles County. If Newcastle again runs into financial trouble, American Golf might have to be sold once more, a process that could eat up more government resources. American Golf, which must pay the county a cut of what it makes on carts and other golfing gear, also recently created a program that effectively minimizes some of those payments. Golfers who join the program do not pay for certain items that would be lucrative for the county. The program classifies the membership fee under driving ranges, which typically require a smaller payment to the county. Fortress, which argues that the program has attracted more golfers to the county, has benefited from the arrangement. Because Newcastle, and not Fortress, was the buyer, Fortress can enjoy the upside of American Golf without much risk. It works like this: Newcastle pays Fortress a fee to manage Newcastle’s business. But Fortress does not own a majority stake in Newcastle. So, if American Golf proves unprofitable, Fortress still collects fees from Newcastle, while avoiding major losses. These deals are a source of revenue for Fortress, whose executives have created five other companies like Newcastle. Last year, Fortress received more than $200 million in revenue from these companies, about a 50 percent jump from the year before. The golf course deal could serve as a cautionary tale for both private equity firms and the growing number of governments doing business with them. Unlike a typical private equity deal, transactions with public agencies call for greater transparency. Fortress, which has not been accused of wrongdoing by the governments, argues that it was transparent in the golf deal. The firm said it was speaking on behalf of Newcastle, which relies on it for    management. Although Newcastle has its own shareholders and board, Fortress is responsible for the company’s management, investments and other business decisions. In a statement, Fortress said that “there is no mystery about who owns American Golf” because it “is very clear” in Newcastle’s securities filings. But these filings were published after the local governments approved the deal. Fortress also pointed to a document labeled “draft,” which it said American Golf emailed to one Los Angeles County official, making reference to “Newcastle Investment Corp. and other funds. ” That official said he had no record of receiving the email. American Golf acknowledged that it had not sent the document to other towns. “It’s like being told you were getting a big red fire truck and then it turns out you get a little red wagon,” said Eric Preven, a TV producer who ran for public office in Los Angeles. With the help of his brother Joshua, a teacher, he first raised suspicions about the American Golf deal more than two years ago. Still, the quality of golf courses has not suffered since Newcastle bought American Golf, Los Angeles County said. Officials often vote an American Golf course best in the county. Newcastle and American Golf don’t own the courses. Instead, as part of an outsourcing plan, American Golf manages operations, making money every time a golfer tees off. Even before Newcastle bought American Golf from Goldman Sachs, it retained a   local lobbyist: Matt Knabe, whose father is Don Knabe, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. American Golf hosts the Knabe Cup, an annual youth tournament named in honor of the senior Mr. Knabe. His son’s lobbying firm, when questioned by local media about the relationship, has previously said there is no conflict because “Matt does not lobby” his father. There is no indication the Knabes directed American Golf to play down Newcastle’s role. In 2013, Don Knabe and the county board approved the sale of American Golf. At the time, the board appeared impressed with Fortress’s track record in working closely with local governments  —   citing in particular a letter from a Florida official praising Fortress. In that letter, the official from Florida’s Department of Transportation said he “had the pleasure” of working alongside Fortress in building a passenger railway known as All Aboard Florida. Along a   stretch of Florida’s eastern coast, Fortress is embarking on its boldest project yet: the nation’s only purely private intercity passenger railroad. The project, All Aboard Florida, is expected to take five years and nearly $3 billion to build. At speeds reaching 100 miles an hour, it plans to eventually carry passengers from Miami to Orlando, with stops in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. And if trains start rolling next year, as planned, and prove successful, the project may provide a template for private investment in public infrastructure for years to come. Yet this ambitious private project hinged on the blessing of government officials. The administration of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida conditionally agreed to lease out state property to All Aboard Florida, which plans to share the track with an existing freight train company. Federal regulators, after some initial concerns, concluded that the railroad’s safety plans met their standards. And a   nonprofit approved   bonds that can help finance All Aboard Florida’s business. Fortress, which owns both the passenger train and the freight rail, secured these victories through a mix of negotiations, public support, political power and a revolving door between the government and the private sector. Documents obtained through public records requests pull back a curtain on the lobbying that shaped the project. The documents, many previously unreported, spotlight the role played by Governor Scott’s aides. The governor’s former campaign manager teamed up with one of his former policy advisers to coordinate All Aboard Florida’s media strategy and meetings with the governor’s administration. They found a receptive audience, including an aide to Governor Scott who texted a Fortress employee, “Let me know if I can be helpful. ” Fortress stands to benefit from the project in several ways. The firm owns All Aboard Florida’s parent company, as well as the freight train operator sharing the track, which means it would profit from All Aboard Florida’s success. Fortress also controls land around the track, where it is developing rental housing. And even if the passenger rail flops, Fortress might benefit from All Aboard Florida’s track upgrades, which would enable its freight operator to carry more cargo at quicker speeds. (Fortress disputes this point, arguing that the upgrades are not needed to improve its freight operations.) Not everyone will benefit. Along Florida’s Treasure Coast  —   oceanfront counties that include some of the state’s richest and poorest areas  —   some residents worry that the train will disrupt their lives. In one county, the sheriff argued that the trains, 32 each day, “could have   implications” if they stranded patrol cars on one side of the tracks as trains passed. A hospital executive warned about ambulances idling at crossings. Two counties sued to halt the   bonds. Some residents also express a deeper concern: The train is literally passing them by. Towns without stops will get the headaches of rail traffic rumbling through, without the economic benefits. In Gifford, a   community pockmarked with abandoned homes, residents say they already live on the wrong side of the tracks. Fortress’s freight trains park there to exchange crews, delaying traffic and prompting local outcry. Fortress sees it differently, arguing that the freight trains stop there because it is safe to do so. Mr. Edens, who said the passenger line was open to adding more stops, remarked that “the handful of opponents of the project are focused on their own narrow   not the greater good. ” While critics say All Aboard Florida is unnecessary  —   a small number of Amtrak trains already travel from Miami to Orlando  —   Mr. Edens said it had the potential to revitalize local economies because mass transit is “one of the real cornerstones of economic growth. ” He called it a “real guidepost for how we can actually bring passenger trains back to the United States. ” Concerns that the new trains could cause traffic delays are unfounded, he said, citing data estimating that All Aboard Florida trains would take 45 seconds to clear crossings. All Aboard Florida said that it would be the only railroad in the country to operate “in full compliance with the latest and most stringent” federal safety requirements, and that it would help reduce car travel in the state. “We’re talking about seconds,” Mr. Edens said, adding that it was “not a meaningful” amount of time. William D. Snyder, the sheriff of Martin County, disagreed. “In my business, seconds absolutely matter,” he said. The train’s opponents dispute some of All Aboard Florida’s data about how long the trains will block intersections, saying the company’s assessment is based on   assumptions. Bob Solari, a commissioner in Indian River County, said that All Aboard Florida did not in “any meaningful way protect the people and property of the Treasure Coast. ” The safety concerns, however, did not ruin the railroad project, thanks in part to some political  . All Aboard Florida took shape after Governor Scott rejected $2. 4 billion in federal stimulus money for   rail between Orlando and Tampa, saying it made Florida taxpayers liable for losses. That decision, in 2011, effectively helped clear a path for an alternative train, though All Aboard Florida was still in its infancy at the time. Adam Hollingsworth was one of the governor’s aides involved in the decision to reject the stimulus money, emails show. At the time, he was a volunteer policy adviser. Months later, he went to work for one of All Aboard Florida’s sister companies. To push for the Fortress railway, Mr. Hollingsworth initially coordinated with Susan Wiles, Governor Scott’s former campaign manager. The railway also retained a lawyer who had previously worked for a government agency from which it needed a permit. This team’s background was helpful to All Aboard Florida, records show. The day before Mr. Edens of Fortress was to meet with the governor’s office, Mr. Hollingsworth texted a staff member. “You met Wes at the gov’s Christmas party,” he reminded her, referring to Mr. Edens. After the meeting, Mr. Hollingsworth wrote the aide: “Thank you! I am glad you and the gov were favorable inclined. ” Mr. Hollingsworth followed up when All Aboard Florida was about to announce its plans publicly. The aide responded, “Great news!” About four months later, Mr. Hollingsworth resumed working for the governor’s office, as chief of staff. Ethics rules prevented him from having further involvement with the train. Mr. Hollingsworth did not respond to requests for comment. Ms. Wiles praised him, saying he had honored his recusal. All Aboard Florida said it “did not need nor use Adam” beyond the scope of his duties, noting that it hired Ballard Partners, a prominent Florida lobbying firm. A spokeswoman for Governor Scott added that the state did not finance All Aboard Florida. Still, the company has benefited from government support. In addition to various regulatory approvals, All Aboard Florida has applied for funding from the federal railroad agency. And it accepted about $9 million in federal funds. In the future, it hopes to fund itself through bonds approved by the Florida Development Finance Corporation, a   nonprofit. The bonds are   but All Aboard Florida, not the government, is responsible for repaying them. Last year, the nonprofit’s board approved the bonds, which All Aboard Florida has yet to issue. Here, too, lobbying was at work. Before the board held a crucial hearing on the bonds, an All Aboard Florida representative emailed one of the board’s new members a reminder to submit the paperwork by close of business the next day “in order to get confirmed by the Senate. ” The email added, “Can I help with this?”",1
25455,"‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer,’ Reimagined by Its Fans - The New York Times","When “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” one of television’s most influential series, first turned up 20 years ago this month, it didn’t just attract viewers, it also unleashed an army of   writers creating their own adventures about Buffy Summers, her friends Willow and Xander, and the vampires Spike and Angel, to name a few. Fan fiction takes characters from an established book series, TV show, movie franchise or other cultural cornerstone and riffs on them. Some of it is highbrow stuff by highbrow authors  —   what is Tom Stoppard’s “Rosencranz and Guildenstern Are Dead” but Shakespeare fanfic? Mostly, though, the authors are amateurs with an overwhelming affection for the characters and a yearning to feel a stronger connection to them. For some, it’s a fun hobby for others, it’s therapeutic  —   they might write under pseudonyms and use their stories to explore issues and problems they are facing. Fan fiction existed before the internet in fanzines and other formats  —   the original “Star Trek” spawned lots of it  —   but giving practitioners the ability to communicate with one another via computer really changed the game. The “Buffy” universe was among the early adopters the show’s stars and writers (and its creator, Joss Whedon) would sometimes visit and post on the online forums that sprang up. The result was a rich, sometimes loopy body of work that included subgenres devoted to specific characters, crossover stories (there are dozens mixing “Buffy” and “Bones,” the Fox series that the “Buffy” actor David Boreanaz later starred in) and more. In commemoration of the 20th anniversary, we asked readers to share a piece of their fan fiction, and tell us why they write about “Buffy. ” Here are some of their edited responses. BY PHOENIX, 17 Read the full work here. When did you start watching “Buffy”? I started watching “Buffy” last May, which sounds ridiculous, since I’ve become such a big fan since. Why did you start writing fan fiction? My first ever was for “Harry Potter” it was sort of a Voldemort back story. Since I was 13, it was utterly terrible. Now I write fan fiction both out of a desire to expand on fictional worlds and out of a desire to correct fictional worlds, in a sense. For example, I didn’t like some parts of Seasons 6 and 7 of “Buffy,” so I wrote a few pieces where Seasons 6 and 7 went the way I wanted. What prompted you to write this piece? In Season 4 of “Buffy,” Willow, a character who has previously only demonstrated interest in boys, falls in love with a girl. I love that arc, but I wanted to explore whether Willow had been attracted to girls before then. In my mind, the way that this would be demonstrated would be through a high school crush on Buffy. I wanted to write about a young Willow discovering who she was. One of the best things about fan fiction is that, since a lot of writers are LGBT+ it can have really good representation of what it is to be LGBT+ that is hard to find in other places. This is part of my contribution to that. BY DAVID FROOM, 32 Mr. Froom writes about   in Sunnydale, Calif. the fictional setting of “Buffy. ” Read the blog here. When did you start watching “Buffy”? I started watching “Buffy” during its fifth season, after years of scoffing at it (I was 15) only to instantly become obsessed. In those Stone Age days, I had to buy   DVDs to catch up on the old seasons, and I gladly burned through entire paychecks from my   job to see everything I’d missed. Why did you start writing fan fiction? The Sunnydale Press is the only fan fiction I’ve ever written. I’d always been intrigued by the idea that Sunnydale successfully covered up supernatural  —   and deadly  —   goings on for decades the idea for the blog was born out of this curiosity. I try to keep with the mood of the show and the late ’90s, giving great weight to the fears of “the occult” and “gangs on PCP. ” It amuses me to no end that   events would get boiled down to blurbs, while common events might turn into     news. BY TERRI MEEKER, 56 Read the full work here. When did you start watching “Buffy”? I didn’t watch “Buffy” until 2008. We were hit hard in the economic crash and got rid of all the nonessentials, including cable TV. We had to keep the internet on so that my husband could look for work in the   software industry, so we signed up for a free Hulu account. I’d always heard about “Buffy,” but was busy raising my kids and didn’t really watch TV. When I saw a clever YouTube spoof poking at the lack of feminism in “Twilight,” called “Buffy vs Edward,” I was intrigued. At first, I wasn’t thrilled with “Buffy,” but I kept watching. By Season 3, I became obsessed. Why did you start writing fan fiction? I’d finished all the episodes of the show, but I needed more. Fan fiction was a way to do that. As an   teacher, I wanted to see more of Spike’s back story, so I began to write a story in which “Buffy”   to the 1880s. The Victorian era is a fascinating time period, and I knew some of their ideas about sexuality would make for some terrific situations. What prompted you to write this piece? I was very worried about the 2016 election. The “Buffy” community is all about empowering women, and I knew they were equally concerned. Since Buffy’s creator, Joss Whedon, had invested a million dollars into a     effort, I wanted to write a little reminder for fans on Election Day. BY SARAH   47 Ms.   writes fiction that retells   episodes via haiku. She calls them Spaiku. Read the full work here. When did you start watching “Buffy”? In 2008. Having seen the regrettable theatrical version when it was first released, I steered clear of the show for as long as possible. When I read that Susanna Clarke counts the writing team of “Buffy” among her top five favorite writers (along with slackers like, y’know, Dickens) I had to watch. And watch. And rewatch. Buffy’s is a hero’s journey for the ages, and it has been a wonderful show to watch again and again with my daughter as she navigates adolescence. What prompted you to write   narratives? My desire to interact with other people who love “Buffy” eventually led me to a very supportive online community at LiveJournal. I read (and commented on) tons of fan fiction, made fabulous new friends, and wished that I could contribute something as well. Alas, the plotting requirements of long fiction are completely beyond me. I thought, “Well, maybe if I made something very small . .. ”",1
25456,Top Opposition Leader in Cambodia Resigns as Election Nears - The New York Times,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia  —   The embattled leader of Cambodia’s main opposition party abruptly quit on Saturday in the face of increasing government pressure, ceding a political stage he had occupied for more than two decades. The resignation of the leader, Sam Rainsy, came after the government began a series of moves that would allow it to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party he led, in advance of crucial local elections set for June. The opposition has also been hit with a barrage of lawsuits and leaked telephone conversations between leading figures and women purported to be their mistresses. It was unclear whether Mr. Sam Rainsy, 67, was leaving politics for good or was planning to work quietly behind the scenes. Either way, his exit seemed to represent the end of an era. As the head of three   political parties since 1995, he had been a thorn in the side of the country’s   prime minister, Hun Sen, for more than 20 years. In an interview on Sunday from Paris, where he has lived in exile since November 2015, Mr. Sam Rainsy, a   former banker, said he had quit as a “  defensive move” to save his political party. This month, Mr. Hun Sen proposed a measure that could dissolve any party led by someone convicted of a crime, which Mr. Sam Rainsy has been many times, because of an abundance of criminal defamation suits filed against him by government officials, government allies and the prime minister himself. “This guy is crazy,” Mr. Sam Rainsy said of Mr. Hun Sen. “He can do anything he wants without consideration for legal, judicial principles, so I have to defend my party and tell Hun Sen and tell the Cambodian people and tell the whole world that Hun Sen no longer has any grounds to dissolve the C. N. R. P. on the basis that his kangaroo court has made me a convict. ” He was vague about his future. “In politics, there are always ups and downs,” he said. “Things can change. ” Ou Virak, the chairman of the Future Forum, a public policy research group in Phnom Penh, the capital, said the departure of Mr. Sam Rainsy was a blow for Cambodia’s fledgling democracy. “Leaving in this kind of situation, when the party is under pressure, is not ideal or democratic,” he said. “It highlights the nature of Cambodian politics for the past 20 or so years. Politics is not created by competition and ideas, but personalities and maneuvering to get what people want. ” Mr. Sam Rainsy was one of those personalities. Despite his weaknesses, including a tendency to flee the country in the face of trouble, he is still, for many, the most enduring symbol of opposition to Mr. Hun Sen. The prime minister, a former Khmer Rouge fighter, has held power since 1985 and maintains close control over most of the country’s institutions. “Rainsy is a character with a lot of flaws, but it has to be recognized that he has maintained this position of opposition for nearly a ” said Sebastian Strangio, the author of “Hun Sen’s Cambodia. ” “At any time, he could have sold out to the C. P. P. and become a rich man,” he said, referring to the Cambodian People’s Party, led by Mr. Hun Sen. Mr. Sam Rainsy, while clearly irritating the prime minister, proved useful over the years by presenting an internationally visible opposition figure to run in elections, which Mr. Hun Sen always won, Mr. Strangio added. But Mr. Sam Rainsy began to pose a more existential threat to Mr. Hun Sen’s political survival when he formed a partnership with another government critic, Kem Sokha, in 2012. Their new political party nearly won the 2013 national election, emboldening them and stunning the C. P. P. Mr. Hun Sen and Mr. Sam Rainsy came to a brief rapprochement in 2014 and 2015, with the opposition leader extracting some important political concessions from Mr. Hun Sen, including equal representation on the National Election Committee and a television broadcasting license. But a few months later, the friendly feelings dissolved, and many of the concessions were rescinded. It has been hard to keep up with the number of lawsuits filed against Mr. Sam Rainsy and other opposition figures over the last 18 months, many involving allegations of criminal defamation against government officials. Salacious telephone conversations involving Mr. Kem Sokha and other opposition lawmakers have also been leaked online and discussed widely in   news media. The most recent recording, released a week ago, involved a man who sounded like Mr. Sam Rainsy bantering with a waitress about her eating and bathing habits. Mr. Sam Rainsy’s moral authority was also being eroded from within his party. While he fled the country in November 2015 to avoid jail time, Mr. Kem Sokha made a point of staying after being charged with crimes related to a suspected affair. Eventually, the government pardoned him. Mr. Kem Sokha is set to become the acting opposition leader. In a statement on Sunday, he called Mr. Sam Rainsy’s decision honorable and said it had been made in discussion with the party’s leadership. Phay Siphan, a government spokesman, said the lawsuits against opposition figures were private matters, and he accused Mr. Sam Rainsy of trying to generate publicity with a dramatic exit. “He is an opportunist,” Mr. Phay Siphan said. “Tell me, so far, in the last 20 years, what has he done for Cambodia except move the people to go on strike and have demonstrations?” Mr. Phay Siphan also criticized the United States representatives Alan Lowenthal and Steve Chabot, members of a new congressional caucus on Cambodia, for writing to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Thursday about the need to promote free and fair elections in Cambodia. Mr. Phay Siphan called the representatives “blind” and “ignorant,” and he suggested that Mr. Sam Rainsy was taking cues from them. Mr. Sam Rainsy countered that all he wanted was for his party to survive long enough to run in the elections, with or without him. “It is Hun Sen who sees me behind any initiative to defend democracy,” he said, “but I think Cambodia has many sons, many daughters, who are willing to defend democracy. ”",1
25460,Court Strikes Down Obama Health Care Rule on Insurance Standards - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A federal appeals court has ruled that consumers must be allowed to buy certain types of health insurance that do not meet the stringent standards of the Affordable Care Act, deciding that the administration had gone beyond the terms of federal law. The court struck down a rule issued by the Obama administration that barred the sale of such insurance as a separate   product. “Disagreeing with Congress’s expressly codified policy choices isn’t a luxury administrative agencies enjoy,” the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said on Friday in a decision that criticized “administrative overreach” by the Department of Health and Human Services. At issue is a type of insurance that pays consumers a fixed dollar amount, such as $500 a day for hospital care or $50 for a doctor’s visit, regardless of how much is actually owed to the provider. Such “fixed indemnity” insurance is normally less comprehensive and less expensive than the “minimum essential coverage” required by the Affordable Care Act. Under the rule, issued by the Obama administration in 2014, fixed indemnity policies could be sold only to people who already have the more comprehensive coverage that meets detailed federal standards. State officials and insurers estimate that as many as four million people might have fixed indemnity policies without major medical coverage. The Obama administration gave several reasons for cracking down on fixed indemnity insurance. It is “an inadequate substitute for major medical coverage” because “it does not provide protection against major medical expenses,” the administration said. Moreover, it said, consumers may be confused and may buy fixed indemnity insurance in “the mistaken belief that it provides comprehensive coverage”  —   a concern also voiced by consumer groups. In adopting the final rule in 2014, the Obama administration said that allowing people to buy   fixed indemnity insurance would undermine the goal of “maximizing the number of individuals who have comprehensive, major medical coverage. ” Since 1996, fixed indemnity insurance has generally been exempt from federal insurance standards, and the Affordable Care Act did not change that, nor did Congress “give even the slightest indication” that it meant to alter the exemption, the appeals court said. But, the court said, the administration “effectively eliminated   fixed indemnity plans altogether,” by tacking “additional criteria” onto the 1996 law. The ruling in the case, Central United Life Insurance v. Burwell, was issued by a panel composed of Judges Janice Rogers Brown, Patricia A. Millett and Douglas H. Ginsburg. Fixed indemnity insurance differs from major medical coverage in many ways. It does not have to provide the “essential health benefits” required by the Affordable Care Act, nor does it have to pay any specific percentage of medical costs. Some fixed indemnity policies provide coverage only for specified diseases, like cancer. In general, consumers have fewer protections. Under the rule issued by the Obama administration, fixed indemnity insurance would be allowed only as a supplement to major medical coverage that complied with the 2010 health care law. People buying the more limited coverage would have to attest, in their applications, that they already had “minimum essential coverage. ” The plaintiffs in the case, who sell fixed indemnity insurance, said the federal rule would essentially destroy the market for such products. “Even after the Affordable Care Act,   consumers may not be able to afford major medical coverage,” said Quin M. Sorenson, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represented the plaintiffs. In states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility, he said, three million people fall into a coverage gap: They make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to qualify for subsidies in the public insurance marketplace, and they cannot afford major medical coverage on their own. For some of them, he said, fixed indemnity insurance plans may be a valuable option. Under the Affordable Care Act, people who go without major medical coverage may be subject to tax penalties. In a     brief, Wisconsin and 10 other states said that some consumers had found they could save money by buying fixed indemnity insurance and paying the tax penalty. “Fixed indemnity insurance is a rational choice for these individuals because it provides meaningful access to the health care system,” the states’ brief said. The appeals court upheld an earlier decision by Judge Royce C. Lamberth of Federal District Court, who said the Obama administration’s rule “has no basis in the statutory text it purports to interpret and plainly exceeds the scope of the statute. ”",1
25461,21 Things We’ve Learned About Hillary Clinton from Wikileaks That the MSM Won’t Share…But YOU Can!,"Daisy Luther 
Let’s talk about Wikileaks. 
First of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: 
“WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.” 
In the 11 years that they’ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) 
So this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. 
Here are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice…the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik’s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary’s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there’s proof. Zero Hedge writes, “…today’s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band’s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family’s private business endeavors.” A pundit called this leak “The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,” meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she’d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case – surprisingly it isn’t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, “ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .” According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, “Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.” ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, ” How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?” ( source ) Clinton’s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, “ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha’s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .” ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. “And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn’t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I’m kind of far removed because the life I’ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven’t forgotten it.” ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: “ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey “ can’t possibly vet all those refugees so they don’t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.” Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama’s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn’t exert some control over North Korean aggression. “ So China, come on. You either control them or we’re going to have to defend against them ,” she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million “donation” from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . “ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,” Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn’t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton’s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. “ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? ” said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . “ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,” she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. “We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can’t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we’re doing and I want credit for it. ” (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who’s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC’s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC’s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory – it really exists and Hillary’s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you “need” to lie. “If everybody’s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.” ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her “impromptu” CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to “approve” articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC’s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, “W e need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov .” You see, Obama’s emails all have to be from”whitelisted”addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) 
And finally, here’s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn’t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) 
At the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you “go to Washington” to “make a small fortune.” Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. “ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, ” Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn’t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general. Please join your voice with mine by liking, sharing, and spreading the word. Together, we cannot be ignored. Together, we are an army. Read more about Hillary Clinton",1
25462,"Aleppo, Donald Trump, Pakistan: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York Times","Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: •   Donald J. Trump’s latest picks for top posts offer more evidence of a tough approach to national security and the   of crucial ties with Beijing. Gen. John F.

25469,DELINGPOLE: How Social Media’s Useful Idiots Responded to the Manchester Suicide Bomb - Breitbart,"This morning I woke to learn that 22 people had been killed and upwards of 50 injured by a Muslim terrorist bomber at an Ariana Grande pop concert in Manchester, England. So, based on past events, I thought I’d predict how it would pan out on social media. [1. Be offended by something @KTHopkins or @TRobinsonNewEra said on Twitter. 2. Candles, we’ll stay strong etc. 3.

They were so happy as they headed for their homes afterwards  —   but some of them never made it. A Muslim suicide bomber killed them in the belief that his religion ordained it, that it would speed his journey to paradise, and that this was the kind of thing he and his brethren should carry on doing until the whole world submits to Islam. Now you’ll note that at no stage was Katie Hopkins  —   or indeed any other spokesman for conservative causes  —   involved in the planning or execution of this atrocity. You’ll also be well aware  —   if you’ve read round the subject  —   that nothing Katie Hopkins or anyone else says or does is going to stop these things happenings. As Islamic State, the main force behind this wave of violence, make perfectly clear in their literature, they’re going to keep on hating us whatever we do. The fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us, imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary reason for hating you will not cease to exist until you embrace Islam. Even if you were to pay jizyah and live under the authority of Islam in humiliation, we would continue to hate you. No doubt, we would stop fighting you then as we would stop fighting any disbelievers who enter into a covenant with us, but we would not stop hating you  …    The gist of the matter is that there is indeed a rhyme to our terrorism, warfare, ruthlessness, and brutality. You might have hoped after London, Mumbai, Boston, Paris, Nice, Berlin, and Stockholm that the message would have begun to filter through by now: that we’ve got the watches, but they’ve got the time and that they’re planning on continuing till they’ve won. So why, every time, without fail, do we get the same achingly predictable response on social media from the useful idiots of the progressive left? Why do they insist on focusing their rage on people like Katie Hopkins when clearly this has nothing whatsoever to do with people like Katie Hopkins?",1
25472,"How Malay Spends His Sundays: Cooking at Home, Music in the Studio - The New York Times","The music producer Malay won a Grammy Award in 2013 for his work on Frank Ocean’s album “Channel Orange. ” Since then, he has kept busy with multiple projects, including producing albums for Sam Smith and Zayn Malik. This means he is in the studio seven days a week and rarely gets a “full day off,” he said. Still, Malay (pronounced  ) 38, whose real name is James Ryan Ho, fits in some downtime on Sundays to connect with his wife, Iris Belson, 30, a singer, and to indulge in some cooking. They live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with their dogs,   5, a Shih Tzu, and Coco, 3, a Maltese Yorkie. NOCTURNAL The earliest I wake up is 10, though sometimes it’s 11. I am a nocturnal person and like to work late, but even if I’m not working, it takes me a few hours to wind down from the day, and I usually go to bed between 4 and 5. Fortunately, Iris has the same schedule. GRAB THE LEASHES   and Coco are antsy to get out when we’re up, so before anything else, we throw on gym clothes and take them for a walk along the Brooklyn waterfront, which is right by our apartment. COLD BREW One the way home, we stop at a sandwich shop on Wythe Avenue called Dépanneur to get our coffee fix. They sell this great Brooklyn brand called Toby’s Estate, and even if it’s freezing outside, Iris and I both order the cold brew. SWEAT IT OUT With our coffee buzz on, we head to the gym in our apartment building for a quick workout. Our Saturday nights are typically   and I like to do an intense cardio to ward off the effects. Normally, it’s a sprint on the treadmill or 30 minutes of jump rope.   BRUNCH I am really into cooking. My family is from Malaysia originally, and in our culture, kids learn basic kitchen skills like chopping as well as cooking at a young age at home by helping their families. Back then, it was a chore, but now I love experimenting with new recipes, especially for Sunday brunches. I just got a Smoking Gun to smoke foods, and I’m using it on egg dishes. The last thing I made was a lobster eggs Benedict that was smoked. I made the hollandaise sauce from scratch. We both try to eat healthy and follow a paleo diet with low carbs but love good food. MAKING MUSIC Normally after brunch, I Juno it to Manhattan to Germano Studios in the Village where I tend to my various projects. Besides Sam Smith and Zayn, I’m working with this      singer from Portland, Aminé, who has a popular song out right now called “Caroline. ” And, I am also working on my own album, which is a collaboration of songs with many of the artists I have worked with. COCKTAIL HOUR My usual workdays average between 10 to 16 hours, but I try to limit myself to five hours on a Sunday. Around 10, Iris and I meet up at Soho House in the meatpacking district or at the newer one on Ludlow Street. We start off by having a drink or two. Without fail, Iris gets the Eastern Standard, this cucumber vodka mint cocktail. For me, it’s either Japanese whiskey or a nice Brunello from Italy. FEAST After I’ve unwound a bit from my afternoon of work, we order dinner. If we’re at Ludlow House, we like their restaurant Ducked Up where they have the best Peking duck I have ever eaten. It comes with pancakes, and we order sides like baby kale salad, roasted carrots and kimchi fried rice. KITCHEN PREP When we’re back in Williamsburg, which is usually by midnight, I spend an hour or so in the kitchen cooking food for the week ahead. I do a big batch of roasted chicken breast, maybe some braised beef, steamed broccoli with garlic and lemon, and roasted cauliflower. CUDDLE UP Iris, the dogs and I get into bed and cuddle up to catch up on all the Netflix series we’re into like “The Get Down,” Baz Luhrmann’s show about musicians in the South Bronx in the 1970s. We also like “Stranger Things” and “House of Cards. ” We’ll watch for a few hours until we all eventually fall asleep.",1
25474,Deep Fried Offshore,"TJ Mott I've been a developer for the past seven years. Currently I'm in the aerospace industry and work with a variety of programming languages and operating systems. 
Stephen worked for an Initech that sold specialized hardware: high-performance, high-throughput systems for complex data processing tasks in the enterprise world, sold at exorbitant enterprise prices. Once deployed, these systems were configured via a management app that exposed an HTTP interface, just like any consumer-grade router or Wi-Fi access point that is configurable through a website (e.g. 192.168.0.1). 
Stephen worked with a diverse team of American engineers who were finishing up the management application for a new model. The product was basically done but needed a little bit of testing and polish before the official release. They expected several months of post-release work and then the project would go into maintenance mode. 
Then disaster struck. A pointy-haired boss somewhere up in a fuzzy area of the organization chart simply labeled “Here be VPs” discovered the large salary difference between American engineers and off-shore workers, and decided American engineers were far too expensive for software “maintenance”. The company decided to lay off 300 software engineers and hire 300 fresh-out-of-college replacements in a foreign country with much lower labor rates. The announcement was overshadowed by the fanfare of the product’s release and proudly billed as a major “win” for the company. 
Stephen was lucky enough to stay on and shift to other projects, the first of which was to assist with the transition by documenting everything he could for the new team. Which he did, in hundreds of pages of explicit detail, explaining how to use the source control repository for the project, execute and log unit tests, and who to contact when they had questions regarding the hardware itself. After that, he devoted himself to other projects. Months turned into years and Stephen assumed by the silence that the handover was successful and he’d never see the management app again. 
Of course that isn’t what happened. 
There’s an old joke on the Internet called “How to shoot yourself in the foot” (http://www.toodarkpark.org/computers/humor/shoot-self-in-foot.html) that lampoons the complicated process of shooting yourself in the foot in various programming languages. Here is one such entry: 
370 JCL: You send your foot down to MIS and include a 300-page document explaining exactly how you want it to be shot. Three years later, your foot returns deep-fried. 
Three years after the management app was passed off to the new offshore engineer team, a new panic was boiling through Initech. The management application was as slow as molasses, buggier than flies in soup, with a user interface that was battered and deep-fried in a nonsense language that vaguely resembled English. It also crashed a lot, each time requiring a power reset to bring the system back up. 
Initech had simmered along by only shipping the original version, but now they had this expensive, powerful product with three years worth of hardware and firmware updates that the management app could not configure and thus were not available to customers. Several important customers canceled their support contracts rather than pay for half-baked updates that rarely worked, and many prospective customers passed them right by when basic features printed in the product brochure were “unavailable for demo”. They were falling behind in the industry. 
It was bad enough that management finally decided to do something. 
That something was to toss the offshore team and see how many of their old laid-off engineers they could scoop up, which was, not surprisingly, few. As one of the few original engineers who still worked there, Stephen was whisked away from his current projects to assist. 
With a bite-sized portion of the old team re-assembled, they set to work to unscramble the situation. Stephen noticed that the last source control check-in was from three years ago. Upon further inspection, he realized that not one of the offshore engineers had ever committed. 
He called up the offshore office to see if they had their own repository. The last few remaining offshore workers didn’t know, and when told to search every system they had, they replied they couldn’t because their local manager had sold all of their computer equipment on an auction site upon learning of their impending layoffs. 
He then contacted the hardware team in hopes that maybe somebody had a clone of the offshore team’s repository, but the hardware guys claimed the software team was laid off three years ago and they were not aware of an offshore replacement team. 
With no current source code, and an old repository that hadn’t been committed to in three years, Stephen and the team were left with no choice but to pick up exactly where they left off three years ago… [Advertisement] Manage IT infrastructure as code across all environments with Puppet .

25475,The World Is About To Witness A Breathtaking Once In A Century Event,"31   GOLD , KWN King World News 
On the heels of a historic election and chaos in global markets, the world is about to witness a breathtaking once in a century event. 
Expect Stunning Changes Stephen Leeb: “ Donald Trump’s victory sparked some of the most tumultuous action in the markets in decades – by some measures far more extreme than in 2008…. IMPORTANT… To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet and is one of the greatest precious metals investment opportunities in the world CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
There is little doubt the market is signaling major changes ahead. These will almost certainly be more than just a change in market leadership, from big-cap high-tech stocks to metal miners, etc. They will be more than a reversal in the market’s overall direction, say from bull to bear. Rather the market is telling us to expect stunning changes in the entire nature of the world’s economy. And all investors should be listening. 
Trump Win Initially Shocks Global Markets Let’s review this past historic week. On Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning as a Trump victory became ever clearer, stock futures dropped further and further into the red and at their low were down 5 percent. Gold rallied and at its high it was up about 5 percent. 
Then it seemed to dawn on almost all investors at the same moment that whatever you thought about Trump’s temperament, his populist message had carried the day. His economic policies would be hell bent on growth. From climate change to financial regulation, all barriers to growth would be knocked down. And given his real estate background, leverage wouldn’t scare him one bit. 
The thought of major infrastructure projects, tax cuts, less regulation, and a constrained Fed led to a 180-degree turn. Stocks were in, bonds and deflation out. Steady growth was out, leveraged cyclical growth was in. This was a trend that had been trying to take hold since mid-year, but the Trump victory sealed the deal big time. 
Take a look at the chart below. Year Chart Of Caterpillar, FaceBook, Amazon, Rio Tinto 
Four major companies diverged dramatically post-election. Facebook and Amazon sank against the rising market, while Rio, one of the world’s largest commodity producers, and Caterpillar, which as the largest earth-moving company is highly leveraged to infrastructure and mining, soared. Most commodities followed suit. Copper’s weekly gain was one of the largest ever. And from its low in late October, when Trump started to gain in the polls, copper has climbed 15 percent. 
Gold was the other side of the coin. After rising 5 percent on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, the Midas metal turned tail and finished the week down nearly 5 percent. Blame the decline, if you want, on the spike up in bond yields and the strong buck. But as I said above, the market’s dramatic moves signal a lot more than relatively short-term shifts in market leadership. For the record, gold almost always falls at the onset of major market turmoil as investors raise cash to get aboard the new leaders. And when the switch involves investors ditching deflation fears and replacing them with enthusiasm for growth, there’s further reason gold initially was left out in the cold. 
We Are About To Witness A Once In A Century Event But don’t let that obscure the bigger reality. While gold could fall a bit more in coming days and weeks, the table has been set for the next act in a massive – perhaps once-in-a-century – bull market in the metal, as commodity scarcities force the world into a new monetary system with gold at its center. 
America’s plans for infrastructure will likely be followed by similar efforts within the E.U., albeit no doubt reluctantly and with a lag. But the only way the E.U. can remain intact is if it starts to generate growth. Even if Merkel holds on to power, we think Europe will move in this direction, which means infrastructure spending. And if Merkel is defeated or doesn’t run, a big infrastructure push in Europe becomes an even bigger bet. 
But even more to the point, however, is the massive amount the East will be spending on infrastructure. Such spending already has accounted for the uptrend in commodities even prior to the Trump blast-off. 
Speaking of Europe, the biggest infrastructure project on that continent was the Marshall Plan, which after World War II helped build up the economies of war-torn countries, in the process granting the U.S. major trade partners. Many still speak with wonder at the scope of that plan. The Chinese analog, which I talk about a lot, goes by the name of One Belt, One Road (OBOR) or the Silk Road initiative. Whatever you call it, it is massive, by some estimates 12 times the size of the Marshall Plan. Its goal is to connect more than 60 countries, which together have 4.4 billion inhabitants and currently account for nearly 40 percent of the world’s economy . And OBOR is just the start of development in the East. 
OBOR and the ongoing economic activity it will foster will utterly dwarf the impact China’s development already has had on the global economy. China today is the largest consumer of just about all major commodities. Multiply Chinese consumption today by many-fold and you get the long-term message of the past week’s unprecedented stock market turbulence. 
With zigs and zags, for the foreseeable future the market will be trying to price in not just an ordinary bull market in commodities, one in which demand temporarily exceeds supplies, but a bull market powered by fundamental scarcities in basic commodities ranging from copper to zinc to fossil fuels. There will be a scramble for virtually all commodities, even ones that are relatively plentiful, as all will be needed to build out a world relying on new sources of energy. As I have argued before, once you have fundamental scarcities, it is probably too late to switch monetary systems from paper to gold. The time to switch is when these scarcities come into view. What we saw this week was the first sign that this new world is, indeed, within sight. 
The $50 Trillion Project And A New Monetary Order To give you a specific taste of what lies ahead, as the U.S. spends perhaps $1 trillion to repair its crumbling bridges, its ancient water pipes, its highways, and its electric grid, China will be adding 31 percent to its capacity to generate electricity as well as entering into agreements to build ultra-high-voltage grids (another area, along with super computers, in which China leads the world) that allow China to generate power it can transmit to countries ranging from Germany to Japan to India. This electricity will be needed to power electric cars and provide lighting in dense urban areas that have yet to be built. Wang Min, an executive vice president of the government-owned Chinese State Grid, has said ultra-high-voltage power networks can tie together the entire Silk Road by 2050. The cost estimate he gives is $50 trillion, well more than $1 trillion a year. But talking about this in dollars is misleading, indeed, meaningless. 
As commodities grow scarcer, they won’t be available for dollars at all. Enter a new monetary order – and gold. I don’t expect to be around in 2050. But well before then, as signaled by the market this past week, we’re all likely to see Eastern development and the new gold-based monetary system it will spawn emerge as the dominant economic and socio-political stories for years to come. ” ***KWN has now released the extraordinary KWN audio interview with whistleblower Andrew Maguire, where he discusses the gold and silver smash, at what price the large sovereign wholesale bids are located, and much more, and you can listen to it by CLICKING HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW.

25476,Vast Purge in Turkey as Thousands Are Detained in Post-Coup Backlash - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   The Turkish government’s crackdown after a military coup attempt widened into a sweeping purge on Monday, cutting a swath through the security services and reaching deeply into the government bureaucracy and the political and business classes. The sheer numbers being detained or dismissed were stunning: nearly 18, 000 in all, including 6, 000 members of the military, almost 9, 000 police officers, as many as 3, 000 judges, 30 governors and   of all generals and admirals, as well as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s own military attaché. The magnitude of the backlash by Mr. Erdogan suggested that the depth of support for the coup was far greater than it initially appeared, or that the president was using the opportunity to root out all perceived adversaries, or both. As hopes faded that Mr. Erdogan would try to use the moment to unite the country, instead taking a   approach, Western allies began to express alarm at what looked like  . On Monday in Brussels, Secretary of State John Kerry and the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, urged Turkey  —   a member of NATO and a candidate for membership in the European Union  —   to show restraint and preserve the rule of law. “Obviously, NATO also has a requirement with respect to democracy, and NATO will indeed measure very carefully what is happening,” Mr. Kerry said. “And my hope is that Turkey is going to move in ways that do respect what they have said to me many times is the bedrock of their country. ” But for the time, Mr. Erdogan stuck with a   determination to punish anyone deemed disloyal. It was not clear how the state would keep functioning with so many crucial posts suddenly left vacant and paranoia and   rampant. The government suspended vacations for the country’s three million civil servants, an effort that seemed intended to make sure the machinery of the state did not halt. As the purge accelerated on Monday, the government was in particular targeting followers of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally turned rival who lives in exile in Pennsylvania, and whom Mr. Erdogan has blamed for trying to topple the government. A senior Turkish official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with government protocol, said that members of the Gulen movement in the military had been under investigation for some time and that the group had pushed forward the coup conspiracy out of a sense of emergency when they realized they might face prosecution. The suspended judges, the senior official said, were allied with the military faction behind the coup. And like others, the official said, they were actually on lists of suspected enemies compiled by the government even before the coup took place. Turkish officials have acknowledged that the number of people rounded up was likely much greater than the actual roll of conspirators. But they maintain that it is necessary to prevent more attacks against civilians and government buildings, especially while some perpetrators are still at large. In Ankara,   hearings were held for some of the accused plotters. Mr. Erdogan’s almost singular focus on the purges was probably fueled in part by his realization that support for the coup ran deeper in the military than initially thought  —   and by having just barely managed to outmaneuver the plotters. Units from across Turkey’s armed forces, including the air force, the army and the gendarmerie, a   police force, worked simultaneously. The coup plotters waged airstrikes on the Parliament building, shut down bridges and seized top military commanders. Fighter jets were able to refuel in midair. “These were serious people very close to the top of military power,” said Matthew Bryza, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He added, “There is a sense there that the entire Turkish system as we know it was imperiled and narrowly escaped. ” The government’s focus on accusations against Mr. Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the coup, has heightened tensions between the United States and Turkey. Turkish officials have publicly reinstated demands that Mr. Gulen be extradited to Turkey  —   though, according to American officials, no formal judicial request has been made. Some Turkish officials have run with the idea of a global conspiracy, accusing the United States of partnering with Mr. Gulen to orchestrate the coup. John Bass, the American ambassador to Turkey, issued a statement on Monday saying: “Some news reports  —   and, unfortunately, some public figures  —   have speculated that the United States in some way supported the coup attempt. This is categorically untrue, and such speculation is harmful to the   friendship between two great nations. ” Mr. Kerry said Monday that the United States would consider extradition for Mr. Gulen if the Turks “send us evidence, not allegations. ” He continued, “We need to see genuine evidence that withstands the standard of scrutiny that exists in many countries, the system of law with respect to the issue of extradition, and if it meets that standard there’s nothing, there’s no interest we have, in standing in the way of appropriately honoring the treaty that we have with Turkey with respect to extradition. ” Turkey is facing multiple security challenges, including terrorism by the Islamic State and a war with Kurdish militants in the southeast. The upheaval in Turkey’s security services, and the deep divisions within them that the coup attempt laid bare, are likely to affect Turkey’s ability to manage the country’s threats. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters on Monday that the country was “strong enough to eliminate multiple threats at the same time. Turkey is a great country with 100 years of experience. ” Mr. Erdogan reiterated on Monday that the Turkish people had called for the restoration of the death penalty for those involved in the revolt and said that his government would consider it. Turmoil in the Middle East in recent years had made Turkey an essential ally of the West in handling the fallout from the civil war in Syria, battling extremists of the Islamic State and stemming the flow of refugees to Europe. Yet the widespread turmoil inside Turkey’s military now could hamper the country’s ability to remain engaged in those crises, analysts said. The United States had come to see Turkey as a crucial member of the international coalition bombing the jihadists in Iraq and Syria. The Turkish Army is charged with securing the Syrian border, and American military and surveillance jets launch regular missions from Turkey’s Incirlik air base. But two Turkish jets from the base participated in the attempted coup, and the base’s Turkish commander was implicated in the plot, raising questions for American forces about the base’s security. “This will have serious disruption in the way in which the coalition carries out its operations,” said Aaron Stein, a Turkey analyst at the Atlantic Council. The vast scale of the purges, especially among the security forces, has also left Turkish citizens anxious over how the country will maintain stability and order when it is reeling from a string of terrorist attacks by the Islamic State and Kurdish militants. “The president is calling people out to the streets to stand guard against threats, and people are going, but how is this possible when there are active terrorist cells all over the country?” asked Seda Kapici, a lawyer, who was discussing the weekend’s events with a friend at a coffee shop in the Beyoglu district of Istanbul. She added, “Everyone is on edge, and with these purges, I don’t know how people are going to be able to go about their normal lives. ”",1
25484,"Trump’s Immigration Order Jolts Iraqis, U.S.’s Top Allies Against ISIS - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s executive order on immigration is straining relations with the partner the United States needs most to reclaim the Islamic State’s stronghold in Mosul: the Iraqis. Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media because they had not been consulted first. The order blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. That lumps Iraq together with Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, nations with no strategic alliance with Washington. “The effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a   relationship with Iraq,” said Lukman Faily, who completed a   stint as Iraq’s ambassador to Washington in June. “We hope it is a blip. It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard to Iraq. ” Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order. Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship, he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a   conference, he said in a telephone interview from Iraq. The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Trump made during a visit to the C. I. A. this month, in which he said that the United States should have “kept” Iraq’s oil after the   invasion and might still have a chance to do so. More broadly, it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a new plan for stepping up operations against the Islamic State, including by empowering “coalition partners. ” With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul, and with more than 5, 000 American troops in the country, the political support of Baghdad is essential. But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on   relations at a critical stage in the fighting. “My brothers in Iraq’s Army, who I proudly fought with, are fighting ISIS tonight,” Mark Hertling, a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq, wrote on Twitter. “The Iraqi govt is now winning. And we ban their citizens?” The order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects. During the Bush administration, the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement, which calls for close diplomatic, economic and security ties and is still in effect. “If I were an Iraqi, I would be waving this signed agreement in the face of the current administration,” said Ryan C. Crocker, who negotiated the accord and served as the United States ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “It is totally inconsistent. ” Iraqis who are already skeptical about Washington have also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States. Moktada   the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support, accused the United States of “arrogance. ” “So get out U. S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U. S.,” he said on Twitter. To contain the political damage, officials said a   call between Prime Minister Haider   of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be arranged for this week. Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates are covered by the new order. Iraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy in its propaganda to recruit new volunteers. As of early Sunday, the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement. However, individual members and supporters have been sharing the order and news articles about it. Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump’s own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection. “The people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous, and rightly so, that our country is going to turn our backs on them,” said Steve Miska, a retired Army colonel, who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training. “This executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies,” they wrote in a statement issued Sunday. The more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out “extreme vetting” of citizens from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State. The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries, as are American troops. “The president’s actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire,” said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. “The policies validate the terrorists’ claim that we are at war with Islam, and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home. ”",1
25486,YouTube bans ‘Clinton’s black son’,"YouTube bans ‘Clinton’s black son’   Source: wnd 
Danney Williams and Bill Clinton 
NEW YORK –YouTube on Wednesday suspended the account of Danney Williams, the 30-year-old man who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. 
YouTube, citing “repeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines,” declared the account “cannot be restored.” 
The YouTube decision blocked the nine-minute feature “BANISHED – The Untold Story of Danney Williams,” which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. 
Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump’s call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! 
“My YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,” Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube’s decision. “[YouTube] can’t handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.” 
Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the “Banished” video on Danney Williams’ page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : “This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.” 
The video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton’s Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. 
Attempt to silence Danney Williams? 
Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
“The behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney’s account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,” Gilbert said. 
HILL AND BILL EXPOSED AS ‘PARTNERS IN CRIME’– $4.95 TODAY ONLY! $21 discount on No. 1 New York Times bestselling author’s brand-new election blockbuster. 
Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
“The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, ‘to run him off the plantation’ as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor’s mansion in 1990,” Gilbert said. 
“Danney cannot be silenced any longer,” he continued. “Hillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it’s not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.” 
See the Danney Williams video feature: 
WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet.

No definitive DNA test 
WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams’ claim first surfaced. 
Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a “DNA showdown” proving Bill Clinton was not Williams’ father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, “There was no match, nothing even close.” 
But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
“I don’t remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton’s DNA,” Bunton told WND. 
Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. 
He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. 
“We got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,” Bunton recalled to WND. “We thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.” 
The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. 
‘Twitter rules’ 
Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as O’Keefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of “Twitter Rules.” The notice said he “must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users’ private information” or violating “other rules.” In a statement, O’Keefe said he relies on social media to “bypass the media and directly reach the public.” On Monday, O’Keefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block “bizarre.” Earlier this month, O’Keefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn’t show up on Google’s “trending” list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his “Gays for Trump” party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie “I’m Not Ashamed,” about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movie’s entire channel was suspended . 
Among the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friend’s account being censored. Facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schooler’s account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giuliani’s comment that Obama “doesn’t love America.” The admin of a pro-Trump group was banned for saying Trump is not anti-Muslim, but anti-ISIS.

25487,US Uranium Weapons Have Been Used in Syria,"Email 
This month, the Pentagon admitted it has used uranium weapons in attacks inside Syria — violating its public promise last year that it would not use DU there, and contradicting the claim that US bombing is done in defense of the Syrian people, according to the Int’l Campaign to Ban Uranium Weapons . 
Like the Pentagon’s past denials of the dangers of the chemical weapon Agent Orange, US military officials still claim publicly that its uranium weapons are not known to cause health problems. Made from waste uranium-238 — left from H-bomb and reactor fuel production — it is called “depleted” uranium (DU) but is only “depleted” of U-235. Ironically, the best evidence that it is dangerously toxic and radioactive — contrary to press pronouncements — comes from the Pentagon itself. A June 1995 report to Congress by the Army’s Environmental Policy Institute (AEPI) concluded: “Depleted uranium is a radioactive waste and, as such, should be deposited in a licensed repository.” 
Military studies done in 1979, ‘90, ‘93, ‘95 and ‘97, make clear that uranium weapons are chemically toxic, alpha-radiation-emitting poisons that are a danger to target populations and to invading/occupying US forces alike. In spite of this cautionary written record, the military has been shooting its radioactive waste all over the world: into population centers in Iraq in 1991 (380 tons), in Afghanistan in 2001 (amounts unknown); in Bosnia in 1994-‘95 (five tons); in Kosovo in 1999 (10 tons), in Iraq again in 2003 (170 tons); and now in Syria. 
The AEPI report above also says that DU has the potential to generate “significant medical consequences” if it enters the body. The Army’s Office of the Surgeon General, in its Aug. 16, 1993 “Depleted Uranium Safety Training Manual,” says that the expected effects of DU exposure include a possible increase of cancer, and kidney damage. The manual also warns, “When soldiers inhale or ingest DU dust, they incur a potential increase in cancer risk … (lung or bone) and kidney damage.” 
The Army’s Mobility Equipment, Research & Development Command reported way back in 1979 that, “Not only the people in the immediate vicinity but also people at distances downwind from the fire are faced with potential over exposure to air-borne uranium dust.” This uranium “dust” is generated when DU shells hit and burn through hard targets like tanks or armored vehicles. The uranium is spread for miles by the wind, contaminating everything is its path including food, water, soil, schools, hospitals, etc., and DU is radioactive forever, or ten times 4.5 billion years, whichever comes first. 
In 1990, the Army’s Armaments, Munitions and Chemical Command radiological task group said that DU is a “low level alpha radiation emitter … linked to cancer when exposures are internal, [and] chemical toxicity causing kidney damage.” It added that “there is no dose so low that the probability of effect is zero.” 
With evidence of its radio-toxicity so clear and redundant, any use of uranium weapons today appears to flaunt the military’s own Field Manual prohibition — absolute and universal — against the use of poison or poisoned weapons. 
Historical Disregard Revisited 
The military has a long history of deliberately exposing US citizens and others to deadly risks without their knowledge or consent, beginning with the open-air nuclear bomb tests it knew would contaminate vast areas. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chose not to evacuate or even warn downwind populations it knew would be hard-hit by radioactive fallout. (“Fallout risk near atom tests was known, documents show,” New York Times, March 15, 1995) These bomb tests exposed Nevada Test Site workers to levels of radiation that the AEC knew could cause harm, but the agency chose not to reduce workers’ exposures or to even inform them of the risks because doing so would have scandalized and halted the bombing tests. (“Records say workers faced high radiation: Suit contends US used no safeguards,” St. Paul Pioneer Press, Dec. 14, 1989) 
Likewise, the government refused to inform some 600,000 H-bomb factory workers that workplace radiation exposures posed serious health risks, although enough was known about radiation to warn them in 1948. (“N-plant workers not told of risks: Report says US arms program exposed many to radiation,” Associated Press, Dec. 19, 1989) Between 1944 and 1974, “medicalized” human radiation experiments were even conducted on unwitting US citizens, 16,000 of them (The Plutonium Files, by Eileen Welsome). 
Today, the Pentagon extends this ghastly history into Syria where it is deliberately exposing human beings to weaponized radiation that it knows can cause cancer and other diseases. As if the undeclared, unconstitutional war in Syria weren’t unlawful enough, now add the crime of using poison in violation of military law and the Hague Regulations of War on Land. 
It is so easy to prove that DU is poison, that a group of four non-lawyers, myself included, convinced a Minneapolis jury in 2004 that AlliantTechsystems’ manufacture of the shells is unlawful enough to excuse an otherwise illegal trespass; our minor offense was justified in order to prevent the greater harm of DU weapons production. Like torture, the use of such poison in war is always criminal, akin to gas war. This latest US government war crime must be condemned in the harshest terms.

25488,"Paula Fox, Novelist Who Chronicled Dislocation, Dies at 93 - The New York Times","Paula Fox, a distinguished writer for children and adults whose work illuminated lives filled with loss, dislocation and abandonment, conditions she knew firsthand from a very early age, died on Wednesday in Brooklyn. She was 93. Her death, at a hospital near her home, was confirmed by her daughter, Linda  . Ms. Fox wrote a   novels for adults and more than 20 books for young people. What united her output was a cool, elegant style that was haunting in its   economy minute observation masterly control of tone and pacing and an abiding concern with dissolution  —   of family, of home, of health, of trust. Her characters are complex,   and often withdrawn, but their ruminative interior states lend the narratives a quiet luminosity. Ms. Fox’s   novel for adults is “Desperate Characters” (1970) about the disintegration of a marriage. It was made into a film of the same title, released the next year and starring Shirley MacLaine and Kenneth Mars. She was awarded the Newbery Medal, considered the Pulitzer Prize of children’s literature, in 1974 for “The Slave Dancer,” a controversial novel centered on the Atlantic slave trade in the   century. Her work also includes two memoirs: “Borrowed Finery” (2001) about her peripatetic childhood, and “The Coldest Winter: A Stringer in Liberated Europe” (2005) about her young womanhood. Ms. Fox’s bibliography took readers from cradle to grave, something few other writers have done. It includes picture books for young children, like “Traces” (2008) a poem, illustrated by Karla Kuskin, about the evanescent signs  —   think of footprints and vapor trails  —   left by unseen visitors. It also includes many titles for   readers and teenagers, among them “Blowfish Live in the Sea” (1970) about a child’s journey to visit the father he has never met “  Cat” (1984) about the painful consequences of a boy’s casual shot with an air rifle and “The Eagle Kite” (1995) about a boy whose father has AIDS. Because so much of Ms. Fox’s work was for young people, her fiction for adults was sometimes overlooked. In 1984, The Nation described her as “one of our most intelligent (and least appreciated) contemporary novelists. ” In later years, however, her adult books enjoyed something of a renaissance, thanks largely to the efforts of the novelist Jonathan Franzen, who became an ardent champion after devouring an    copy of “Desperate Characters” he had come across by chance. A new edition of “Desperate Characters,” with an introduction by Mr. Franzen, was published by W. W. Norton  Company in 1999. Ms. Fox’s other adult novels  —   among them “The Widow’s Children,” “A Servant’s Tale” and “The God of Nightmares”  —   have also been   by Norton, with introductions by writers including Frederick Busch, Andrea Barrett and Rosellen Brown. As a stylist, she was known for her impeccable, almost anatomical, depictions of the material world. In the Paula Fox universe, objects take on heightened importance, as if rearing up to fill the gaps left by characters’ failure to make real connections. This is painfully evident in the opening scene of “Desperate Characters,” which examines the brittle marriage of a professional couple  —   yuppies long before the term was coined  —   living in a fine Brooklyn home: “Mrs. and Mrs. Otto Bentwood drew out their chairs simultaneously. As he sat down, Otto regarded the straw basket which held slices of French bread, an earthenware casserole filled with sautéed chicken livers, peeled and sliced tomatoes on an oval willowware platter Sophie had found in a Brooklyn Heights antique shop, and risotto Milanese in a green ceramic bowl. A strong light, somewhat softened by the stained glass of a Tiffany shade, fell upon this repast. ” In the pages that follow, Sophie is bitten by a stray cat, an event that sets in motion the dissolution of her marriage to Otto. The great risk of being alive, nearly all of Ms. Fox’s work seemed to say, is that anything can happen to anyone at any time. Paula Fox was born in Manhattan on April 22, 1923, to parents who did not want her. Her father, Paul Hervey Fox, was an undistinguished novelist and playwright who earned his living as a script doctor. Her mother, the former Elsie de Sola, of Spanish and Cuban extraction, was young, vain, cold “and ungovernable in her haste to have done with me,” as Ms. Fox wrote in “Borrowed Finery. ” Paul and Elsie floated through the 1920s and ’30s in a sea of alcohol, Hollywood parties and European travel, none of which, they made plain, was best experienced with a child in tow. When Paula was a few days old, she was left, at her mother’s insistence, in a foundling hospital. From there, she embarked on her itinerant young life, bouncing among a series of friends, relatives and strangers across the country and in Cuba, where she lived for a time on a sugar plantation with her grandmother. Periodically, her parents would turn up, and Paula would be returned to their dubious care. By the time she was 16, she was more or less on her own. There was one happy interlude. When Paula was 5 months old, she was taken in by a stranger, the Rev. Elwood Amos Corning, in a small Hudson Valley town aptly named Balmville, N. Y. A kind, scholarly man who lived with his mother, Mr. Corning taught Paula about books and nature and history. She lived with him till she was 6, when her parents swooped down and parceled her out somewhere else. Ms. Fox studied piano briefly at the Juilliard School in Manhattan and later attended Columbia University. She held a series of odd jobs, including modeling, reporting on the postwar reconstruction of Poland for a British news service and teaching emotionally disturbed children. As a teenager, Ms. Fox had what she referred to as a “brief, disastrous marriage” her second marriage, to Richard Sigerson, ended in divorce. In 1962, she married Martin Greenberg, a brother of the art critic Clement Greenberg. They had met when Martin, then an editor at Commentary magazine, rejected a story Ms. Fox had submitted. Critical response to Ms. Fox’s work over the years was largely favorable, though there was sometimes dissent. Her Newbery Medal for “The Slave Dancer” inspired a protest at the awards ceremony that year: The novel, which tells the story of a white New Orleans youth conscripted to play the fife on a slave ship in the 1840s, had been condemned by some reviewers for portraying the captured African slaves as a passive, undifferentiated group. In 1997, while visiting Jerusalem, Ms. Fox was mugged and suffered serious brain injury. The incident, she said afterward, prompted her to begin writing her first memoir, “Borrowed Finery. ” Her recovery was so arduous that it took her a year to write the book’s first 10 pages. At the end of “Borrowed Finery,” Ms. Fox tells of being reunited with the daughter she had borne at 20, the offspring of a brief liaison after her first marriage had ended. She gave the infant up for adoption, a decision, she wrote, that pained her the rest of her life. In middle age, the daughter, Ms.   found Ms. Fox. (One of Ms.  ’s children, it transpired, is the rock singer Courtney Love.) Besides Ms.   Ms. Fox is survived by her husband, Mr. Greenberg a son, Adam Sigerson, from her second marriage a half sister, Louise Fox three half brothers, Keith, Bruce and James eight grandchildren and 10  . Ms. Fox’s other honors include the Hans Christian Andersen Award, which she received in 1978 for her body of children’s work. Given the subject matter of Ms. Fox’s books, it is not surprising that some reviewers called them depressing. This did not sit well with her. “Children know about pain and fear and unhappiness and betrayal,” she said in an interview quoted in the reference work Contemporary Authors. “And we do them a disservice by trying to sugarcoat dark truths. There is an odd kind of debauchery I’ve noticed, particularly in societies that consider themselves ‘democratic’ or ‘liberal’: They display the gory details but hide meaning, especially if it is ambiguous or disturbing. ”",1
25489,"Ronald Lauder, Advocate of Art Restitution, Says His Museum Holds a Clouded Work - The New York Times","When it comes to art plundered in Europe during World War II, Ronald S. Lauder, chairman of the Commission for Art Recovery, has been very much the face, and soul, of the restitution movement. In June, he was center stage at a Senate hearing on a bill to ease the way for the return of art looted by the Nazis, testifying alongside the actress Helen Mirren, who last year starred in “Woman in Gold,” a film about a Jewish heir’s struggle to retrieve her family’s stolen possessions. Away from the spotlight, though, Mr. Lauder has been criticized for more than a decade by other restitution advocates and scholars. They say his own practices in detailing the provenance of works within a Manhattan museum he   the nonprofit Neue Galerie, and his private collection have not been as transparent as they should be. Now there are signs Mr. Lauder has heard the criticism. To elevate their research, he and his staff have hired additional experts, are overhauling the museum’s website to ensure that provenances are more detailed and soon plan to announce a surprising byproduct of their labors: One of the Neue Galerie’s major works has a clouded history and may be returned to people who say they are the rightful owners. Mr. Lauder, 72, would not identify the piece or its creator during an interview, saying that negotiations on its return were being finalized. He did say he was surprised that a work with a disputed provenance had made it into the museum, which focuses on art created in Austria and Germany from 1890 to 1940. The Neue Galerie’s collection includes major works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele and was assembled largely from art donated by Mr. Lauder, an heir to the cosmetics fortune created by his mother, Estée Lauder, and by his friend Serge Sabarsky, an art dealer and expert on German and Austrian Expressionist art who died in 1996. “If you asked me a year ago, ‘Do we have everything there?’ I would have said yes, because that is what I was told,” he said of the museum’s provenance research at the time. “I was told there were no questions about the pieces we had. ” Others would not be so surprised. Soon after opening the museum in 2001 in a Fifth Avenue mansion that was once home to the society doyenne Grace Vanderbilt, wife of Cornelius Vanderbilt III, Mr. Lauder faced criticism that the provenances listed for many works were incomplete. He asked for patience. “We are only 12 to 14 months old, and it is taking us more time to get going and do the research necessary,” he said then. A review last week showed only minor progress. The museum, for example, still posts few dates for when its holdings changed hands  —   crucial information, according to experts. Given the extent of Nazi looting and the art sales made by Jews under duress in the years leading up to and through World War II, any work that was transferred from one party to another in Europe during that period typically receives the highest level of scrutiny. “You would think that his gallery would be the most transparent, but it provides the minimal amount of information, which I do find surprising,” said Elizabeth Karlsgodt, an associate professor of history at the University of Denver and an expert on Nazi art looting. Ms. Karlsgodt added, “If his collection is entirely clean, the museum website should prove it with more detailed provenance information. ” Marc Masurovsky, who jointly founded the Holocaust Art Restitution Project in 1997, said his group has long wanted to assess Mr. Lauder’s private collection but was told that Mr. Lauder was unwilling to participate. “We hit a stone wall,” Mr. Masurovsky recalled. “The question for us is whether he did due diligence to make sure his collection is as clean as driven snow. ” Mr. Lauder has long said that he viewed his staff’s research as thorough and that few claims to his art have arisen despite the many times it has been displayed in public. But he asked Agnes Peresztegi, a   lawyer and expert on Holocaust era property claims, in recent months to seek more information on the museum’s holdings, including more detailed provenances. “I am not happy because I think we should have had more information,” Mr. Lauder said in the interview, “and we are doing it. ” Ms. Peresztegi, who is president of the Commission for Art Recovery, said of the Neue Galerie, “I can’t deny that there are museums whose websites are more forthcoming than the museum’s. ” Ms. Peresztegi said that a decision was made at the museum six or seven years ago not to display transfer dates until a full provenance for a work became available. Under its new policies, the museum will post provenance information piecemeal as soon as it has it, officials said. It is repairing a link between the gallery’s database and its website that has been broken for about two years  —   a break, officials said, that had prevented a more timely updating of information. Mr. Lauder has been on a mission to restitute art since the late 1980s. He has been chairman of the Commission for Art Recovery since it was formed in 1997 to negotiate with governments, museums and other entities as part of the effort to retrieve art wrongfully taken from Jews by the Third Reich and its allies. Over the years, Mr. Lauder says, he has returned three works from his personal collection because of concerns over their rightful ownership. But now, for the first time, he is faced with the prospect of returning an artwork held by the museum. All Ms. Peresztegi would say about the work in question was: “The Neue Galerie is in the process of evaluating the provenance information of an artwork, and discussion about restitution is currently ongoing. ” In the past, Mr. Lauder faced criticism that he did not do enough as a board member of the Museum of Modern Art to chastise the institution for fighting to hold onto works by Schiele and by George Grosz that were claimed as looted art. In both cases, Mr. Lauder recused himself and said he refrained from taking a vocal position because he was chairman of MoMA when the claims arose. But he said that he worked behind the scenes to push the museum to consider the claims fairly. Regarding the Grosz art, which involved a claim to three works, he said he also asked a lawyer for the Commission for Art Recovery to review the case. The commission ended up filing a legal brief in support of the plaintiffs, who were suing to recover the art. Jennifer Kreder, a lawyer who helped write the brief, said: “Ronald Lauder has possibly accomplished more behind the scenes for the restitution of   art than any other single person. ” (In the Grosz case, MoMA ultimately prevailed with a legal victory. As for the Schiele painting, “Portrait of Wally,” the Vienna museum that had lent it to MoMA retained the work as part of a settlement under which it paid $19 million to the heirs of the woman from whom it had been stolen by a Nazi.) Ray Dowd, a lawyer for heirs of Fritz Grünbaum, a Viennese art collector and cabaret performer who was killed by the Nazis, said Mr. Lauder’s representatives had stonewalled when he sought the return of a Schiele drawing, “I Love Antitheses. ” “The evidence is particularly strong,” he said, “that the drawing was stolen from Mr. Grünbaum, but they jerked us around and said they would not give us any information on how it was acquired. ” Mr. Lauder confirmed through a spokesman that he owns “I Love Antitheses” and would only say, “The cornerstone of the Grünbaum matter is an internal family inheritance dispute. ” These days, Mr. Lauder said he has all but stopped buying German and Austrian Expressionist art. There are often provenance questions associated with the period, he said, and he has plenty of such works. And, he added, sellers who identify him as a prospective buyer with a passion for that period often try to charge higher prices. Years ago, when he was buying Expressionist works, Mr. Lauder said, the provenance information available was much less reliable than what exists today on the internet. Still, Mr. Lauder said he was determined to make the Neue Galerie’s provenance research a gold standard for the art world. During the interview, he said he recognized that, given his profile as a restitution advocate, he will continue to be subject to greater scrutiny. “When you walk around with a white suit on, anything shows on it,” he said. “I understand that. ”",1
25493,Divided Aleppo Plunges Back Into War as Syrian Hospital Is Hit - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Syria’s divided city of Aleppo plunged back into the kind of   war not seen in months on Thursday, witnesses and health workers said, as they reeled from government airstrikes that demolished a hospital in the   side and from retaliatory mortar assaults by rebels on the   side. At least 27 people, including three children and six staff members, were reported killed in the strike on the hospital, which turned it into a smoking pile of rubble on Wednesday night, and 20 were reported killed in airstrikes on Thursday. At least 14 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the mortar attacks on   areas, said officials at a hospital where casualties were streaming in throughout the day on Thursday. The deadly destruction in Aleppo punctuated a drastic escalation in fighting over the past week that has shattered a partial truce in a war that has consumed Syria for more than five years. The escalation also threatened to derail renewed attempts at peace talks in Geneva by the United Nations, and could disrupt or stop humanitarian aid to besieged parts of the country, affecting millions of people, relief officials said. “I could not in any way express how high the stakes are for the next hours and days,” Jan Egeland, the United Nations special adviser on Syria aid, said on Thursday in Geneva as the scope of the destruction in Aleppo became clearer. Once Syria’s commercial center, Aleppo has been an intermittent combat zone for much of the war, split into insurgent and government halves. It had enjoyed somewhat of a respite because of the partial    —   until now. The scream of jet fighters and thud of shelling could be heard everywhere from Wednesday night into Thursday, residents and aid workers said. Panic and anguish were visible on both sides of the city. There was no indication that the Syrian government forces of President Bashar   and their Russian allies were any closer to retaking the entire city. But it had become apparent in recent days that the truce was unraveling in the surrounding area, with more airstrikes by the government and increased shelling by rebels. About 200 people, most of them civilians, have been killed, according to tallies by local news media and activists on both sides. The location of Al Quds hospital, the destroyed facility on the rebel side of the city, was well known, and the hospital was assisted by the international charity Doctors Without Borders. “This devastating attack has destroyed a vital hospital in Aleppo, and the main referral center for pediatric care in the area,” the head of the charity’s Syria mission, Muskilda Zancada, said in a statement. “Where is the outrage among those with the power and obligation to stop this carnage?” Russia’s military denied it was responsible. Two hospitals in the town of Maarat   to the east, including one working with Doctors Without Borders, were hit on the same day earlier this year, each by multiple strikes. Groups such as Physicians for Human Rights have tracked what they call a pattern of deliberate targeting of health services by government forces. Witnesses contended that the same appeared to be true in the strike on Al Quds hospital, in the neighborhood of Sukkari. “Those were multiple airstrikes targeting the same area with less than   gaps,” Adnan Hadad, an opposition journalist, said shortly after returning from the scene. The International Committee of the Red Cross called on all parties to stop indiscriminate attacks and to avoid harming civilians, or Aleppo would face what it called a new humanitarian disaster. “Wherever you are, you hear explosions of mortars, shelling and planes flying over,” said Valter Gros, who heads the Red Cross’s Aleppo office. “Everyone here fears for their lives and nobody knows what is coming next. ” By Thursday afternoon, outlets on both sides were reporting deadly new government airstrikes on the   neighborhoods of Bustan   and Kalaseh. Videos showed concrete apartment blocks with their facades sheared off in Bustan   where three children were reported killed one man carried away a boy with the top of his head missing as another man embraced a    girl found alive. Videos from the   side showed a street scene of damaged buildings and a motionless boy in an ambulance. By nightfall, there was no sign that the attacks had stopped. Mr. Hadad, on the   side, reported one of the new strikes had hit a bakery, and on the   side, shelling and gunfire could be heard in the distance. In government territory, casualties from rebel shelling streamed into Al Razi hospital as the wail of ambulance sirens mixed with the thud of explosions in the city streets. Most of the wounded were civilians, including at least three children who were killed, but some were members of the military. A wounded soldier writhed on the ground, kicking and yelling as a commander comforted him. A man walked down a corridor, carrying his limping son. “We will kill them today,” he shouted to a reporter. Hassan Anees, the hospital’s executive director, said violence had been rising steadily through the week. Mr. Anees said the rebels appeared to have started using more powerful munitions since the   crumbled in the city over a week ago. “First it was mortars, then it was gas canister bombs, and now it is missiles,” he said. As he spoke the rattle of gunfire drifted through his office window, a reminder that the nearest front line was about half a mile from the hospital. On the   side, much of the Quds hospital building had collapsed, and in videos and photographs after the attack, bodies could be seen pinned under rubble and what looked like the metal frames of beds. A man rushed from the scene carrying the limp body of a small girl in pink clothing, her skin gray with the dust of pulverized concrete. Another girl in pink, her eyes glassy with tears, clung to the shoulder of a man in a red tank top who howled in grief, “Those are my family! I lost my family!” The hospital was hit when it was already full of victims from government shelling, Hadi Abdullah, an opposition journalist, reported in a video from the scene, in which a medical worker said that three of his colleagues had been killed. One of them was Mohammad Wassim Mo’az, known by his nickname Abu Abdulrahman, the only pediatrician in the area. A dentist, Ahmad Abulyaman, was also killed. “I’m crying,” Louay Barakat, a journalist and photographer, said by phone after visiting the scene. “My baby’s doctor died. About 11 nurses and hospital staff died. Most of them are my friends. ” The hospital was the main referral center for pediatrics, with eight doctors, 28 nurses, an emergency room, intensive care unit and operating room, all now destroyed. In another area, a small boy was captured on video crying over the body of his brother, calling him “the love of my father. ” Stroking his body, he said, “I wish it was me, not you. ”",1
25494,Shootings Further Divide a Nation Torn Over Race - The New York Times,"First came the cellphone video of an   man being fatally shot by a Louisiana police officer, and the astonishing live feed of a Minnesota woman narrating the police killing of her   boyfriend during a traffic stop. Then came the horrific live television coverage of police officers being gunned down by a sniper at a march protesting the police shootings. And suddenly, the panoply of fears and resentments that have made this a foreboding summer had been brought into sharp relief. Police accountability and racial bias have been at the center of the civic debate since August 2014, when a black teenager was killed by a white officer in Ferguson, Mo. a suburb of St. Louis. Mass murders in Newtown, Conn. Charleston, S. C. Orlando, Fla. and too many other locales have revived gun violence as a social issue and national shame. Both black anger at police killings and the boiling frustrations of some whites who feel they are ceding their   place in society have been constant undercurrents in politics since January and the Iowa presidential caucuses. Now, in the space of three days, the killings of two black men by Louisiana and Minnesota police officers and the retaliatory murders of five Dallas officers, this time by a black Army veteran, have coalesced all those concerns into a single expression of national angst. In the midst of one of the most consequential presidential campaigns in memory, those convulsive events raised the prospect of still deeper divides in a country already torn by racial and ideological animus. Since the Thursday night sniper attack the national conversation has swung between bitterness and despair over seemingly unbridgeable gulfs in society. The New York Post’s front page blared “CIVIL WAR. ” The Drudge Report warned in a headline that “Black Lives Kill. ” Some Minnesota protesters on Thursday night chanted, “Kill the police. ” Police officers and sociologists alike say that racial tension is approaching a point last seen during the street riots that swept urban American in the late 1960s when disturbances erupted in places like the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts and Detroit and Newark, during summers of deep discontent. “Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when there was a lot of tension around policing and civil rights and the antiwar movement, we’d never seen anything like what happened in Dallas,” said Darrel W. Stephens, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and an instructor at the Public Safety Leadership Program in the School of Education at Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Stephens and other police officials said that departments were increasingly schooling officers in ways to avoid and defuse violent encounters with minorities. But other experts said the parade of cellphone videos depicting shootings of black men have only reinforced  ’ conviction that little has changed in six decades. “There is a constant bombardment of images of brutality against   and not just brutality, but   brutality,” said Paul Butler, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. This week’s videos, he said, were particularly devastating. “It’s visceral,” he said. “It hits you in the gut. It’s emotional and graphic, so it makes you feel worse. ” There are some parallels today to the 1960s. Those riots were largely touched off by violent encounters between blacks and the police. Scholars say and statistics show that attacks on police officers became an increasingly frequent   response to decades of inequality and mistreatment at that time. The Kerner Commission, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson, reported in 1968 that “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white  —   separate but unequal. ” And a white backlash became a driving force in the presidential campaign that year that saw a   Republican, Richard M. Nixon, end eight years of Democratic rule. Whether this week’s violence presages a repeat of that history is, of course, an unknown, as the nation’s first black president nears the end of two terms in office and the two political parties move toward their national conventions this month. But racial tensions are clearly rising. A June survey by the Pew Research Center found that only 46 percent of whites surveyed thought that race relations were generally good, a sharp drop from the 66 percent who held that opinion in June 2009, shortly after Mr. Obama took office. For blacks, the corresponding decline  —   to 34 percent last month from 59 percent in 2009  —   was even steeper. The same Pew survey found that about   of   thought that blacks in their communities were treated less fairly by the police than were whites a bare 35 percent of whites felt the same. In the hours after the Dallas ambush, stunned officials and civic leaders pleaded for citizens to repair the rips in the nation’s social fabric. “Our profession is hurting,” said the Dallas police chief, David O. Brown, who is  . “Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken. There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city. All I know is that this must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens. ” The Rev. Bryan Carter echoed him at a Friday memorial service for the fallen officers, saying: “We refuse to hate each other. We commit to pray together. ” President Obama, speaking on Friday from Warsaw, where he was attending a   NATO summit meeting, said of the police, “Today is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices they make for us. ” He called the attack a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. ” In a presidential race in which racial and ethnic divisions have become an issue, both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump canceled political events on Friday. Mr. Trump called the events in Texas “an attack on our country. ” “It is a coordinated, premeditated assault on the men and women who keep us safe,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “We must restore law and order. ” Mrs. Clinton wrote on Twitter on Friday, “I mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families and all who serve with them. ” But on social media, there were salutes to the sniper, blame of the news media for dividing the nation, charges that black protesters had spread hysteria, calls for love, fear of civil war and laments that the country is headed toward an unbridgeable divide. Some activists said their movement would press on, demanding that the police be accountable. Aislinn Sol, a Black Lives Matter organizer in Chicago, said, “The disproportionate   violence against   has not changed,” adding, “What we have seen is a change in the response. ” In interviews, a number of police officials said that they believed the only lasting solution to the violence and division was to end the glaring inequalities that fuel them, but that they saw little hope for that. “We’re the most heavily armed violent society in the history of Western civilization and we dump this duty on   ” in police departments, Ed Flynn, the police chief in Milwaukee, said in an interview before Thursday’s killings. “The problem for American policing is we’re learning the hard way that our political establishment finds it far easier to develop a constituency at the expense of our police than to solve these social problems. ” Perhaps it was Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch who captured the day’s mood. “This has been a week of profound grief and heartbreaking loss,” she said on Friday. “After the events of this week, Americans across our country are feeling a sense of helplessness, of uncertainty and of fear. ” “We must reject the easy impulses of bitterness and rancor,” she added, “and embrace the difficult work  —   but the important work, the vital work  —   of finding a path forward together. ”",1
25495,Postmodern Stalinism,"BY EDITORS OF CHRONICLES MAGAZINE While this is an interesting post, we object to the facile use of the term “Stalin” to signify something unjustifiably tyrannical, invasive and dictatorial. The Stalin period is surely one of the most complex in modern history, as Stalin ruled the Soviet Union under conditions of extreme Western hostility and outright warfare against the young socialist federation for most of his tenure. Yet, there is little doubt that Josef Stalin was—for all his flaws, real and mostly invented and augmented—a firm and colossal enemy of capitalism, a formidable obstacle to the victory of the “Wall Street way of life” around the globe and that he did succeed in shaping the USSR into a superpower capable of surviving and rendering help to weaker nations shedding brutal Western colonialism. That, and not the “crimes of Stalin” is the real source for the undying hatred and nonstop shabby malicious slandering we observe to this day against his legacy (the demonization of Putin, a much milder irritant to the Washington elites should give us some insight into the depths of this imposture) both in the corporate media and political class, but unworthy of repetition among people who should know better or who like to think of themselves as leftist. What use is the anti-communist left in a world on the brink of extinction because of a semi-deranged, hegemonic-at-all-costs runaway imperialism?—P. Greanville Dateline: October 27, 2016 In his latest Sputnik Radio International interview Srdja Trifkovic discusses the Czech Republic government’s establishment of an information unit to counter what it says is pro-Russian, anti-Western and anti-NATO propaganda. “We want to get into every smartphone,” said Milan Chovanec, the Czech interior minister. Audio (unedited verbatim transcript) Klaus: Speaking truth to the annoyance of the NATO-bought political prostitutes running the Czech state these days. ST: It is strangely reminiscent of the old Soviet times, when any criticism of Soviet policies was termed “anti-Soviet propaganda,” and was ascribed to some mysterious imperialist forces in the West that were out to subvert the Soviet Union and its “Fraternal Community of Socialist Nations.” It is rather funny that—more than a quarter of a century after the end of the Cold War—we see the exact replica of the mindset, and a state-financed reaction, on the side of the so-called liberal-democratic, free-market-oriented, “Western” members of NATO. It is also significant that one of the foremost critics of the Western policies in general, and in Ukraine in particular, is Vaclav Klaus, one of the most respected Czech politicians. My immediate thought is whether they regard Mr. Klaus—the elder statesman of the Czech Republic—as one of the exponents of the Russian propaganda who needs to be monitored and countered. My second thought is that, ultimately, it comes to the quality of information and analysis. If the makers of this new unit, fighting what they regard as Russian disinformation, are up against certain perfectly justified, rational, and well-reasoned criticism of Western policies, and those of NATO in particular, then they have a big problem. In this time and age, of the mainstream media being confronted by the social media, the Internet, they will have a problem, because the unspoken assumption is that the quality of information and analysis they can offer is better than what they regard as the Russian propaganda. As it happens, we have this counter-propaganda all the time, in the pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post , on the BBC, the CNN, and every flickering screen and every printed page all over the Western world. And yet . . . they are not doing a very good job. Ultimately, if we are looking at an informed and rational consumer of information, he or she will be able to make an astute judgment of who is in the right and who is actually a propagandist. Q: Srdja, if they consider this to be so important at this particular moment, why is this unit made up of only twenty people? ST: It could made up of only two people if they are well informed, capable of top-class analysis, and if they have strong arguments which can be used to counter what they regard as Russian disinformation. It boils down to what I mentioned earlier: the quality of information, and the quality of analysis. Q: Is it going to have any influence on anything at all? ST: Ultimately not. Obviously, the same job is being done by much better paid columnists of the Washington Post , the Guardian , Le Monde , the Frankfurter Rundschau —they are all up to the same thing: to discredit arguments against the global empire of the United States and its fellow travelers in Western Europe. If that job is not done much better by people who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros every year to do it in a systematic and coherent way, I don’t see any way for a bunch of twenty Czech bureaucrats to do it. Q: Let’s get back to the accusations that some Czech politicians have been throwing at Moscow, that they are forming the networks of pro-Russian groups that can be used to destabilize the country. How grounded are these accusations? ST: It reminds one of McCarthyism in the United States in the early 1950’s. If you are a “deviant” in your mindset, if you dare criticize the official line, if you say things that are outside the permitted parameters of rightspeak, then you must be an agent for a foreign power. It is a paranoid mindset, it is deeply antidemocratic, and it smacks of Stalinism. This is, of course, Stalinism in a postmodern-liberal guise, but it is not qualitatively different from the original model.

25498,Globalization Expressway to Universal Slavery,"If humans were largely moral and ethical beings, then globalization could be a workable proposition. Unfortunately, the dark behavioral narcissism expressed by compulsive greed and an infinite appetite for power seems to have become the guiding precept of our collective nightmare. If only the desire to dominate others and have a lot more than them were not the prime motivations for the global elite on top of the human food chain, we could all have our respective modest slice of happiness on this planet. The Utopia of globalization through institutions such as the United Nations (UN), World Bank , and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was supposed to eradicate the universal pestilence of war, extreme poverty , hunger and slavery using the might of the above supranational institutions to prevent the rise of so-called rogue nations usually ruled by dictators.
World order of chaos with misery for profit
The opportunity of this push for a supranational form of government has to be understood in the psychological context of a world traumatized by World War II. Many public servants, who had fought against the Nazis and their Japanese and Italian allies, had genuinely the best intentions at heart when institutions like the UN were set up. If some of the original ideas were good and moral to some extend, a rot almost immediately contaminated and perverted most of the created institutions and quickly — using the pretext of the Cold War — allowed the birth of a monstrosity such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ). The globalists have controlled and ultimately Wall Street has financed, supranational government instances such as the UN, IMF, World Bank and a myriad of non-governmental organization (NGO) little helpers. Not only have these done nothing to curtail the man-made disasters of war, climate change , slavery and poverty, but they have exacerbated them, all for the sake of profit.
In this Orwellian time of moral decay, human misery is good for business. In a globalization controlled by Wall Street’s puppeteer sociopaths, who believe they are the masters of the universe, ordinary people everywhere have become canon fodder and slave labor. They are not even collateral damage but human lubricant, as viewed by the elite. One can see that if they are not stopped immediately, trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and its Trans-Atlantic counterpart could seal the deal of the establishment of an atrocious world government, controlled by a few thousands, in complete disregard of not only national interest, but also cultural diversity.
Look what happened to Detroit, Michigan, and countless other manufacturing towns in the United States that are all collateral damage of Bill Clinton’s North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The massive trade agreements in the works, to be put in place by the globalists if they remain in power, are intended to annihilate any form of economic or political independence from the signatory countries and to scatter their populations to the wind, as in the case in the globalist-controlled demolition of the Middle East in Iraq, Libya and Syria. Displaced and disenfranchised populations are beaten into submission and used as docile worker bees.
Drastic action or hell on earth
If we let the globalists complete their worldwide coup already in progress, then all sovereignty would be lost, and most of the world’s population would become slave-wage laborers at the mercy of the global corporate empire. Countries with a diversified agriculture would be turned into one-crop wastelands to ensure that most of the food supply has to be imported. Pseudo local governments would merely officiate as the slave drivers for the global elite. This must be stopped at all cost and undone by all means necessary. If we allow this final coup by the geriatric psychopaths at the top of the current world order, thousands of years of our rich human experience would be wiped out. Like poorly made cheap electronic products, the cultural garbage of the lowest common denominator empire would flood the world. This cultural homogenization would affect primarily the information available to people. Since dissent is impossible without correct information and critical thought, the globalists want their propaganda to become the only source of information. With the UN, the World Bank and the IMF, the political and economic framework financed by a worldwide network of banksters is already in place. Influential nations, on paper, like France and the United Kingdom, which are still officially full fledged members of the UN Security Council, have de facto abdicated their sovereignty to become vassals and secondary enforcers of the globalist plan. We are at the edge of an existential threat of greater magnitude than ever before in human history.
The semantics of deception
Machiavelli is known for his cynical view of political power; however, the advice the author of The Prince gave to the powerful of his time seems innocent by comparison to the depravity of today’s puppet masters. Words and ideas are gutted of their meaning to signify, most of the time, the exact opposite. For example, globalist eminence grise George Soros’ Open Society Foundation is an opaque giant NGO, with more than 100 offshoots worldwide by its own admission, but its tentacles are in reality more far reaching. The recent publications of Wikileaks in the voluminous Podesta email files have been a revelation of the extent of deception victimizing United States citizens. John Podesta may be viewed as a Soros right-hand man in the US in charge of delivering the returns for the globalist’s investments in the US elections. The connection between the two men is not only obvious but also official considering that Soros financed Podesta’s so-called Center for American Progress, the fake left equivalent of the neocon think tanks. The term progress is a lure that signifies power, just like Soros’ open society is, in reality, an exclusive club as tight as oysters reserved only for Soros’ chosen associates to savor. What is apparent from the email treasure trove is that Podesta’s job is really to supervise Hillary Clinton on behalf of Soros. In this context, the expression, leader of the free world, to describe the US president becomes a lie. The current world order of the globalists is anything but free, and one applicant for the job, Hillary Clinton, is not a queen on the chessboard, but a pawn.
Axis of resistance: Russia, China and Iran and lessons from Haiti’s revolution
One could ask: isn’t this psychopathic globalist coup of financiers well on its way? Isn’t it a done deal, and how can we resist and salvage anything? The examples of Russia, China and Iran prove that, as national entities, we still can. Germany, Japan and South Korea could reclaim their independence and kick out their US occupation. France and the UK could stop being submissive nations and get out of NATO. That would be a start. The path of war rhetoric expressed by the globalist mouthpieces of the West against Russia, Iran and, to a lesser extent, China has to do with the national resistance of these three countries. The citizenry of Europe and North America should understand, that if such unprecedented conflicts occur, all countries will be on the front line, and there is more than enough fire power on each side to ensure massive destruction and no winning side. Russia, China and Iran are the last national obstacles to the globalist coup, and perhaps we are heading back to a bipolar two-block world order similar to the Cold War era. Other options, including the dismantlement, or at least the curtailment, of supranational organizations such as the UN, World Bank and IMF would surely be the side effects of what appears to be in many countries a revival of nationalism. The final plan of the globalists would be atrocious for all of us. Waving the white flag is not an option. At this critical time of our history, and before our collective enslavement, we should all emulate the brave Haitian slaves who beat not one, but three empires 212 years ago. Haitians were only the last ones to prove that it can be done; it must be redone.

25501,"From a Wedding Writer’s Notebook, 10 Views on Love - The New York Times","When writing for the weddings pages of The New York Times  —   which I have done since 1992, at first on a weekly basis and now occasionally  —   the job is to walk into a room full of   strangers and collect the best descriptions you can find about love and marriage, mostly love. It isn’t easy. For one thing, people sense a stranger in their midst as acutely as a herd of gazelles might, and they tend to scatter, or stare from a distance in a menacing way. Over the years, I have filled many spiral notebooks with quotations. On the subject of love, clichés are hard to avoid. I have heard, “  are like two pieces of a puzzle,” or “It was     to be” thousands of times, or that’s how it feels anyway. Occasionally, though, people say something original and sparkly about love, and as a reporter, I want to hug them. It’s like finding a diamond in the sand. As a sort of   to all of those whom I have written about, and those whom I have written for, here are 10 of those jewels: 1. “In a sense, the person we marry is a stranger about whom we have a magnificent hunch. ” This is my   favorite quotation about marriage, spoken during a 1992 wedding in a small, unheated chapel in Cold Spring, N. Y. and sourced from the 1991 book “Weddings From the Heart” by Daphne Rose Kingma. In its own way, the quotation also explains a lot about divorce. 2. This remark, from a Vows column about the 1995 wedding of Elizabeth Burbank and LaMott Britto, describes how it feels to finally find a partner: “I’ve always felt like a fish out of water, and when I met LaMott it was like he was the same fish. ”  3. According to Stacy Cor, who became engaged to Dan Polner 10 days after they met on an airplane in 1993, examination should not be necessary to determine if love is real. “When you know you know, and don’t believe it any other way,” she said. “When someone asks you to marry them, you shouldn’t have to make a list of pros and cons. You just know. You jump into their arms and say, ‘Yeah! ’” 4. For some, “knowing” is not so obvious. This is how Patricia Durkin knew Kenneth Wignall, whom she would marry in 1995, was right for her: “One night, a moth was flying around a light bulb and he caught it and let it out the window. I said: ‘That’s it. He’s the guy. ’” This quotation also speaks to the fruitlessness of trying to impress someone with a certain look, attribute, political affiliation or apartment décor. The things that spark attention and interest are often mysteries, even to ourselves. So throw out the list. 5. When brides and grooms describe their first or second meetings, they often say they feel as if they have known each other forever, possibly even in former lives. “I feel like Sean and I have known each other since the beginning of time,” Meghan Milewski said of Sean Yeaton, whom she married in 2013. “I always tell him, ‘After we die, we have to find each other in our next life.’ I also tell him if I die before him, I really want him to fall in love again. But in our next lifetime, he has to find me, not her. That’s the deal. ”  6. Sometimes, you only learn what love is by breaking up. Before Eames Yates and Pamela Taylor were married in 2006 in Snowmass, Colo. they separated for a period of time that was especially excruciating for Mr. Yates. It was also illuminating: “I now know what love is,” he said. “It’s when someone becomes part of every breath, in what way I do not know. But I couldn’t breathe without her. ”  7. Billboards and big diamonds are not necessary for proposals to be romantic. This is how Gabriela Power Porto described the marriage proposal Peter Castaldi put forth, more than two decades ago, one of the sweetest I ever heard: “When he gave me the ring, he said: ‘It’s not a big stone you can’t carry around. This ring won’t put you in danger on the subways.’ He said, ‘This is a solid ring, like my promises. ’”  8. How should you feel on your wedding day? There are no rules, but this is how Ryan Baker described the day of his 1995 wedding to Brett Savage: “It was like a dream. It was surreal. In life, you don’t have to search for bad things  —   they find you without a problem. Disasters always seem to know your address, even if you move. But the good times, they’re hard to find, and this one was one of those truly spectacular times. ”  9. Of all the homemade vows I’ve heard, one spoken by Melissa Richard during her 1996 wedding to Frank J. Oteri sums up the reason we continue to marry, against the odds: “Of my own accord, I present myself, my days, my nights and my life. I present them freely and willingly because they cannot be better spent than in your company. ” More than a few couples I’ve interviewed have described love as a good conversation that lasts. 10. However, nothing lasts forever (unless you believe in reincarnation). The Rev. William G. Kalaidjian, who was known as Reverend Bill and died in 2015, was the officiant at one of the first weddings I covered, in 1992. He lived in a house full of noisy clocks. “I like to hear the tick, tick, tick of clocks,” he said. “I always tell the couples I marry, ‘Take time before time takes you. ’”",1
25504,"For Andrew Puzder, Labor Nominee, Fighting for Owners’ Interests Began Early - The New York Times","Decades before President Trump nominated him to be labor secretary, Andrew Puzder went to battle with federal labor regulators in a Las Vegas courtroom. The year was 1983, and Mr. Puzder was working at a law firm owned by a famous mob lawyer and casino owner whom the Labor Department accused of squandering $25 million from his union workers’ pension funds on sham investments. It fell to Mr. Puzder to lead the defense, which he framed in aggressively antigovernment terms. In his opening statement, Mr. Puzder told the jury it was not his boss’s fault for not paying back the money  —   it was overzealous regulators in Washington who had killed off a good business deal by intervening before his investments could succeed, he said. “We should not be required to pay for the mistakes of the Department of Labor” and the union, Mr. Puzder said, according to The Las Vegas  . The jury did not buy it. Mr. Puzder’s boss, Morris A. Shenker, was hit with a $34 million judgment and filed for bankruptcy. More than three decades later, the lawyers who represented the Labor Department in the case recall Mr. Puzder as bright and capable, but they still marvel that he blamed government regulators. “I personally find there is some irony in him being nominated to be the secretary of labor,” said Daly D. E. Temchine, the lead lawyer in the case for the Department of Labor. “Back then, he represented a guy who thought it was O. K. to screw his employees. ” As it turned out, Mr. Puzder’s arguments in the case foreshadowed positions he would take after leaving the practice of law to become chief executive of a   company. He has repeatedly argued that labor regulations stifle economic growth. He has indicated his preference for machines over people because they do not take time off or file lawsuits. And a recording recently surfaced of him referring to his employees as “the best of the worst. ” Because he was a lawyer representing a client, the positions that Mr. Puzder took in the case do not necessarily represent his personal views. But Mr. Shenker was more than just a client: He was also Mr. Puzder’s first boss, one he chose to work for, an associate said, specifically because it gave him the chance to litigate this case and a second similar one. Mr. Puzder declined to comment for this article, but upon nominating him in December, Mr. Trump said Mr. Puzder would “fight to make American workers safer” and “save small businesses from the crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations that are stunting job growth. ” Worker advocates have opposed Mr. Puzder’s nomination, citing lawsuits that workers filed against CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, as well as wage violations at those restaurants. Mr. Puzder is chief executive of CKE. His confirmation hearing before a Senate committee has been delayed four times. His spokesman said Mr. Puzder, 66, was working to divest from his company. “He doesn’t view laws and regulations as things that help protect the most vulnerable from exploitation. He looks at them as things that hinder him from doing what he wants to do,” said Judy Conti, who oversees federal advocacy for the National Employment Law Project. “That’s antithetical to the mission of the Department of Labor. ” Mr. Shenker led a life fit for the movies. A Jew, he fled Russia as an orphaned teenager in the 1920s to join his older brothers in St. Louis. He went on to become one of the   lawyers in America. He was also a mob lawyer. In his thick accent, Mr. Shenker sometimes said he would rather see a guilty man go free than an innocent man go to jail. But his work on behalf of organized crime figures went beyond the courtroom. Through one of his most notorious clients, the former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, Mr. Shenker gained influence in the   over the Teamsters’ enormous Central States pension fund. According to an investigation by Life magazine, Mr. Shenker built a fortune from fees he was paid to   loans from the fund to businesses. In 1973, he took control of the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and a resort in California. Married and supporting two children, Mr. Puzder began working at the Shenker law firm while a   student at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, finding it more attractive than the construction work he had been doing to earn money. Mr. Puzder joined the firm full time after graduating in 1978, a career choice that bewildered some who knew him. The firm was fading in relevance, with its famous principal spending much of his time in Las Vegas. But Peter Sadowski, who worked part time at the firm with Mr. Puzder while both were in law school, said Mr. Shenker had enticed Mr. Puzder with the chance to handle the   lawsuit already underway in Las Vegas. “Shenker wanted him to lead the defense,” said Mr. Sadowski, now an executive vice president at Fidelity National Financial, a major seller of title insurance. Politico recently reported on Mr. Puzder’s work for Mr. Shenker. Mr. Shenker’s fortunes had changed quickly after Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which, among other things, protects worker pensions from being raided by their employers. The next year, the Teamsters pension fund backed out of a $40 million loan that Mr. Shenker wanted for an expansion of the Dunes. Mr. Shenker sued, and the Labor Department joined the case with the pension fund. In 1980, after a federal judge summarily dismissed the case halfway through the trial, Mr. Puzder presented the appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, arguing, in part, that the loan was promised before the new law took effect. In court filings, Labor Department lawyers described Mr. Puzder’s efforts as “a vigorous but futile attempt to backpedal, sidestep, and otherwise avoid the absolute barriers” of the pension protection act known as Erisa. The appellate judges denied Mr. Puzder’s appeal. By then, another spigot of union pension money had gone dry. The pension fund for the culinary workers union in Las Vegas had been extending loans to Mr. Shenker with no restrictions since 1973. A new pension fund chairman  —   Richard P. Crane, a former federal prosecutor  —   was appointed in 1976 and concluded that the Shenker loans were “a total  . ” He insisted on all but shutting down the flow of money. “Shenker went nuts,” Mr. Crane recalled. In 1977, the Labor Department sued Mr. Shenker, accusing him of failing to repay the $24. 9 million it said he had illegally borrowed from the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Trust. The total represented more than half of the trust’s assets. The case proceeded slowly. During a 1982 hearing of the Senate committee that oversees labor, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, accused the Labor Department of “blatantly coddling” Mr. Shenker for years. Labor officials saw the case as an early test of using Erisa to rid unions of corruption. Seven lawyers were sent to Las Vegas from Washington. For Mr. Shenker, repaying the money would have threatened his financial survival. Mr. Puzder, then 32, and a colleague from the Shenker firm, E. Michael Murphy, left St. Louis for Las Vegas. As he stood to make a point in the trial’s opening days, the months of grueling preparation caught up with Mr. Puzder: He promptly collapsed to the floor, fainting in front of judge and jury. After regaining his composure, he attacked government regulators, claiming they had a “vendetta” against his boss. “Some people in the Department of Labor were more concerned with pursuing Shenker than they were with recovering the trust’s money,” Mr. Puzder said, according to The Las Vegas Sun. He argued that Mr. Shenker was financially harmed when the pension fund stopped making payments on a loan extension in 1977. He said the Shenker investments had been well on their way to becoming successful. The federal judge, Roger D. Foley, was unimpressed, at one point saying that the money appeared to have gone down “a rathole. ” The specter of organized crime hung over the trial. Tapes of a 1979 meeting between Mr. Shenker and two mob figures  —   Joey (The Clown) Lombardo and Allen Dorfman, a   liaison between the mob and Hoffa’s Teamsters union  —   revealed Mr. Dorfman complaining that Mr. Shenker had failed to pay him kickbacks on millions in loans that Mr. Shenker had procured from the Teamsters. Newspapers covering Mr. Lombardo’s 1983 sentencing hearing splashed the incriminating transcripts across their pages. The government was determined to reduce the Shenker case to its most basic elements. “In my opening statement to the jury, I said, ‘You may hear a lot from the defense about how complicated this is, but it’s simple,’” Mr. Temchine said. “‘He borrowed a thousand bucks from each member and promised to give it back, with interest. He didn’t. ’” The jurors agreed. After the   trial, Mr. Shenker was required to repay all the money he had borrowed, plus interest, for a total of $34 million. “I think he’s too good a con man for me to mix with,” one juror told The Las Vegas Sun. “I’d be like the pension fund. I’d lose on the deal. ” Months later, Mr. Shenker filed for bankruptcy, citing $184 million in obligations. About that time, Mr. Puzder and Mr. Murphy left his firm, which limped along until Mr. Shenker was indicted on bankruptcy and tax fraud charges in 1989. He died later that year. During the bankruptcy case, government lawyers were able to extract $26 million for the pension fund, Mr. Temchine said. At least one time as a lawyer, Mr. Puzder was on the other side of such a case, helping to represent the interests of a police pension fund that had been defrauded by its investment managers. His team argued that the managers were essentially stealing from the widows of police officers. At his labor secretary confirmation hearing, one challenge senators may choose to take up is determining whether Mr. Puzder ultimately favors protecting workers, or executives like himself and his old boss. In a surprising turn, that confirmation hearing could place Mr. Puzder face to face with Mr. Hatch, the senator who once said the Labor Department had been going soft on Mr. Shenker at the same time Mr. Puzder claimed the department had been unfairly tough. Almost 35 years later, Mr. Hatch still sits on that committee. And while he praised Mr. Puzder in December as someone who “will bring invaluable expertise to the Department of Labor,” he may well be reminded of the time he scolded a Labor Department official in front of his fellow lawmakers. “I am still not sure,” Mr. Hatch said at the time, “if some of you understand the enormity of the problem that these actions by Mr. Shenker and the Labor Department’s poor oversight have caused the 30, 000 workers covered by this pension fund. ”",1
25505,Unthinkable Politics and the Bodies of Children,"Unthinkable Politics and the Bodies of Children   
By Henry A. Giroux / Truthout Bo / (CC BY-ND 2.0) 
As the distinction between the truth and lies fades in public life, politics appears to be increasingly emptied of any substance. As Lucy Marcus has observed , “Nowadays, facts and truth are becoming [more] difficult to uphold in politics (and in business and even sports).” Certainly, in the age of Trump there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the appeal to reason, informed judgment and facts is at odds with the current political culture. That is, truth and evidence have gone the way of the electric typewriter, or so it seems. 
Americans seem to have a growing fondness for ignorance, an attitude that reinforces the downsizing of the civic function of language. Falsehoods and deceptions no longer appear marginal to political debate but now seem to shape much of what is said by the presidential candidates. This is shockingly true for Trump, who has organized much of his campaign around endless fabrications, sending fact checkers into a frenzy of activity. When Trump is caught in a falsehood, he simply ignores the facts and just keeps on lying. His followers could care less about whether he deceives them or not. 
On the other hand, Hillary Clinton has earned a reputation as a chameleon, willing to say almost anything to promote her political career, regardless of whether she sacrifices the truth in order to do so. Her email scandal is largely read as symptomatic of a more pronounced and deeper level of dishonesty. Consequently, she is viewed mostly by the general public as untrustworthy. In response, she has managed her truth deficit by invoking her lifelong defense of families and children. For instance, during the second debate she claimed she wanted “America to be for our children” and attempted to bolster her concern for the welfare of children by pointing to her early work with the Children’s Defense Fund. In the third presidential debate, she argued against Trump’s call for exporting 11 million immigrants by stating that she was against his deportation policies because she “didn’t want to rip families apart [and was against] sending parents away from children.” In her political television ads, she points to supporting policies that “will invest in schools and colleges [and will work to] develop an economy where every young American can find a job and start a family of their own.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Unfortunately, Clinton only focuses on managing some of the problems that young people face, rather than doing anything to change the conditions that produce them. For instance, she says nothing about what education should accomplish in a democracy when educational policies are driven by a neoliberal economy that she supports. And while she talks about providing jobs for young people, she has little to say about transforming rather than adjusting an economy marked by wide gaps in inequality, wealth and power. 
Matters of power, state violence, extreme poverty, institutional racism, a broken criminal justice system, the school to prison pipeline and the existence of the mass incarceration state, among other important matters, rarely if ever enter her discourse and yet these are major issues negatively affecting the lives of millions of children in the United States. And her alleged regard for children falls apart in light of her hawkish policies on global regime change, drone attacks and cyber-warfare, and her unqualified support for the warfare state. Her alleged support for children abroad does not capture the larger reality they face from when their countries are invaded, attacked by drones and subject to contemporary forms of indiscriminate violence. Rather than critique the US as a powerful engine of violence, Clinton expands its imperialist role around the globe. This is a key point in light of her defense of the rights of children, because her warmongering ideology puts children in the path of lethal violence. 
At the same time, Clinton’s promise to address the problems many children face in the United States reeks of a disingenuousness made visible by her history of siding with and supporting policies that were injurious to children. Not only did she once disparagingly call young people super-predators, but as the First Lady she strongly backed her husband’s campaign to “end welfare as we know it.” President Clinton’s welfare policies did great harm to poor children. They eliminated the Aid to Families with Dependent Children federal assistance program and infuriated Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children’s Defense Fund, to the degree that she ended her working relationship with Hillary Clinton. According to Edelman , the bill represented a frontal assault on the well-being of poor children and families. Yet as late as 2008, Hillary was still touting this pernicious welfare bill as a success. She also supported Bill Clinton’s “tough on crime” policies, which, according to Michelle Alexander , “resulted in the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history”—which has a devastating effect on the families and children of color. Finally, Clinton supported Bush’s invasion of Iraq, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children. 
Occupying the right wing of the Democratic Party, Clinton has aligned herself with a war culture that supports drone warfare and continues to support military policies that result in the needless deaths of millions of children in the Middle East, Yemen, Somalia, and other places that bear the brunt of America’s foreign policy. It is difficult to imagine, given Clinton’s coziness with the financial elite, big corporations, the military-industrial complex and the reigning war culture, that she will do anything that will lessen the violence to which children, both at home and around the globe, will face under her potential reign as President of the United States. Clinton has nothing to say about the need for a collective struggle for economic and political justice. Given her past history, Clinton’s disingenuousness becomes even starker next to the images of war and violence that mark the bodies of youth both in the United States and abroad. Her commitments to war and security have been built on the misery, mutilation and deaths of young people and her recent alleged support for the welfare of children does little to cover up the many ways capitalism, militarism, state violence and racism are killing poor Black and Brown youth. 
Rethinking the Horrors of War 
The horrors of war became painfully visible when the image circulated of the lifeless body of Aylan (Alan) Kurdi, a three-year-old who washed up on a beach face-downin the coastal town of Bodrum, Turkey, on September 2, 2015, while traveling with other refugees toward the Greek island of Kos. A second haunting image appeared on August 17, 2016, showing five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, bloodied and covered with dust, sitting silently in an ambulance after an airstrike on Aleppo, a city in northern Syria.",1

by Health Impact News/MedicalKidnap.com Staff 
Chris and Keshia Turner from East Tennessee are still waiting to bring their son Brayden home since he was removed from their custody on December 11, 2014. Keshia had rushed the baby to the emergency room when his leg that had been splinted in the NICU became tight and warm to the touch. While at the hospital, an x-ray revealed a broken bone and several rib fractures. 
The following day, Keshia took Brayden to his pediatrician to follow-up on his care. There she found herself confronted with law enforcement and a Department of Children’s Services worker who demanded that she take Brayden to Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, nearly three hours away. 
That evening, Vanderbilt Medical Center Child Abuse Specialist Dr. Deborah Lowen said that Brayden’s injuries could only be abuse, and investigators and doctors allegedly stopped looking for another explanation. 
Dr. Lowen first said that it was a “classic case of Shaken Baby,” though most of the classic symptoms were not present. Later Dr. Lowen claimed that Keshia had crushed her three month old child with her hands and caused multiple rib fractures. 
The Turner’s first story is here: Baby Found with Broken Bones – Parents Assumed Guilty of Abuse and Lose Custody Keshia’s Second Child Taken 
In September of 2015, while her case was pending, Keshia delivered her second child, a baby boy named Carson, who was in perfect health. Sadly, he was removed from her custody four days after he was born because of the ongoing case involving Brayden. Both boys have been in a relative placement with their paternal grandparents. Chris and Keshia have had limited supervised contact with the children since their removal. 
Recently, the boys were evaluated by Tennessee Early Intervention System, a voluntary educational program for children ages birth through age two with disabilities or developmental delays. The program is also associated with Vanderbilt Medical Center. Both children were diagnosed with significant developmental delays. Brayden with his baby brother Carson. Photo source: Turner family. 
Brayden’s evaluation revealed that he is delayed 25% in cognitive development and 40% in adaptive, communication, social skills, and motor. He also exhibited “multiple red flags of autism.” Additionally, he has a 30 degree curvature in both feet and will require orthotics. 
Carson’s evaluation showed that he is delayed 25% in communication and cognitive development, and 40% in adaptive and motor. It was also noted that his head was “really flat.” The family was told that when he begins to walk, there is a possibility that he will need to wear orthotics. 
Additionally, both boys have low muscle tone. In light of the new developments, the family believes that this is, as Eugene Wilson at the Center for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Alliance says, “more than likely an underlying medical condition.” 
Therapy has been recommended for both children. Difficult Day at Court 
Because Keshia was the last one to care for Brayden before the emergency room visit, she is being accused of abuse in the dependency proceeding in juvenile court. 
After several days of hearings, including the presentation of medical experts on behalf of the parents, on June 25, 2016 Judge Larry Warner found Keshia guilty of “severe child abuse.” The judge cleared Chris of any finding of abuse. Because of that, the couple was advised by the father’s attorney to file for divorce, in the hope that the court would award Chris custody. Although the couple’s divorce is still pending, Judge Warner ordered immediate reunification with Chris. However, the children are still in a relative placement, and the Department of Children’s Services has not done anything to establish their reunification. There is no plan in place to get the children home with their father. Bias and Lack of Understanding Impeding the Case 
The judge’s ruling came despite the Turners having two medical experts who testified on their behalf, a radiologist and a pediatrician with experience teaching at a university as well as working in the emergency room. The two medical experts gave extensive medical testimony—comprehensive explanations of Brayden’s medical conditions— which both opined as osteopenia of prematurity. 
Going in to court, the mother’s Attorney Connie Reguli was concerned that Vanderbilt’s Child Abuse Specialist Dr. Lowen’s deposition had been filed months before the trial by Department of Children’s Services. It appeared to Attorney Reguli that once the judge read it, he had made up his mind before coming to court, leaving no room for other medical explanations. Dr. Deborah Lowen. Source: Vanderbilt University . 
Attorney Reguli points out that this is “an extremely complex” case. Because of that, the experts took painstaking measures to educate the judge about the “fragile bone state of a baby…who was premature and so small.” She says that after examining Brayden’s history, the pediatrician concluded that he had rickets of prematurity. The doctors explained in detail the medical evidence supporting their opinions, including the premature birth, the loss of amniotic fluid prior to birth, the low vitamin D levels, and the healing pattern of the bones. 
The Turner family’s experts disputed Child Abuse Specialist Dr. Debra Lowen’s conclusion. Dr. Lowen said that Brayden’s injuries were non-accidental, and therefore, must be child abuse. Attorney Reguli says that Dr. Lowen’s conclusion was drawn without being challenged on the medical research upon which she relied. When Dr. Lowen was asked to submit medical research to support her conclusion, she submitted a mere nine articles and references, some of which contradicted her own conclusion. 
In contrast, the experts called by the family provided a bibliography of over 50 articles which supported the rickets diagnosis. 
Attorney Reguli is very concerned about the court’s apparent bias and lack of understanding about the intricacies of the medical evidence, which she believes are impeding this case. She says, “The complexity of presenting the evidence is a tremendous challenge.” Further, she points out that the medical community is not in agreement on this issue, and she is concerned that it might be too complex for a juvenile court judge to understand. The Environmental Epidemic of Vitamin D Deficiency in Infants 
In August 2008, researchers Kathy A. Keller and Patrick D. Barnes published the article, “ Rickets vs. Abuse: A National and International Epidemic .” The article documents that, what was at first “believed to primarily affect the elderly and dark-skinned populations in the US,” was found “demonstrated in otherwise healthy young adults, children, and infants of all races.” 
In “ Rickets or Abuse, or Both? ” Russell W. Chesney says, “We are in the midst of an epidemic of nutritional vitamin D deficiency rickets that has been termed ‘the third wave of rickets.'” The article goes on to say, “Inherent in each wave is that infants with rickets are born to mothers who are deficient or insufficient in vitamin D themselves.” 
Dr. Teresa Hill points out in the Journal Advocate that vitamin D deficiency persists today. She says, “Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is considered epidemic.” 
One reason that the medical profession is not in agreement on this issue is the lack of information about the role of vitamin D deficiency resulting in metabolic dysfunction in abuse cases. Dr. Mercola reports that Dr. Ayoub, after reviewing over 3,000 pieces of medical literature, concludes that “a great number of child abuse cases may, in fact, be instances of misdiagnosed metabolic dysfunction.” 
Dr. Mercola, citing the work of Dr. Ayoub and others, says: 
“Thousands of child abuse cases may, in fact, be misdiagnosed cases of rickets caused by either vitamin D deficiency or aluminum adjuvants in vaccines, or both.” He goes on to say, “Vitamin D deficiency is a hidden problem that can actually cause bones to appear as if they’ve been broken on an X-ray, which is a sure diagnosis of abuse to the inexperienced eye.” 
Dr. Mercola says that Dr. Ayoub estimates that “there may be literally tens of thousands of misdiagnosed cases of child abuse around the country,” and that it is a “trend of misdiagnosis goes back at least 25 years or more.” 
Dr. Mercola calls this “the other side of the child abuse drama,” and he believes that “it is critical for this information to become more widely known.” He goes on to say that being informed about “how infantile rickets mimics cases of child abuse” is the best way to prevent the “traumatic injustice to parents who really have done nothing wrong, besides listening to and trusting conventional medical advice, which still does not place sufficient weight on the importance of vitamin D.” 
Dr. Ayoub asserts: 
“Modern textbooks simply do not cover rickets as textbooks of the past did, and flawed research has been used as the basis to perpetuate the misdiagnosis of healing rickets as an inflicted injury.” 
Further, he says that the current protocol for doctors does not include testing vitamin D levels in expectant mothers, who are considered “one of the most at-risk populations.” In his opinion, this is “reprehensible medical malpractice.” Apparent Conflict of Interest 
The complexity of the underlying medical condition of the child is buttressed with the conflict of interest inherent in Child Abuse Specialists, whose only role is to determine and “diagnose” child abuse. Attorney Reguli says: 
“Child Abuse Specialists aren’t doing true clinical rule-out evaluations.” 
The hospital pediatricians who are certified as Child Abuse Specialists are considered by default “state expert witnesses.” However, they are not trained in all of the medical areas that they include in their opinions of abuse. 
Further, Attorney Reguli says: 
“Doctors like Lowen have a contract with the Department of Children’s Services and have a vested interest in maintaining their relationship with them.” Subsequently, she says, “The Department has to remove children from their homes to get the money they need to fund the agency itself in the current federal funding scheme.” 
Ultimately, the children and their parents are the ones who pay the price.

25512,Chaga: The Superfood You Should Know About,"by ARIANA MARISOL 
This little-known, anti-aging superfood can help prevent cancer, lower bad cholesterol, support the immune system, and much more! Chaga , otherwise knowns as Inontus Obliquuus , is a wild mushroom that grows on birch trees in extremely cold regions. Chaga can be found in the Baltic regions, Scandinavia, Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada where temperatures fall bellow -30 F for over 2 to 3 months per year. The chaga conk grows in cooperation with the birch tree over a seven to twenty year period, absorbing life-sustaining nutrients from the tree. This medicinal mushroom’s DNA structure is 30% more human than it is plant. 

Chaga has been used medicinally for centuries. The Inuit never used chaga and had an average lifespan of only forty to fifty years whereas people in Siberian tribes who used chaga had a lifespan of ninety to over one hundred years. Indigenous Siberians would grind it and put it in stews, soups, and daily beverages. The Siberians found that, despite their harsh climate, the regular consumption of chaga prevented the onset of various degenerative diseases. Contemporary Russians have found that the districts that regularly used chaga had no traces of cancer. 
[Suggested Reading: Know These Important Rules Before You Forage ] 
Chaga was also traditionally used by many ancient peoples of China, Korea, and Eastern Europe. In Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, it is considered a cancer cure. In Northern Canada it is known as a cure for tumors. In Korea, it is used to fight stress and regulate energy. It is also known for its ability to cure inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. In Eastern Europe it is also known for its powers against bronchitic and lung disease. 

For centuries, people in the East have traditionally consumed chaga in tea. More recently, chaga has gained popularity in the West where enormous amounts of health benefits are beginning to be recognized by many health gurus. 

Here are only a few of chaga’s health benefits. 

Supports Immune System An abundance of Beta-D-Glucans are found in chaga. These help balance the response of the body’s immune system . This means chaga can help boost the immune system when it is necessary, while also having the ability to slow it down when it is overactive. This makes chaga a natural Biological Response Modifier (BRM). 

Cancer Fighting Medical researchers have gone to Siberia to learn about the effects of chaga on the indigenous people of the region. The medical team found that although there was a lot of talk about cancer, not a single cancer patient was admitted to any of the hospitals in the region. They also found that these people were brewing chaga instead of coffee in order to save money. Researchers found that these people were unwittingly treating themselves for cancer prevention. 

Chaga has a very high content of super-oxide dismutase (SOD), an important enzyme that functions as a powerful antioxidant. SOD occurs naturally in different forms in human tissues, but levels decline with age, greatly declining after age thirty. Chaga provides SOD in a form that can be used both topically and internally. Having been studied in about 900 different clinical trials, the health benefits of its use are clear. Cancer patients undergoing radiation who were given SOD in a form that they could absorb had dramatically better survival rates with less toxicity, less scarring, and better wound healing. 

Chaga also activates immune cells responsible for combating cancer initiation. Research is ongoing, and more studies must be done to determine chaga’s full role in fighting cancer. 

Soothing Properties Chaga is able to support the integrity of blood vessels and can provide soothing properties during irritation. This is helpful for people who suffer from pain, neuropathy, and diabetes. 

Ulcers and Gastritis Chaga has been known to treat ulcers and support gastrointestinal health. Most ulcers are caused by bacteria that can be fought off by a well-functioning immune system. 

Normalize Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels The betulinic acid found in chaga is able to break down LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the bloodstream. 

Anti-Aging SOD performs vital anti-aging functions by neutralizing oxygen free radicals, and preventing oxidative damage to cells, and tissue. For this reason, chaga is supremely healthy for the skin. It has proven to be highly anti-aging as well as therapeutic for skin disorders. 

You can make a face cream with chaga, raw beeswax, and spice oils. 

What are the properties in chaga that make it so healthy? 

Polysaccharides Chaga contains structural polysaccharides which provide energy, cardiovascular health, intestinal and liver health, and promote healthy blood sugar levels. These can also improve your mood. 

Beta-D-Glucans Beta-D-Glucans are known for their ability to help the immune system. They can also help with normalizing cholesterol levels and blood pressure. 

Phytosterols Chaga contains many phytosterols , 45% of them being Lanosterol, 25% of them being Inotodiols and a ramaining 30% of them being Egosterol, Fecosterol, and several others. In vivo and in vitro testing shows a direct effect of both Lanosterol and Inotodiols on cancer cells, with Lanosterol having a positive effect on viral compounds. 

Betulin and Betulinic Acid (Triterpenes) Betulin and betulinic acid are powerful therapeutic agents that can support healthy cholesterol levels. These agents are also being studied for their effects on cancer and viruses. 

Antioxidants Chaga contains massive amounts of melanin which has high antioxidant levels. In fact, chaga has the highest level of antioxidant potency of any superfood. 

Where to Find Chaga Chaga can only grow wild and is quite hard to find. It grows predominantly on birch trees in cold climates throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including northern parts of Europe, Russia, Korea, Canada, and the United States. 

If you do not live in these northern regions, you can find chaga mushrooms and chaga tinctures at local health food stores or online. 

How to Make Chaga Tea Chaga tea is the most popular way to consume chaga. 
1. Break the whole chaga into roughly 10g chunks. 
2. Grind one chunk into powder using a blender or coffee grinder. 
3. Place one or two teaspoons into a tea infuser. 
4. Place the tea infuser into a large mug and pour in about 400 ml of hot water. 
5. Leave the chaga and hot water steeping for at least 5 minutes (the longer the better to get more bioactive ingredients). 
6. Remove the infuser from the mug and add maple syrup or honey for taste.

It may be the case, that the higher heat of baking is more destructive to the plant chemistry than boiling or pressure cooking. 
A particle of freshly ground flour is still enormous compared to a bacterium, but grinding probably increases the surface area accessible to the bugs somewhat, and the seed coat probably slows down penetration, which may be a good thing. Jack Hall 
The other factor to consider is that the increase in surface area increases exposure to digestive enzymes and degradation by HCL which would increase absorption of nutrients in the small intestine rendering it less useful to bacteria once it has reached the colon. Stewart 
I would be interested in the the nature of the whole wheat rolls that were used in this study. Very often the difference in white rolls and whole wheat is minimal at best. They also tend to have added oils and frequently milk or whey. A real multi grain bread with higher fiber would likely do much better. 
I’m looking for a good whole grain bread recipe if anyone can share one. lemonhead 
I used to bake bread, but gave it up a while ago. I’ve been thinking about taking it up again and trying sprouted grains. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the recipe(s), just that I had to add extra gluten to 100% whole grain dough (and that my current oven sucks). Peter Reinhart’s books are great, you might find them at your local library. lemonhead 
Just remembered something – I’ve noticed more than one of the centenarians (7th Day Adventists) I’ve seen interviewed make their own whole grain bread using freshly ground flour. Maybe there’s something to freshly ground flour or homemade whole grain bread, or maybe it’s the fact that they have a task to do every morning that gets them out of bed and keeps them active. Thea 
lemonhead: One of my pet theories (nothing to back up that it makes a significant difference) is that home-made freshly ground flour a) will not have had as much time to lose as much nutrients and b) is not likely to be ground up quite as finely as what comes out of professional mills — and for these reasons is healthier. Even if true, I don’t know if it is healthier enough to make any kind of significant difference in health outcomes. It’s just a pet theory of mine. But I like it… Nick Presidente 
Most whole wheat rolls are about 60% whole wheat, the rest refined.. they need to keep it soft and fluffy for that selling feature. Unfortunately multigrain buns are worse, with the majority of grain being refined. 
I’ve been attempting a 100% whole grain, no oil or sugar bread. I add ground flax and molasses, with very little salt. The salt makes the rising and over proofing a major concern. Very hard to find a good recipe. Also using a bread machine is limiting, and I don’t have the tools right now to mix and bake by hand David J 
Good point – if the studies did not use intact whole grains, then that alone could be the reason no benefit was found. Also I’m wondering if the whole wheat rolls or whatever else was used had emulsifiers in them. Some research on mice has shown that emulsfiers negatively impact gut bacteria. plant_this_thought 
Nick: My understanding is that the sugar (or molasses or honey) is only there as food for the yeast (which, of course, makes the bread rise). I wonder if the sugar content could be titrated to an amount that will be completely consumed by the yeast. Blair Rollin 
1 cup whole grain spelt flour 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour 1 1/4 cup whole grain rye flour 1/4 cup 7-10 grain cereal 1 tbsp ground flaxseed meal 2 1/4 tsp yeast 2 tsp salt (or whatever you like) 1 tbsp molasses 6 tbsp gluten 1 2/3 – 1 3/4 cups water 
I use a bread maker. Knead for 15 minutes then let sit for 20 (turn the machine off and restart it). Then follow the machine cycle for whole wheat bread. 
You can substitute any other whole grain flour for the rye and it will be excellent, but possibly not as high a loaf. Bob’s Red Mill has a big selection of whole grain flours you can try. No preservatives so it’s only good for a day or so but it freezes perfectly.I have been baking these whole grain breads for over a decade and will not willingly eat any other except whole grain Wasa bread. Once you start eating these fabulous whole grain breads you begin to believe that people can indeed live on bread and water. 
The refined ingredient is the gluten. You can reduce the amount of gluten but it’s going to get a lot flatter. (This is one of the very few refined products that I eat, so I’m okay with it for the time being.) Thea 
Blair Rollin: Thanks for taking the time to share a tried and true recipe with us! I’m not usually one for making bread, but you have me tempted with this recipe. Blair Rollin 
I assure you, I’m very much in the camp of “whole grains are better than whole grain flours”. (I guess bread is just another hangover I have from my previous SAD diet.) But I only eat one slice of bread a day usually. The stuff is very handy for making a calorie rich meal (sandwich) that you can eat while you’re driving. And it’s good for sopping up the pot liquor from my red beans and collards. plant_this_thought 
No oil in this recipe. Is oil included in standard bread recipes just as a pan lubricant? Is it not required if one uses a non-stick pan? Thea 
plant_this_thought: I don’t make enough bread to answer your question about what is standard. I can guess that non-stick pans would be one way to avoid oil. Another way is to just shape the bread in big round pillow and bake it in an oven instead of a bread machine. When you bake it in an oven, you can put it on a silicon mat or parchment paper and I imagine that no oil would be needed in that case either. (though I don’t know) . Stepping back a second. My philosophy: While I typically avoid oils in the food I cook, I’m not opposed to occasionally greasing a pan for a special recipe. I think that is a reasonable way to use oils in one’s life if I don’t have heart disease or diabetes. That’s just my approach which I’m sharing in case you would find it helpful. Ruth 
Spelt is an old fashion wheat flower that hasn’t been messed with like the regular bread wheat. Its own gluton content is much lower because of not messing with it. Your bread will be lighter using the gluton flower with it. It is the gluton stretching that helps the bread to rise. AnnieVanCookie 
You made me laugh with the “until know” thing xD!! I wonder why there’s people with sad diet and aren´t obese. I have been all my life struggling to loose weight even though I always ate “healthy”. I see people eating crap everyday and they just wont get fat. TofuAnnie 
I liked this pop-up as well! Your voice kept on as you’re mini-me pointed to the ‘until now’. It’s your signature, so why not?! I need to go back and re-watch the mircobiome videos. Thanks for your work, doc. David J 
Sorry but although I found it ok, it will keep me from sending it to skeptical people I am trying to convince to take this kind of work seriously. Nancy Altman 
It humor. Just humor. Come on, people, lighten up! It’s good for your health! Thea 
AnnieVanCookie: Why do some people get fat and some stay thin when eating pretty much the same type of SAD diet? Why do some people get or stay fat even when they try to eat healthy? It’s a great question. Dr. Lisle, one of the experts from Forks Over Knives, does a good job of answering that question at the beginning of his talk, How To Lose Weight Without Losing Your Mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAdqLB6bTuQ AZ DONALD 
hi thea, 
i searched and searched last night but couldn’t find the video i was looking for and am hoping you can direct me to it. 
recently, dr G changed his recommendation from methyl cobalomin to cyano cobalomin because a small percentage of people don’t absorb the methyl. 
are you able to direct me to that one? 
thanks, donald. Thea 
AZ DONALD: From my memory, Dr. Greger has always recommended the cyanocobalamin form. Here are a couple pages where you see that recommendation: An Ask the Doctor page from 2012: http://nutritionfacts.org/questions/which-type-of-b12-is-best/ General nutrition recommendations from 2011: http://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/ In the new book (How Not To Die), Dr. Greger talks about recommending the cyano… form because that’s the one that is tested in studies showing that it works. We don’t have the body of evidence showing that the other forms work. . If there is a page where Dr. Greger talks about changing his recommendation on B12, I’m sorry but I’m not aware of it. kari228 
Great Share, I had never seen this before. Erica 
Would you add an even greater benefit to the mixed whole grains by chilling them before eating? I’m curious whether we would get the benefits of resistant starches with chilled whole grains. The studies we had seen previously showed a benefit when processed or refined (white) grains where cooled/chilled and then consumed. 
Yes, that works if they’re chilled AFTER they’ve been cooked. They can be reheated and the resistant starches will remain. Mike Quinoa 
What about whole grain pasta that’s not even cooked in the first place? I sometimes “cold-cook” pasta by just leaving it in cold water for a few hours, and then using it in a bean / pasta salad. David Hochstettler 
I tried making bread without flour sugar and oil for over a year and finally let it go. Now I eat a slice of ezekial bread every day to satisfy my cravings for bread and 300 grams of cooked whole wheat ,barley and brown rice in their whole form. To cook it I boil 3 quarts of water and add 3 cups of wheat berries and a 1/2 a cup each of pearl barley and brown rice and simmer for an hour. Quick cool it by running cold water through it in a strainer and bag it up in 300 gram fold top sandwich bags. Richard 
You bring out a good point: bread is addictive! I can’t find where I read it before, but wheat has some kind of morphine-like substance it it. Bread is also an SOS (salt, oil, sugar) food. In fact, the average American gets more salt from bread than any other food. Bread has a high glycemic index, higher than intact grains. Trouble is, when I’m hungry, it’s the most convenient and appealing thing in the house. That is, it was. From now on, I’m going to keep bread out of my house and have some baked potatoes or yams in the fridge. Ben 
The ezekial breads and the silver hills breads are both healthy. Vege-tater 
I often microwave a large sweet potato, then slice it and make thin “toast” for a quick “bread”. Steve Billig 
I did not see in the study descriptions whether the whole grain variety that makes a difference in microbial richness (great term) is required over the course of a day, or perhaps over the course of a week. Did anyone pick that up? susan 
good question Steve, and its an interesting answer ! the transcript says they used whole grain barley, or whole grain brown rice and the combination of the two worked better than either alone . hmm might be able to make a cold chopped vegie salad using both grains that wouldnt be bad ! hope that answers your question steve. susan 
sorry steve, I may have missed your question.. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744518/figure/F1/ this page details showing the number of grams per day over the course of how many weeks . Steve Billig 
Variety, to me, is one of foundations of healthy eating. Research shows that variety even trumps volume (more types of healthy foods yields better health than more volume of healthy foods). My understanding is that the way to achieve variety is to eat all the plant-based food groups (fruit, veg, grains, legumes, nuts/seeds) over the course of a day, and a variety within each food group over the course of a week (variety of nuts, or veg (crucifers/onion family/starchy family/leafy green family, etc.). Since the research only tested daily variety and not weekly variety, we do not know for sure, so in order to go with what we know, eat a variety of grains daily. susan 
Makes total sense to me steve. They achieved a better result mixing two varieties, so I would think it would be very beneficial to mix it up over the course of the week. I plan on mixing up grains in salads more often.. throwing in some lentils too, and trying new combinations. thanks Steve ! Wegan 
No, you said the t word. Ed 
Glad to see you more animated in your videos, but this one needs fireworks and music. I recently tried a newer probiotic with 115 interdependent strains, as I eat more veggies, beans,and lentils than most the changes were profound.This information can still kick my biome into another gear.

25521,"Sessions, Trump, Dylann Roof: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama delivered a nostalgic but hopeful farewell address to the nation from a convention center in Chicago. He warned the nation not to shrink from the challenges of economic inequality, racial strife, political isolation and voter apathy. “If something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing,” Mr. Obama, a   political organizer, told the cheering crowd. “If you’re disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Persevere. ” Here’s the full video and text. _____ 2. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama,   Donald J. Trump’s pick for attorney general, received a surprisingly gentle welcome at the start of his Senate confirmation hearing. He appeared to assuage Democrats by saying that that waterboarding is “absolutely” illegal and that he did not support barring Muslims from the United States, and even the most liberal senators declined to vigorously confront him on allegations of racism from three decades ago. The whirlwind week of hearings continued with retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security nominee. Here’s the full schedule for the week. And late in the day came this news: The chiefs of America’s intelligence agencies last week gave Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama a summary of unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about Mr. Trump. The agencies are investigating, said two officials with knowledge of the matter. _____ 3. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who expressed no remorse for killing nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, S. C. was sentenced to death. The jury returned its unanimous verdict after about three hours of deliberations in the penalty phase of the trial. Mr. Roof showed no emotion as the verdict was read. _____ 4. The Obama administration is making a   push for police overhauls in two of the nation’s most violent cities, where officers have been accused of routinely mistreating  . The results of the Justice Department’s sweeping investigation into police practices in Chicago are expected before Inauguration Day. Baltimore, above, is close to a deal that would require the police to make changes under court supervision. _____ 5. Fox News secretly settled sexual harassment accusations against Bill O’Reilly, the network’s top host, last summer. Juliet Huddy, a longtime   personality, said Mr. O’Reilly had tried to ruin her career after she rebuffed his advances. The settlement was described in a draft of a letter from Ms. Huddy’s lawyers to Fox News that was mailed anonymously to The Times and verified. _____ 6. Volkswagen is on the verge of admitting to criminal violations and paying $4. 3 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its cheating on emissions tests. The company will probably plead guilty to charges of customs fraud and violating the Clean Air Act, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. _____ 7. Protests broke out in Iran at the funeral of Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a key figure in the country’s 1979 revolution who had come to be seen as the last establishment voice friendly to the opposition. Officials said 2. 5 million mourners attended. The live broadcast on state television tried to avoid protesters’ chants for a former presidential candidate under house arrest against Russia, Iran’s ally in the Syrian conflict and for the release of political prisoners. _____ 8. Clare Hollingworth, a British journalist who became the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents, died in Hong Kong at 105. She was on the   border in August 1939, just a week into her first job for a British newspaper, when she reported what was probably the greatest scoop of modern times: the start of World War II. She roamed the conflict zones of the world equipped with little more than a toothbrush, a typewriter and, if need be, a revolver. _____ 9. “They started coming in like the tide. ” That was an official at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar have fled by the thousands to escape a brutal counterinsurgency campaign. They say soldiers burned their villages, shot at random and systematically raped women and girls. _____ 10. Finally, a wealthy activist who bought a $2. 2 million West Village home a decade ago is giving it to the original Manhattanites: the Lenape Native American nation.   Goldwater Bourgeois, the son of the sculptor Louise Bourgeois, said he had always been troubled by the    legend that the Lenape sold Manhattan (the name is their word for “the land of many hills”) to Dutch settlers for the equivalent of $24 worth of goods. “Manhattan is a capitalist rock this is a quiet protest against that,” he said. “I’m giving it back to whom the land was stolen from, and that’s really a joyful event. ” _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

25523,Hurricane Matthew Pummels Haiti and Moves Toward U.S. - The New York Times,"Hurricane Matthew assaulted Haiti’s southern coast with deadly fury on Tuesday, destroying homes and crops, sweeping away livestock and cutting off transportation as a large part of the Caribbean was pummeled by the storm’s     winds and torrential rain. The top United Nations official in Haiti, Mourad Wahba, described the storm as “the largest humanitarian event” in the country of 11 million since a devastating earthquake six years ago, with thousands scrambling for shelter. Haiti’s civil protection agency said a bridge collapse severed the main highway connecting the south with    the capital. Initial reports from the government said that five people had been killed, 10 people had been injured and one person was missing. Interior Minister François Anick Joseph said Tuesday night that 14, 530 people had been evacuated and that about 2, 200 homes were flooded or destroyed. As of Wednesday morning, the storm, which was downgraded to Category 3, from Category 4, had passed through Cuba, and the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned that a dangerous surge was beginning to spread over the Bahamas, to the north. A hurricane warning was in effect for Haiti, parts of the Bahamas and of Cuba, and a coastal stretch of Florida that includes Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, as well as Lake Okeechobee. As the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia braced for wind and rain, officials in the Caribbean took stock of the destruction. Georges Dubuche, the former director general of Haiti’s Ministry of Health who serves on an advisory board for Direct Relief, an aid organization, said on Tuesday that he feared that there would be “maybe hundreds of dead. ” Mr. Joseph acknowledged that the scope of the destruction was not yet clear and that the government was still assessing the damage. The storm threw into doubt the   plans for presidential elections scheduled for Sunday. Officials were expected to announce a decision on Wednesday, with many experts saying it would be nearly impossible to conduct voting with crucial infrastructure crippled or destroyed. “I have a suspicion they will hold it in two weeks,” said Leslie Voltaire, the campaign manager for one of the candidates, Maryse Narcisse. “But it is only a suspicion. ” The storm was still a Category 4 when it made landfall around 7 a. m. Tuesday at Les Anglais, on the southwestern tip of Haiti, the western half of the island of Hispaniola. Frantic residents in the south said by phone that they were coping with major devastation as the storm felled trees, ripped roofs and destroyed farms in what already was a struggling area in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country. “Thank God our neighbors came to save us,” said Daphne Thelma, a resident of Les Cayes, one of the   towns on the southern coast. “We lost all our crops, and have nothing left. ” She said her family of eight, four of them children, had been rescued by neighbors as trees crashed into their home. The family split up to ride out the storm in different houses. Adassa Romilus, a spokeswoman for Heifer International, a charity that works with 30, 000 farming families in Haiti, said many livestock placed in shelters for protection had been killed. “The shelters couldn’t withstand the force of the hurricane,” she said. Officials reported that roughly 400 homes had been destroyed. In the town of Kay Coq on the remote island of    a fishing community of 2, 000 people about six miles off the coast of Les Cayes, the hurricane left a scene of chaos. “Right now there is no more Kay Coq,” said Carobert Altema, 58, a fisherman. “Houses are down, people are screaming. We have no updates about which people are missing. ” Mr. Altema said household belongings had been washed out to sea. “At my age, this is the first time I have experienced something like this,” he said. Aid organizations in Haiti said rescue efforts were focused on evacuating people from houses threatened with collapse. “People have been leaving their homes under the full force of the storm to find shelters,” said   Fignole, a program manager in Haiti for Oxfam, the international charity. Mr. Fignole said the storm had hit Haiti just as farmers in the south were about to harvest plantains, a staple in their subsistence diet. “There will be real hunger in the weeks ahead,” he said. Other charitable groups doing work in Haiti also expressed alarm about the storm’s effect on food production in the country, which has been struggling to recover from a prolonged drought. John Hasse, national director for World Vision Haiti, said that the storm destroyed avocado trees and that at least two communities had lost their entire banana crops. “We have gotten good rain this year. We were starting to see progress in malnutrition,” he said, because families were able to prepare healthier food for their children. “We think this is going to destroy a lot of it. ” The National Hurricane Center had projected 15 to 25 inches of rain for southern Haiti and in the southwestern part of the Dominican Republic, warning that as much as 40 inches of rain might fall in some areas. Some streets in    flooded, and public transit was paralyzed. But by late afternoon, the storm appeared to have spared    the worst of its wrath. Moderate rain was falling, residents reported, with no sign of the catastrophic flooding that was affecting areas farther south. Although the sea level rose at the edge of Cité Soleil, the city’s harbor slum, the water did not breach the central wharf. Residents in the most vulnerable part of the slum, a   shantytown called Deye Chabon, piled logs and garbage into barricades that kept the water from spilling into the narrow streets. Nonetheless, residents of Deye Chabon were keeping a wary eye on the sea. “They say if it keeps rising, they will have to go find another place to be,” said Sherby St. Louis, 16, a student. Melanie Jean Pierre, 32, a street vendor, said she was riding out the storm in    with her children. She said the only damage had come from a leak in the roof that soaked her bed. More than four million children may be threatened by the hurricane, Unicef warned on Tuesday. “Waterborne diseases are the first threat to children in similar situations,” Marc Vincent, the Unicef representative in Haiti, said. “Our first priority is to make sure children have enough safe water. ” Jessica Pearl, the Haiti country director for the Mercy Corps charity, who lives in    said a main concern in   areas would be providing drinking water, which she described as “a problem in normal times. ” Haiti still is recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake, with 55, 000 people living in shelters. A cholera epidemic that followed the earthquake has persisted, and it spiked in 2016. Partners in Health, an aid agency that has long worked in Haiti, says there have been 26, 000 cholera cases this year. The hurricane “has the potential to be a big setback for years of efforts to bring cholera under control,” Ms. Pearl said. “The people here have just been pushed down by one thing after another. ” The hurricane center had warned that the combination of a dangerous storm surge and large and destructive waves could raise water levels by seven to 11 feet above normal tide levels on the southern coast of Cuba seven to 10 feet on the southern coast of Haiti four to six feet on the northern coast of Cuba and four to six feet in Jamaica. Officials in the United States were preparing for one of the most powerful hurricanes to threaten the East Coast. The governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared emergencies while meteorologists refined their forecasts and suggested that the storm could lash the shoreline into the weekend. More than 2, 000 National Guard soldiers were activated across the South, and the authorities planned lane reversals, school closures and sandbag distribution sites. In Florida, where hurricane and tropical storm watches were in effect for part of the coast, officials were considering evacuations. “The problem we have with this storm is that the projected path is right along our coast,” Gov. Rick Scott said on Tuesday during a stop in the Florida Keys. “If it turns, we’re not going to have a lot of time to make a decision. The best thing is to be prepared and not to take any chances. ” Mr. Scott warned that the storm could prove “catastrophic,” and officials worried about extended power failures, widespread flooding and a lack of preparation along the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor. Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who said officials expected Matthew to strike the state as a Category 2 or 3 hurricane, deferred a decision on a coastal evacuation until Wednesday. “I would love nothing more than to see this just suddenly take a   turn and go out to sea,” said Ms. Haley, who told about one million residents to prepare to leave the coast as soon as Wednesday afternoon.",1
25524,Report: FBI to Move to “Likely Indictment” Of Clinton Foundation,"Home / BREAKING NEWS / Report: FBI to Move to “Likely Indictment” Of Clinton Foundation Report: FBI to Move to “Likely Indictment” Of Clinton Foundation Claire Bernish November 3, 2016 1 Comment 
A new report says the FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation has taken a “very high priority” after dragging on for over a year in its White Collar Crime Division, and a preponderance of evidence means a forthcoming indictment is “likely.” 
Two unnamed, separate sources with “intimate knowledge” of the investigation told FOX News ’ Bret Baier the FBI is “actively and aggressively pursuing this case” — even re-interviewing key people for the third time. 
Ironically, one of the anonymous sources told Baier the investigation has benefited from ongoing publications by Wikileaks of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s emails, in that “There is an avalanche of new information coming in every day.” 
Taken in conjunction with the rapidly approaching presidential election on November 8, it appears Julian Assange’s ‘October Surprise’ could have lasting implications beyond lifting the veil from behind-the-scenes wrangling by Clinton campaign insiders, corporate media, and Democratic National Committee. 
However, even before Wikileaks began publishing the Podesta Files, unnamed law enforcement sources told FOX News , the bureau had collected “a great deal of evidence.” 
“FBI agents have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple people on the foundation case,” FOX reports, “which is looking into possible pay for play interaction between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.” 
Indeed, an indictment on the pay-for-play scandal appears likely, “barring some obstruction in some way” from the Department of Justice. 
Real Clear Politics summarized major points of Baier’s revealing report, noting the FBI’s investigation is “far more expansive than anybody has reported so far.” 
In fact, although previous revelations the FBI had made special “side agreements” to “destroy” the laptops of Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson — which prompted scathing criticism and doubts about possible purposeful decimation of evidence — Real Clear Politics notes those computers “have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them.” 
Baier reports, “As a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides, including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the FBI would destroy those laptops after a narrow review. We are told definitively that has not happened. Those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C. and are being exploited. 
“The source points out that any immunity deal is null and void if any subject lied at any point in the investigation.” 
Further, elaborating suspicions about aide Huma Abedin’s now-estranged husband’s laptop causing the FBI to relaunch its investigation, Real Clear Politics notes, “Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton’s secret server on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature.” 
While Baier’s sources, being unnamed, are impossible to verify, the FOX report comes on the heels of reporting by the Wall Street Journal — also citing unnamed sources “familiar” with the same investigation — which states, “Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay.” 
Those sources, paraphrased by the WSJ , explained, “Agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called ‘Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.’” 
Inter- and intra-agency disputes over the strength of evidence surrounding the pay-to-play allegations against the Clinton Foundation left senior officials at both the FBI and DOJ at odds with lower-ranking investigators, who felt that — in combination with ‘Clinton Cash’ and the aforementioned recordings — promising leads deserved to be pursued. 
Internal discord spilled into the public arena recently when FBI Director James Comey took the highly anomalous step of publicly announcing the investigation had been re-started — sparking condemnation by President Obama, politicians, and other officials about potentially influencing the looming election. 
Partly fueling the internal squabble over investigating the foundation are those who blame Comey’s second-in-command, “deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation,” the WSJ reports. 
While FBI agents continued making headway in an informal probe to decide whether a full investigation was warranted, official in the Justice Department began objecting to their actions, under the premise the evidence was flimsy at best — despite further statements from informants and additional information beyond what had been presented in “Clinton Cash.” 
As the WSJ describes: 
“FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. 
“As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn’t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly.” 
Friction between the DOJ and FBI reached a pivotal point when a ‘senior Justice Department official’ summoned McCabe to a meeting over the perception agents had rebuffed instructions from superiors not to pursue the investigation further. 
“Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?” the WSJ quoted McCabe asking the official. 
“Of course not,” the DOJ official is said to have replied. 
Whether or not quashing a deeper investigation into the Clinton Foundation had, in actuality, been the Justice Department’s intent may never be clear — but given the overlapping dates of this bickering and the FOX News report of the yearlong probe, it would seem the Clintons are still very much treading water.

25527,"Your Wednesday Evening Briefing: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Fort McMurray - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump stands unchallenged for the Republican presidential nomination after John Kasich followed Ted Cruz out of the race. Mr. Trump now faces an electoral map that heavily favors Hillary Clinton. In recent interviews with The New York Times, Mr. Trump sketched out what he meant to be a reassuring vision of his early presidency, including rapid action on a wall with Mexico and halting Muslim immigration. _____ 2. Bernie Sanders holds a lead on Mr. Trump even wider than Hillary Clinton’s, according to a new national poll. Mr. Sanders, who won the Indiana primary on Tuesday but remains far behind in delegates, cites his strong performance against Mr. Trump as a main argument for staying in the race. _____ 3. President Obama made his first visit to Flint, Mich. since the water crisis emerged, promising that he would not rest till the water was safe. He earned applause after asking for a glass of water. “I really did need a glass of water,” he said as he sipped. “This is not a stunt. ” _____ 4. The cause of Prince’s death has not been announced yet, but a clue emerged.

25528,Israeli Convicted in Murder of Palestinian Teenager - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   An Israeli court convicted a    man on Tuesday of abducting and murdering a Palestinian teenager in 2014, rejecting his   insanity plea and bringing to a close a case that has convulsed Israelis and Palestinians. The Jerusalem District Court ruled that the man, Yosef Haim   had been fully responsible for his actions when he and two teenage nephews snatched Muhammad Abu Khdeir, 16, off a street near his East Jerusalem home, drove him to a forest on the outskirts of the city, choked him, beat him unconscious and burned him to death in the early hours of July 2, 2014. Mr.   told investigators during a recorded   of the crime that he had urged his young relatives, who struggled with their captive in the back of the car, to “finish him off. ” Prosecutors are demanding a life sentence. One of the teenage defendants was sentenced in February to life in prison, and the other to 21 years, after the judges determined that he had played a lesser role in the murder. Their names have not been made public because they were 16 at the time of the crime. The murder took place at a particularly traumatic period in Israel’s recent history  —   a few hours after Israelis buried three teenagers who had been hitchhiking home from their yeshivas in the occupied West Bank when they were abducted, shot and killed by Palestinians. Their bodies were found in a shallow grave on a West Bank hillside after a wrenching   search. The Israeli authorities determined that Mr.   and his nephews intended to carry out a revenge attack, leading to Muhammad’s death. The kidnappings and killings roiled Israeli and Palestinian emotions, touched off riots in East Jerusalem and contributed to a spiral of tensions and violence culminating in the   Gaza war that ended in August 2014. Hussein Abu Khdeir, Muhammad’s father, who has closely followed the trial, attended dozens of court hearings and accused Mr.   of having faked an act of insanity, said he mistrusted the Israeli justice system because “it judges Arabs one way, and Jews another. ” After the ruling on Tuesday, Mr. Abu Khdeir said he wanted “justice all the way,” meaning a life sentence, no prospect of a presidential pardon and the demolition of Mr.  ’s family home, “exactly like they do to Arabs, so that there is democracy. ” “We are tired of this,” he added. “Don’t ask how we feel. For the past year and nine months we haven’t gone to parties. My cousin got married two weeks ago, and we didn’t go. We can’t go. ” Waves of violence have shaken Jerusalem in the years since Muhammad’s death. Tensions over a contested holy site revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the   Mosque compound reignited rioting in Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem and contributed to a surge of stabbing and vehicular attacks by Palestinians against Israelis that spread from Jerusalem to the West Bank and cities around Israel over the past six months. On Monday more than 20 people were wounded when a bomb exploded on a bus in Jerusalem  —   the first bus bombing in years. Mr.   a resident of a West Bank settlement who ran a glasses store in Jerusalem, did not testify during his trial. Asher Ohayon, the public defender representing him, said during the trial that his client was in “a state of denial” and unable to remember his actions or to communicate. Mr.   who had received psychiatric treatment in the past, including for   disorder, submitted a late opinion by an American psychiatrist after the main court proceedings were over. The psychiatrist told the court that while Mr.   understood what he was doing at the time of the crime, the manic and psychotic symptoms he displayed in the past might have affected his ability to control his actions. The prosecution argued that Mr.   had worked up until the time of the killing, including that evening, and had acted normally and rationally during and after the episode. He made sure to destroy evidence of his crime  —   showing that he understood that his actions were unacceptable  —   and later gave a coherent account of the events of that night, during the   prosecutors said. A   Israeli psychiatrist found that Mr.   was aware of his actions and was not psychotic at the time of the crime, and the court agreed. In addition to murder, the court convicted Mr.   of abduction for the purpose of murder, assault, attempted arson and attempted kidnapping. Mr.   and one of his nephews had tried to kidnap an    Palestinian boy in the same area of East Jerusalem the night before Muhammad was killed, but the boy’s mother shouted and struggled with the kidnappers, and the boy got away. “The acts the accused carried out are of the cruelest imaginable,” a state prosecutor, Uri Korb, said after the ruling. “He burned the victim while he was alive, all motivated by crazed revenge. ” The Jerusalem District Court also convicted on Tuesday an Israeli man, Yishai Schlissel, of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder for his deadly stabbing rampage at the city’s gay pride parade in July, when he killed Shira Banki, a    Jewish girl. Mr. Schlissel, an   Jew, was released from prison shortly before the march, after having served 10 years for stabbing participants in the gay pride parade in 2005.",1
25529,Remembering President John F. Kennedy [Video],"The 53 rd anniversary of the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is remembered and his life is celebrated.
On Nov. 22, 1963, the 35 th President of the United States was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, at 12:30 p.m., in Dallas, Texas. He was in a motorcade with his wife Jacqueline, the Governor of Texas John Connally and his wife. They were traveling through Dealey Plaza when he was shot.
He won the 1960 election by a narrow margin, although, in 1961, more than 60 percent of the population claimed they voted for Kennedy. He brought a special new aspect to the White House; a young family, culture, laughter, and class. Most importantly, Americans felt he brought the people hope.
Kennedy was the only Catholic President of the United States. He once stated:
There are three things in life; God, human folly, and laughter. The first two are beyond our comprehension, we must make the best of the third.
The Life of Kennedy: His great-grandparents were immigrants from County Wexford, Ireland. He was fortunate to have not suffered poverty or discrimination, except for the Boston Brahmins, who believed he was “Shanty Irish.” He knew he was a Fenian.
During World War II, his father’s influence helped him enlist in the United States Navy. Kennedy was a skipper of PT-109, in the Salmon Islands. A Japanese destroyer cut his boat in two, in a night action. He was thrown back into the bridge, causing a lifetime back injury. Despite his pain, the skipper collected his crew and saved a burned crewmate by placing a belt under the man’s arms and towing him to shore, holding the belt in his teeth. This act of valor earned him the Navy and Marine Corps. Medal and a Purple Heart.
The Kennedy Presidency: October 1962, the president had to face Russia, concerning the missiles in Cuba. Generals wanted to go to war. However, Kennedy had experienced war, thus, he negotiated a settlement. The world viewed this as a victory for Kennedy.
On June 11, 1963, his Civil Rights speech was televised across the nation. He asked Americans to allow equal rights for their fellow African-American citizens. In his speech, Kennedy stated that the nation was facing a moral issue that was “as old as the Scriptures and as clear as the American Constitution.”
President Kennedy’s Civil Rights Bill was passed by Lyndon Johnson, in 1964.
Also in June 1963, Kennedy delivered a speech in Berlin. This famous speech is known as “Ich bin EIN Berliner.” He offered the citizens of the country hope and warned Russia that their time was coming.
He left Berlin and flew to Ireland to address the Irish Parliament. Kennedy made a point to visit Arbour Hill, the mass grave of 14 of the martyrs in the Easter Rebellion. He is the only United States leader to honor this memorial. He read the names of those buried there, while the Irish Prime Minister Sean Lemass walked by his side. Lemass knew many of the leaders in that grave.
On Aug. 5, 1963, Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This was supposed to make the world a safer place. Nonetheless, four days later, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, the infant son of the president, died. He was two days old.
Monday, November 18, President Kennedy made a stopover in Tampa, Florida. He was the first president to be a guest of this city. Among the multitude of conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of the former president are a few that involve his visit to Tampa.
Tampa Conspiracy Theory: One of the many conspiracy theories claims there was a gunman at the Floridian Hotel. This gunman was prepared to assassinate President Kennedy. This theory is supported by the reports of organized crime in Tampa Bay. Per the story, the Floridian Hotel would be a good place for a sniper to set-up, in preparation to take a shot.
Oswald Acted Alone Despite Disbelief: However, Warren Commission investigated the assassination of President Kennedy and determined, in September 1964, that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. It was concluded that Oswald acted on his own.
The Associated Press conducted a poll in April 2013, and 50 percent of the American population believed more than one person was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. They also believe it was a conspiracy. However, 24 percent of the people think Oswald acted on his own and 16 percent were undecided. A Gallup poll, in 2003, revealed 75 percent of Americans thought there was a conspiracy involved in the death of the president.
In Remembrance: Springfield, Massachusetts, held a ceremony, to honor former President Kennedy, at 1 p.m., on Nov. 22, 2016, at the Eternal Flame in Forest Park. U.S. Rep. Richard Neal and Mayor Domenic Sarno were in attendance.
A memorial wreath and three red roses were left at the Eternal Flame. The ceremony included a moment of silence in honor of Betty Sullivan, the wife of former Springfield Mayor William Sullivan. She recently passed away.

25530,"California Today: A ‘See Something, Say Something’ Prostitution Plan - The New York Times","Good morning. Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Tell us about the issues that matter to you  —   and what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com. Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. Thomas Fuller, the  San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times, provides today’s introduction with news of an unusual   initiative in the Bay Area. Oakland hosts millions of visitors every year for its sports events, thriving restaurant scene and growing technology businesses. The city also gets lots of    johns who prowl the streets for sex. Of the 660 arrests made last year for prostitution in Oakland, more than   of the suspects came from outside the city. On Saturday, Oakland is taking an unconventional step in fighting its image as one of America’s most   cities, introducing a website, reportjohn. org, that city authorities hope will deter customers of the sex trade. Residents will be encouraged to note down the license plate numbers of suspected johns’ vehicles and describe the specific activity they witnessed. The sightings are uploaded to the police, who will send a letter to the address where the vehicle is registered. Karely Ordaz Salto, the chairwoman of the city’s Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Task Force, says Oakland is the first city to target johns in this way. “The hope is that they will think twice and this will deter them,” said Lt. Jill Encinias of the Oakland Police Department. “We really need to attack this problem from all sides. We need to start focusing on the demand. ” The first question in the online form gets straight to the point: “Do you have any photos of the activity?” The city’s problem with prostitution, and especially the involvement of girls, has been underscored this year by a scandal in its police department involving a young prostitute who claimed that she had had sex with officers and said the police had tipped her off to raids. The scandal led to the departure of three police chiefs in less than two weeks. The predecessor to reportjohn. org was a program called Dear John, introduced in 2013, which allowed residents to fill out a form that they submitted to the police. That program generated more than 300 “Dear John” letters mailed to the owners of the vehicles spotted by residents. The police department considered it such a success that the authorities wanted to move it to an online format. Although the program could conceivably lead to foul play  —   vendettas by jilted lovers or disgruntled neighbors come to mind  —   Lieutenant Encinias said there had been no signs of false reporting in the Dear John program. That said, stay tuned for reaction from civil liberties groups. “This has historically been something that people thought they could do in the shadows,” said Erica Terry Derryck, a spokeswoman for Mayor Libby Schaaf. “The intent is to put people on notice. ” • No, the federal government does not have plans to kill 45, 000 wild horses in the western United States.

That’s the idea behind two new   crosswalk designs in downtown Santa Monica. The city hired two artists, armed with buckets of boldly colored paints, to create the artworks this week as part of an effort to delight pedestrians, said Constance Farrell, a city spokeswoman. The Federal Highway Administration actually frowns on crosswalk art, calling them distracting. But that hasn’t stopped a bunch of municipalities from doing it, anyway. Long Beach, West Hollywood and San Francisco are among the cities that have colored their crosswalks in recent years, though perhaps not quite on so grand a scale as Santa Monica. One of the designs fills the entire intersection at one of the city’s 12 new “scramble crosswalks”  —   the kind that lets you cross the street every which way, including diagonally. Counter to the government’s recommendations, Ms. Farrell suggested that the bright colors would improve safety by catching drivers’ attention. One has to wonder, though, how long the sheen will hold up under an unending march of vehicle tires and footsteps. “Upkeep is something we’re monitoring,” Ms. Farrell said.

25531,Donald Trump Summons Tech Leaders to a Round-Table Meeting - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   During the long presidential campaign, the most resolutely   part of the country was the narrow strip of land south of this city. Silicon Valley shunned the Republican candidate and all he stood for. It mobilized its technology for his defeat and warned of dire consequences if he should somehow win. Now that the impossible has happened, tech’s day of reckoning is here  —   next Wednesday afternoon, to be precise. The   is summoning leaders of the biggest tech companies to New York for a   discussion, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations. The agenda is undisclosed and perhaps still under consideration, but it is unlikely to produce the sort of love fest that existed between President Obama and Silicon Valley. Tech culture celebrates disruption as the tool that produces a better future for all. Many of Donald J. Trump’s supporters, on the other hand, see it as pushing them down. How to reconcile these views is the task of Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and Facebook board member whose role is to formulate a tech policy for the new administration. Mr. Thiel secured this position by making a contrarian bet on Mr. Trump’s candidacy, which paid off. The   invitations are from Mr. Thiel Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    and Reince Priebus, the incoming chief of staff. If the past is any precedent, Mr. Trump might suggest or even order the tech overlords to do what he thinks necessary. The   met on Tuesday with Masayoshi Son, the founder and chief executive of SoftBank Group, which recently created a new investment fund that could invest up to $100 billion in tech companies worldwide. Afterward, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that Mr. Son agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and create “50, 000 new jobs. ” Two Silicon Valley chief executives appeared willing to test the waters: Safra Catz, of the software maker Oracle, confirmed her participation in next week’s meeting with Mr. Trump. So did Chuck Robbins of Cisco Systems, the networking gear maker. Representatives for other leading tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple, declined to comment. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Mr. Thiel has said in interviews that the benefits accruing to tech investors like himself should be more widely shared outside a few ZIP codes in New York and around San Francisco. One role of the meeting is to spur ideas for changing this situation. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment. In Apple’s case, Mr. Trump has said he told its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, in late November that he wants the company to build “a big plant” in the United States  —   or even better, “many big plants. ” Apple itself does not do any manufacturing in the United States. A contractor, Flex, manufactures   desktop computers on its behalf in Austin, Tex. employing about 2, 000 people. A vast majority of Apple’s production is in China, where there is an enormous ecosystem devoted to it. Many economists say that reproducing such an interlocking web of suppliers here would push the cost of iPhones up considerably. Mr. Trump also tangled with Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, during the campaign, saying that Mr. Bezos has “a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much. ” Amazon is overwhelmingly the dominant force in  . In its original business of books, for example, it is by far the most important retailer of both physical and electronic books. In several spheres, it is developing technology that eliminates the middleman  —   in other words, jobs. This week, the company debuted a new system for operating stores without cashiers. How much Silicon Valley is reconciling itself to the thought of President Trump is a complicated question. Last week, David O. Sacks, the chief executive of the   software   Zenefits, said he was stepping down after having had discussions about helping Mr. Trump’s transition team. Mr. Sacks is a longtime associate of Mr. Thiel’s. If there are some overtures being made in Silicon Valley, there are also some lines being drawn. Chris Sacca, a prominent venture investor, said there was only one path for those attending next week’s meeting: defiance. “If an attendee wants to maintain their integrity and preserve their company’s ability to recruit the best talent, then there is only one purpose for a trip to Trump Tower: to deliver the message that our industry will not be complicit in the systematic disgrace of our democratic institutions, the establishment of an authoritarian kleptocracy nor the oppression of citizens, including the minority of Americans who elected him,” Mr. Sacca said. Or perhaps everyone will get along fine. Some in Silicon Valley speculate that the rough moments between Mr. Trump and the tech industry come not because they are so different but because they are at the bottom so similar. “Trump embodies the harsher aspects of Silicon Valley  —   a brash and arrogant disrupter, convinced that the world is all wrong as it is and only he can change it for the better,” said Shiva Ramesh, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Even Mr. Trump’s    plans have a familiar ring. “Sounds like the pitch of some  : ‘It is all there in my head and in a   plan, it will all work out, I can do it, trust me,’” Mr. Ramesh said.",1
25537,"Risks Higher for Front-Seat Passengers in Some S.U.V. Crashes, Tests Show - The New York Times","  passengers in some small sport utility vehicles may not be as well protected as drivers in certain types of crashes, according to recent tests of seven vehicles by the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The tests, known as small overlap frontal tests, were similar to the kind that the institute conducts by directing the   impact to the driver’s side of the vehicle. But in these latest tests, whose results were released on Thursday, the impact was on the S. U. V. s’ front passenger side. Among the small S. U. V.s tested, a 2015 Toyota RAV4 received a rating of “poor” on its   results. A 2014 Nissan Rogue and 2014 Subaru Forester received “marginal” safety ratings for   passengers. All seven vehicles had received the highest rating  —   “good’’  —   for protecting drivers in earlier, similar crash tests. But sitting next to the driver can be a riskier proposition. Of the seven, only a 2016 Hyundai Tucson earned a “good’’ rating on the   test. The remaining three  —   a 2015 Buick Encore, a 2015 Honda   and a 2015 Mazda    —   were rated “acceptable. ’’ (The different models reflect the first year in each case when modification were made that enabled the vehicles to earn their “good” ratings for the   tests.) The findings matter because more than 1, 600 passengers in the right front seats of vehicles of all types died in frontal crashes in 2014, according to the federal government’s fatality data. It is not known how many of those crashes were of the sort replicated by the insurance institute’s tests, which involve 25 percent of the front end of a vehicle striking a rigid barrier at 40 miles an hour. The test, which uses dummies, aims to show what happens when a vehicle runs off the road and strikes an object like a tree or utility pole. The insurance institute, which has been conducting this test for four years, was aware that automakers were focusing their initial safety improvement efforts on the driver’s side of vehicles  —   given that there is always a driver in the car, but not necessarily a   passenger. “Some manufacturers told us that in the short term they could make more driver’  modifications to more vehicle models to improve safety rather than making improvements to both sides,’’ said Becky Mueller, a senior research engineer at the insurance institute and the lead author of the report on the latest tests. But the expectation was that automakers would start to make modifications to the passenger side as well. “We are now four years into the testing and we want to remind manufacturers that the short term doesn’t last forever,” Mrs. Mueller said. “Consumers are going to want the same level of protection for drivers and   passengers,” she said. “They expect that when we rate a vehicle ‘good,’ it applies to both sides of the vehicle. ” The small overlap frontal test is the newest of the insurance institute’s crash tests. It began in 2012 as the institute, which is funded by the insurance industry, was trying to determine why people were still being seriously injured or killed in frontal crashes, despite seatbelts, airbags and “good” frontal crash test ratings. One of its studies of newer vehicles found that small overlap frontal crashes accounted for about 20 to 25 percent of those injuries and deaths. Automakers began redesigning their vehicles to get better scores on the new test and provide better protection. The insurance institute said that since the test’s introduction, 13 automakers have made structural changes to 97 vehicles. Because crash forces in the small frontal overlap test are concentrated on the front wheel, suspension and firewall, the passenger’s survival space can be seriously compromised by intruding structures. The front wheel can be forced back into the footwell, resulting in serious and debilitating leg and foot injuries on the driver’s side as the test dummy’s feet and legs get caught up in the metal pedals. It is also easy for drivers and passengers to hit their heads and chests against metal structures, like the instrument panel, protruding into the vehicle. “If the structure is so badly intruded, the airbag can’t do its job effectively,” Mrs. Mueller said. In the Toyota RAV4 test, the intrusion into the interior of the vehicle on the passenger’s side was 13 inches deeper than on the driver’s side. And the RAV4’s   door popped open, which in a crash would put the occupant at risk of being ejected. In 2013, when the RAV4 was tested for the first time, it got a “poor” small overlap rating. The 2015 model received a good rating, but Toyota did not make the same safety improvements to the passenger side. In a written statement responding to the new test results, Toyota said, in part: “The I. I. H. S. small overlap test is severe, specialized and goes beyond federal vehicle safety requirements. “Rather than waiting to   both driver’s and passenger’s sides,’’ Toyota added, “we took immediate steps to enhance performance on the driver’s side. ” The company said that it had incorporated safety enhancements on both sides for vehicles built on Toyota’s new platforms, beginning with the 2016 Prius. With the Nissan Rogue, maximum intrusion on the passenger side was 10 inches more than on the driver’s side, and the door hinge pillar, which is at the bottom of the passenger compartment where the rocker panel meets the A pillar  —   a front roof support  —   was torn off completely, although the door remained closed. In a written statement, Nissan said: “Nissan is committed to the safety and security of our customers and their passengers. We are aware of the I. I. H. S. testing and we are currently reviewing the details to assess opportunities for improved performance. ’’ Hyundai, meantime, was happy to promote its results. “Our 2016 Tucson’s good rating for both driver and passenger in the demanding I. I. H. S. small overlap crash test reflects our commitment to passenger safety at every level,’’ Mike O’Brien, a vice president for Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement. Here are the full results of the    tests: Driver side: GOOD Passenger side: GOOD _____ Driver side: GOOD Passenger side: ACCEPTABLE _____ Driver side: GOOD Passenger side: ACCEPTABLE _____ Driver side: GOOD Passenger side: ACCEPTABLE _____ Driver side: GOOD Passenger side: MARGINAL _____ Driver side: GOOD Passenger side: MARGINAL _____ Driver side: GOOD Passenger side: POOR",1
25538,Let’s Be Clear – A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3,"Archives Michael’s Latest Video Let’s Be Clear – A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3 By   26th, 2016 
If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “temperamental”, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. 
Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are “going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton”… 
On Syria’s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. 
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. 
“What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.” 
In order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. 
And in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. 
According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences… 
Russia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. 
“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” Clapper said, speaking with CBS’ Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. 
Of course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria “would require us to go to war” … 
“Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,… That’s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I’m not going to make.” ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) 
But Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. 
You see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn’t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no “humanitarian crisis” in Syria at all. 
Thanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won’t have anywhere to hide. 
So the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. 
One recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates … 
“Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation – at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,” Putin said. 
“Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,” Putin noted. 
Anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. 
And even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania … Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America’s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. 
In addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia… 
After accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. 
A rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. 
“The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,” said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide. 
Most Americans aren’t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. 
But in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation … 
Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. 
At the Kremlin’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. 
The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. 
I know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. 
In my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn’t know how the election would turn out. 
At this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. 
If you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don’t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. 
If the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years.

25541,Comment on Report Exposes Inner Workings of Facebook and How Clinton Loyalists Control Your Newsfeed by Phil Freeman,"Home / Be The Change / Flex Your rights / Report Exposes Inner Workings of Facebook and How Clinton Loyalists Control Your Newsfeed Report Exposes Inner Workings of Facebook and How Clinton Loyalists Control Your Newsfeed Claire Bernish October 30, 2016 1 Comment 
Censorship by Facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press — for instance, sentiments not praising Hillary Clinton — and now, through both a new report from Reuters and emails published by Wikileaks, we have insight into why certain posts are targeted. 
Facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive, violent, or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards — but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts, pages, and groups are made remains unknown. 
And Facebook takedowns, no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make, have been no less controversial or questionable — and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case. 
Recent examples of head-scratchers which led to an international uproar, include Facebook’s removal of the iconic Vietnam War photograph of Phan Thị Kim Phúc — who, at just 9-years-old, was captured on film by an Associated Press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a Buddhist pagoda in the village of Trang Bang. 
That photograph helped cement in the collective American mind the horrors of the war, and ultimately fueled the success of the anti-war effort — but Facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity — and proceeded even to ban the page of the Conservative prime minister of Norway for also posting the image. 
Ultimately, the social media company reversed course in that case — but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader Rosa Park’s arrest. 
But taking down of the image of Kim Phúc might not have been simply an error of AI, since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal, two unnamed former Facebook employees told Reuters . 
“Trainers told content-monitoring staffers that the photo violated Facebook policy, despite its historical significance, because it depicted a naked child, in distress, photographed without her consent, the employees told Reuters.” 
In the final decision to reverse that censorship, Facebook head of the community operations division, Justin Osofsky, admitted it had been a “mistake.” 
According to Reuters , to whom many current and former Facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity, the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will, in certain instances, be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the company’s elite executives. 
In addition to Osofsky, Global Policy Chief Monika Bickert; government relations chief, Joel Kaplan; vice president for public policy and communications, Elliot Schrage; and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals. 
“All five studied at Harvard, and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution. All but Sandberg hold law degrees. Three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to Sandberg,” the outlet notes. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions. But there are others. 
Company spokeswoman Christine Chen explained, “Facebook has a broad, diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement, with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand.” 
For those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship, recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by. Often, the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors. 
Indeed, and once again flaring international controversy, Facebook disabled , among others, the accounts of editors of Quds and Shehab New Agency — prominent Palestinian media organizations — without explanation or even a specific example given for justification. 
Although three of four Palestinian-focused accounts were restored, Facebook refused to comment to either Reuters or the accounts’ owners why the decision was reversed, except to say it had been an ‘error.’ 
In fact, although Chen and other Facebook insiders spoke with Reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures, many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences. 
Earlier this year, an exposé by Gizmodo showing Facebook’s suppression of conservative outlets via its “Trending Topics” section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays. Alternative media, too, which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm, has often been the subject of controversial take-downs, censorship, and suppressive tactics — either directly by Facebook, or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots. 
However, considering Sheryl Sandberg and her loyalists populate the top-level group deciding the fate for content removal complaints, it would appear Wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred, left-leaning narrative. 
In a June 4, 2015, email to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by Wikileaks — penned by Sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband, states , in part, 
“And I still want HRC to win badly. I am still here to help as I can. She came over and was magical with my kids.” 
After a wave of post removals and temporary page bans, it appears Facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards — and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives. 
Senior members of Facebook’s policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards, which — though welcome — might only provide temporary relief. Quoted by the Wall Street Journal , they wrote : 
“In the weeks ahead, we’re going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest—even if they might otherwise violate our standards.” 
While the social media giant deems itself a technology, and not news, platform, Facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users. Although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content, putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility — and grave importance — of free speech.

25542,"Sex and That ’70s Single Woman, Mary Tyler Moore - The New York Times","“Let’s get her some sex. ” Susan Silver says that was one of her chief contributions as a writer on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ” Playing the beloved young housewife Laura Petrie a few years earlier, Ms. Moore and her TV husband, Dick Van Dyke, had been made to sleep in separate beds. But it was the 1970s now. Even good girls had sex. Ms. Silver and the other women writing for “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” made sure of it. [ Read Mary Tyler Moore’s obituary | How she changed fashion ] As Ms. Moore’s new sitcom character, the independent, single career woman Mary Richards, put it in one episode: “I’m hardly innocent. I’ve been around. Well, all right I might not have been around. But I’ve been nearby. ” Ms. Silver said there was no particular feminist agenda for the show. There was, however, an   number of female writers on it  —   well over a dozen in the show’s   run that started in 1970. They were encouraged, she said, to write from their own experience, and to let Mary Richards’s   derive “organically. ” That made “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” a laboratory for the social issues of the day, which in some cases were being reflected for the first time on   television. Sex, birth control, equal pay, workplace sexism, homosexuality  —   all took a turn on the show, and not from the bully pulpit but from the “girl” who could turn the world on with her smile. Here’s how they played: When Lou Grant (Ed Asner) interviews Mary Richards for an associate producer job in his Minneapolis TV newsroom, he asks questions that women in the workplace often got asked but that weren’t necessarily legal: How old are you? Are you married? Divorced? What religion are you? She calls him out but answers anyway, in the show’s first episode. The point was not belabored but Mary Richards slept with her boyfriends. A   Chicago journalist had suggested that Mary, who was 30 when the series began, was “undersexed,” Ms. Silver said, and so in Season 3, Ms. Silver wrote an episode in which Mary asked her friend Rhoda if that was the case. A few episodes later, Mary goes on a date and comes home the next morning in the same dress. “Men across the country wrote to the show in despair over the betrayal of their trust and admiration,” Jennifer Keishin Armstrong wrote in her 2013 book, “Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted: And All the Brilliant Minds That Made ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ a Classic. ” The third season featured another   handled in a    way. Mary’s friend Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) tries to push her brother into Mary’s arms, but the brother (Robert Moore) is more taken with Phyllis’s archnemesis, Rhoda (Valerie Harper). Phyllis works herself into a lather over this development, until Rhoda puts her out of her misery. “He’s not my type,” she reassures Phyllis, who remains skeptical. No really, Rhoda says. “He’s gay. ” Mr. Moore himself was gay, and he embraced the late decision to out the character this plainly, Ms. Armstrong writes in her book, especially since all the laughs were directed at his clueless TV sister. Had the Pill ever been mentioned in a sitcom script before “Mary Tyler Moore”? If so, the moment has been lost to history. Not long after the   episode, Mary’s father, at loose ends after his retirement, is visiting Mary for dinner at her apartment. Mary’s mother, making her exit, turns at the door. “Don’t forget to take your pill!” she calls out. “I won’t,” father and daughter answer in unison. Cut to the comically guilty look on Mary’s face. The Pill had won federal approval in 1960, but it was only that year, 1972, that a Supreme Court decision had made it available to unmarried women. And Mary was unmarried, for all seven seasons. Early hopes to make her a divorcée from the outset were instantly quashed by queasy executives. “It used to be I felt I could be myself. Now I feel I represent women everywhere. ” The third season opens with Mary kvetching to Rhoda as she prepares for a meeting at the TV station, where she resents the station manager “trotting in groups of people and saying, ‘This is our woman executive. ’” Her views take on a slightly different cast when she discovers that she makes $50 a week less than the man who had her job before her. She confronts Lou, asking him why. “Because he was a man,” Lou says. “The Dick Van Dyke Show” ended just four years before “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” made its premiere, even though it seemed the two shows were worlds apart. Ms. Moore broke ground in the earlier show, too, though. When the script called for her to vacuum in skirt and heels, she put her foot (in ballet flat) down and her Capri pants on. “We got the absolution of men everywhere,” she told TV Guide a few years ago, “and women kind of breathed a sigh of relief, too, and said: ‘Hey, that’s right. That’s what we wear. ’”",1
25547,The Modern History of ‘Rigged’ US Elections,"The Modern History of ‘Rigged’ US Elections   Robert Parry, Consortium News 
The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world’s “gold standard” that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The “wise men” of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens’ judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation’s leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn’t vote). 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy’s vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South’s heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. 
Nixon’s ‘Treason’ 
So, by 1968, the Democrats’ once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn’t want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that — with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided — President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. 
The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixon’s campaign went behind Johnson’s back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnson’s Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixon’s emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam. 
Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixon’s “treason”— from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election — he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford – three pillars of the Establishment – expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking: 
“Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that I’m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected,” Clifford said. “It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our country’s interests.” 
Clifford’s words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of America’s electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process. 
To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixon’s treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the library’s archivists call the file on Nixon’s sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their “X-file.” [For details, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ LBJ’s ‘X-File’ on Nixon’s ‘Treason. ’”] 
The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixon’s paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his “treason”– top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJ’s presidency – led to Nixon’s creation of the “plumbers,” a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the “plumbers” became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters at the Watergate in Washington. 
Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixon’s far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnson’s Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixon’s sabotage — and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome — the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “ The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .”] 
In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixon’s strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting president’s foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign. 
Reagan’s ‘October Surprise’ Caper 
In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagan’s campaign feared that Carter might pull off an “October Surprise” by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagan’s team take action to block Carter’s October Surprise? 
The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagan’s team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carter’s October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixon’s Paris peace talk maneuver. 
That evidence indicates that Reagan’s campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages’ release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagan’s vice presidential running mate. 
By early November 1980, the public’s obsession with Iran’s humiliation of the United States and Carter’s inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagan’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan. 
Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class. 
Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Iran’s cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. 
In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview: 
“It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. … [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.” 
Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagan’s beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua’s leftist government. 
While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there. 
A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt. 
Tired of the Story 
By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 “October Surprise” question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991. 
However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israel’s exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 “October Surprise” case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Casey’s attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages. 
Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic “London alibi” would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the President’s flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation. 
Meanwhile, Bush’s State Department and White House counsel’s office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena. 
Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassy’s confirmation of Casey’s trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape. 
Williamson said that among the State Department “material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown,” Beach noted in a “ memorandum for record ” dated Nov. 4, 1991. 
Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beach’s boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bush’s reelection hopes in 1992. 
At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bush’s reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to “kill/spike this story.” 
Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. “Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate ‘October Surprise’ investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President ,” Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.] 
Among “touchstones” cited by Gray were “No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan.” White House “talking points” on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings. 
Timid Democrats 
But Bush’s White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received – and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993 – there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagan’s election victory. 
That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process – and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be “good for the country.” 
In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beach’s memo regarding Casey’s trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task force’s dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue. 
“The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip” to Madrid, Hamilton told me. “Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.” 
Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task force’s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task force’s investigation. 
“If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us,” Hamilton said, adding that “you have to rely on people” in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquiry’s failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was naïve in the extreme. 
Arguably, Hamilton’s timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bush’s team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamilton’s investigative conclusion reinforced the “group think” dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a “conspiracy theory” when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasn’t done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent. 
Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didn’t make any sense . 
But the dismissive “group think” remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned. [For details, see Robert Parry’s America’s Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.com’s “ Second Thoughts on October Surprise. ”] 
Past as Prologue 
Lee Hamilton’s decision to “clear” Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bush’s rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000. 
President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper), if the full truth had been told about the father’s role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, it’s hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush “stolen election” in 2000. 
Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Florida’s electoral votes and thus the presidency. 
The reality of Gore’s rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Florida’s disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted. 
However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be “good for the country.” 
So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery – that the so-called “over-votes” in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices’ names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the “under-votes” that hadn’t registered on antiquated voting machines. “Over-votes” would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on “clear intent of the voter.” 
However, instead of leading with Gore’s rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. 
On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gore’s victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for “the good of the country,” much as Johnson’s team had done in 1968 regarding Nixon’s sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamilton’s inquiry had done regarding the 1980 “October Surprise” case. 
Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didn’t accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom. 
However, this violation of objective and professional journalism – bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle – was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future. 
By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000 – even if the media’s motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks – the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ Gore’s Victory ,”“ So Bush Did Steal the White House ,” and “ Bush v. Gore’s Dark American Decade. ”] 
A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus 
Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the “stolen” elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful “losers” are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters’ will had been ignored or twisted. 
Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Court’s majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bush’s “legitimacy.” 
Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern “wise man,” in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didn’t ruffle too many feathers. 
But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies – uttered for “the good of the country”– is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. 
So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isn’t pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. 
Trump’s complaints about “rigged” elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they don’t succeed at “stealing” the election from white people. 
There is a racist undertone to Trump’s version of a “rigged” democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. He’s just not honest about what those flaws are. 
The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracy’s “gold standard”; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.

25550,"Alec Baldwin, in His Own Words, on Playing Trump - The New York Times","How exactly did Alec Baldwin construct his mischievously exaggerated,   searingly funny portrayal of Donald J. Trump on “Saturday Night Live”? In the latest episode of “The ” he explains at length, switching in and out of the  ’s character as he describes his comedic craft. Here, he recalls his anxious, improvised debut as Mr. Trump: I spoke with Sarah Maslin Nir, my colleague who conducted (and, thankfully, recorded) the original conversation with Mr. Baldwin, his first interview about the comedic role. The liberal Mr. Baldwin concedes that he holds the   in low regard. But that has not stopped him from becoming a close student of Mr. Trump’s every physical quirk and verbal tic  —   he is particularly taken with Mr. Trump’s tendencies to pause “and then what he comes to is something that you didn’t really have to pause to come up with that. ” But is the performance an act for the sake of comedy or an act of political rebellion? “I’m here doing a show,” Mr. Baldwin says. “I’m a performer, an actor that’s here doing a show. It’s a great part. ” That said, he isn’t shy about where he stands. “I don’t hate him. I want him to enjoy his life. I just want him to not be the president of the United States  —   as quickly as possible. ” As a satirical version of Mr. Trump, Mr. Baldwin now deals with an unexpected dilemma, for him, anyway: Is his portrayal making the new president more human, and thus, more sympathetic? Ms. Nir asked him about that, too. That’s the fake Mr. Trump. The real Mr. Trump had a busy and consequential week, grappling with   global affairs in Germany, Turkey, Russia and Syria that are challenging a presidency focused on domestic economic revival. What did we learn about his interest and influence over international events? I put that question to the White House reporters Maggie Haberman and Mark Landler.   almost always remain silent on foreign policy until their inauguration, to avoid confusing the world about who, exactly, is commander in chief. On this, Mr. Landler and Ms. Haberman agree: Mr. Trump, and his very active Twitter account, have no interest in abiding by that practice. “He doesn’t subscribe to the old idea that the country has one president at a time,” Mr. Landler says. Ms. Haberman questions how much we can deduce about his policy once in office from his current behavior. “When it is not Trump triangulating against Obama and Trump actually having to be the only president, I don’t know what we’re going to see in terms of foreign policy. It’s a little easier for him to do this right now. ” From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.

25551,Comment on 21 Things We’ve Learned About Hillary Clinton from Wikileaks That the MSM Won’t Share…But YOU Can! by Lakshmima,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by Daisy Luther 
Let’s talk about Wikileaks . 
First of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: 
“WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.” 
In the 11 years that they’ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) 
So this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. 
Here are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice…the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik’s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary’s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there’s proof. Zero Hedge writes, “…today’s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band’s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family’s private business endeavors.” A pundit called this leak “The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,” meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she’d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case – surprisingly it isn’t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, “ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .” According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, “Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.” ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, ” How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?” ( source ) Clinton’s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, “ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha’s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .” ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. “And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn’t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I’m kind of far removed because the life I’ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven’t forgotten it.” ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: “ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey “ can’t possibly vet all those refugees so they don’t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.” Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama’s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn’t exert some control over North Korean aggression. “ So China, come on. You either control them or we’re going to have to defend against them ,” she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million “donation” from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . “ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,” Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn’t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton’s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. “ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? ” said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . “ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,” she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. “We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can’t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we’re doing and I want credit for it. ” (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who’s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC’s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC’s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory – it really exists and Hillary’s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you “need” to lie. “If everybody’s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.” ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her “impromptu” CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to “approve” articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC’s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, “ W e need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov .” You see, Obama’s emails all have to be from”whitelisted”addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) 
And finally, here’s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn’t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) 
At the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you “go to Washington” to “make a small fortune.” Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. “ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, ” Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn’t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general.

25555,Tesla Model S Suspension Failures Under Scrutiny by Safety Agency - The New York Times,"Tesla Motors, the maverick   maker, is under scrutiny from federal regulators over suspension failures attributed to its   model  —   along with reports that it had asked owners not to disclose the problem. The nation’s top auto safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said on Thursday that at least some Tesla customers who experienced suspension failures with Model S luxury cars were asked to sign confidentiality agreements about the issue. “The agency immediately informed Tesla that any language implying that consumers should not contact the agency regarding safety concerns is unacceptable, and N. H. T. S. A. expects Tesla to eliminate any such language,” said Bryan Thomas, an agency spokesman. “Tesla representatives told N. H. T. S. A. that it was not their intention to dissuade consumers from contacting the agency. ” The regulator added that the agreements that Tesla required were “troublesome. ” Tesla did not respond Thursday to requests for comment. [On Friday, the company responded in a blog post, saying there was no safety defect with the Model S nor any intent to discourage complaints to regulators.] The safety regulator is examining the Model S suspension  —   the springs, joints and other components that connect a car to its wheels  —   for possible defects that could be causing premature failures. Since October, it has received 33 complaints of suspension parts breaking. A suspension breakdown can cause severe steering problems and make driving impossible, according to filings listed on the agency’s website. A few of the complaints pertained to a requirement that owners sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for having their cars repaired. The suspension problems and the issue of the nondisclosure agreements have also been discussed on blogs for Tesla owners. The company reported that in 2015, it sold 25, 200 Model S cars, which have a starting price of about $70, 000. Tesla has just started offering a sport utility vehicle, the Model X, and is planning to offer a compact car, the Model 3, next year. The company hopes the Model 3 will become its top seller and says it has already received $1, 000 deposits from about 375, 000 potential buyers. The suspension issue with the Model S is the latest sign of quality concerns. The Model X S. U. V. was recalled earlier this year because of a problem with its rear seats. Tesla’s first model, the   Roadster, which was produced from 2008 to 2011, also had its problems. At Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting last month, Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, acknowledged that the Roadster had been plagued by a number of issues. “This car, even though it met all regulatory requirements, it was completely unsafe, broke down all the time and really didn’t work,” Mr. Musk said. Two years ago, the safety administration looked into two instances in which Model S cars caught fire. It determined that the fires were caused by road debris striking the vehicle’s underside, and closed the matter after Tesla agreed to reinforce the shield that protects the battery. For most of its   history, Tesla has tried to break away from many standard auto industry practices, a strategy that at times courts controversy. Its practice of selling its cars online without dealers has led to court battles in several states. The company is also building a gigantic battery factory in Nevada and often announces news via tweets by Mr. Musk. “Everything they do, they try to do differently than the traditional auto company, but they all have to deal with the same rules,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader. Ms. Krebs said she had never heard of a car company requiring customers to sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for repairs of potential safety defects. “It does raise eyebrows,” she said. “It may have happened before. I’ve just never seen it. ” In its statement about the inquiry, the N. H. T. S. A. did not elaborate on the extent or details of Tesla’s use of nondisclosure agreements. But according to accounts posted online, some customers who complained about suspension problems had their cars fixed on the condition that they agreed in writing not to talk about the issue or how the company dealt with it. An auto industry blog, dailykanban. com, posted what it said were excerpts from the agreement, along with a scanned copy. “You agree to keep confidential our provision of the Goodwill, the terms of this agreement and the incidents or claims leading or related to our provision of the Goodwill,” the document said. “Goodwill” is the term Tesla used to refer to any repairs or compensation it made because of a suspension failure. The agreement posted on the blog released Tesla from any liability and barred the car owners from filing legal proceedings against the company.",1
25561,Sex and the Presidential City,"Email 
Why does everyone think that presidential campaigns are about “issues,” when anyone over the age of consent knows they are all about sex? But it says a lot about the lasting power of Viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventy-year-olds on the ballot. (“ For an election lasting more than four years, please call your doctor .”) 
In last week’s newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman (I have lost track) to come forward to say that Donald Trump made suggestive and “inappropriate” advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago. 
The woman in question is Jessica Drake, who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament, she was working in the “the adult industry” (that’s what People Magazine calls porn) for Wicked Pictures (the 20th Century Fox of gang banging) when the randy Donald kissed and hugged her in his room. 
Trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door, together with two friends. Normally, in the adult business, when three porn stars knock on your hotel door, it’s considered foreplay. 
When Trump’s effusive greeting of Miss Drake did not lead to more snuggling, let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television, he offered her $10,000 to satisfy his suite dreams. 
Drake again demurred, saying that the next morning she needed to get back to Los Angeles “for work.” By that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for “Extreme Doggie” and “Fornocopia.” I would mention other titles, but as they say at the New York Post , “This is a family newspaper.” 
That rejection prompted Donald to offer Jessica an early morning ride (of shame?) on his Trump airliner back to LA, which still didn’t turn the trick. * * * 
Then last week, in the presence of her lawyer, Gloria Allred (the Perry Mason of many cases against Bill Cosby) Miss Drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that Mr. Trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation, which, after all, includes the 2009 Adult Video News Award for the “Best Double Penetration Sex Scene” in her classic work, “Fallen.” 
Drake said she was coming forward now to stand in “solidarity” with the other women Trump has manhandled, although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of Drake’s new online store, where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her “Guide to BDSM for Beginners,” among other titles. 
Normally scenes such as the one I am describing would be consigned to John Oliver, Monty Python, or Saturday Night Live , but in the new normal of presidential politics, even Miss Drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues. 
For example, the next day the Huffington Post reported: “Woman Says Trump Sexually Assaulted Her, Offered Her $10,000 For Sex.” 
The deadpan New York Times wrote: “Ms. Drake, who appeared Saturday with the women’s rights lawyer Gloria Allred, said Mr. Trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission.” 
The headline in New York Magazine read: “Adult Actress Jessica Drake Details Trump Assault, Blasts Him for ‘Uncontrollable Misogyny’.” 
Look, I have no doubt that Trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women, but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the “adult” industry? * * * 
Sadly, the answer to this question dates to winter 1992 when Bill and Hillary Clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline, few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform. 
During the 1992 Super Bowl, the Clintons appeared on a halftime special of 60 Minutes to deny jointly (Bill: That allegation is false ) that he had ever had an affair with Gennifer Flowers, who lived in Little Rock, Arkansas when Bill was governor and often out jogging. 
In this vaudeville performance, Hillary played the straight man, adding: “You know, I’m not sitting here—some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.” (At least she didn’t reference The Eagles.) 
Only in 1998, under oath in a sworn deposition, did Bill admit to having a 12-year affair with Ms. Flowers. But neither her allegations in 1992, nor his lying about it, cost him the election that year. 
Just the opposite: Clinton’s wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters (no strangers to sexual boredom) who found they had more in common with a soft-shell Baptist (Bill) than an uptight Protestant (George H.W. Bush). 
Nor did Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky under oath in the Paula Jones case hurt his post-presidential career (worth $200 million +) or the electoral prospects of his wife in 2016. 
But it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue, which is one of the reasons why this year’s race seems only to be about sex. * * * 
No doubt the Clintons do find some delicious irony in Trump’s groping charges, as payback for what they view as the Republican use of sexuality to impeach Bill in 1998 and, in 2016, for the GOP plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites. (Cut to an online image of the White House and over it a fading picture of Bill smoking a cigar, with the caption “Here we go again?”) 
Without the pageant-loving, casino operating Donald Trump as the Republican nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front, with Bill’s mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that Hillary organized the slut-shaming. 
Instead of the 2016 election turning on Hillary’s marriage to Hugh Hefner’s doppelgänger, the storyline that has played best in the media is Donald’s secret life as a groper. 
The press actually has given Trump a pass for his adultery (which produced all those wonderful children) but zeroed in on his groping, in part because he confessed to it on an NBC videotape and also because—think of ratings—gropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways, crowed elevators, or near schoolyards. 
Best of all for the Clintons, politically anyway, is that the charge of groping is impossible for Trump to refute. Even denying it sounds sleazy. 
And it colors all aspects of the campaign. To wit: the New York Times headline when at Gettysburg Trump outlined his vision for America: “Donald Trump Pledges to ‘Heal Divisions’ (and Sue His Accusers).” * * * 
For its mud-slinging, I am sure the Trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar Hillary as a lesbian. But even that innuendo has fallen flat, despite the rumor mongering that she’s in a Boston marriage with her assistant Huma Abedin (whose husband, Anthony Weiner, is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms). 
Several of Bill’s former lovers (Sally Miller, Dolly Kyle, and Flowers) have tried to play up Bill’s pillow talk that Hillary prefers the nighttime company of women. But none of these allegations have gone further than Infowars or the supermarket press. (“ Hillary Hit Man Tells All !”) 
Nor have out-of-wedlock children, a staple of the 1884 campaign (as was chanted to Grover Cleveland: “ Ma, Ma, Where ’ s my pa ?”), gotten much play in this year’s presidential race. 
Trump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that Danney Williams is Bill Clinton’s illegitimate son by a Little Rock prostitute named Bobbie Ann Williams. 
Trump invited Danney (a sympathetic man) to the third presidential debate, as if to press on Bill a Scarlet Letter. Despite Williams looking very much like President Bill, the story got no more traction than did the news that Malik Obama, the president’s shunned half-brother, is supporting Trump. He, too, got a debate invitation, to sit in the box presumably marked “Shame.” 
Also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that Flowers aborted Bill’s baby in 1977 and the whispering campaign (a great political standby when proof is elusive) that Chelsea is the product of an affair between Hillary and her then law firm colleague, Webb Hubbell. 
The Williams and Hubbell stories come with some convincing Internet similarities, at least in the photographs, although in both cases politically, this rumor milling whiplashed against Trump, as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his Birther past, something that has stuck as campaign mud. * * * 
Technically, Birtherism does’t directly involve sex, although it lingers on its fringes, as it speaks to Barack Obama’s illegitimacy, his foreign allegiances, and possibly disputed paternity, including the claim that Frank Marshall Davis was actually Obama’s biological father (another subterranean creed of Trumpism). 
Again, the documentary proof is a series of look-a-like photographs, as close as the Internet gets to DNA. That Davis was an American Communist works well in the campaign, as it suggests the origins of Obama’s political genetic code. 
Ironically, for all his efforts at smear, Trump came out the loser in the debates when Hillary nailed him to Birtherism, which has become a convenient code word for Trump’s racism, misogyny, and intolerance of immigrants, especially muslims. 
Nor, in response, did Trump have any luck in linking the Birther movement to Clinton’s 2008 campaign, when, according to Donald, consigliere-journalist Sidney Blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that Barack was born in Kenya. 
Instead, the debate claim only made Trump look disingenuous. Clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in 2008. And at this point, no one cares. But voters do remember Trump as the Imperial Wizard of Birtherism. * * * 
Republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in 2016 along lines of sexual preference or deviance, although this strategy was based on Hillary being the Democratic nominee and anyone other than Trump standing for the Republicans. 
Had the GOP nominee been Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush, or John Kasich, Clinton Inc. might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity, illegitimacy, and rape. (Cue up the Paula Jones description of Bill, during a business meeting, exposing himself in a Little Rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for $850,000.) 
Instead, the Republicans went with the polyamorous Trump, who, in addition to three marriages, has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since 1996 has been leering at Miss Universe contestants—a bit like Austin Powers. ( Shall we shag now, or shall we shag later ?) 
With Trump’s resumé of creepy perversion, you might have thought that the Republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook. Instead, they doubled down to make the case that both Clintons, if elected, would turn the White House into a strip club. 
Not only did the Clintons shrug off such innuendo, but, in response, they said (in effect), if they did, it would be to cater to the likes of players such as Donald J. Trump (leisure suit and open collar optional). * * * 
For the moment—and I can’t see anything changing in the last days of the campaign—the accepted wisdom of most front pages is that Donald Trump has groped as many women as Tiger Woods has watched pole dancing in Vegas. Even the gallery of “their women” looks about the same. 
Conversely, few voters seem to care that Bill might have forced himself on several women or that Hillary helped to cover up his brutality. That’s a narrative of the 1990s, which is perhaps the last time Austin Danger Trump read the newspaper. ( I’ve been frozen for 30 years. I’ve got to see if my bits and pieces are still working .) 
For most voters in 2016, names such as Kathleen Willey or Juanita Broaddrick are as lost in time as Nan Britton, who just before the 1920 election bore a love child with then candidate Senator Warren Harding. 
Britton and the child got Republican hush money and a sad little house in Asbury Park, New Jersey. After Harding won, she was invited to the White House but their affair, so to speak, was kept in the closet. * * * 
If you think about elections as political sitcoms, in 1960 the Kennedys had to run as Rob and Laura Petrie on The Dick Van Dyke Show , complete with twin beds, long flannel pajamas, and prudent kisses on the cheek to say good-night, even if The JFK Reality Show would make Trump, Bill Clinton, and Tiger look like apprentices at adultery. 
Come 2016, only something that resembles Modern Family and a desperate-housewives reality show can crack network primetime, and who better to put on air than The Clintons, with their Dallas -like money, communal sexuality, and more illicit storylines than CSI . 
For more than twenty years, Bill and Hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust, affairs, “I-did-not-have-sex-with-that-woman”, Vince Foster, Travelgate, foundation slush funds, basement servers, commodity trading, Whitewater, Bosnian snipers, pay-to-play, Benghazi, lost e-mails, and the like, and the ratings only continue to go up. 
Sure, The Apprentice was fun for a few episodes, but the sameness of insulting young people grew tedious. How is that supposed to compete with Bill making a pass at Huma, while her husband goes to prison for airing his junk, and Chelsea finding out about her real father. Next on The Clintons ?",1
25562,Self-Proclaimed Truth Czars Create Lists of ‘Fake News’ Sites to Control Your Mind,"Waking Times 
One of the greatest takeaways of election 2016 is that mainstream, corporate news no longer cares about maintaining the appearance of objectivity, and that the internet has made it possible to counter the top-down state driven narrative with genuine, alternative journalism. This of course challenges the king-making abilities of the corporate media who were shocked when their preferred candidate lost. 
“Hillary Clinton was the choice of nearly every American newspaper editorial board. It didn’t matter.” ~ The Los Angeles Times 
Just a week after the election, Google, Facebook, Twitter and other internet giants are now declaring a war on so-called fake news sites , trumpeting the idea that unregulated information is confusing and misleading the public and interfering with our ability to make sound decisions. 
The sub-text here is that the public can not be trusted, and therefore information in the public domain must be controlled and regulated. But by whom, exactly? 
Already several lists of websites are being widely circulated around the internet and heralded as go-to places to instantly determine the credibility of an internet publisher. There are a number of alarming problems with this, especially for a nation that supposedly values freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Several of these lists taxonomize websites under multiple categories, which are only tangentially related, yet grouped under the all encompassing banner of ‘fake’ news. 
But, what is the difference, for instance, between fake news and misleading news? And, is there a material difference between misleading news and ‘clickbaity’ news, or is it just about wording of the article title? Also, what is the difference between a fake news site and a hoax site? And, where does editorial news fit into this spectrum, and if the term propaganda is being used, does it now apply to editorializing in general? 
The most important concern, though, is who decides what fake news is? The Zimdars Hit List 
The most widely circulated list right now was created and is maintained by Melissa ‘Mish’ Zimdars , a professor and researcher at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts. 
“Bio: I am an assistant professor of communication & media, and this list started as a resource for my students, who are learning about journalism/social media/media literacy.” ~ Melissa Zimdars 
The Zimdars list of news site you should avoid is located here . It breaks down some 100+ websites with different ratings under the broad introductory headline, “ False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and/or Satirical “News” Sources.” There are zero examples given for any of these sites explaining why they fall under the heading of fake news, or why their content is to be considered questionable, just a link to their homepage. In other words, these sites are fake news sites because Melissa Zimdars says they are. 
When I first saw this list, I was actually not surprised to find that my site, www.WakingTimes.com , was on this list, given our easy to spot anti-status quo perspectives, although it was intriguing to me that my site was misnamed Walking Times, which I took as a sign of the author’s carelessness in creating this list. 
Waking Times has a five-year history as an internet blog and content publisher, with almost 7000 original, guest authored and aggregated articles which express the personal interests, biases and world views of the editor, myself, Dylan Charles . This is perfectly legal and acceptable in a free society. I contacted Ms. Zimdars and demanded that she remove our site from the list, and although I have not heard back from her personally, to her credit, our site was removed from the list within half an hour of my email. 
For background on her biases, Ms. Zimdars has publicly responded to the question of what news sites trusts and visits: 
“Some people are asking which news sources I trust, and all I can say is that I read/watch/listen very widely, from mainstream, corporate owned sources ( The New York Times , The Washington Post, The Boston Globe , The Wall Street Journal , Forbes ) as well as The Atlantic, National Public Radio, and various local and alternative sources with different political perspectives, some of which are included on this list.” ~Melissa Zimdars 
Without question, many of these mainstream sites are guilty of publishing false, biased, clickbaity, and propagandistic news, especially so in this election season, so it is clear that an agenda is in play here. The U.S. News Hit List 
This list, published by U.S. News & World Report by Rachel Dicker , Associate Editor of Social Media, only features 16 websites, out of thousands, defaming other people’s work without proof, citation or even examples. 
Titled, Avoid These Fake News Sites at All Costs , the Dicker list, which includes the well-known satirical site, The Onion , offers three categories, satire, hoax, and propaganda, all lumped under the banner of fake news. Serious anti-establishment blogs like Activist Post are grouped along satire and hoax as propaganda. 
Who decides which propaganda is allowable? 
Rachel Dicker has published a number of articles for U.S. News, which can be seen on her author page, here . A quick scan of her work reveals an overt bias towards liberalism, against Donald Trump, for social justice issues, and towards leftist political causes. In other words, Rachel Dicker herself has a bias and an agenda, and is a propagandist. The Growing List of Other Hit Lists 
Now that it’s all the rage to castigate supposedly fake news in frenzy of coming official censorship, the list of lists is growing, and propagandists have now been given franchise to defame others. Ed Brayton has a list, here . Inquisitr has its elaborated list, here . Snopes, the self-proclaimed oracle of internet truth has published its warning, here . The Independent has posted their version of the Zimdars list, here . 
Pardon the pun, but the list goes on and on. Real Issues – Censorship and Personal Responsibility 
What’s really happening here is a portal towards total internet censorship is being opened and exploited by the establishment. 
The internet has in recent years been flooded with bogus news sites, and it has long been my suspicion that this phenomenon would lead to exactly the scenario we see unfolding right now. The public would clamor for a crackdown on so-called fake news, and in the wake, real, truthful, and critical alternative journalists will be forced out of business and off the internet by an authoritarian corporate government. 
Another real issue at play here, though, is the concept of personal responsibility on the part of both publishers and internet users. There is inarguably some gray area when looking at how the internet will evolve, as there are no doubt players who will publish anything just to make money, but does that mean that individuals shouldn’t be trusted with making up their own minds? 
The following message from activist John Vibes does well to sum up the conflux of these two issues in the following statement: 
“The internet and the alternative media has given us freedom of information. One drawback to this is that people did not seem to get the memo that responsibility is somewhat of a prerequisite for true freedom. 
In previous eras, the mainstream media spoon-fed people information, and whether it was true or not, everyone accepted it at face value because they didn’t have much of an ability to fact check even if they wanted to. 
Now we have a sea of information thanks to the intern et and the alt-media. Just like the mainstream media in the past, some of this information is factual, while some of it is not. With the mainstream media though, since they only gave you one narrative instead of a sea of information to sift through, it was easy for someone to make up their mind about things. 
Now with all this freedom of information, people really need to do their due diligence and actually research the information they come across, instead of letting a media organization spoon feed them a particular point of view, this goes for both alternative and mainstream media. 
I say this in light of the fact that multiple sites that i write for have been targeted as “fake news sites” because we present a viewpoint that is alternative to the mainstream. We are being lumped in with bullshit clickbait sites and i think that is all a part of the plan that the mainstream has to reassert their legitimacy. 
We work very hard to fact check our info, and always make corrections when necessary, however, people need to realize they are in a new era of media, one that requires research and personal responsibility.” Final Thoughts 
The changing face of news and information with the advent of the internet and user friendly content management systems means that anyone can share their ideas with people who are willing to look at them. And people naturally have opinions about politics and life, meaning that we are all propagandists when we publish on the internet. 
As the corporate and political establishment look for more ways to control the debate and control public opinion, we will see the rise of self-appointed truth czars and the rise of an official ministry of truth. Unless you do something about it.   Dylan Charles . About the Author

25564,Let It Go Go Go! Three Stage Versions of ‘Frozen’ Are on the Way - The New York Times,"In 1957, Walt Disney laid out what was then an astonishing plan for an entertainment ecosystem: Animated movies would fuel theme park attractions, which in turn would power merchandise sales, which would create interest in more movies. Today, with “Frozen,” the plan has evolved further. When the movie became a blockbuster in 2013, taking in $1. 3 billion globally, Disney got busy: It rushed out merchandise, sent Princesses Anna and Elsa on an   tour and started work on an Arendelle boat ride at Epcot and three stage musicals. Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, told a Wall Street conference last month that he had recently seen a “Frozen” show bound for Disney California Adventure. He noted that “Frozen” would be part of the parade at the new Shanghai Disneyland. And, he said, “I sat on Friday here in New York in a   of the ‘Frozen’ musical that we’re starting to develop for Broadway. ” It’s an increasingly familiar approach: Both “Beauty and the Beast” and “Aladdin” had theme park shows before New York productions. (Broadway veterans helped create them all.) Keeping all the efforts untangled can be challenging. Is the theme park show a miniversion of the Broadway one? What about the Disney Cruise Line production? Here’s what we know about the   versions of “Frozen” underway: DIRECTOR Liesl Tommy. Raised in South Africa, she tends to pursue   projects about civil and political rights. Ms. Tommy is a Tony nominee for her direction of “Eclipsed,” a searing play, starring Lupita Nyong’o, about captive women in Liberia. Her musical credits include “Party People,” a regional show about the Black Panther movement. OTHER TEAM MEMBERS “Frozen  —   Live at the Hyperion,” as the   theater here is named, uses the film’s score, but some songs initially written as solos (“In Summer”) were rearranged by Jason Michael Webb (“The Color Purple”) to become ensemble numbers. Chad Beguelin, the   author of the book for Disney’s “Aladdin” on Broadway, adapted the “Frozen” book from the film’s screenplay. Video elements, and there are a ton of them, were handled by Aaron Rhyne (“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love  Murder”). STATUS It began an   run on May 27 and has up to five performances daily. The Hyperion was home to “Aladdin  —   A Musical Spectacular,” which ran for 13 years. CAST More than 100 actors, dancers and puppeteers are involved (about 3, 500 auditioned) but Disney declined to identify any by name. With so many daily performances, a spokesman explained, numerous performers share the lead roles. (Disney also, ahem, takes the suspension of disbelief to an extreme at its theme parks: As an usher told a child before a recent performance, Anna and Elsa are real and played by themselves.) RUNNING TIME 55 minutes AUDIENCE The    masses. Everyone from babies to older adults took in a recent performance, with a handful of people in prime seats holding up their phones to videotape the opening number. “There’s going to be a lot of people who have never seen theater before,” Ms. Tommy said in an interview. COST TO ATTEND Ostensibly free. But the Hyperion is inside Disney California Adventure, one of two theme parks that make up the Disneyland Resort. Admission to California Adventure is $95 to $119, depending on the day. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE FILM “It’s 10 times better than the movie,” a Disney usher named Yvonne (from Lakewood, Calif. according to her name badge) told guests as they waited in line for nearly an hour for a recent performance. Some film fans may disagree. Some songs are abbreviated and ancillary scenes and characters are cut. There is no Marshmallow (the ice monster) for instance, and Anna does not wander into Wandering Oaken’s Trading Post and Sauna. How it differs from other ‘Frozen’ adaptations A lot more bells and whistles. “People are coming in here full of adrenaline, they’ve been on rides,” Ms. Tommy said. “How do I top that?” There’s a lavish    video wall, a sequence in which Sven the reindeer literally flies, and lots of fake fog. ‘Let It Go’ Moment Hold on tight: Elsa belts it out while standing atop a towering set of crystal stairs that rotates out over the audience. DIRECTOR Alex Timbers. An unconventionally witty theater director known for his steampunk aesthetic, he has twice been nominated for Tony Awards, for directing Disney’s “Peter and the Starcatcher” and for writing the book for “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson. ” OTHER TEAM MEMBERS Music and lyrics by Kristen   and Robert Lopez, who wrote the film’s score, and a book by Jennifer Lee, who wrote the screenplay and directed the film. The set design is by Bob Crowley, who has won multiple Tony Awards, including for Disney’s “Aida” and “Mary Poppins. ” STATUS A developmental lab (two weeks in which actors, accompanied by keyboards and drums, read and sang, using scripts on music stands, before an invited audience that at one point included Mr. Iger) was held in New York last month. A   run is planned at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts in August 2017, and Disney said that it planned to move the show to Broadway in the spring of 2018. CAST At the developmental lab, Betsy Wolfe (“Bullets Over Broadway”) played Elsa, Patti Murin (“Lysistrata Jones”) was Anna, Okieriete Onaodowan (“Hamilton”) was Kristoff and Greg Hildreth (“Cinderella”) was Olaf. Although actors often remain with productions from the developmental process through full productions, Disney has not committed to casting for the Denver production that cast would likely continue on to Broadway. RUNNING TIME Two full acts, presumably running two to two and a half hours. AUDIENCE The Broadway audience is older than that at the theme parks most ticketbuyers are women. Disney’s shows attract more families with children than do some more   Broadway shows, but the company says its shows also draw many adults without children. COST TO ATTEND Prices have not been set, but   tickets to “The Lion King” on Broadway are $99 to $199, with premium seats for up to $225. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM FILM Live actors, obviously. An expanded story and an expanded song list  —   there are eight (and a reprise) in the film, and this production will probably have at least twice that. Among the new songs is “True Love,” an Act II ballad sung by Anna after Hans, a scheming prince, betrays her and locks her in a palace room. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM OTHER ‘FROZEN’ ADAPTATIONS The Broadway version is the only one with new songs and new book material. It will be the most fully realized and ambitious theatrical production. ‘LET IT GO’ MOMENT The song, thanks to its soaring sound and stratospheric popularity, is now the first act’s closing number. DIRECTOR Sheryl Kaller, whose Broadway credits include “Mothers and Sons,” in 2014, and “Next Fall,” which earned her a Tony nomination in 2010. OTHER TEAM MEMBERS Disney has not publicly confirmed this production, but casting notices this year said that Josh Prince, whose Broadway dance résumé includes “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” and the   “Shrek the Musical,” would be the choreographer. STATUS Still in the early stages. There has been at least one   but this musical is planned for the   cruise ship Wonder, which is headed to dry dock this year for refurbishment. CAST With limited living quarters for performers, Disney’s ships often look for people who can simultaneously play a range of characters. But the casting notice for this effort included some specific requirements. For the role of Kristoff, for instance, Disney advertised for a baritone who stands six feet tall or more and can play a “rugged   type, a little rough around the edges, yet endearingly awkward. ” RUNNING TIME The show that will likely be replaced, “Toy Story  —   The Musical,” runs about an hour in the Wonder’s   theater. (Or “glitzy   theater palace at sea,” if you’re going by the Disney Cruise Line website.) AUDIENCE Disneyphiles. While intended to appeal to a wide range of travelers, guests tend to be well acquainted with Disney’s singular style of entertainment, and that means any efforts to cut corners are noticed. COST TO ATTEND Included with the price of passage, which starts at $507 a person (plus port fees and taxes) for a     Bahamian cruise. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM FILM Like the theme park version, this will be about presenting what’s in the movie  —   in   fashion  —   for already captive crowds. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM OTHER ‘FROZEN’ ADAPTATIONS Disney Cruise Line, which mounts its stage productions without much interaction with its corporate siblings, bills its musicals as “ . ” Marketing pitches aside, this show will almost certainly be the least extravagant. ‘LET IT GO’ MOMENT You can bet that the climactic scene will include fake snow. Choose your seat wisely.",1
25567,Dilma Rousseff Is Ousted as Brazil’s President in Impeachment Vote - The New York Times,"BRASÍLIA  —   The Senate on Wednesday impeached Dilma Rousseff, Brazil’s first female president, and removed her from office for the rest of her term, the capstone of a power struggle that has consumed the nation for months and toppled one of the hemisphere’s most powerful political parties. The Senate voted 61 to 20 to convict Ms. Rousseff on charges of manipulating the federal budget in an effort to conceal the nation’s mounting economic problems. But the final removal of Ms. Rousseff, who was suspended in May to face trial, was much more than a judgment of guilt on any charge. It was a verdict on her leadership and the slipping fortunes of Latin America’s largest country. The impeachment puts a definitive end to 13 years  of governing by the leftist Workers’ Party, an era during which Brazil’s economy boomed, lifting millions into the middle class and raising the country’s profile on the global stage. But sweeping corruption scandals, the worst economic crisis in decades and the government’s   responses to the souring national mood opened Ms. Rousseff to withering scorn, leaving her with little support to fend off a power grab by her political rivals. “She lacked it all,” said Mentor Muniz Neto, a writer from São Paulo who described Ms. Rousseff’s final ouster as a “death foretold,” asserting that she lacked charisma, competence and humility. “We deserved better. ” To her many critics, the impeachment was a fitting fall for an arrogant leader at the helm of a political movement that had lost its way. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters call her ouster a coup that undermines Brazil’s young democracy. Moreover, her impeachment may not restore public confidence in Brazil’s leaders, or diminish the corruption that pervades the country’s politics. To the contrary, many Brazilians note, it transfers power from one   party to another. Michel Temer, 75, the interim president who served as Ms. Rousseff’s vice president before breaking with her this year, is now expected to remain in office until the end of the current term in 2018. But Mr. Temer’s centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which anchored the Workers’ Party’s governing coalition for more than a decade, was also deeply enmeshed in the colossal graft schemes staining Brazil’s political system in recent years. It arguably benefited as much as the Workers’ Party from huge bribes and illicit campaign financing. Since becoming interim president in May, Mr. Temer has had approval ratings nearly as dismal as Ms. Rousseff’s. Shifting the government to the right, he named a cabinet without any female or   ministers, outraging many in a country where nearly 51 percent of people define themselves as black or mixed race, according to the 2010 census. Several of the men named by Mr. Temer have already resigned under the cloud of scandal, including his anticorruption minister and his planning minister, amid claims that they were trying to stymie investigations into the bribery scandals engulfing the national oil company, Petrobras. Mr. Temer was recently found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years. Beyond that, a construction executive has testified that Mr. Temer was the beneficiary of a $300, 000 bribe, an assertion Mr. Temer disputes. The impeachment effort has divided the nation and stirred passions on both sides. Of the four Brazilian presidents elected since Brazil’s democracy was   in the 1980s, Ms. Rousseff is the second to be forced from office through the impeachment process. In 1992, Fernando Collor de Mello resigned before the Senate could convict him on corruption charges. (Under Brazilian law, a president is not impeached until he or she is convicted by the Senate, legal scholars say.) “It’s painfully obvious that Temer is a slap in the face to Brazilian democracy,” said Creuza Maria Oliveira, the president of the National Federation of Domestic Workers, which represents millions of maids who benefited from the strengthening of labor laws by Ms. Rousseff. “Dilma is a champion of the poor,” said Ms. Oliveira, who was among the supporters of Ms. Rousseff who accompanied her to the Senate this week. “Temer is a champion of his own political class, which he wants to shield from justice. ” Some prominent business and political figures in Brazil counter that Mr. Temer, a former speaker in the lower house, has the political skills needed to muster support in a fractious, discredited Congress for ambitious measures aimed at increasing investment in the economy and easing a major pension crisis. Mr. Temer’s administration has “all the conditions needed to embark on a new route,” Philipp Schiemer, the head of  ’s operations in Brazil, told reporters in recent days. “We need to decide if we want a Brazil like Venezuela or a Brazil inserted in the new world. ” Still others, including Ms. Rousseff, contend that the ease with which the political elite shunted aside the president will bring more divisiveness and political tumult in Brazil. “This is serious because other presidents of the republic will have to deal with this,” Ms. Rousseff said this week in her testimony in the Senate, comparing her ouster to the coups toppling Brazilian leaders throughout much of the 20th century. “If that isn’t political instability, then I don’t know what is. ” Unlike many of the politicians who led the charge to oust her, Ms. Rousseff, 68, remains a rare breed in Brazil: a prominent leader who has not been accused of illegally enriching herself. Instead, her trial revolved around a contentious legal question of whether she committed an impeachable offense by employing budgetary tricks to conceal yawning deficits. Ms. Rousseff repeatedly insisted that she did nothing illegal, pointing out that her predecessors also manipulated the federal budget. But her opponents argued that the scale of her administration’s transfers of funds between giant public banks, to the tune of about $11 billion, seriously eroded Brazil’s economic credibility and helped her get   unfairly in 2014. Ms. Rousseff will not go to jail after her conviction, but she expressed defiance throughout her trial, insisting that Brazil’s economic crisis was largely the result of shifts in the global economy that cut commodities prices. A bureaucrat who specialized in overseeing giant public companies in Brazil’s energy industry, Ms. Rousseff had not held elected office until her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, anointed her as his heir after other leaders in the Workers’ Party were tarnished by a   scandal. As a divorced grandmother known as an avid reader of literature, she was an exception in the   political scene. In addition to serving as Mr. da Silva’s   chief of staff, she was known for her involvement with the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard, an urban guerrilla group, in her youth. Agents of the military dictatorship captured Ms. Rousseff and tortured her repeatedly in the early 1970s. But the qualities that made her a compelling chief of staff did not carry over when she became president. Her autocratic persona and short temper became legendary in Brasília, a capital where   deals are customary when forging and nurturing alliances with an array of bickering parties. Many voters also felt betrayed after Ms. Rousseff’s   campaign, when she narrowly won on promises to maintain extensive state control over the economy, resulting in generous public spending. But once   she went in another direction, appointing a finance minister who tried to win approval for   policies. “She simply lied through her teeth to get   forming a wave of national indignation,” said Antonio Risério, a historian and cultural commentator. “Upon perceiving that they voted for one person and elected another, the majority of the population started to want her head. ” With Ms. Rousseff deposed, the Workers’ Party, a dominant force in Brazilian politics for much of the past decade and a half, is now scrambling to find its way in a political landscape where conservative voices are growing more powerful. João Santana, the party’s campaign strategist who helped Ms. Rousseff win two presidential elections, faces charges of illegally receiving millions of dollars in offshore accounts from the bribery scheme involving the national oil company. Even more damaging for the party, federal investigators are seeking graft charges against Mr. da Silva, the former labor leader universally known as Lula, who was president from 2003 to 2010. The move adds to mounting legal problems faced by Mr. da Silva, who is still signaling that he plans to run for president in 2018. Ms. Rousseff found herself increasingly isolated in recent months, with many in her party quietly withdrawing their support. But senators offered her a morsel of consolation by voting to allow her to run for public office, overruling an effort to make her ineligible from doing so for several years. And some in Ms. Rousseff’s party defended her as she made her   effort before the Senate this week. “You veered from the narrative when you were elected president of the republic as a woman, from the left, a former militant against the dictatorship, without a husband to pose by your side in the photographs,” said Regina Sousa, a Workers’ Party senator from Piauí in northeast Brazil. “You never fit in the cute little dress designed by the conservative elite of this country,” Ms. Sousa added. Heated tempers marked the trial in the Senate. Crying as she spoke, Janaína Paschoal, the law professor who was an author of the impeachment request, said she had been inspired by God and that she was seeking impeachment for the good of Ms. Rousseff’s grandchildren. Ms. Rousseff’s lawyer, José Eduardo Cardozo, said he was stunned that her opponents had dragged Ms. Rousseff’s family into the acerbic debate, pointing out that Ms. Rousseff was never accused of embezzling public funds to benefit her family. “If you want to condemn her, go ahead, but don’t mock the honor of a dignified woman,” said Mr. Cardozo, also crying as he spoke.",1

25574,Beating of Disabled Teenager Highlights a Crime That Often Goes Unpunished - The New York Times,"CHICAGO  —   The appalling video seized the nation’s attention this week: A group of young people kidnapped, bound, beat, slashed, gagged, humiliated and threatened to kill a teenager with mental disabilities over nearly three days, and laughed about it as they carried out their acts. But by far, the most unusual thing about the episode, advocates for people with disabilities have said, was not the abuse itself, but the fact that it was recorded. Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize, advocates have said, and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously. The victim in the attack here, an    white man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday. The four accused attackers, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are black. The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail. The defendants are accused of multiple felonies, including hate crimes. Prosecutors said the victim, who was found by the police on Tuesday, was targeted based on his race and his disability. During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants, another can be heard denouncing white people, and, at one point, a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic. “I’m wondering as I’m hearing this, ‘Where was the sense of decency?’ ” Judge Kuriakos Ciesil asked. In explaining her denial of bail, she added, “How do you put someone out there who has allegedly committed such horrible offenses against a person?” People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities, according to a Justice Department report based on Census Bureau surveys. And people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized. But some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater, saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement. They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously. “There are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don’t know about it,” said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. “In a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?” Advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude, conscious or not, that people with disabilities are not fully human. They pointed to a recent case in Idaho, where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager, who was black and had mental disabilities, after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months. Though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault, he was sentenced to probation rather than prison. “We have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,” said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. “What we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, ‘Oh, this case is hard, it’s not worth our trouble. This person is hard to understand, or they’re not credible, or they won’t stand up to  . ’” Mr. Decker said that when Congress spent years drafting, debating, and finally voting on hate crimes legislation, which passed in 2009, it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities, as well as bias based on categories like race or sex.   of the 50 states have hate crimes laws, according to the   League, but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group. Vilissa Thompson, an organizer of the Harriet Tubman Collective, a coalition of advocates for disabled black people, said, “People are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people, but what’s worse is that there’s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator, especially when it’s a parent or caregiver. ”",1
25575,The 'Elite' Families Behind Hitler & Nazism — The Nazi War Machine Was Actually An American Business,"Stopping the shipment of these supplies to Germany would have ended the Nazi war.

Nazism was the first time in human history that the rich had enough wealth to hire an entire country to do their dirty work. 


Have you ever wondered who exactly are these rich men that thrive by destroying entire nations only to rebuild them later on — whilst reaping $Trillions in the process?

The most powerful of these infamous families is the Rothschild banking clan, who has been financing both sides of every war since the time of Napoleon.

The following quote, even though it has been attributed to a fictitious character, it is very accurate:

“I told you once before that there were two times for making big money: one in the up-building of a country and the other in its destruction. Slow money on the up-building, fast money in the crack-up. Remember my words. Perhaps they may be of use to you some day. (Rhett Butler)” ― Margaret Mitchell, Gone with the Wind 

To my readers, it will surely come as no surprise to find out that Hitler was, in fact, a Rothschild

Adolf Hitler’s father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber and Baron Rothschild. Maria Anna was working as a maid in Baron Rothschild’s mansion when she became pregnant and was sent back to her village for confinement.

A correspondent who has extensively researched this subject writes:

“It appears to me that Hitler knew about his connection long before his Chancellorship. Like his father before him, when the going got rough, the Hitlers went to Vienna. Hitler’s father left his home village at an early age to seek his fortune in Vienna. When Hitler was orphaned, after his mother died in December of 1907, he left for Vienna not long after the funeral.

“There he seemed to drop out of sight for ten months! What happened during this ten-month stay in Vienna is a complete mystery on which history sheds no light. It makes sense, now that it has become established that Hitler was a Rothschild, that he and his cousins were getting acquainted, and his potential for future family endeavors was being sized up.”

The Rothschilds and the Illuminati produce many offspring out of wedlock in their secret breeding programs and these children are brought up under other names with other parents.

Hitler was financed by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which are both owned/ controlled by the Rothschilds, which is further evidence that they have been the greatest force behind the second world war. 

It makes me sick to even think about the rivers of blood spilled by their hidden conspiracies and the amount of pain, sufferance and destruction caused to the world.


Also, George Bush’s grandfather, the late US senator Prescott Bush, was a director and shareholder of companies that profited immensely from their involvement with the financial backers of Nazi Germany.

Adolf Hitler and Prescott Bush 
Basically, the Bushes have contributed to the rise of Hitler and made a fortune in the process.


The Powers That Be (TPTB) take good care of their own 

From 1945 to 1945, Operation Paperclip granted American citizenship to nearly 1,000 Nazis. Once “bleached” of their Nazism, they ended up working in the US military industrial complex, and have worked for the CIA, NASA, etc..

One of the Nazi experiments that continued in America was mind control. The subject were mostly children and mind control was achieved through torture. The secret project received the name MKUltra.

In his book, The Nazis Next Door , investigative reporter Eric Lichtblau reports that thousands of Nazis managed to settle in the USA after World War II, often with the direct assistance of American intelligence officials.

And what about Adolf Hitler? 

The FBI has quietly declassified secret files attesting that Hitler fled to Argentina in 1945 and they knew all about it.

Also, there are separate reports from people who met him in Argentina just months after war.

One of these contacts has even told the FBI the exact location where Hitler and his wife, Eva Brown, were hiding : a lakeside mansion in Patagonia, Argentina. (This remote mountainous paradise was full of top Nazi refugees).

But Hitler and his entourage were offered a safe heaven by TPTB and they were not to be bothered for the rest of their lives.

25577,Scientists Find A Plant That Could Treat Diabetes & Kill Cancer Cells,"  More recently, bitter melon juice was shown to kill pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice in a study done by the University of Colorado. Considering the results were seen in both in vitro and in vivo tests, the effectiveness of bitter melon juice in treating pancreatic cancer, and potentially other cancers, at a clinical level are promising.[ 1 ] “IHC analyses of MiaPaCa-2 xenografts showed that BMJ(Bitter Melon Juice) also inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and activates AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) in vivo . Overall, BMJ exerts strong anticancer efficacy against human pancreatic carcinoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo , suggesting its clinical usefulness.” Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat due to the fact that it is often discovered late, leaving very little time to treat. Since traditional therapies (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery etc) were not showing promising results and littler advancement was being made, researchers have been looking elsewhere to find treatment. Interestingly, cannabis, specifically cannabinoids, have been shown to induce apoptic (programmed) death of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and stop pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.[ 4 ] Cannabis is perhaps one of the most popular treatments being aggressively pursued right now given its promising results both in labs and anecdotally. Scientific Evidence   Many cancerous tumors have insulin receptors which move glucose to cancer cells helping them to grow and divide. Studies have shown that insulin encourages pancreatic cancer cells to grow in a dose dependant manner, since bitter melon has been shown to help regulate insulin levels, this could help prevent pancreatic cancer over the long-term. The Colorado University study was led by Dr. Rajesh Agarwal. They examined effects of bitter melon on 4 different lines of pancreatic cancer cells (in vitro) and in mice. For the in vivo studies, mice were injected with pancreatic tumor cells and were randomly divided into one of two groups. One group of mice received water, which was the control group, and the other group was given bitter melon juice for six weeks. [6] Researchers studied the tumors at the end of the study and results showed that bitter melon juice not only inhibited cancer cell proliferation but also induced apoptosis (programmed cell death). Compared to the control, tumor growth was inhibited by 60% in the treatment group and there were no signs of toxicity or negative effects on the body. With toxicity and negative effects being a huge role in traditional mainstream treatments, this was positive to see. Diabetes A number of clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of bitter melon for treating diabetes. Since it is believed that diabetes is a precursor for pancreatic cancer, researchers felt bitter melon could treat diabetes as well after seeing pancreatic cancer results. In 2011, results of a four week long clinical trial were published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology that showed modest hypoglycemic effects and significant fructosamine management for those taking 2000mg/day of bitter melon. As published by the study: “Bitter melon had a modest hypoglycemic effect and significantly reduced fructosamine levels from baseline among patients with type 2 diabetes who received 2,000 mg/day. However, the hypoglycemic effect of bitter melon was less than metformin 1,000 mg/day.”[ 3 ] Another study published in 2008 in the international journal Chemistry and Biology indicated that compounds in bitter melon improved glycemic control, helped cells uptake glucose and improved overall glucose tolerance. This study was done in mice and led to promising advancements in treating diabetes and obesity with bitter melon.[ 4 ] In contrast, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 2007 did not show significant benefit of the treatment of diabetes by bitter melon but 2 years later in the British Journal of Nutrition it was stated that “more, better-designed and clinical trials are required to confirm the fruit’s role in diabetes treatment.” Since that 2007 study, more studies have been done to show beneficial effects which perhaps was a result of better design. Conclusion When it comes to bitter melon juice, the current research available is showing strong results for specific types of cancer cell destruction, diabetes treatment and potential prevention of pancreatic cancer. Further research and clinical trials would be helpful to better understand how effective this plant can be and in what specific cases. It remains a very promising option that could be explored under the correct supervision. Other Uses of Bitter Melon Bitter melon has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time. It has been used to treat: colic, fever, burns, chronic cough, painful menstruation and skin conditions.[ 5 ]

25578,"While Young Britons Favor Staying in E.U., They Aren’t Big on Voting - The New York Times","LONDON  —   On June 23, tens of thousands of young Britons will be gathered at the Glastonbury music festival, whose headliners include Coldplay, Muse and Adele. Others will be avidly following the European Soccer Championship in France or biting their nails in anticipation of the next episode of hit teenage soap “Hollyoaks. ” Oh, and there is the referendum that day asking them whether Britain should leave the European Union. “Wait, are we even registered to vote?” Priya Patel, 25, asked her friend recently, as they waited outside a theater in east London to see their favorite stars arrive at the British Soap Awards. Would she want Britain to stay in the European Union? “Oh, definitely,” Ms. Patel, a medical practitioner, answered impatiently, switching her attention to her smartphone, visibly more interested in televised dramas than in the   tensions between her country and Brussels. “Wait, what just happened?” she exclaimed as a “Hollyoaks” star rolled by in a car. Holding the attention of young voters  —   and getting them to turn out on June 23  —   is one of the biggest challenges for both sides in the campaign over Britain’s place in Europe, especially for the advocates of remaining in the European Union. Polling suggests that younger people are more favorable to continued British membership in the bloc than are older voters, and in a close race could decide the outcome. The problem for the   forces is that young people are historically less likely to vote. In this case, some analysts say, it could be particularly hard to motivate them, not just because many of them will be immersed in summer activities, but also because they are being asked to embrace the status quo rather than to take up an idealistic cause of change of the type that typically energizes young people. “It’s hard to get them passionate about remaining,” said Scott Townsin, 26, who recently directed a campaign video urging young people to vote in favor of staying in the European Union. Older voters tend to decide based on information they get from traditional media. But with young people, Mr. Townsin said, “you’ve got to be loud, you’ve got to compete with brands, favorite friends, Instagram, whatever, to get their attention. ” Zak Reynolds, 20, from London, said he had yet to make up his mind. One of his parents will vote to stay in, the other to leave. “There’s a lot of propaganda stuff,” he said. Sam Hemphill, 24, an engineering student from Swindon in southwest England, said he had not made up his mind but was leaning toward Britain’s remaining. Part of his uncertainty, he said, was driven by the perception that the campaigns “are both lying. ” “All the facts and figures feel manipulated, which makes the decision hard,” he said. “They are both polar opposites appealing on emotions rather than facts. ” The In campaign used targeted Facebook ads to imply (falsely) that a British exit, or Brexit, could stop British soccer clubs from signing European players. (“If we leave the E. U. how will Tottenham be affected?” one ad asked.) The Out campaign lent its support to a pop concert in Birmingham, only to have three acts pull out because they did not agree with its   position. The voter registration deadline was Thursday, prompting ambitious drives by both sides to sign up supporters. Groups like Bite the Ballot, an organization that tries to encourage youths to vote, teamed up with Starbucks, which favors Britain’s remaining in the European Union, to hold registration drives in coffee shops across the country. Uber, which has not taken a position on the referendum, flashed ads on customers’ smartphones reminding them to register. Some surveys indicate that half of those between ages 18 and 30 want to remain in Europe, with the proportion higher among those under 25. Young Britons are generally comfortable with a multicultural society, surveys have found, and they value the opportunity to work and travel in 28 European nations without a visa. A survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of those 18 to 34 years old in Britain had a favorable view of the European Union, compared with 38 percent of people 50 and over. The 180, 000 or so people attending the   festival in Glastonbury will have to vote by mail  —   a relatively tedious process  —   or apply to have someone else vote on their behalf. (There will be no polling booths on the festival grounds, 900 acres of farmland in Somerset, since people have to vote where they are registered.) The same voting rules apply to the 300, 000 to 500, 000 British fans, many of them under 30, who the police expect will travel to France for the monthlong European Soccer Championship. Some of the efforts to get young people to vote are paying off. Since March 1, more than a million people have registered to vote, with big gains among those 18 to 34 years old, according to figures published recently by the government. Ashleigh Breedy, a    florist in favor of Brexit, said the referendum was so important that she would vote for the very first time. “All that money we’re sending to Belgium and them telling us what to do,” she said, referring to Brussels, where the European Commission is based. “Our queen doesn’t have a say,” she said. “Is Belgium going to tell our queen what to do?” she asked, puffing on a cigarette and drinking a can of Red Bull. “If enough of us stand up to leave, we’ll leave. ” Brexit campaigners are calling for more controls on immigration and greater national sovereignty the option of remaining is appealing to voters because of the economic benefits. Charlie Carline, 31, a British exit supporter who will be in France on referendum day, said he had made sure to vote by mail. It is “very important,” he wrote in a message on Facebook. “I want out of the European Union dictatorship. Look at the state of Europe because of these   scum leaders. ” By contrast, some of the young people supporting Britain’s continued membership in the European Union are less passionate. For them, the monthslong campaign often felt more like   Conservative politicians arguing over a dining bill. “It’s hard not to get bored by it,” said Josh Glancy, 29, who plans to go to Glastonbury and who applied for a postal vote only because a friend had insisted. “It’s a kind of spat among the Tory party, so I’ve become quite fed up with it. ” Still, he said he planned to vote to stay in Europe because he liked “the idea of a Europe that can cooperate” over issues including the migrant crisis. Vahan Salorian, 23, who juggles work as a composer, primary school music teacher and pub supervisor, said he would vote for Britain to remain in Europe. “I’ve been watching with mild terror” the possibility of a British exit, he said, wearing a   decorated with avocados and sipping beer with friends in a park in east London. “I’m terrified it might happen. ” Mr. Salorian, who is from the rural town of Barnoldswick in northern England, said living in a cosmopolitan city like London shaped his views. Friends in Barnoldswick, he said, were planning to vote out even though the area has had very little immigration. Back in east London at the British Soap Awards, Jennifer Burnett, 33, said she was registered to vote, but was unsure about her intentions. She had more definite views about the soaps. “I know exactly who I’m going to vote for,” she said. “Vote ‘Hollyoaks’!” she exclaimed, raising a plastic champagne cup in a celebratory gesture.",1

I had just entered a store and a couple of minutes later heard that tell-tale electronic tone, and just to be sure I was hearing what I thought I heard, I went closer to the speaker in the ceiling. 
It was your typical test, saying if there had been an actual emergency, a instructions would have followed… and the regular radio programming resumed. I had to laugh because I think I was the only one in the store who heard it. Everyone else seemed oblivious. If the intention is to incite fear… it failed. We passed the zombie test. High five! ~ BP

25585,A Paralympian Races to Remove Obstacles for the Next Generation - The New York Times,"CLARKSVILLE, Md.  —   Growing up on a   street in suburbia, Tatyana and Hannah McFadden raced their wheelchairs up, down and all around. Their family challenged    convention, but also fit right in. Two moms, three children, a grandma and two dogs. A basketball hoop in the driveway. Purple wheelchairs scattered throughout the garage. Sports equipment, and prosthetic legs, stuffed in cramped closets. “It’s been just such an amazing year,” Debbie McFadden said, standing alongside her daughters on the backyard patio. Dozens of camera phones clicked. The buttercream on the sheet cake told the rest of the story: “Tatyana  Hannah Go for the Gold!” was written in red script across the icing, and two tiny wheelchairs raced on a fondant track. The daughters were raised to believe they could do anything, no matter what the physical impairment, and this is what their uncommon determination has wrought: At the Paralympic Games, which begin Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, Tatyana McFadden could become the first athlete to sweep every distance in wheelchair racing. She will compete in the 100 meters and the marathon  —   and everything in between. She could leave Rio with seven gold medals. Her sister Hannah is racing in three of the same events, including the 4x100 relay. If the McFaddens finish    on the podium, they will be the first sisters to do so in a Paralympics. The odds of this? Longer than a marathon, especially given their start. “You know, when Tatyana and Hannah came here, Tatyana was told by doctors at Johns Hopkins she probably wouldn’t live long, and they said Hannah would never be active,” Debbie McFadden told the gathering at their Rio   party. One of the best athletes most Americans have never heard of, Tatyana McFadden may be hard to miss in the coming months. Her Phelpsian medal quest will be a focal point for NBC’s Paralympics coverage  —   more than 70 hours across NBC’s networks and sports app, compared with six hours of coverage for the London Paralympics four years ago. “In the U. S. you don’t know about the Paralympics,” said Philip Craven, the president of the International Paralympic Committee. “You’re going to get to know. Give your people a chance to get to know Tatyana. It will take their minds off the presidential election. ” McFadden’s image appears on more than a million Coke cans. Her    life story will be told, and retold, in commercials. In the time leading up to Rio, BP became the first United States Olympic Committee corporate partner to sponsor more Paralympians than Olympians. Now that Michael Phelps has packed up his Speedo and gone home and Simone Biles has clapped her last cloud of chalk into the rafters, will the American public stay for the Paralympics  ? “We’re on the cusp of breaking the barriers for Paralympic sport,” Tatyana McFadden said. “It’s taken a lot of hard work and dedication, trying to teach society what it means to be a Paralympian, that we’re not any different, that we’re just like the Olympians, with the same training sites, sponsorships, medals and venues. ” If not the same rewards. The United States Olympic Committee awards $25, 000 to every American who wins an Olympic gold versus $5, 000 for every Paralympic gold $15, 000 for Olympic silver versus $3, 500 for Paralympic silver and $10, 000 for Olympic bronze versus $2, 500 for Paralympic bronze. There is also a significant difference between prize purses in major marathons. The New York City Marathon, for example, awards   winners $100, 000 its wheelchair division winners receive $15, 000. “It’s absolutely ridiculous,” Tatyana McFadden said. “That bar needs to be raised. ” “If you don’t speak out, it’s going to stay the same,” she said. “Because I’ve been in the sport for a bit, I can be an educator. I want to give back for the next generations to come, however long I’ll be racing. I think it’s really, really important to have that voice. ” Born with spina bifida and adopted from a Russian orphanage, Tatyana McFadden, 27, is paralyzed from the waist down. Hannah McFadden, 20, adopted from Albania, born without a femur in her left leg, is an    amputee. She uses a prosthesis to walk and a wheelchair to race. Ruthi McFadden, 17, also adopted from Albania, is the outlier  —   no wheelchair, no prosthetic leg to pop off at airport security and hand to a T. S. A. agent, as Hannah does for kicks. She has no desire to run the length of a basketball court, let alone a marathon. “I don’t like to sweat,” she tells her sisters. “Our family is a very unique household,” said Hannah McFadden, legs slung over an ottoman in the living room. “If you took a family photo right now, you got Grandma with an oxygen tank, probably sassing the photographer. ” (The oxygen tank comes courtesy of decades of smoking the sassing comes naturally.) She continued: “Ruthi talking about all the boyfriends she has. Tatyana wishing she had all the boyfriends. And me saying, ‘Where’s the food?’ You’d have all those different things going on and oh, yeah, and then parents, Deb and Bridget. We have two moms. “That was just the way it was. Having two moms wasn’t what really stood out about this family,” she said, in the deadpan of a mockumentary. Earlier this year, after People magazine published a feature article with the headline, “Meet My Two Moms: Wheelchair Racing Sensation Tatyana McFadden Reveals How She Was Saved From a Bleak Russian Orphanage,” the family collectively chuckled. It was not exactly breaking news. Debbie McFadden and Bridget O’Shaughnessey have been partners for 32 years. They kept their relationship and their shared parenting role   because they did not want headlines to read, “Raised by Two Moms, McFadden Wins Gold. ” “I’ve been public about it,” Tatyana McFadden said, “but I haven’t been always, ‘Oh, these are my two moms, these are my two moms, these are my two moms.’ “It’s something I grew up with, and it’s not any different to me. Our parents have been together, what, more than 30 years? They’re a great example of what love and relationships look like. ” They met when Debbie McFadden was still recovering from the effects of   syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease. While she was in graduate school, the condition left her paralyzed from the neck down. As a result, she relied on an electric wheelchair for four years and then crutches for eight. The obstacles Debbie McFadden faced while disabled  —   limited job and educational opportunities, snap judgments based on physical appearance  —   came to define her life’s work, as an advocate and a mother. “This can never be,” she told herself. She became the United States commissioner of disabilities in 1989, appointed by President George H. W. Bush. “Why, sir, this job?” she recalled asking the president. “Because you’re a pain in the ass,” he replied. “I’d rather have you working for me than against me. ” (Bush, 92, did not recall the specific interaction, but spoke highly of McFadden, a spokesman, Jim McGrath, said.) McFadden helped write the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, the milestone legislation that prohibits discrimination based on disability. “She makes the impossible happen,” Hannah said. “That woman does not know the word ‘no. ’” Debbie McFadden now serves as her daughters’ manager, or “momager,” as they call it. O’Shaughnessey, who works in information technology for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, is the    parent, the one fixing wheelchairs and wearing a headlamp for   wheelchair workouts on the track. She is the steady pace runner, the quiet complement to her    partner. On a stage in Times Square this summer, surrounded by Olympians and Paralympians, Tatyana McFadden described her early years in St. Petersburg, Russia. “For the first six years in the orphanage, I received no medical treatment, so no wheelchair available,” she said, addressing the crowd at a news media event. “And I taught myself how to walk on my arms, using my arms as my legs to get around the orphanage. ” The next speaker, Michelle Obama, waited in the wings. “The sixth year changed my life for the better, when a woman happened to walk through the door, and that’s my mom Deborah McFadden. She’s here today. ” She paused for applause and then continued. Tatyana McFadden said sports had changed her life, and had perhaps saved it. Given her weak physical state at the time of her adoption, her parents signed her up for every sport they could find to build her strength. “See that wooden fence?” Debbie McFadden said as she pulled into the parking lot outside the home of the Bennett Blazers, an adaptive sports program. “That’s where she was when we first put her in the racing chair and said, ‘Go. ’” Inside the gym, Tatyana’s legacy is everywhere  —   in her trademark candy purple racing chairs, still used by the current Blazers, and the imprint she has made on the children there today. She is their Stephen Curry, their Serena Williams, their autographed poster on a bedroom wall. “Tatyana brings pride and recognition,” said David Elbert, whose daughter, Ruby, is part of the Blazers program. “She makes these kids stand up taller sometimes. Last Paralympics, Tatyana was on the gas pump. You pulled into BP, and Ruby was like, ‘Whoa. ’” In seventh grade, Ruby broke down Tatyana McFadden’s lawsuit against the Howard County school district for a social studies assignment. When McFadden was 15, Ruby’s age now, she was the youngest member of the 2004 United States Paralympics team. After winning her first two Paralympic medals in Athens, she started her freshman year at Atholton High School in Columbia, Md. She had never imagined that earning a varsity letter would be the greater challenge. Competing against   runners, McFadden did not expect her results to count she just wanted to experience competitive sports. Citing safety concerns, school officials prohibited McFadden, a freshman, from racing alongside her high school track team. In 2005, the McFaddens filed suit, claiming no damages, against the Howard County Public School System. Until the case could be heard in federal court, the school allowed Tatyana to race separately, to circle an otherwise empty track after everyone else had run. The highly publicized legal battle took a toll on the teenager. At times, she was booed on the track, ostracized by teammates and ripped on message boards. A teammate, the coach’s daughter, sent a scathing letter to local newspapers. “I will no longer sit back and watch runners be treated unfairly because they are NOT disabled,” the 2007 letter said, according to The Washington Post. “Politically correct or not, I have been waiting several months to get all this off my chest. ” During the years of the lawsuit, McFadden turned to her grandmother Jo for support. “I’d be coming home being emotional and Grandma Jo would help me through it,” Tatyana said. “She reminds me that it’s about the long run. ” “It was a tough time for her,” Grandma Jo said. “A lot of tears. ” Grandma Jo, O’Shaughnessey’s mother, moved in with the family when the children were young. She was the one home when Mom (Debbie McFadden) traveled abroad, running an international adoption agency after her term as commissioner of disabilities. And Grandma Jo was the one home when Mama (Bridget O’Shaughnessey) was still at work in Washington. McFadden eventually won the right to race with her classmates  —   and the suit paved the way for the passage of a state law that guaranteed all students with disabilities the right to participate in sports. Then it became a national mandate. Three years ago, the United States Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights issued a letter of guidance clarifying school districts’ legal obligation to provide equal access to extracurricular activities to all students. The long run  —   the marathon view, if you will  —   made the struggle worth it. It made life easier for those who followed, including Hannah, who did not have to deal with the obstacles or animosity her sister had faced. In Tatyana McFadden’s book for young readers, “Ya Sama! Moments From My Life,” published this year, there is a chapter about the case, with the ugly moments softened or omitted. “I didn’t want to make it so dark or so tragic,” she said. The Russian phrase “Ya sama!” can be translated as “I can do it” or “I can do it myself. ” It is a phrase she learned as a young child in her St. Petersburg orphanage and one she uses now when faced with a challenge. “Any race that Tatyana is on the starting line is a race she can win,” said Adam Bleakney, her coach for the Paralympics and at the University of Illinois, where she is a graduate student. “So I wouldn’t be surprised if she wins seven golds. One of her strengths is her ability to have a very singular focus, whatever the task at hand. There is never a reservation or doubt when she has a goal in her mind. Most of us will get a sliver of doubt, but I don’t think that ever happens to Tatyana. ” After returning with three golds from the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London, Tatyana tried skiing for the first time. She made the 2014 Winter Paralympics team and left Sochi with a silver medal, her 11th over all. In Rio, McFadden is likely to win gold several times over, as she is the   holder in the 100, 400, 800, 1, 500 and 5, 000 meters. The United States relay team  —   nicknamed the McRelay, with a lineup of the McFadden sisters, Amanda McGrory and Chelsea McClammer  —   is a gold medal contender. And Tatyana McFadden is favored to win the marathon, after having swept the Boston, London, Chicago and New York marathons for the last three years. In April, at the London Marathon, McFadden raced wheel to wheel and shoulder to shoulder with her Swiss rival Manuela Schär. McFadden’s arms throbbed as she pushed past Buckingham Palace, unable to shake Schär, who had saved energy for the final push by riding in McFadden’s draft. The duo headed for the finish at the Mall. As Schär tried to outkick her rival, McFadden floored it to the finish, winning by a second. As her parents watched, even they were astounded. Where did that sprint come from? they asked her. “Well, she was going to beat me,” she said,   .",1
25588,"Arguing for a Judge Today, and Before Him Tomorrow - The New York Times","Neal K. Katyal was for a time the top lawyer in the Obama administration. As acting solicitor general, he represented the government before the Supreme Court. He is no conservative, and says he is disappointed that the latest nominee to the court is from the White House of President Trump. Yet in the opinion pages of The New York Times on Tuesday, Katyal made a forceful case for Trump’s pick to the high court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Katyal called the nominee a man of principle who will uphold the rule of law, and “bring a sense of fairness and decency to the job, and a temperament that suits the nation’s highest court. ” The author says he knows this because he has seen Gorsuch in action, both in court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve. What Katyal did not mention  —   and the   page did not disclose in his bio  —   is that he has cases pending before the Supreme Court. Katyal was identified as a former solicitor general, a law professor at Georgetown University and a private litigator at the law firm Hogan Lovells. But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer   Squibb, Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court. Some readers would have liked to know more about Katyal’s background. Here’s one email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands, N. J. I took this concern to both   page and to Katyal himself. Jim Dao, the   editor, said the editors had not been aware of Katyal’s cases before the court. Writers are required to disclose potential conflicts, he said, but the process got rushed in this case. “Editors do try to ask writers directly,” he said. “On tight deadlines  —   and the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline  —   the question doesn’t always get asked. So I don’t blame the writer or the editor in this case. ” When I reached out to Katyal, he said he had not received such a disclosure request and had not had a conversation about potential conflicts. He also thought it was obvious to The Times that as a lawyer whose practice often brings him to the Supreme Court, he would have a case before it. More critically, Katyal said, it is common for Supreme Court lawyers not to mention litigation they have pending before the court when writing an opinion piece about a nominee or speaking to a reporter. Here’s his response to me in full: The problem is that the   did not note that Katyal is among the elite lawyers who argue before the high court. Katyal, in his original submission to   editors, disclosed that he is a highly experienced litigator before the Supreme Court. The editors did not disclose that to readers. The Times editors’ lack of disclosure may leave Katyal open to unwarranted criticism, not only from readers but from others looking to challenge his motives. I’m not suggesting Katyal is currying favor with a man who is almost certainly going to be on the court. I seriously doubt that he is. Plus, given the range of his clients, some might benefit and others not if Gorsuch is even on the bench when their cases come up. But The Times opens itself up to that criticism by failing to simply tell the readers more about who he is. Katyal’s piece falls into an appealing category for an   editor: a partisan who breaks ranks to support the opposition. Whenever that happens, the author of the piece is bound to endure scrutiny by those who feel betrayed. Shouldn’t The Times err on the side of disclosure? It doesn’t need to be in   language that implies a grave conflict. I’m not suggesting that The Times should have listed every case Katyal has before the court. But at minimum, readers in this case deserve to know that he is a Supreme Court litigator with cases before the court. Let the readers decide if that matters, or indeed whether it might even enhance the author’s expertise. Updated 7:30 a. m. February 4, to clarify that it was The Times, not Katyal, that failed to disclose his litigating experience. I intended from the start to convey that this was The Times’s failure and not Katyal’s. I regret the ambiguity surrounding the party responsible for failing to disclose Katyal’s experience and any misunderstanding caused by it.",1
25589,John Bolton: Trump Admin Put Iran ‘On Notice’ for First Time in Eight Years,"On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton said he was “delighted” to hear National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s statement that Iran has been “put on notice” for its ballistic missile launches and other provocations. [“I think it’s the first time in eight years that anybody has really said to Iran what needs to be said,” Bolton told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.   “I think it demonstrates a couple of things: Number one, that the Obama administration’s nuclear deal, agreed to in the summer of 2015, is in deep trouble. I think that’s what being put officially ‘on notice’ means. Because this latest ballistic missile launch by the Iranians was a violation of the agreement, although the wording is weak and ambiguous, thanks to John Kerry, there’s no doubt this is unacceptable behavior by Iran,” he said. “It also sends the political signal to America’s allies, as well, that any notion that we will simply continue to accept this deal as written is something they need to dismiss,” he continued. “I think it’s the kind of   that helps clarify the situation with friends and adversaries alike. ” “This deal was a strategic mistake when it was made. It’s not gotten any better with age,” Bolton said. “It’s better to be unambiguous when a mistake like this is made. Even though Iran has benefited from the deal  —   the release of sanctions, unfreezing of $150 billion of their assets  —   it’s just an example of how bad the deal was for the United States. Iran gets the goodies up front, and its obligations only came down the road. ”  “But nonetheless, because I think they’re already in violation of the deal, and I think there’s evidence to show that, we need to get on with the business of looking and talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel when he arrives in a couple of weeks and our friends in the Arab world who see the Iranian nuclear threat as a direct threat to them, not just a threat to us,” he advised. Marlow turned to President Trump’s executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from seven   nations and asked if Bolton thought the rollout of this order has been “ . ” “Well,   is a very diplomatic way to put it,” Bolton told Marlow. “You have a future at the State Department if you want one at some point. ” “Thank you, sir,” Marlow said. “That’s not a compliment, actually,” Bolton said with a laugh. On a more serious note, he said things were left out of the executive order that he thinks should have been included, “for example, making it clear that green card holders were not subject to it. ” “Other exceptions were put in. This one was not,” he noted. “We all know the Trump administration wants to give refugee status to, like Iraqis, former interpreters who helped us out during the Iraq conflict. I think that added to the confusion and the publicity. ” “But honestly, this is going to be controversial even if those steps had been corrected. What I don’t understand is why the White House wasn’t more prepared for the fury of opposition that met it. It’s not like this wasn’t an issue during the campaign. It’s not like it wasn’t highlighted,” he said.  “Look, it’s a bump in the road. I’ve been through transitions coming in and going out through the government. The first couple of months at the White House always have rocky periods. The real consequence here is that they learn from it, and I’m comfortable that they will,” said Bolton. He agreed with Marlow’s suggestion that despite all the hysteria around the supposedly draconian executive order, it did not go far enough in certain ways. “It’s very limited, and I think, in fact, if people read the executive order, they’ll see that with respect to these seven nations that are affected by it, that the same seven nations that, as you said a moment ago, were tagged by the Obama administration to effectively be eliminated from the visa waiver program. So that was a step in the direction Trump took. Trump just went further,” he observed.  “But the key point was that these seven governments, for a variety of reasons, cannot supply the United States with adequate information about people claiming to be citizens of those countries who want visas to come into the United States. Let’s take a couple of examples: Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Syria. These are places where the government has just collapsed. It’s just collapsed. There is no effective government. We have no confidence that the information we’re getting is correct. Other governments like Iran, I wouldn’t trust as far as I could throw them anyway, even though they’re functioning in their territory,” Bolton said.  “The point is to give the secretary of Homeland Security time to figure out whether these problems will be corrected or whether other steps need to be taken. People complain we should have put Saudi Arabia on the list. Actually, we get a lot of information from Saudi Arabia about visa applicants that we can corroborate and check into. Is it perfect? Of course not, but the opponents of the executive order, I think to be fair, cannot have it both ways. It’s too broad, which is what most of them claim and simultaneously claim it’s not broad enough, which really is hypocritical,” he said. On the subject of Iran, Bolton described the threat it poses as “enormous,” amply justifying the Trump administration’s putting them “on notice. ” “This cruise missile story is definitely very troubling because of its implications,” he said, referring to Iran’s recent missile test. “It was reported that the test had failed, but here’s the significant fact: it failed at the reentry stage  —   that is to say, as the warhead part of the missile, the nose cone and what’s under it, was coming back into the atmosphere. ” “What is significant about that? When you launch weather and communications satellites, you don’t care what happens on   as long as the satellite is in orbit. What happens to the rest of the missile, it burns up in the atmosphere. You don’t care,” he explained. “The only reason you care about   vehicles is when you’re delivering nuclear weapons because obviously, you can put the weapon into space, but if you can’t bring it down over the target, you’ve wasted a lot of effort. So the fact that Iran is at the point where it can launch ballistic missiles  —   and we know they’ve got   ballistic missiles now. ” “That they’re testing ICBM kinds of missiles, capable of hitting the United States at a certain point, and they’re testing the   capability, tells you exactly what this missile program is all about. So the argument that ballistic missiles aren’t intended for nuclear weapons is just another Iranian lie. That’s the only purpose of this program,” Bolton said.

25590,John Leguizamo: The First Time I Faced a Hostile Audience (Kids) - The New York Times,"There I was playing Jack from “Jack and the Beanstalk,” pretending to climb a rope. Suddenly  —   boom!  —   the giant comes out, and several castmates and I erupt in a synchronized breakdance, mirroring one another’s moves. The crowd screams with a mixture of joy and fear, trying to make Jack hip to the fact that he’s about to be captured. This was all in a day’s work, as I was trying to be an actor and the only gig I could get was a diverse children’s theater troupe that was hiring my flavor. I joined Off Center Theater, a troupe that was mostly Latin and black, when I was 19. It was the  ’80s, and   and oversized clothes were the styles of the moment. We traveled around the city performing for kids in public schools. Spanish Harlem, East New York, my old neighborhood in Jackson Heights  —   all over. And I understood these kids because I used to be one of them myself. We actors knew they would rather be somewhere else, but we loved the challenge. It was my first hostile audience! (Well, after my family.) But we learned that once we started changing the plays up so they could relate, these audiences weren’t hostile at all  —   they actually loved it. I saw firsthand how hungry my young Latin people were to be entertained by their own. At the time, I was taking serious acting classes at HB Studio and the Lee Strasberg Institute. I was the only Latin kid in the room, and the plays we studied were written by white dudes. Still, I loved studying with the masters of acting. I was living in my brother’s dorm at Columbia University. I didn’t have enough to cover room and board, so I had to find work. So that’s how I ended up at Off Center. What seemed at first like a mere moneymaking thing turned into a   adventure. It was really   for me, bouncing between my brother’s room at Columbia and this rarefied world of privilege and opportunity, and then performing at public schools where there was never enough funding and the children and their families were struggling to get by. These were separate worlds in the same city. Sometimes it got me down  —   I felt like these kids didn’t have a chance. But it also showed me how kids in poverty learn to find joy in the little things that life has to offer. They have to make do. Look, I’m not saying you should put your children in poverty to make them happy. But growing up poor gives you a special perspective, and there’s a lot of value and strength in that. At the schools, we would update the classics. We did “Little Red Riding Hood,” where she was a fine black girl and all of a sudden the Big Bad Wolf would start  . We added slang, Spanglish and  . We did impressions of Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. One time we did Frankenstein’s monster as a breakdancer. We told jokes: “We were so poor my mother would take Polaroids of other kids playing with toys for Christmas. ” Things like that. Once a kid came up after a show and asked why he didn’t know that Jack from “Jack and the Beanstalk” was Latin. He said he was going to ask his mom why she never told him. Man, to see those kids squealing and jumping up from their seats was the biggest highlight of my life. I realized how important it was for them to see themselves and their culture reflected back to them, something the media of the time rarely attempted. Seeing their lingo, mannerisms and pop culture references onstage was a way of being validated. We may have been the first ones to really show them that who they were was important and cool. Especially in my Manhattan. But the biggest service being provided was what the kids gave me. They showed me that there was an audience of people who grew up just like me, hungry for material they could relate to. I figured if these Latin kids were into what I was doing, then Latin adults might be, too. I had never thought that before. No one ever told me. So eventually I was inspired to try to connect with new audiences. I performed at these downtown performance art venues that had more of a white   crowd. I saw that even though I was talking about Latin life, they, too, were hungry for an understanding of this sister culture to their own. I was testing the waters of what I could and couldn’t be, how far I could push the boundaries. But I soon saw that the boundaries were mostly in my own head. What I saw on TV and in movies and books did not apply to the real world. I found that the real world, once I gave it a chance, was pretty open and tolerant and curious.",1
25593,Key Moments From Today’s Confirmation Hearings - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Democrats continue their rigorous questioning of President Trump’s nominees for cabinet positions and other important posts. Here are key moments from today: ■ Representative Tom Price of Georgia, nominated to be health and human services secretary, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress. “The reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,” he said. ■ Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented “the   of the nomination process. ” ■ Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the nominee for budget director, said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities. ■ The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes. ■ Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Small Business Administration, said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job. ■ Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations. A background investigation of Mr. Price says he understated the value of his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, and claimed income tax deductions that he could not substantiate. The findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price’s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties. In a questionnaire in December, the committee staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400, 613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through “a private placement offering. ” The value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $50, 000 to $100, 000, but that reflected the purchase price, the staff reported. At the request of the committee, Mr. Price recalculated the value of his holdings to reflect their market price. The revised value was $100, 000 to $250, 000. In addition, the committee staff said, Mr. Price “took improper deductions on his 2016 tax returns” for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums that he owns in Washington and Nashville. Moreover, the staff said, Mr. Price and his wife, both physicians, claimed “miscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19, 034” for various expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Neither Mr. Price nor his wife work as a physician, the staff report said, and “proper documentation could not be located,” so Mr. Price’s tax returns will be amended to remove the $19, 034 in deductions. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Price over his trades of health care stocks during his time in Congress. “It is hard to see this as anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of position,” Mr. Wyden said. In particular, Mr. Wyden pressed Mr. Price over his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, which the senator said could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress. Mr. Price said he had done nothing wrong. “The reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,” he said. Just how involved is Mr. Price as the Trump administration plots how it will replace the Affordable Care Act? Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, tried to find out. “President Trump said he’s working with you on a replacement plan for the A. C. A. which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation,” Mr. Brown said. “Is that true?” “It’s true that he said that, yes,” Mr. Price responded, drawing laughter in the hearing room. “Not that he’s ever done this before, but did the president lie?” Mr. Brown asked. He added: “I know we don’t use the word lie here, because we’re polite, when presidents say statements that aren’t true. But did he lie to the public about working with you?” “I’ve had conversations with the president about health care, yes,” Mr. Price replied. Senator Hatch lamented “the   of the nomination process. ” He said Democrats’ attacks on Mr. Price’s ethics were “specious and distorted. ” He said lawmakers should not “invent new standards for finances, ethics and disclosure that are different from those that have generally applied in the past. ” “None of those who say they oppose Dr. Price’s nomination seem to be talking about whether he is qualified,” Mr. Hatch said. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, also came to Mr. Price’s defense. “I feel like I’ve been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction,” he said. He called Mr. Price “an honorable man. ” Mr. Mulvaney said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities if he were confirmed as Mr. Trump’s budget director. “I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later,” Mr. Mulvaney said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Budget Committee. “I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. ” While Mr. Mulvaney is a big believer in spending cuts, he made it clear that he wanted to protect America’s social safety nets. “A strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable,” he said. Mr. Mulvaney was asked about his failure to pay nanny taxes in his opening question, and said that it had been an innocent mistake. “In 2000, we had triplets. When we came home, we hired someone to help my wife, to help take care of the children,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “In my mind, she was a babysitter. ” He added, “I did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding. ” Mr. Mulvaney said he had realized his error when filling out a questionnaire related to his nomination to be Mr. Trump’s budget director. He said that he had quickly notified his accountant, the president and his colleagues so that he could correct the mistake. The toughest questions Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came not from a Democrat but from Senator McCain. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending, and appeared shocked when he could not remember those votes. “Boy, I’ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, congressman,” Mr. McCain said. “Maybe you don’t take it with the seriousness that it deserves. ” Mr. McCain was also unimpressed with Mr. Mulvaney’s explanation for wanting to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. After giving the congressman a history lesson on the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, he offered a final note of disapproval. “I am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,” he said. Mr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization. “I wouldn’t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme,” he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and gives it to other people. As for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits. However, he said that he could see raising the age for receiving benefits in the future. Ms. McMahon reassured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations, promising to work to put in place “the right regulations” to spur economic growth if she is confirmed as head of the Small Business Administration. Senator Jim Risch, the Idaho Republican who leads the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said the regulatory structure of government today was “strangling businesses. ” Ms. McMahon presented herself not as the billionaire former chief executive of W. W. E. but instead as an entrepreneur who had weathered the most difficult moments of building a business from the ground up. “Small businesses want to feel they can take a risk on expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable,” she said. “We want to renew optimism in our economy. ” Ms. McMahon described how she and her husband, Vince, built their global business enterprise from an operation so small they shared a desk. She spoke of how they fought back from an early bankruptcy filing  —   a stark contrast to the wealthy former executive she is today. The McMahons were among Mr. Trump’s biggest campaign donors, having given $6 million to a “super PAC” supporting him last August and September. Ms. McMahon and Mr. Trump go back decades, bound by their shared background in entertainment. The Trump Plaza in Atlantic City hosted the W. W. E. ’s WrestleMania twice in the late 1980s, according to Mr. Trump’s W. W. E. “Superstars” bio, and Mr. Trump became a frequent attendee at the entertainment empire’s events. In 2007, he shaved Mr. McMahon’s head in the wrestling ring after winning a   Battle of the Billionaires wager. Introduced and endorsed by the two Democrats who defeated her in her failed Senate bids in Connecticut  —   Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy  —   Ms. McMahon seems likely to sail to confirmation, with the committee expected to approve her next week. The introduction and endorsement of a Republican nominee by two Democratic senators is unusual at the outset of a confirmation hearing.

25594,China Helps Aung San Suu Kyi With Peace Talks in Myanmar - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   As Myanmar’s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, met this past week with Chinese officials during her   visit here, China helped arrange a gift for her back home, a reminder that it wants to make itself Myanmar’s new best friend. Since assuming power this year, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has said her major goal is to end 70 years of civil war with ethnic minorities seeking greater autonomy. The gift, announced Thursday, was a letter signed by three   and stubborn ethnic rebel groups with ties to China that declared their intention to join a peace conference she will convene this month. “I do believe that as a good neighbor China will do everything possible to promote our peace process,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said at a news conference here on Friday. “If you ask me what my most important aim is for my country, that is to achieve peace and unity among the different peoples of our union. Without peace there can be no sustained development. ” But China was not acting out of altruism when it nudged the groups to join the peace talks. After years of encouraging the armed groups, China wants to end the prolonged fighting. The lawlessness created by that conflict has allowed the illegal jade and timber trade, worth billions of dollars, to flourish, but it has also made legitimate commerce across China’s southern border with Myanmar almost impossible. Once peace comes, China plans to build roads and railways across northern Myanmar to the Bay of Bengal, a short cut to supplement the recently built oil and gas pipelines that would bolster trade from the Middle East by avoiding the South China Sea. China also has other projects in mind to knit Myanmar into its orbit. As an indicator of that interest, the Chinese president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Jin Liqun, met with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday. But China is not the only player in Myanmar with plans for new relationships and investments after decades of corrupt military governments. The United States was the handmaiden to the successful election in November, when Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, won in a landslide. She is scheduled to visit the White House next month, an invitation intended to confirm the legacy of President Obama’s role in Myanmar’s transition from authoritarian rule to a fledgling democracy. Washington, facing widespread popular sentiment against nation building, no longer pays for major projects abroad, except through the World Bank and other international financial institutions. American corporations have been reluctant to invest in Myanmar although  the Treasury Department lifted an array of sanctions a few months ago, others were tightened on some major companies in Myanmar. That means that China has an opportunity to play a major role as a builder in Myanmar, a nation strategically placed between India, China and Southeast Asia and with access to the Indian Ocean. But the United States is not completely out of the picture, analysts say. They note that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is working to cultivate ties with both Washington and Beijing as foreign minister, one of the many posts she holds as the country’s de facto leader. “China sees everything in a transactional way to help themselves,” said Hans W. Vriens, a managing partner of Vriens  Partners, a corporate advisory company that specializes in Myanmar. “Its expectations may be too high. Aung San Suu Kyi is rebalancing with China, but they’re not going to move away from the United States. Washington was a very, very big role in the whole transformation to democracy and will remain so under her. ” The Obama administration is not opposed to China’s role in resolving the fighting between the myriad ethnic groups and the army, Mr. Vriens said. An end to the wars in the border region where the groups influenced by China operate is in the interests of the United States and its ally Japan, which has made Myanmar a major destination for its foreign aid and corporate investment, he said. Japanese government experts are helping Myanmar’s ministries draw up plans for urban renewal and transportation routes. On Thursday, three armed groups that had refused to attend the peacemaking gathering, called the Panglong Conference, said they were willing to be there on Aug. 31. All of them  —   the Kokang group, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army  —   receive backing from across the border in China. The Kokang, an ethnic Chinese group, used southern China as a haven for tens of thousands of refugees last year during fierce fighting with the Myanmar Army. In a reversal, the Kokang’s leader, Peng Jiasheng, 85, said in a recent letter that he welcomed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s overtures. “I believe the full stream of history will go ahead,” he wrote. And with China’s backing, the most recalcitrant of the ethnic fighters, the United Wa State Army, the largest ethnic army in Myanmar, has also said it will join the peace gathering. The conference, to be in held in the capital, Naypyidaw, is Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s signature effort since assuming power. She has likened the initiative to the peace talks in Northern Ireland, and she is working on it with the British politician Jonathan Powell, a chief negotiator on those talks and chief of staff under Tony Blair, then the prime minister. China’s president, Xi Jinping, told Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday that China would play a “constructive role” in the peace process. Before arriving in Beijing, she promised China a role as mediator at the conference. But Sumlut Gun Maw, a prominent leader of the Kachin, a largely Christian group that is fighting the Myanmar government, warned that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi should be careful not to overplay her hand with China. Mr. Sumlut Gun Maw, who met with Obama administration officials in Washington several years ago, said the relationship with the Chinese could backfire. The Wa and Kokang enjoy “comradely” ties with China, he said, and China is likely to demand much in return for delivering them to the peace process.",1
25596,The Making of Virtually Real Art With Google’s Tilt Brush - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   In 1949, a Life magazine photographer named Gjon Mili made a pilgrimage to the French Riviera to see Pablo Picasso. Mili had come up with a way to photograph trails of light, and he wanted to shoot Picasso “drawing” in midair with a light pen  —   a process that would leave no trace except on film. Picasso loved it. The result, published in Life and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, was Picasso’s celebrated series of “light drawings” of bulls and centaurs and the like  —   photographs that captured him in the act of creating the ultimate in ephemeral art. Picasso is long gone. But some 68 years later, Google has been calling on dozens of artists, animators and illustrators with a   update of Mili’s concept  —   a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it, at least for viewers wearing a VR headset. In place of Gjon Mili are Drew Skillman and Patrick Hackett, a pair of video game developers turned virtual reality enthusiasts who live in San Francisco. They were trying to build a   chess application one night a couple of years ago when they discovered it had an unexpected side effect: As you moved the chess pieces around in virtual space, they left trails of light behind. Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature, the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails, hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions. In April 2015, seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called Tilt Brush, Google bought their company for an undisclosed sum  —   which is how Mr. Skillman and Mr. Hackett have come to be ensconced in the company’s offices near the downtown waterfront here. With Google’s support, Tilt Brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing, painting, even sculpting in space. It was released in April as a free   to the new HTC Vive, an $800 virtual reality system produced by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC in partnership with Valve, an American video game developer. (It’s on sale as a $30 software package from Valve’s online store.) Reviewers immediately dubbed it the Vive’s killer app. This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman’s apartment, a    studio in South Park, the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco’s digerati since the 1990s. “Not in our wildest dreams,” said Mr. Skillman, a slightly built    with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest, unassuming manner. Tilt Brush got its name because in its earliest versions, you would draw or paint on a   surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space. But because the HTC Vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of   controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space, the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a   area  —   no surface required. One controller serves as a palette, with dozens of colors and effects the other acts as a brush or pen. To watch someone use it is a bit unnerving, since the person appears to be making marks in midair, but you can’t actually see those. But put on a Vive headset and step between the sensors yourself  —   as I did in a windowless room in Google’s New York offices  —   and the illusion of delusion disappears. Instead, you suddenly see what has been produced: a phantom creation in three dimensions, something you can walk around, walk through, poke your head inside, do everything except touch. Google’s investment in virtual reality pales beside Facebook’s $2 billion purchase of the VR pioneer Oculus. Still, Tilt Brush is part of a growing effort, one that began with the introduction in 2014 of supercheap cardboard headsets that work with smartphones, and continues with the recent release of a stunning virtual reality version of Google Earth as a free download for Vive owners. Over the past year, Google has invited more than 60 people to try Tilt Brush and offer feedback, and this week the company is unveiling their work and participation. “You would never want to create an artistic tool with only engineers,” said Mr. Skillman. “That’s just absurd. ” According to Tory Voight, Google’s Tilt Brush program manager, those who have joined this    program include Dustin Yellin, a Brooklyn artist known for his   collages encased in layers of glass, and Jonathan Yeo, a British painter whose portrait of Kevin Spacey as the fictional American president Francis J. Underwood was exhibited last year at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery. Jeff Koons, whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $58 million, had early access, though he was not part of the artists in residence program. Bob Mankoff, Roz Chast and other cartoonists for The New Yorker have also checked it out, as has Alex Hirsch, the young animator behind Disney’s hit television series “Gravity Falls. ” Last June, Mr. Hirsch posted a sample creation on Twitter along with an enthusiastic status update: “Drawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a   wizard god!” But the first to try it was Glen Keane, a   figure who in his 37 years at Disney had brought the warmth of   animation to such characters as Ariel (in “The Little Mermaid”) Aladdin, Tarzan and Pocahontas. “When I left Disney in 2012,” Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif. “I told them it was because I know there’s something new coming  —   I don’t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it. ” He was still looking when he met Regina Dugan, then the leader of Google’s secretive Advanced Technology and Products group, which was experimenting with virtual reality. First he partnered with the group to make a   virtual reality short called “Duet,” a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an Academy Award. “Duet” broke new ground, since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been  . But though he’d spent a lifetime drawing on paper, Mr. Keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear. “The goal would be to animate not on paper but in space,” he said. Enter Tilt Brush, which Mr. Keane encountered when Mr. Skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in San Francisco. Though still in a primitive state, it was maturing rapidly, and Mr. Keane soon became a convert. In September 2015, seven months before its release, he previewed its capabilities with “Step Into the Page,” a   video. “The edges of the paper are no longer there,” he exclaimed in a   as he did a loose, freehand sketch of Ariel in virtual space. “This is not a flat drawing. This is sculptural drawing. ” Scott McCloud, the graphic artist whose book “Understanding Comics” is considered the ultimate guide to the art form, got to play with Tilt Brush when Google invited him to its Silicon Valley headquarters in August. “I don’t mind saying, I’m a little bit obsessed with this program,” he said as we sat in his small,   office in a mall in the Los Angeles exurb of Thousand Oaks. “One thing that appeals to me the most is, it’s still very early. Everyone is asking fundamental questions. We’re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for. I love it when technology is in that stage. ” So, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. “I doodle with it,” said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. “I describe it as a   sketchbook. ” What it won’t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call “Flatland. ” For denizens of Flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of   this can be problematic. Mr. Mankoff, the cartoon editor at The New Yorker, came up with some characteristically     drawings during the two days he spent using Tilt Brush with Ms. Chast and other colleagues at Google’s New York offices. But though he professes to have enjoyed the experience, he seems unlikely to lead The New Yorker out of Flatland. “You’ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists,” he said. “Or it may just not work  —   but that’s no reason not to try it. ” One suggestion the New Yorker team had: cubes and cylinders and other   shapes to draw on, “so you’re not starting from zero in   space. ” (Google has since implemented a similar idea.) Other than that, Mr. Mankoff offered with a grin: “The advice I would have for Google is, more cats. You can’t go wrong with cats. ” Mr. Keane has a different item on his wish list. Currently, works created in Tilt Brush are as motionless as a New Yorker cartoon. They’re essentially static, and Mr. Keane is an animator. “To me, the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space,” he said as I viewed a Tilt Brush drawing called “Victory Dance” in his studio. The piece captures a brief moment in time, seconds after his daughter’s high school choir had won a national championship  —   but it begs to be brought to life. “Just like you have a spatial dimension, you’ve got to have time as a dimension,” Mr. Keane continued. “There’s no reason you can’t do that. I’m not smart enough to figure it out. But Drew is. ”",1
25598,Trump or Clinton?,"  
Enemies of the United States are joyously watching its upcoming elections that are exposing this once great nation as deeply corrupt. It’s as if a huge rock has been turned over, exposing the swarming, slithering underside of America’s political system. 
For those who admire America, like this writer, this week is a time to weep for the republic. 
We see two candidates who are utterly unfit for the highest office: Hilary Clinton, engulfed by scandals, and blustering TV mogul Donald Trump, a man of profound shallowness who advocates Islamophobia, torture and environmental ignorance. 
Hillary Clinton’s core supporters are black food stamp and welfare recipients, and legions of women who are voting simply by gender. Trump’s core supporters are tax-paying workers who have watched Wall Street loot America’s economy and send their jobs abroad. 
Like many people, I’ve been tearing my hair trying to decide for whom to vote. I now favor Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson who gained worldwide fame as a dolt when asked about the destruction of Aleppo, Syria. ‘What’s Aleppo?’ asked this New Mexico Bismarck. 
Now that’s the kind of president I’d like to see. No more regime-changers and empire-builders. No more Imperial America. No more crusaders or world super power bullying. No more mucking around the world and acting as the globe’s enforcer. Let’s forget Aleppo, Beirut, Gaza, Tehran, Islamabad, the South China Sea and North Korea. 
We can no longer afford to play ‘Game of Thrones.’ We’ve got to rebuild bridges and airports, and clean the Augean Stables of Congress, America’s most corrupt institution. We just spent $2.8 billion on roads in remote Afghanistan while our own highways are crumbling. 
Such is the folly of imperialism. The old Soviet Union did something similar, allowing its domestic infrastructure and industry to fall apart while adventuring in Afghanistan, and deploying 55,000 tanks in the Red Army. These tanks were useful in putting down the heroic Hungarian Revolution of 1956 – 60 years ago this week – but for nothing else. 
But I fear that whoever wins the US election will very quickly face major problems for which they are woefully unprepared. Most obvious is the bloody mess the US has created across the Mideast. 
I just learned that Trump recently named, as Mideast advisor, a notorious Muslim-hating fanatic, who is a Lebanese Maronite Christian fascist. His advice will likely be to invade Lebanon and Syria and kill more Muslims. 
For her part, Hilary Clinton has long been a wholly-financed subsidiary of Wall Street and the mighty Israel lobby. Just have a look at the list of her largest donors. Her pro-Israel supporters are urging her to create a so-called ‘no-fly’ zone over Syria, which is code for full-scale war against Syrian government and Russian forces. Guess who will benefit from Syria’s destruction and disintegration? 
This supreme idiocy could lead directly to nuclear war with Russia, something I’ve been warning against for years. 
There has been no mention in the campaign of rebuilding the Arab world, ravaged by western imperial interventions. Little mention of some 12 million Syrian refugees created by the Saudis and US. Nor of five million Palestinian refugees, and who knows how many in Iraq, Libya, Somalia and now war-ravaged Yemen. And not a word about America’s stalemated war in Afghanistan. Nothing about a shaky Europe. Nor how to accommodate China’s rise. 
Instead, we’ve heard tirades against the phony ISIS, which is funded by the Saudis, and Hilary Clinton’s absurd claims that wicked Vlad Putin is somehow behind America’s foreign disasters. It’s stupid and shameful demagoguery. 
At least Trump has the good sense to urge that we end our pointless confrontation with Russia and scale back the unaffordable American Empire. Few Americans know that almost half their government’s budget is spent on the military. 
Besides disgusting many Americans, the presidential campaign has made the US an object of derision and embarrassment around the globe. Many analysts claim that this grand fiasco marks the beginning of the end of US global hegemony. It’s certainly the beginning of the beginning. 
This week alone, the Philippines and Malaysia, two staunch American allies, edged closer to China’s camp. Neither Trump no Clinton had a care for America’s reputation during their ugly debates. 
My fear is that the election vitriol will not end America’ shame and misery but continue on, like an acid eating into the national fabric.",1
25602,A Rio Table Tennis Lament: That’s the Way the Ball Crumples - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The relics were arranged in a sphinxlike configuration, as in some type of ancient burial ground. Massimo Costantini, the coach of the United States table tennis team, called the formation “a sort of homage to the fallen. ” They appeared on the first day of the Olympics, in a far corner of the table tennis pavilion: 18 white balls, all of them crumpled or cracked, arranged ceremoniously in the center of a quartet of water bottles. It was a fitting symbol of the frustration that has festered at the tables this week at the Rio Games, where the table tennis balls are giving players fits. They do not bounce true, the players said. Their flight paths are unpredictable. And they frequently break. “I think this ball is very bad,” Li Ping of Qatar said after losing a match. The player who beat him, Dimitrij Ovtcharov of Germany, fumed that the official competition ball “makes it almost impossible to compete. ” Table tennis balls are capricious little things. Infinitesimal variations in size and imperceptible deviations in construction can have considerable ramifications for how they spin, fly and bounce. Casual players  —   people in suburban garages or fraternity houses  —   tend not to notice such details. But professionals obsess over them. The balls at the Olympics, then, are not the ones you find, cobwebbed, under the basement couch. They are not even the same balls used at the last Summer Games. Two years ago, the international federation that governs the sport switched the material of the official ball from celluloid to a different type of plastic. The federation also allowed the ball to be slightly larger. Some players are still struggling to adjust  —   and so, apparently, are some manufacturers. Many players criticized as subpar the specific quality of the balls from D. H. S. a Chinese equipment brand that became the official ball supplier after the 2012 Olympics in London. “I think many players are complaining because we have better balls,” said Timo Boll of Germany, who is at his fourth Olympics. “There are better balls on the market. We don’t use them at international tournaments. That’s a pity. ” The old celluloid balls were required to have a diameter of 39. 5 to 40. 5 millimeters the new ones can range from 40. 0 to 40. 6 millimeters. According to players, a bigger ball produces less speed and less spin. After the change, players had to recalibrate years of training and muscle memory. Those reliant on spin were disadvantaged more than athletic power hitters. The balls were changed shortly after the 2000 Olympics, increasing in size from 38 millimeters. Other past changes in equipment and rumors that more could be coming, like a rise in net height, have left players irked. “This is not good this is unprofessional,” Panagiotis Gionis of Greece said of the tinkering. “It’s your job. It affects you. Some players are destroyed about this. ” Gionis criticized the D. H. S. ball but was equally concerned about the lack of consistency from competition to competition. Different brands can be used in domestic leagues, regional tournaments and international competitions, and no two have felt alike in the past two years. “It’s like if you have to drive a different car than yours,” said Costantini, the United States coach, who was more concerned about this inconsistency than about the quality of any brand. “Maybe the brakes are not the same, the accelerating, and it takes some time to adjust. ” Players have to begin the adjustment process for the Olympics  —   the most prestigious competition in the sport  —   weeks or months before the Games to get comfortable with the ball. But that was tough to do this summer, some said, because of what they perceived as the poor quality of the D. H. S. ball. “We practiced with that ball months beforehand to get used to it, but you can never get used to it,” said Ovtcharov, who also said he felt the ball getting softer over the course of his games. (Certain competitions cycle multiple balls through a match, but not the Olympics.) Stefan Fegerl of Austria said: “This ball doesn’t jump so well. Many times it falls down very fast. When you hit them with the edge, maybe it’s broken. The quality is not good. ” In an interview Tuesday, Lou   the general manager of D. H. S. said he had not heard any complaints firsthand. Through an interpreter, Lou said the company was “quite satisfied” with its transition to the new ball. Still, he was sympathetic when informed of the concerns. He said the company was continuing research to make a better ball. “From one side, they give us information,” Lou said, “and from the other side, we improve the balls gradually. ” Thomas Weikert, the president of the federation that governs the sport, acknowledged in an interview that the balls used in the past two years had not been as good as they could be. But he said this was a symptom of the industry rather than of any individual company. “They’ve improved a lot,” Weikert said of the balls. “Let’s say it’s O. K. It’s not 100 percent. ” Lou and Weikert noted that some griping was expected. “If you use another ball, other players will complain,” Weikert said. To be sure, certain players seemed blissfully unaware of the complaints. Told about the multitude of players voicing frustrations with the ball, Paul Drinkhall of Britain smiled. “Did they lose?” he said. Boll, the German player, was eliminated in the fourth round of the singles tournament. The team competition begins Saturday. “I’m sure they want to produce now a better ball because they’re getting a lot of criticism,” Boll said. “It would have been nice if it was before the Olympic Games. ”",1
25603,CDC Blocks Testimony of Vaccine Whistleblower in Medical Malpractice Case,". CDC Blocks Testimony of Vaccine Whistleblower in Medical Malpractice Case An important witness in a case focusing on the link between vaccines and autism has been stopped fro... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/cdc-blocks-testimony-of-vaccine.html An important witness in a case focusing on the link between vaccines and autism has been stopped from testifying. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), has stopped CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson from giving evidence on scientific fraud and destruction of evidence by senior CDC officials in a recent case. Attorneys Bryan Smith and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. , of Morgan & Morgan , have wanted to have Dr. Thompson testify in a medical malpractice case to explain how the CDC committed scientific fraud in a series of studies, which found no link between vaccines and autism. After denying the request, Dr. Frieden said, ""Dr. William Thompson's deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of CDC or HHS [Health and Human Services].""Dr. Thompson is a 19-year veteran at the CDC and former senior vaccine safety scientist at the agency's Immunology Safety Office, and is the co-author of four key studies that the CDC widely suspects will stop the use of the MMR vaccine and vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, from being linked to autism. Thompson's current position is at the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention. Back in August 2014, Dr. Thompson revealed that the data behind CDC's principle vaccine safety studies demonstrated a causal link between vaccines and autism or autism symptoms, even though CDC claims the opposite is true. Thompson says,based upon interpretation of the data: ""There is biologic plausibility right now to say that thimerosal causes autism-like features."" Dr. Thompson invoked federal whistleblower protection in August 2014. Shockingly Thompson has claimed that his bosses, including the CDC's Immunization Safety Office Branch Chief Frank Destefano, specifically ordered him and three other CDC scientists to destroy data demonstrating vaccine induced autism in CDC's seminal 2004 study (Destefano, et al. 2004). The data in question unexpectedly showed a 250 percent increase in autism among young black males who received the vaccine on time (before their third birthday) in comparison to those who were vaccinated after their third birthday. It also showed a significant link between the vaccine and isolated autism, which is an autism that occurs in normally developing children with no other medical problems. According to Thompson, Destefano called his four co-authors into a room and ordered them to dump the damning datasets into a giant garbage can. The published study left out those sets of data. This study is now cited in 91 other papers on PubMed as proof of vaccine safety, is the main building block on the idea that vaccines don't cause autism. The case in question is to do with 16-year-old Yates Hazlehurst. The case is claiming that Yates is autistic as a direct result of vaccine injuries acquired in 2001 when the vaccine was improperly administered. Because of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act of 1986 (VICA), which protects doctors from any liability to do with vaccine injuries, Hazlehurst v. The Jackson Clinic is the only vaccine injury case in 30 years that has reached a court in the US. Dr. Thompson wishes to reveal the scientific fraud and destruction of evidence that occurred in the studies he was involved in. The problem has arisen due to the Whistle Blower Protection Act, which means Dr. Thompson can not testify under oath without the permission of the director of the CDC, Dr. Thomas Friede. Hazelhurst's lawyer Kennedy, who argued before Tennessee Senior Circuit Court Judge William Acree that Dr. Thompson's testimony was necessary, said: ""Yates, and almost 5,000 other vaccine injured autistic children, lost their cases in vaccine court because CDC and the Justice Department submitted fraudulent science wrongly denying the vaccine-autism link."" Judge Acree ordered on Feb. 5 that Dr. Thompson should be deposed, accepting the logic of the argument, and following this ruling, Smith filed a formal request to CDC to make Thompson available for deposition and trial testimony. ""Since that original study data is only available from Dr. Thompson,"" Hazelhurst's other attourney Smith explained, ""We are very confident that a federal judge will order CDC to make Thompson available.""

25604,2016 Closes With 140 Cops Being Killed in the Line of Duty,"A total of 140 law enforcement officers were killed in 2016 in line of duty deaths. The number of deaths increased by 10 over 2015’s 130 officers who were killed. [The final death of the year came Friday night when Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Landon Weaver was shot and killed while investigating an alleged violation of a protective order. Jason Robinson, 32, allegedly grabbed a gun during the investigation and shot Trooper Weaver, killing him. Robinson fled the scene and was later found after an overnight manhunt. He threatened officers and was shot and killed.  Death by gunfire was, once again, the leading cause of death for officers who were killed on duty. A total of 64 officers were killed by gunfire  —   up from 39 in 2015, according to statistics obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP). This represents an increase of over 60 percent over the prior year. “The 61 percent increase in law enforcement officers shot and killed in 2016 versus 2015 and a 53 percent overall increase in officers murdered in the performance of duty are deeply troubling statistics,” ODMP Director of Research Steven Weiss told Breitbart Texas. “Included in that statistic is a disturbing increase in officers killed in ‘ ’ murders, such as the incidents in Dallas and Des Moines. ” “These types of murders are particularly disconcerting because they are not born out of a criminal’s desire to avoid arrest, but out of a hatred for not only law enforcement, but for our society as a whole,” Weiss explained. “It is the type of attack that, for the most part, tactical training or increased vigilance may not help to prevent. ” Weiss told Breitbart Texas the “ambush style” murders of police officers have been increasing since 2012. “When a person is willing to plan and then put into action that plan to assassinate a person for no other reason than the person is a law enforcement officer,” Weiss stated, “it is hard to draw any conclusion other than it is an attack against the American way of life. Many times the men or women in uniform represents the face of our government, since an interaction with a law enforcement officer may be the extent of most citizen’s direct contact with government during their lifetime. ” In addition to gunfire, 12 officers were killed by vehicular assault, one officer was stabbed, and three were killed in other types of assaults. Officers gave their lives in service to the public in 34 of our 50 states. Additionally, law enforcement officers with the federal government, Indian tribal police, and the U. S. territory of Puerto Rico also lost their lives while serving their departments. Texas led the nation with the deaths of 19 police officers. California was a distant second with 11 officers being killed. Each of the other states were listed with single digit numbers of officers killed while on duty. Vehicle accidents and a heart attack took the lives of three U. S. Border Patrol agents. This was the second year in a row that Texas peace officers led the nation in line of duty deaths. Automobile accidents were the second leading cause of death for law enforcement officers across the country. Automobile accidents accounted for 23 deaths while motorcycle accidents added seven more. Four officers were killed during pursuits with suspects and twelve officers were killed after being struck by automobiles alongside the roadway. One officer was killed in an aircraft crash and one was struck by a train. Other causes of death included drownings (2) animal related (1)   illness (1) falling (1) accidental gunfire (2) heart attack (6) and illness related to   (3). Of the 140 deaths recorded, 134 were men and 6 were women. In addition to the 140 human officers killed in the line of duty, 34 K9 officers also lost their lives in the line of duty. Heat exhaustion led the causes of death with 12 K9 officers being killed by heat related issues. An additional ten K9 officers were killed by hostile gunfire and two K9s were killed by accidental gunfire. Weiss said these numbers are about more than statistics. “Each of those deaths represents the loss of a person that dedicated their life to service, to the pursuit of justice, and to keeping their community safe,” he said. “The loss of an officer is something that effects an entire family, many time for generations.  Spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings and extended family are all impacted.  And the impact many times can have a profound effect on the community the officer served. ” “Thankfully, the law enforcement community is brotherhood like no other and those LOD families, like their loved ones, are never forgotten,” Weiss concluded. “They are supported by their agency and their communities for a lifetime.  Agencies and charities ensure their children are able to afford   that families can stay in their homes and that children that lost a parent always have a father or mother figure to speak with and be there for them when they need it. ” Author’s note: All statistics in this article were compiled from the Officer Down Memorial Page.

25605,Trump Institute Offered Get-Rich Schemes With Plagiarized Lessons - The New York Times,"In 2005, as he was making a transition from developing real estate to capitalizing on his fame through ventures like a reality show and   deals, Donald J. Trump hit upon a   strategy for entering the field of   education. He poured his own money into Trump University, which began as a   business advising customers on how to make money in real estate, but left a long trail of customers alleging they were defrauded. Their lawsuits have cast a shadow over Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. But Mr. Trump also lent his name, and his credibility, to a seminar business he did not own, which was branded the Trump Institute. Its operators rented out hotel ballrooms across the country and invited people to pay up to $2, 000 to come hear Mr. Trump’s “  secrets and strategies. ” And its customers had ample reason to ask whether they, too, had been deceived. As with Trump University, the Trump Institute promised falsely that its teachers would be handpicked by Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump did little, interviews show, besides appear in an infomercial  —   one that promised customers access to his vast accumulated knowledge. “I put all of my concepts that have worked so well for me, new and old, into our seminar,” he said in the 2005 video, adding, “I’m teaching what I’ve learned. ” Reality fell far short. In fact, the institute was run by a couple who had run afoul of regulators in dozens of states and had been dogged by accusations of deceptive business practices and fraud for decades. Similar complaints soon emerged about the Trump Institute. Yet there was an even more fundamental deceit to the business, unreported until now: Extensive portions of the materials that students received after paying their seminar fees, supposedly containing Mr. Trump’s special wisdom, had been plagiarized from an obscure real estate manual published a decade earlier. Together, the exaggerated claims about his own role, the checkered pasts of the people with whom he went into business and the theft of intellectual property at the venture’s heart all illustrate the fiction underpinning so many of Mr. Trump’s licensing businesses: Putting his name on products and services  —   and collecting fees  —   was often where his actual involvement began and ended. “That Trump Institute, what criminals they are,” said Carol Minto of West Haven, Conn. a retired court reporter who attended one seminar in 2009 and agreed to spend $1, 997. 94 to attend another before having second thoughts. She wound up requiring the help of two states’ attorneys general in getting a refund. “They wanted to steal my money,” she said. The institute was another example of the Trump brand’s being accused of luring vulnerable customers with false promises of profit and success. Others, besides Trump University, include multilevel marketing ventures that sold vitamins and telecommunications services, and a vanity publisher that faced hundreds of consumer complaints. Mr. Trump’s infomercial performance suggested he was closely overseeing the Trump Institute. “People are loving it,” he said in the program, titled “The Donald Trump Way to Wealth” and staged like a talk show in front of a wildly enthusiastic audience. “People are really doing well with it, and they’re loving it. ” His name, picture and aphorisms like “I am the American Dream, supersized version” were all over the course materials. Yet while he owned 93 percent of Trump University, the Trump Institute was owned and operated by Irene and Mike Milin, a couple who had been marketing    courses since the 1980s. A Trump executive, Michael Sexton, told The Sacramento Bee in 2006 that there was a simple reason for going into business with the Milins: Their company was “the best in the business. ” Yet the Milins’ reputation was actually pockmarked with lawsuits and regulatory actions  —   a dismal track record that Mr. Trump and his aides could have unearthed with a modicum of due diligence. The Milins were known for running   ads that screamed “FREE MONEY!” and offered tutorials on how to obtain government grants and loans. They were also notorious for being frequent targets of state regulators. In 1993, the Texas attorney general accused their company, then called Information Seminars International, of taking customers’ money and running. People who bought a $499 “Milin Method” package were promised financing to resell real estate purchased at government auctions, officials said, but when customers sought to follow up with the company, the Milins had vanished. In 2001, operating as National Grants Conference, the Milins settled with Florida authorities after being accused of violating the state’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. And in 2006, the Vermont attorney general sued the Milins for consumer fraud, ultimately fining them $65, 000 and allowing customers to seek more than $325, 000 in refunds. The regulatory woes continued after the Milins rebranded their seminar business with the name of the country’s   real estate developer: In 2007, 33 state attorneys general signed a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the Milins of deceptive trade practices. A year later, their company sought bankruptcy protection, owing $2. 1 million to creditors. The venture continued for a few years. Alan Garten, Mr. Trump’s   counsel, said that executives were unaware of the Milins’ history when their business relationship began but that he could not recall when they became aware of the couple’s   with regulators. Operating as the Trump Institute, the Milins pursued familiar tactics  —   and attracted familiar complaints, eventually earning an F from the Better Business Bureau. Seminar attendees who later sought assistance from supposed experts over a Trump Institute   phone line complained of being told to ignore what they had been taught in the seminars because it was outdated or useless advice. “The ‘advisers’ refused to listen to us when we referred to the methods taught in the seminars,” Fred and Zofia Besel, a retired couple from New York, wrote in 2009, seeking a refund in a letter that wound up with the Florida attorney general’s office. Unbeknownst to customers at the time, though, even the printed materials handed out to seminar attendees were based on a lie. The Trump Institute copyrighted its publication, each page emblazoned with “Billionaire’s Road Map to Success,” and it distributed the materials to those who attended the seminars. Yet much of the handbook’s contents were lifted without attribution from an obscure   guide published by Success magazine in 1995 called “Real Estate Mastery System. ” At least 20 pages of the Trump Institute book were copied entirely or in large part from “Real Estate Mastery System. ” Even some of its hypothetical scenarios  —   “Seller A is asking $80, 000 for a   residence”  —   were repeated verbatim. Asked about the plagiarism, which was discovered by the Democratic “super PAC” American Bridge, the editor of the Trump Institute publication, Susan G. Parker, denied responsibility and suggested that a lawyer for the Milins, who provided her with background material for the book, might have been to blame. The lawyer, Peter Hoppenfeld, who no longer represents the Milins, said Ms. Parker was most likely at fault but acknowledged forwarding her information from the Milins’ office. Reached at her home in Boca Raton, Fla. Irene Milin told a reporter, “I’m very busy,” and hung up. She did not answer subsequent calls or respond to a voice mail message. Mr. Garten said Mr. Trump was “obviously” not aware of the plagiarism. But even while playing down Mr. Trump’s link to the Trump Institute, calling it a “  licensing deal,” Mr. Garten expressed pride in the venture. “I stand by the curriculum that was taught at both Trump University and Trump Institute,” he said. Ms. Parker, a lawyer and legal writer in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. said that far from being handpicked by Mr. Trump, she had been hired to write the book after responding to a Craigslist ad. She said she never spoke to Mr. Trump, let alone received guidance from him on what to write. She said she drew on her own knowledge of real estate and a   of Mr. Trump’s books. Ms. Parker said she did venture to one of the Trump Institute seminars  —   and was appalled: The speakers came off like   salesmen, she said, and their advice was nothing but banalities. “It was like I was in sleaze America,” she said. “It was all smoke and mirrors. ”",1
25606,EXCLUSIVE – Islamic State Supporters Following Coptic Bus Attack: ‘Christians Will Not Have Security’,"TEL AVIV  —   Writing in an encrypted chat room, Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated the deadly terrorist attack against a bus of Coptic Christian pilgrims in Egypt on Friday, and warned that Christians in the country should expect more such attacks. [Breitbart Jerusalem obtained access to correspondence posted in a closed chat group that utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service. The group serves as an internal Twitter of sorts for IS jihadists and sympathizers, and has been used in the past to issue IS communications.  The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in which 29 Christian civilians were murdered by gunmen claiming to be security forces as the pilgrims were reportedly on their way to volunteer at a monastery. “A security team of caliphate soldiers set up an ambush for dozens of Christians as they headed to the church of St. Samuel,” IS announced on Saturday through Amaq, the terrorist group’s media and propaganda arm. The attack horrified Egypt and the Western world, but IS members and supporters on the Telegram network viewed the carnage as heroic and vowed to continue targeting Christians. Talha Alanssari wrote in the Telegram conversation, “May your jihad be blessed you are sons of the Islamic State. Bless the pure hands that struck the strongholds of the Christians and the infidels. Thank Allah who made our hearts happy with the heroic attack of the nation of Caliphs against the Christians in Egypt who should expect more attacks. The same Christians will not have the luxury of security and they will pay   …     the taxes of the Jizya with the help of Allah” Jizya is a tax levied on   living in an Islamic state. Oubaida Alsinawi joined the conversation, saying, “Thanks to Allah before and thanks to Allah after. He’s the one who made a success of this attack of our brothers in the military arena who left to commit suicide but returned safely, thank Allah alone. Thank Allah who allowed our brothers to hunt these Christians as the hunter hunts his prey. The soldiers of the Islamic State will continue in an   campaign with these Christians and traitorous Muslims in the Egyptian army and the tribes that help them in Sinai. I swear to Allah that our brothers in the field are demonstrating creativity as they reach these Christians and infidels and all those who help them. The attacks that have yet to come will be much harder with the help of Allah. ” Hamza Alraqawi wrote, “May your jihad be blessed, you the Mujahedeen of the Islamic State in Egypt. You warmed our hearts as our Mujahedeen brothers did who struck in England, Belgium, France, America and Russia. We say to you, continue with the blessing of Allah and increase your attacks and don’t allow them to continue harming the oppressed on the Earth. Here in Raqqa we are fighting fiercely on the outskirts of the city and we won’t let the infidels and traitors enter. Our bodies are explosives meant to kill them and lead them to hell. ” A Telegram user who goes by the name “The Sheikh of the Caliphate” wrote, “Thanks to Allah before and thanks to Allah after for strengthening the Mujahedeen and guiding their hands in their campaigns and attacks. The blessed attack against Christians in Egypt had a special importance for the Mujahedeen, especially after the suicide attack committed in their idol churches. The war against the Christians is no less important than the war against the Shi’ites and against the infidels. They must clearly understand that the abduction and killing of Muslim men and women in Egypt’s streets will not pass without punishment and they must wait for more painful things with the help of Allah. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

25607,Austria Rejects Far-Right Presidential Candidate Norbert Hofer - The New York Times,"VIENNA  —   In rejecting a   candidate for president on Sunday, voters in Austria showed the limitations of   Donald J. Trump’s tailwinds on a continent where extremist politics have traditionally brought cataclysm. Call it the other Trump effect, one that may sow caution among some European voters suspicious of the advances of populist politicians. Populist forces have unsettled politics in Europe and the United States, frequently by using fake news and fanning fears of globalization and migration. The British vote to leave the European Union this year was complicated by such anxieties. The rejection of constitutional changes in Italy on Sunday hinged on a variety of issues. But the choice before Austrians was perhaps the starkest. The bitter yearlong campaign for the presidency pitted Norbert Hofer, a leader of the   Freedom Party, founded in the 1950s by former Nazis, against a      former Green Party leader, Alexander Van der Bellen. This was a   political choice, and Mr. Van der Bellen’s decisive victory  —   by 6. 6 percentage points with 99 percent of votes counted  —   left his supporters predictably jubilant, if surprised. In recent days, they had seemed resigned to fearing that Mr. Trump’s victory, in particular, was tilting the outcome here against them. “It is unbelievable,” said Wolfgang Petritsch, a veteran diplomat, a biographer of the former Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and the chairman of Austria’s Marshall Plan foundation. “Austria saves the world!” he said with a twist of irony. Austria is too small a sample to know whether the populist tide is abating. Europe still faces pivotal elections next year in France and Germany, as well as the possibility of a snap election in Italy. Those races will define politics in the European Union for the remainder of the decade. But Austria does seem to disprove the idea that Mr. Trump’s victory accelerated a broader public acceptance of populist,   forces. In recent days, many in Austria had seemed resigned to the likelihood of a Trump bounce for the far right. Mr. Hofer himself said in an interview last month that the American election had bolstered support for his Freedom Party. Yet it was not the case. “People followed Trump with curiosity, shock, fear, jubilation, but I don’t think they drew any conclusions,” Johannes Hübner, a Freedom Party parliamentary deputy, said on Sunday night. “It’s like a Hollywood movie. ” Perhaps the message Austrians received, he said, was “beware of another Trump  —   don’t vote for Hofer. ” Mr. Van der Bellen, who exudes a calm in public, campaigned as a sort of   reveling in corny, retail politicking. In an interview in September, he noted that he had been teased for donning traditional Austrian jackets and attending the numerous village fetes and festivals that are the essence of rural life here. Especially, he said, when “it emerges that I like doing this. ” He also suggested then that the intensity of the campaign had led to a broad politicization across Austria, where the voting age is 16. He said Britain’s “tragic” vote to leave the European Union had made people think twice about Austria’s imitating any such move. Mr. Hofer’s party is more skeptical of Europe, but he had stopped well short of calling for Austria to leave the European Union. The country, which straddles the heart of Europe from Italy and Switzerland to Hungary and Slovakia, depends heavily on tourism and exports for its comfortable living standards. A choice to be the first country in postwar Europe to elect a   leader for president could have jeopardized that standing. The vote was widely watched across Europe as a measure of how high fringe parties could climb in mainstream politics, turning what is normally a sleepy contest for a largely ceremonial post into a measure of the populist wave that has advanced on both sides of the Atlantic.   and   forces have already ridden a populist path to power in Hungary and Poland and have gained strength in France and even Germany. Mr. Van der Bellen had appealed to Austrians to vote for reason over extremes. Mr. Hofer campaigned on an “Austria First” slogan, and said he wanted to lead a country that was secure “for our children and grandchildren,” playing on fears of the tide of migrants that have entered Europe. Mr. Hofer’s failure is likely to reverberate around Europe, where the far right has made inroads from Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France to the   Alternative for Germany party, both of which have begun eating into support for mainstream conservatives. Establishment politicians are likely to breathe a sigh of relief and interpret the result as a sign that fringe parties still face what many in Europe have long considered a   barrier to broader support because of historical associations with fascism. One person who may thank the Austrians, with whom she has tussled over immigration, is Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Austria’s rejection of the   wave comes as Ms. Merkel heads this week into a congress of her conservative party, at which she will be anointed its candidate for a fourth term in elections next year. Ms. Merkel issued no immediate reaction to the Austrian vote, but her vice chancellor, the Social Democratic leader Sigmar Gabriel, called it “a victory for reason. ” Still, Mr. Hofer made the biggest advances of any populist in Europe, racking up almost 50 percent of the vote when he lost a presidential runoff by just 31, 000 votes. His party contested the slim defeat, and Austria’s highest court ordered a rerun on procedural grounds. That was then postponed to Sunday, from October, after absentee ballots were found to have faulty glue. Despite the   process, voter interest and emotions ran high. The presidential contest was the   since 1986, when Austrians elected Kurt Waldheim, a former United Nations secretary general, despite revelations that he had concealed his service in Hitler’s armed forces close to the sites of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans during World War II. An array of establishment figures lined up behind Mr. Van der Bellen, but Mr. Hofer garnered some support from mainstream conservatives in the People’s Party, which declined to back the former Green leader. Mr. Petritsch and other political veterans said the length of the campaign worked in Mr. Van der Bellen’s favor. He was the clear favorite of voters in Vienna and other cities, and apparently was able to reach into rural areas where Mr. Hofer won in May but performed less strongly Sunday. “He built a broad coalition,” said Alexandra   the editor in chief of the liberal daily Der Standard. Now, she said, Austrians will expect Mr. Van der Bellen to mend the rifts that appeared during the bitter campaign. After early projections showed him clearly lagging, Mr. Hofer, 45, quickly conceded on Facebook, asking “all Austrians to stick together and to work together. ” “Dear friends,” Mr. Hofer wrote, “you supported me so well and I am infinitely sad that it did not work out. ”",1
25608,How Deep Will Trump’s Truths Go?,"How Deep Will Trump’s Truths Go?   
Donald Trump will often be mocked in the coming months as the anti-elitist, anti-establishment disruptor of politics who wants to lower taxes on the elite and who is not above hiring establishment figures such as Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for his team. The mockery will mostly be misplaced simply because the terms “elite” and “establishment” are understood too broadly: Trump’s movement was only against certain forms of establishment elitism which have nothing to do with wealth, membership in a party hierarchy or even political experience. -Bloomberg 
In this editorial we learn that Trump voters were against America’s intelligentsia. These are the people who occupy the bureaucratic rungs in Washington and the tenured chairs in top universities. 
These are the people as well that cluster in New York, Los Angeles and Washington. They move back and forth between corporations and “public service.” 
These are the folks that set the tone for the cultural attacks that are ruining the United States. These people, as well, constitute the ranks of globalists. Much of what they want for America is intended to destroy it. 
More: 
When Trump supporters think about the “elite” or the “establishment” what they really mean is America’s intelligentsia. 
… Collectively, they — we — were seen as an entrenched, closed, arrogant group that sees fit to tell people what to say and think. 
… This is the same understanding of “elite” and “establishment” that informed Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged”: The Trumpists share Rand’s exasperation with teachers, writers and bureaucrats and their fake recipes for social justice, as well as her admiration for the rough but creative doers, the titans of business. 
Of course this is nonsense, and in fact these perceptions are exactly what’s wrong with Rand. 
She saw the world as a place where “doers” were hemmed in and pulled down by their inferiors. 
But today’s world is not like that. In fact, one can make a case that the industrial revolution – filled with doers – eradicated an independent peasantry whose lives were a good deal freer than ours today. 
The problem with the modern world is simple. It is in the grip of a great conspiracy, the likes of which have probably never occurred on this scale in human history. 
The conspiracy is apparently run by a few people who have inherited control central banking around the world and thus are worth trillions. 
With this money they have created an almost seamless web of propaganda intended to frighten people and drive them into the arms of international government. 
The goal is a single world order with one justice system, one central bank, one currency, one civil police force, etc. 
This Bloomberg article is focused not on the top people in this conspiracy but on the “little people” who do the bidding of higher ups and have learned how to survive in an internationalist environment and profit from it. 
But in our view, these are probably NOT the people that Trump’s voters really voted against. Many of Trump’s voters, like Trump himself, understand that the problems go far beyond academics, bureaucrats and corrupt tycoons. 
In fact, this Bloomberg article is a perfect example of a kind of elite propaganda. It is trying to convince us that we need to “listen” to the anger of Trump voters and then, we are instructed, the intelligentsia needs to react. 
American intellectuals may violently disagree with the average Trump voter on most things. They may have access to facts that prove that voters wrong. But there’s no way they — we — can go on dismissing and ridiculing these people without dooming themselves to irrelevance and provoking further backlash. 
This is in fact the fondest hope, no doubt, of those tasked with defending the REAL culprits from exposure and attack. Such individuals are the ones running the world’s largest corporations and leading the most powerful nation states. 
And these individuals may be found in higher places still, plotting the propaganda that the rest of us imbibe. Also managing central bank strategies and even plotting our gradual progress toward a new world war. 
The Bloomberg article ends by suggesting that a lot of the irritation of Trump voters is aimed at political correctness and that the US needs “an open conversation about what ails it, not … one that tiptoes around speech taboos about racism, misogyny and sexual discrimination.” 
Once more – hooey. Our guess is that like Donald Trump himself, many of his voters – perhaps tens of millions are quite aware that the world’s problems extend far beyond political correctness and “intellectuals.” 
Of course we’ll have to wait and see. But Trump called InfoWars to thank them for their support, and InfoWars, for all its controversy, has provided a good deal of reality about the way the world works. 
If Trump intends to educate people about the real “conspiracy” – a banking conspiracy located, to begin with, in London’s City – then fairly powerful truths will need to be spoken. 
It is quite likely these truths, once uttered, will find a sympathetic audience with many of Trump’s supporters. This isn’t what Bloomberg is hoping for, however. Bloomberg, as this editorial shows, wants a conversation focused on debunking political correctness and bringing America’s – and the West’s – intelligentsia to heel. 
Conclusion: Will Trump’s victory provide us with larger truths, or will the conversation be bogged down and trivialized? This is an important question. We can see the answer Bloomberg hopes for. We hope for something more fundamental.",1
25610,"$12 Million Iranian Embassy Is Empty, but the U.S. Cuts the Grass - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The $12 million compound, once a playground for the Iranian ambassador and guests like Elizabeth Taylor, Andy Warhol and Richard M. Nixon, now sits empty on Washington’s Embassy Row. The   Upper East Side townhouse that served as a consulate was long ago repurposed as the headquarters of a dealer of old master paintings. And the   Bethesda, Md. ranch house for Iranian diplomats is now the home of a family of five. The properties, and seven others across the United States assessed altogether at more than $50 million, still belong to the Islamic Republic of Iran. But for nearly 40 years, the task of maintaining and putting the properties out for rent has fallen to an unlikely management company  —   the State Department. The arrangement is one of the stranger consequences of the diplomatic freeze between United States and Iran, two former allies that cut official ties after Iranian revolutionaries took 52 Americans hostage in the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979. Although much has changed since the nuclear deal last year, when Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, experts say Iran and the United States are still years away from   diplomatic relations. As a result, Iran’s properties in the United States remain in limbo, with little prospect of change. “There’s more dialogue between the United States and Iran, but the acrimony hasn’t ceased,” said Karim Sadjadpour, who studies Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. At the top of the list of Iranian government property is the compound that was Iran’s embassy in Washington, the site of lavish parties in the 1970s given by Ardeshir Zahedi, the ambassador who was once married to the daughter of the shah of Iran. “My heart is still a part of it,” Mr. Zahedi said in an interview from Montreux, Switzerland, referring to the embassy designed at his behest in the 1960s by American and Iranian architects as a fusion of Persian and modernist styles. “It’s like a baby for me. Day and night I was fighting to get the budget and have it done. And it was a pride. ” The State Department’s Office of Foreign Missions, adhering to guidelines in the 1961 Vienna Convention that govern relations between nations even if they sever diplomatic ties, acts as a real estate service for the Iranian properties. The office coordinates upkeep, security and landscaping, including cutting the grass, and hires local real estate firms to list some of them for rent. (Six of the 10 are currently rented.) Sam Werberg, a State Department spokesman, said the office tried to rent the properties at market rates and used the proceeds to pay for upkeep and other associated costs. “They are in touch with real estate brokers just like everybody else, I guess,” said Wolfgang H. Ludwigs, a real estate agent in Potomac, Md. who said he was approached unexpectedly by the State Department to list a property in Bethesda. At least eight of the 10 properties are worth more than $1 million, according to tax assessments, and would most likely be worth more on the open market. Even if it wanted to, it is unclear if Iran could sell the properties unless it reached a diplomatic agreement with the United States. Next door to the former Iranian Embassy is a   Georgian Revival home, assessed at almost $10 million and currently empty, where Mr. Zahedi lived and where overnight guests stayed. A similar building around the corner, formerly the offices of Iran’s military and educational attachés, has been rented out to the Romanian ambassador since the 1990s for an undisclosed sum. Several miles away in Bethesda, Md. a German family of five occupies a former diplomatic residence, complete with a pool and two bars for entertaining. A local real estate agent last listed the property for rent in 2015 for $5, 500 a month. “It is a funny feeling being in this house,” said Julian Koelsch, whose parents rent the property. “It has a very different feeling than normal American houses. ” Richard L. Feigen and Company, a   gallery specializing in old master paintings and European modernists, has made its headquarters since 2002 in the former Iranian consulate in New York, on 69th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. Mr. Feigen, like several other renters, declined to comment on his lease for fear of angering his landlord. In Houston, a newer home with six columns out front stands as a relic of the days when oil and energy interests made allies of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf Coast. In San Francisco, an    home, estimated to be worth more than $10 million, sits just blocks from the Presidio, at the heart of a region Mr. Zahedi said was once dotted with thousands of Iranian students and other civilians. In Washington, the former embassy has been rented out in the past for weddings and other special events, but today blinds cover its windows and plaster peels from some of its walls. Mr. Zahedi, who served Iranian caviar and Dom Pérignon at parties costing tens of thousands of dollars, said the events he once held there built up his relationships in Washington. “These things bring people together,” he said. Mr. Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment said the Iranian Embassy in Washington  —   and the other properties around the country  —   served as a symbol of Iran’s outsize role in American foreign relations in the 1960s and 1970s. “Zahedi and his predecessors were very close to America’s elite politicians and bankers and entertainment stars,” he said. But after 1979, “it went from Iran having enormous influence in Washington to the polar opposite. ” David G. Bradley, the owner of Atlantic Media who has a home around the corner from the former embassy, said that the Iranians had been gone so long that, in his neighborhood, the time can almost be measured in life cycles. “It is a measure of how bad relations have been that the child I watched biking with training wheels around the embassy grounds is now 27 and living abroad,” Mr. Bradley said, referring to his son. “It’s been a long, long time. ” Still, Mr. Zahedi said he held out hope that the two nations could reconcile. A painting of the embassy hangs in his Swiss home, a personal reminder, he said, of what the cooperation of the two nations can achieve. “Yes, it is sad,” he said. “I hope that soon it will change, because I see the light at what I would call the end of the tunnel. Revenge is a horrible thing. To forgive is a beautiful thing. ”",1
25613,"C.I.A. Arms for Syrian Rebels Supplied Black Market, Officials Say - The New York Times","AMMAN, Jordan  —   Weapons shipped into Jordan by the Central Intelligence Agency and Saudi Arabia intended for Syrian rebels have been systematically stolen by Jordanian intelligence operatives and sold to arms merchants on the black market, according to American and Jordanian officials. Some of the stolen weapons were used in a shooting in November that killed two Americans and three others at a police training facility in Amman, F. B. I. officials believe after months of investigating the attack, according to people familiar with the investigation. The existence of the weapons theft, which ended only months ago after complaints by the American and Saudi governments, is being reported for the first time after a joint investigation by The New York Times and Al Jazeera. The theft, involving millions of dollars of weapons, highlights the messy, unplanned consequences of programs to arm and train rebels  —   the kind of program the C. I. A. and Pentagon have conducted for decades  —   even after the Obama administration had hoped to keep the training program in Jordan under tight control. The Jordanian officers who were part of the scheme reaped a windfall from the weapons sales, using the money to buy expensive SUVs, iPhones and other luxury items, Jordanian officials said. The theft and resale of the arms  —   including Kalashnikov assault rifles, mortars and   grenades  —   have led to a flood of new weapons available on the black arms market. Investigators do not know what became of most of them, but a disparate collection of groups, including criminal networks and rural Jordanian tribes, use the arms bazaars to build their arsenals. Weapons smugglers also buy weapons in the arms bazaars to ship outside the country. The F. B. I. investigation into the Amman shooting, run by the bureau’s Washington field office, is continuing. But American and Jordanian officials said the investigators believed that the weapons a Jordanian police captain, Anwar Abu Zaid, used to gun down two American contractors, two Jordanians and one South African had originally arrived in Jordan intended for the Syrian   program. The officials said this finding had come from tracing the serial numbers of the weapons. Mohammad H.   Jordan’s minister of state for media affairs, said allegations that Jordanian intelligence officers had been involved in any weapons thefts were “absolutely incorrect. ” “Weapons of our security institutions are concretely tracked, with the highest discipline,” he said. He called the powerful Jordanian intelligence service, known as the General Intelligence Directorate, or G. I. D. “a   reputable institution known for its professional conduct and high degree of cooperation among security agencies. ” In Jordan, the head of the G. I. D. is considered the second most important man after the king. Representatives of the C. I. A. and F. B. I. declined to comment. The State Department did not address the allegations directly, but a spokesman said America’s relationship with Jordan remained solid. “The United States deeply values the long history of cooperation and friendship with Jordan,” said John Kirby, the spokesman. “We are committed to the security of Jordan and to partnering closely with Jordan to meet common security challenges. ” The training program, which in 2013 began directly arming the rebels under the code name Timber Sycamore, is run by the C. I. A. and several Arab intelligence services and aimed at building up forces opposing President Bashar   of Syria. The United States and Saudi Arabia are the biggest contributors, with the Saudis contributing both weapons and large sums of money, and with C. I. A. paramilitary operatives taking the lead in training the rebels to use Kalashnikovs, mortars, antitank guided missiles and other weapons. The existence of the program is classified, as are all details about its budget. American officials say that the C. I. A. has trained thousands of rebels in the past three years, and that the fighters made substantial advances on the battlefield against Syrian government forces until Russian military forces  —   launched last year in support of Mr. Assad  —   compelled them to retreat. The training program is based in Jordan because of the country’s proximity to the Syrian battlefields. From the beginning, the C. I. A. and the Arab intelligence agencies relied on Jordanian security services to transport the weapons, many bought in bulk in the Balkans and elsewhere around Eastern Europe. The program is separate from one that the Pentagon set up to train rebels to combat Islamic State fighters, rather than the Syrian military. That program was shut down after it managed to train only a handful of Syrian rebels. Jordanian and American officials described the weapons theft and subsequent investigation on the condition of anonymity because the Syrian rebel training is classified in the United States and is a government secret in Jordan. News of the weapons theft and eventual crackdown has been circulating inside Jordan’s government for several months. Husam Abdallat, a senior aide to several past Jordanian prime ministers, said he had heard about the scheme from current Jordanian officials. The G. I. D. has some corrupt officers in its ranks, Mr. Abdallat said, but added that the institution as a whole is not corrupt. “The majority of its officers are patriotic and proud Jordanians who are the country’s first line of defense,” he said. Jordanian officials who described the operation said it had been run by a group of G. I. D. logistics officers with direct access to the weapons once they reached Jordan. The officers regularly siphoned truckloads of the weapons from the stocks, before delivering the rest of the weapons to designated   points. Then the officers sold the weapons at several large arms markets in Jordan. The main arms bazaars in Jordan are in Ma’an, in the southern part of the country in Sahab, outside Amman and in the Jordan Valley. It is unclear whether the current head of the G. I. D. Gen. Faisal   had knowledge of the theft of the C. I. A. and Saudi weapons. But several Jordanian intelligence officials said senior officers inside the service had knowledge of the weapons scheme and provided cover for the   officers. Word that the weapons intended for the rebels were being bought and sold on the black market leaked into Jordan government circles last year, when arms dealers began bragging to their customers that they had large stocks of   and   weapons. Jordanian intelligence operatives monitoring the arms market  —   operatives not involved in the   scheme  —   began sending reports to headquarters about a proliferation of weapons in the market and of the boasts of the arms dealers. After the Americans and Saudis complained about the theft, investigators at the G. I. D. arrested several dozen officers involved in the scheme, among them a lieutenant colonel running the operation. They were ultimately released from detention and fired from the service, but were allowed to keep their pensions and money they gained from the scheme, according to Jordanian officials. Jordan’s decision to host the C. I. A.  training program is the latest episode in a long partnership. Beginning in the Eisenhower administration, the C. I. A. made large payments to King Hussein, who ruled Jordan from 1952 until his death in 1999, in exchange for permission to run numerous intelligence operations on Jordanian soil. C. I. A. money and expertise also helped the king establish the G. I. D. and put down internal and external threats to his government. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the United States has flooded Jordan with money for various counterterrorism programs. American and Jordanian spies have run a joint counterterrorism center outside Amman, and a secret prison in Jordan housed prisoners the C. I. A. captured in the region. In his 2006 book, “State of Denial,” the journalist Bob Woodward recounted a 2003 conversation in which George J. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, told Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, “We created the Jordanian intelligence service, and now we own it. ” It is a relationship of mutual dependence, but Jordan has particular leverage because of its location in the heart of the Middle East and its general tolerance to be used as a base of American military and intelligence operations. Jordan’s security services also have a long history of trying to infiltrate Islamic militant groups, efforts that have yielded both success and failure. In 2009, a Jordanian doctor  —   brought to the C. I. A. by a G. I. D. officer after the doctor said he had penetrated Al Qaeda’s leadership  —   turned out to be a double agent and blew himself up at a remote base in Afghanistan. Seven C. I. A. employees, as well as the G. I. D. officer, were killed in the attack. Two recent heads of the service, also known as the Mukhabarat, have been sent to prison on charges including embezzlement, money laundering and bank fraud. One of them, Gen. Samih Battikhi, ran the G. I. D. from 1995 to 2000 and was convicted of being part of a scheme to obtain bank loans of around $600 million for fake government contracts and pocketing about $25 million. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, but the sentence was eventually reduced to four years that were served in his villa in the seaside town of Aqaba. Gen. Mohammad   who ran the service from 2005 to 2008, was later convicted of stealing millions of dollars that G. I. D. officers had seized from Iraqi citizens crossing into Jordan in the years after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. His trial showed that he had also arranged for money to be smuggled in private cars from Iraq into Jordan and had been involved in sellingJordanian citizenship to Iraqi businessmen. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison and fined tens of millions of dollars. President Obama authorized the covert arming program in April 2013, after more than a year of debate inside the administration about the wisdom of using the C. I. A. to train rebels trying to oust Mr. Assad. The decision was made in part to try to gain control of a chaotic situation in which Arab countries were funneling arms into Syria for various rebel groups with little coordination. The Qataris had paid to smuggle shipments of       weapons over the border from Turkey, and Saudi Arabia sent thousands of Kalashnikovs and millions of rounds of ammunition it had bought, sometimes with the C. I. A. ’s help. By late 2013, the C. I. A. was working directly with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations to arm and train small groups of rebels and send them across the border into Syria. The specific motives behind the November shooting at the Amman police training facility remain uncertain, and it is unclear when the F. B. I. will officially conclude its investigation. This year, the widows of the Americans killed in the attack sued Twitter, alleging that it knowingly permitted the Islamic State to use its social media platform to spread the militant group’s violent message, recruiting and raising funds. Captain Abu Zaid, the gunman, was killed almost immediately. His brother, Fadi Abu Zaid, said in an interview that he still believed his brother was innocent and that he had given no indications he was planning to carry out the shooting. The Jordanian government, he said, has denied him any answers about the shooting, and has refused to release his brother’s autopsy report.",1
25614,BOMBSHELL: Declassified Documents Reveal Why U.S. Ignored Saudi 9/11 Ties,"BOMBSHELL: Declassified Documents Reveal Why U.S. Ignored Saudi 9/11 Ties 
At long last, the so-called ‘missing’ 28 pages from the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, have been released, albeit in redacted form. 
While obviously critical information has been obscured from the general public, the evidence remaining appears to show the hijackers and their associates received and had been receiving funds from individuals working for the government of Saudi Arabia—as has long been rumored and intimated. 
The redacted report also keenly criticizes failures in communication between the FBI and CIA, which its authors suggest could have been a crucial intelligence breakdown prior to the attacks. 
According to the report, with all emphasis added: 
“[T]he committees are particularly concerned about the serious nature of allegations contained in a CIA memorandum found by the Joint Inquiry Staff in the files of the FBI’s San Diego Field Office. That memorandum, which discusses alleged financial connections between the September 11 hijackers, Saudi government officials, and members of the Saudi royal family, was drafted by a CIA officer [REDACTED], relying primarily on information from FBI files. The CIA officer sent it to the CTC to determine whether CIA had additional information. He also provided a copy to the FBI agent responsible for the investigation of one of the individuals discussed in the memorandum. Despite the clear national implications of the CIA memorandum, the FBI agent included the memorandum in an individual case file and did not forward it to FBI headquarters. FBI headquarters, therefore, was unaware of statements in the memorandum until the Joint Inquiry brought the memorandum’s implications to the Bureau’s attention [FULLY REDACTED SENTENCE CONCLUDING THAT PARAGRAPH].” 
Those connections between the planners of the 9/11 attack and members of the Saudi royal family and Saudi government are fleshed out in many of the remaining pages, despite redaction of many obviously telling points. For instance: 
“While in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, or received support and assistance from, individuals who may be connected with the Saudi government. There is information, from FBI sources, that at least two of those individuals were alleged to be Saudi intelligence officers.” 
Even more damning, a heavily redacted paragraph suggests the reason, prior to 9/11, the FBI did not focus its investigations of possible terrorist ties of “Saudi nationals in the United States was due to Saudi Arabia’s status as an American ‘ally.’” 
Though it appears the Joint Inquiry discovered telling evidence of ties between terrorist actors and the Saudi principals, the report refused to make a definitive statement on the issue due to the limited scope of its investigation. 
However, the report states, “it is possible that these kinds of connections could suggest as indicated in a [REDACTED] dated July 2, 2002, ‘ incontrovertible evidence that there is support for these terrorists within the Saudi government ,’” though that statement is downplayed with a disclaimer there may be legitimate, innocent reasons for those connections. 
Another revelation the Joint Inquiry discovered on examining evidence suggested: 
“One individual who provided assistance to Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mindhar may be connected to the Saudi Government. A second individual who may have been in contact with al-Hazmi and al-Mindhar also has ties to the Saudi government, including connections to the Saudi Ambassador to the United States. There is reporting in FBI files that persons have alleged that both of these individuals may be Saudi intelligence officers.” 
In fact, the hijackers “may have been in contact with other Saudi Government officials in the United States prior to” the attacks, and—perhaps most damning of all— “Saudi Government officials in the United States may have ties to Usama Bin Laden’s terrorist network.” 
One subject, in particular, Omar al-Bayoumi, was found to have “extensive ties to the Saudi Government.” Nevertheless, Congress decided not to pursue those allegations any further. 
Indeed, the report states: 
“Al-Bayoumi had been an accountant at the Saudi Civil Aviation Administration from 1976 to 1993, when he relocated to the United States,” and, further, the FBI found “Al-Bayoumi was in frequent contact with the Emir at the Saudi Ministry of Defense, responsible for air traffic control.” 
Al-Bayoumi also received regular payments from the Ministry of Defense through a Saudi company called “Ercan,” and he contacted Saudi government “establishments” in the U.S. “almost 100 times between January and May of 2000.” 
At a closed hearing in October 2002, the document notes, a former FBI agent in San Diego testified that al-Bayoumi “acted like a Saudi intelligence officer, in my opinion. And if he was involved with the hijackers, which it looks like he was, if he signed leases, if he provided some sort of financing or payment of some sort, then I would say that there’s a clear possibility that there might be a connection between Saudi intelligence and UBL ,” with UBL being the government’s acronym for Usama, or Osama, bin Laden. 
Another former agent in charge in San Diego apparently said he received around six reports from individuals who suspected al-Bayoumi “was a Saudi intelligence officer” —but the FBI ultimately somehow found there was not sufficient evidence to conclude as much. 
Further lending credence to theories the Saudis may have been directly involved in the attacks, the Inquiry noted: 
“In testimony and interviews a number of FBI agents and CIA officers complained to the Joint Inquiry about a lack of Saudi cooperation in terrorism investigations both before and after the September 11 attacks.” 
One agent even said the “Saudis had been useless and obstructionist for years” and will “only act when it is in their self-interest.” 
These 28 pages certainly seem to indicate the U.S. pursued, targeted, and invaded the wrong country in its choice of Afghanistan and Iraq after the September 11 attacks—as has been widely assumed for some time. 
Though no definitive statements are made concerning conclusive proof of Saudi involvement—directly or indirectly—in the planning of 9/11, sufficient information is laid bare to conclude as much. In fact, the evidence calls directly into question exactly why the United States government continues to this day to categorize Saudi Arabia as a ‘trusted ally.’

25616,Allo’s Tryout: 5 Days With Google’s Annoying Office Intern - The New York Times,"You may now have more messaging apps than you have close friends. As of this week, there are six prominent chat apps in the United States  —   or as I see it, one too many. The latest to join the horde is Allo, Google’s highly anticipated messaging app that lets people take advantage of artificial intelligence to chat and make plans. Google began offering the smarter app on Wednesday. Allo is appearing at a time when smartphones are already crowded with chat apps. IMessage from Apple is prominent among iPhone owners. Facebook Messenger is widely used on that social network. Also popular is WhatsApp, the chat service from Facebook that has largely replaced text messaging internationally. Add to the list Slack, a group chat tool that is popular among businesses, and Google Hangouts, which was released in 2013, and you have six. I asked the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who studies the relationship between brain size and social circles, about the overload. His research has found that most people have the mental capacity to sustain 150 meaningful relationships, and among them, only five close ones. “Having more apps than close friends doesn’t help, as something will have to go,” Mr. Dunbar said in an email, though he noted that the various messaging apps serve different purposes. Younger people are shying away from chatting on Facebook, for example, to have more private conversations on apps like WhatsApp. With that backdrop in mind, I tested Allo for five days and compared it with the apps that are most similar to it: Google Hangouts, Apple iMessage and Facebook Messenger. After weighing the pros and cons, my advice is that people can hold off on downloading Allo, largely because its artificially intelligent assistant was unhelpful. But if Allo matures, users will probably want to ditch the Hangouts app. First, some context about Allo. Google announced the app in May, aiming to highlight the company’s push into artificial intelligence. Its older chat app, Hangouts, will remain, but Google will emphasize that product’s use as a videoconferencing and messaging app for businesses. To understand how Allo works, it’s easiest to think of the app’s A. I. assistant as an office intern who is lurking in the background, eager to chime in. The assistant analyzes messages you have typed or dictated and, when appropriate, springs into action with automatically generated phrases you can choose to reply with or suggestions for Google searches that may help accomplish tasks. When you’re having a conversation with another person, for example, the assistant suggests ways it can help. Saying “Want to see a movie tonight?” prompts the assistant to offer a Google search for movie showtimes or to reply with suggestions like “Sure, what time?” or “Not really. ” Here is where Allo became frustrating for me. Asking an assistant to search “movie showtimes tonight” should load a list of movies and corresponding showtimes. Instead, Google’s assistant shows a list of movies without showtimes only after tapping on a film can you ask for times. Sometimes that doesn’t even work. Asking for showtimes for the movie “Snowden” loaded movies playing at a movie theater called UA Snowden Square Stadium 14. Not helpful  —   unless, of course, you live in Columbia, Md. Allo also tries to guess what your written response might be to certain types of phrases, questions or photos. With photos, the app occasionally identifies what’s inside the photo to generate a suggested reaction. So when you receive a photo of a dog, Allo loads responses like “adorable. ” This feature ran into several problems. When I sent a picture to a friend of my cat sitting inside my car, Allo suggested this response to the friend: “What a cute car!” (Sorry, Allo, but my Prius is the opposite of cute.) When I sent photos of my dog to the same friend, Allo’s assistant correctly identified the breed, a Pembroke Welsh corgi. It suggested the reaction “Nice pembroke welsh corgi. ” Impressive, but if someone said that to me in real life, I would add that person to my list of suspected Cylons. For now, Allo’s artificial assistance feels limited. So if I were a manager seeking an assistant, I probably wouldn’t hire Allo. But I would politely tell the candidate to reapply after getting more experience. Each messaging app has its own purpose, but Allo has the most in common with Facebook Messenger, iMessage and Google Hangouts. That’s because all four are capable of adding some personality with stickers and emojis. So I tested Messenger, iMessage and Hangouts against Allo to determine their pros and cons. The highlights: ■ iMessage, Hangouts and Messenger work on mobile devices and computers. Allo works only on Android and iOS mobile devices, though Google plans to expand Allo to computers later. ■ iMessage and Messenger support   apps, adding features like sending money to friends within messages. Google has no plans to support outside apps in Allo. ■ Messenger has more sticker packs than Allo, which has only about 25. ■ Facebook is experimenting with chat bots that you can talk to for shopping or summoning an Uber car. Allo’s assistant was quicker to respond and more natural to communicate with than Facebook’s chat bots. ■ IMessage stickers are more fun to use. In iMessage, stickers can be placed on top of messages and photos  —   add a cartoon mustache to your selfie, for example. On Allo, stickers can be sent only as   messages. ■ The Hangouts app is very much like Allo, without the   assistant. Allo has more entertaining stickers, including a muscular yellow bull that appears to be twerking. The big difference between the two is that the Hangouts app relies primarily on your contacts list linked to a Google Mail account, whereas Allo pulls contacts from your device’s phone book. The upshot: iMessage and Messenger have more features than Allo. There are two major features missing from Allo: the ability to chat using a computer and using   apps and games to do more within messages. With Allo, Google has the opportunity to stand out by offering superior artificial intelligence. Neither Messenger nor Allo has great A. I. yet, but Google’s assistant has a better start. Finally, there is privacy to consider. It’s tough to say how Allo will fare in terms of security until encryption experts take a close look at the app. Here’s what we know so far: By default, Apple’s iMessage service is    encrypted, which means a message is encrypted when it is sent from your device and remains encrypted when it passes through Apple’s server and reaches the recipient. Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger both lack    encryption, so at some point when messages pass through their servers, they can see your messages. Allo has    encryption turned off by default because its server needs to see the messages to work its A. I. magic. However, Allo includes a mode called Incognito with full encryption enabled, which people can use for private conversations, similar to a private mode on a web browser. But, of course, the A. I. features do not work in Incognito. So Allo is a step ahead of Hangouts and Messenger for privacy. But by default (and by design) it is not as secure as iMessage. I recommend waiting for Allo to become available on computers and for its A. I. to become smarter. At the moment, Allo’s assistant will waste more time than it saves when it comes to helping you make plans, and it will probably make conversations more awkward. Google said it was still improving and refining its algorithms, and Allo’s assistant will get better over time. Once Allo’s assistant matures, the Hangouts app will become redundant and you’ll be able to delete it from your device. The catch, of course, is that Allo’s A. I. won’t become sophisticated until more people use it and share feedback. For now, if I really need help, I’m going to request a competent intern.",1
25619,New York Times Outs Israel as Source of Classified Intel Before Trump Visit,"JERUSALEM  —   The rampant leaks concerning President Trump continued full speed ahead on Tuesday, with the New York Times quoting a “current and a former American official” saying it was Israel that provided classified intelligence purportedly disclosed by Trump during a White House meeting last week with Russian officials. [The report comes six days before Trump is due here in Israel for a visit and could potentially impact the U. S. relationship with Israel. Indeed, the second sentence of the Times report states that the information about Israel reportedly serving as the source “adds a potential diplomatic complication to the episode. ”  The Times failed to note its own report, if accurate, could endanger Israel’s antiterrorism intelligence collection operations. Continues the newspaper in the second paragraph of the article: Israel is one of the United States’ most important allies and a major intelligence collector in the Middle East. The revelation that Mr. Trump boasted about some of Israel’s most sensitive information to the Russians could damage the relationship between the two countries. It also raises the possibility that the information could be passed to Iran, Russia’s close ally and Israel’s main threat in the Middle East. However, toward the bottom of the piece, the Times cites Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, as telling reporters that Trump was not aware of the source of the information. Israeli officials reached by the Times would not confirm that Israel provided the intelligence, which reportedly concerns the inner workings of the Islamic State. Israel’s U. S. ambassador, Ron Dermer, affirmed his trust in the U. S.  intelligence sharing relationship. “Israel has full confidence in our   relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump,” Dermer told the Times by email. Yesterday, the Washington Post first reported that Trump allegedly revealed “highly classified information” during a meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, according to “current and former U. S. officials. ” The Post article acknowledged that as president “Trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law. ” McMaster told the Post that “the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation. ” “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly,” McMaster stated. Later, McMaster stated the leak may put U. S. national security at risk. “I think national security is put at risk by this leak and by leaks like this,” he said. “And there are a number of instances where this has occurred and I think it’s important to investigate these sort of things. ” Trump tweeted he has the “absolute right” as president to share information. As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W. H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining  …    .  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017,  The Post claimed the information was provided through an unnamed U. S. ally: The information the president relayed had been provided by a U. S. partner through an   arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U. S. government, officials said. The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. Now the Times has outed that ally as Israel, citing a “current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information. ” In January, Israel’s respected Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported U. S. intelligence officials from the Obama administration warned their Israeli counterparts not to trust then   Trump with intelligence secrets, citing alleged fears that Russia held blackmail information over Trump.  Those fears seemed to have been in part referencing the now partially debunked infamous dossier claiming that Russia collected compromising videos of Trump. The dossier, which contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed, was compiled by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. Meanwhile, the Obama administration faced its share of accusations that it leaked sensitive Israeli intelligence or military operations. In November 2013, Israeli officials were reportedly furious at the Obama White House for confirming the Israeli Air Force was behind a strike on a Syrian military base. Israeli policy is not to confirm strikes carried out beyond its borders. The Times of Israel reported at the time: Israel’s Channel 10 TV on Friday night quoted Israeli officials branding the American leak as “scandalous. ” For Israel’s ally to be acting in this way was “unthinkable,” the officials were quoted as saying. A second TV report, on Israel’s Channel 2, said the leak “came directly from the White House,” and noted that “this is not the first time” that the administration has compromised Israel by leaking information on such Israeli Air Force raids on Syrian targets. It said some previous leaks were believed to have come from the Pentagon, and that consideration had been given at one point to establishing a panel to investigate the sources. In 2012, Israel suspected the Obama administration had leaked information to prevent the Jewish state from striking Iran’s nuclear facilities. ABC News reported at the time: The first report in Foreign Policy quotes anonymous American officials saying that Israel has been given access to airbases by Iran’s northern neighbor Azerbaijan from which Israel could launch air strikes or at least drones and search and rescue aircraft. The second report from Bloomberg, based on a leaked congressional report, said that Iran’s nuclear facilities are so dispersed that it is “unclear what the ultimate effect of a strike would be  …    ” A strike could delay Iran as little as six months, a former official told the researchers. “It seems like a big campaign to prevent Israel from attacking,” analyst Yoel Guzansky at the Institute for National Security Studies told ABC News. “I think the [Obama] administration is really worried Jerusalem will attack and attack soon. They’re trying hard to prevent it in so many ways. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

25620,‘When Money Dies: The Nightmare of the Weimar Collapse’,"Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » ‘When Money Dies: The Nightmare of the Weimar Collapse’ Precious metals expert Michael Ballanger discusses his favorite investing books and reviews the landscape for gold and the U.S. dollar between now and the end of the year as the almighty “gravestone doji” signals the end of the dollar rally is near… Submitted by Michael Ballanger, Streetwise : 
Since entering the hallowed halls of Saint Louis University, that sits near the banks of the equally-venerable-and-old man river, the “Mighty Mississippi,” I have kept a number of books in my library that shall remain as “life textbooks,” tomes upon which to refer in times of confusion, despair, joy and victory. 
Because of my background in hockey as a (much) younger man, I have always enjoyed re-reading sports books and one of my favorites was Ken Dryden’s “The Game” because he described a team and league that had many members familiar to me in the 1970s. Thomas Hauser’s “Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times” was another superb book about the singular, most-globally-recognized athlete of all time and, again, an athlete from the era in which I was raised. 
However, the REAL text books were books like “The Four Agreements” by Don Miguel Ruiz, “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle, and “Conversations with God, Book 1” by Neale Donald Walsch, all of which dealt with the human spirit and personal struggle. 
However, in the world of business and markets, the books which are always within arm reach are, in order of least-to-most importance, “The Battle for Investment Survival” by Gerald M. Loeb (1935), “Reminiscences of a Stock Operator” by Lefevre and Lowenstein (1923), “ Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World” by Michael Lewis (2011), “Atlas Shrugged” by Ayn Rand (1957) and finally “When Money Dies: The Nightmare of the Weimar Collapse” by Adam Fergusson (1975). 
As a snapshot of the societal impact of the Great Keynesian Experiment through which are currently traversing, “Atlas Shrugged” tells you EXACTLY where we are today complete with gutted-out American manufacturing and massive corruption, intervention, and interference brought about by the odious partnership between government and the elite 1%. The one book that describes the probable outcome of all of the money-printing ($57 trillion) of the post-2008-meltdown era is “When Money Dies: The Nightmare of the Weimar Collapse” and it is this book that is sitting under the desk phone in my office. 
The last paragraph sums it all up with the following ghastly summary: “In hyperinflation, a kilo of potatoes was worth, to some, more than the family silver; a side of pork more than a grand piano. A prostitute in the family was better than an infant corpse; theft was preferable to starvation; warmth was finer than honour; clothing more essential than democracy, food more needed than freedom.” THAT paragraph is like “The Ghost of Christmas Yet-To-Come” in Lewis Carroll’s “A Christmas Carol,” and it is truly frightening. 
The use of history books is, for me, a necessity and the following two quotes are the reasons why: 
“History never repeats itself but it rhymes.” – Mark Twain . 
and, 
“Those who cannot remember the past doomed to repeat it.” – George Santayana 
In the bigger picture concerning the global capital markets, I see enormous changes coming and it is all laid out in front of us like those little solar lights that illuminate the path from my deck down to the water on a very dark night. In “Atlas Shrugged,” Ayn Rand describes what America would look like when the business “elite” finally own the government and legislature and the justice system. Nothing is more relevant than looking at the events that have transpired since the Financial Crisis of 2008 that didn’t “nearly” take down the financial system; it DID take it down but criminal collusion manufactured the bail-out mechanism that allowed it to continue to function in “Walking Dead” fashion. 
All you need to do is look at Deutsche Bank to witness all of the same insanity, greed and aberrant behaviors that were so very prominent among the bankster crowd of 2004–2008 being replayed here in 2016 by the German’s beloved DB . 
In “Boomerang”, Michael Lewis walks us through the mindsets of the European bankers and politicians and especially the citizenry, whose contempt for the former two is most acute in Ireland, where one might have thought a few of them might have been carted off to jail. 
However, nothing can send chills up and down your spine more than the last of my list, “When Money Dies.” We have all heard stories about the Weimar hyperinflation and how the indiscriminate albeit well-intended printing of “Reich marks” sent post WWI Germany into chaos and bedlam and unimaginable human suffering. 
“Atlas Shrugged” describes the environment created BY the crime; Michael Lewis walks us through the incredible sense of entitlement among the populist movement responding TO the crime; but Adam Fergusson paints a horrific portrait of the outcome OF the crime. It is a “must-read” for everyone that is playing around with stocks and bonds or trying to manage “Cash” these days. Can’t happen here in “the modern world”? Well, it is happening right now as we speak in Venezuela where prison inmates have been resorting to cannibalism due to dire food shortages and government corruption. 
I write all of this nonsense because as a former resident of the U.S., I was there for the Watergate hearings; I watched Nixon resign; I watched Jimmy Carter have his legacy tarnished by an Arab oil embargo, 12% inflation, massive line-ups at the gas pumps and a hostage crisis. I watched Presidential campaigns in 1972 and 1976 first-hand and have always paid a great deal of attention since. The bare facts behind this year’s race are ugly; you have two candidates that are equally annoying, unequivocally flawed and universally repulsed by the vast majority of voters. 
What hits me between the eyes is that for the first time in history, we are witnessing a race so thoroughly “un-presidential” that it resembles a WWF wrestling match complete with enough “smackdowns” and “whup-ass” remarks to put Vince McMahon to shame. 
The global champion of democracy and capitalism, apple pie and Apple Computer now has the entire world looking on in fear and disbelief that either one of these two candidates could have access to the launch codes that could vaporize the entire planet in a heartbeat all because of a bad meal or a particularly stressful day. The days of Ronald Reagan running the country as Chairman of the Board are now over. And that, my friends, is not only sad; it is outright disturbing. 
So the U.S. dollar continues to roll higher and the gold market struggles to right itself against FOREX headwinds. The U.S. dollar responds to the pre-election tape-painting and the broadly-based consensus that once the election is over that the Fed will hike rates and send the USD index to 105. 
However, given that I don’t care a great deal for technical analysis, here is a Wiki snapshot of a classic “Gravestone Doji” that indicates that a trend may be coming to an end. 
Now take a look at the chart of the U.S. dollar index ($USD) that has finally turned up with a big Gravestone Doji to cap the current rally off the May, June and August lows, setting things up for another metals advance into year-end. 
Now, we saw a Gravestone Doji a few months back in the HUI (NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index) around 175 but it decided to advance another 100 points before correcting, so don’t get too excited (or committed) with this one for the USD. I only mention it because the USD is not as illiquid as the global gold market because the Americans have printed TRILLIONS of USDs since 2008 so it is not nearly as easy to manipulate FOREX as it is gold. Ergo, technical analysis works for the USD and it is useless for gold—period. 
I reported to you all that I had re-entered the GDXJ (VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF) position on October 13 th and added more on Friday the 14 th when I suddenly realized that I was far too complacent with the decaying currency sitting in my trading account. I was growing miserable, snarly, inattentive, and argumentative without my beloved GDXJ position and it was truly difficult to function. 
Those around me were so happy to see me take my enormous profit on GDXJ and were more than happy with the new drapes and the new leash and the Gourmet Alpo and the “designer doggie bags,” but I now know that they thought of me as “seriously depressed.” I am now no longer upset and I am no longer depressed as I now own every single wonderfully decadent share of the GDXJ that I owned back in late 2015 when the junior miners were being shorted and sold by every HFT algorithm and every desk trader and every CNBC-following doorknob on the planet. 
Now, for the traders out there? I have a sell order in for 50% of the GDXJ position at $45.00. If filled, we will own the remaining 50% at new breakeven cost of $32.20 at which point I sit back and chill. No reason to particularly worry with such a wonderful adjusted cost. 
Now, most of you are dying to know how a) Stakeholder Gold Corp.’s (SRC:TSX.V) Ballarat RAB drilling program is progressing and b) when the Canuc Resources Ltd. (CDA:TSX.V) /Santa Rosa RTO will be completed. Last update for the Yukon was yesterday and the first seven RAB holes are now en route to the assay lab in Whitehorse where the turnaround should be 10-14 days. SRC CEO Chris Berlet and V.P. Exploration John Nebocat are in Dawson City today travelling to the property for a day full of comprehensive interpretation and analysis. I would expect a drilling update upon their return. I could talk all day about the large intercepts of quartz sericite alteration and the density of the rock they are encountering but until the assays are back from Whitehorse, it is pretty much meaningless. 
I have been asked about the seasonality effect and the lack of news flow during the long Yukon winter and whether or not it will affect the stock price performance. The fact that SRC will have a full treasury after all 2016 exploration bills are paid allows a generous amount of working capital to be allocated to marketing. Since getting the story “out” is crucial to the survival of all junior miners, SRC has already secured a booth at the January 2017 Vancouver Resource Investment Conference and will be doing the same for PDAC in Toronto in March. While that is all fine and dandy, it is obviously imperative that SRC has a decent tailwind from positive assay results coming off the 2016 program. 
As for the Canuc/Santa Rosa RTO, all I can say is that every RTO to which I have been privy over the years takes longer than first thought and this one is no different. Between the lawyers and the regulators, it seems that just when you think you are getting the green light, they come up with something ridiculous like translating a document that is 15 years old from Spanish to English “in order to protect the poor minority shareholders of Canuc Resources.” In reality, all that needs to happen is for Canuc shareholders to vote on the transaction. It is they that are getting absorbed by the private company (Santa Rosa Silver Mining Corp.) so why not just ask them if they are OK with the terms of the deal and drive on? Alas, despite the delay, I simply cannot stand the wait as the Santa Rosa project will be a beauty. (If anyone wants to have a look at the old PowerPoint presentation that was used back in 2015, email me at [email protected] .) 
Only two more weeks until the elections are over and then it should be a “Sell the news” scenario for the USD and that should provide the impetus for a sizzling year-end rally in the metals. Then, as 2016 ticks down, and with so many money managers having missed the gold rally, it wouldn’t surprise me if there is a mid-December scramble for the mining shares and/or physical gold and silver as year-end window dressing is applied to “modern portfolio management.”

25621,"In Orlando, a Son of a Muslim Immigrant Rushed to Heal Pain Caused by Another - The New York Times","ORLANDO, Fla.  —   When Dr. Joseph Ibrahim heard that the attack at the Pulse nightclub may have been linked to terrorism, he caught himself fearing any kind of link to his own Muslim,   roots. Please, he thought, don’t let Ibrahim appear anywhere in the gunman’s name. Dr. Ibrahim  —   who heads the trauma unit at Orlando Regional Medical Center, and generally goes by Joey  —   had already spent hours repairing gunshot wounds in the bodies of Latino men and women, many of whom were the sons and daughters of immigrants, too. Yanked from bed by a phone call at 2:15 a. m. he was doing what he had trained for. His old friends from his hometown in Tennessee were pulling for him. But it was hard to escape the pairing: the son of one Muslim immigrant from the Middle East trying to save the lives of mostly gay Latinos whom another son of Muslim immigrants tried to kill  —   all in a chunk of verdant Florida built on Disney joy. “Maybe we’re a target because of our diversity and tolerance,” Dr. Ibrahim said after a morning of surgery on Wednesday. “Here you constantly see people from all over the world, and it’s wonderful. ” This is the Orlando that the shooting tore right through, a place that sees itself as a model of diversity, at ease with difference, with room for everyone and every ride. Even now, as the conversation outside Orlando zeros in on “radical Islam,” this city is awash in American flags, vigils with Republican and Democratic politicians trying to speak Spanish, and signs on churches, strip clubs, and restaurants with two catchphrases: “Orlando Strong” and “Orlando United. ” It is hardly a perfect union, one without pain, or frustration. Some Latinos have wondered why the shooting that left 49 people dead has become a   touchstone and not a Latino one. Some immigrants with loved ones among the dead have collapsed in the arms of local leaders, desperate for financial help, wishing for more of the support found in the larger Puerto Rican community. There is some confusion too many countries in the hemisphere are still trying to figure out if any of their citizens were killed, a challenge since many of the victims had United States citizenship even if they were originally from somewhere else. But all of these issues  —   the intersecting identities, the struggles for recognition  —   only make more obvious just how much this most American of places has rapidly changed. Walt Disney had the vision to cobble together a resort with secret land deals in a quiet cow town of lakes and mosquitoes. Now, Orlando and its suburbs in Orange County point to where this country is headed when it comes to demographics, and the degree to which immigrants and their offspring are woven into every aspect of American life. What Orlando looks like today is what the United States will look like in 30 years  —   that is what local Republican Party officials tell newcomers. In simple terms, the white   population is shrinking (it is now at 43 percent in Orange County) and cultural and ethnic diversity is expanding and evolving as foreigners, new arrivals from Puerto Rico, and the children of earlier immigrant waves all find their footing in Orlando’s affordable sprawl. At Valencia College, more than   of the   student body is nonwhite. On Wednesday, black and Latino students with the school’s   Alliance  —   including Jorge Lanza, 23, a son of immigrants from Honduras who goes by George  —   gave out free hugs and candy near the library seven of the people killed at Pulse were current or former Valencia students. Most of them had not been here for long, which is typical. Nearly   of the 1. 3 million people in Orange County arrived   Center, which opened in 1982. “I happen to have been born about 1, 000 yards that way, but there is not a large population in Orlando that are   residents,” said Mayor Buddy Dyer of Orlando, a Democrat, standing near the Pulse nightclub. Teresa Jacobs, the mayor of Orange County, who is a Republican, said that newness, along with the lack of a single dominant group  —   plus nonpartisan elections  —   have pushed Orlando toward tolerance. “We have to get along,” Ms. Jacobs said. The shooting shattered the area’s image as a welcoming place. It is why at the public memorials here, many residents said the attack had been particularly hard for people to accept. And yet, immigrants and the children of immigrants, from the Caribbean and beyond, played a role at every stage of the tragedy. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a   American. His parents, who got married in New York in the early 1980s and briefly lived in Flushing, Queens, before moving to Florida, were quick to assimilate after moving from Afghanistan. His first wife, Sitora Yusufiy, was from Uzbekistan. His second wife, Noor Zahi Salman, was born in California to Palestinian parents from the West Bank. Many of the people Mr. Mateen killed had similar stories of hyphenated existence. Jerald Arthur Wright, 31, whose family was from Colombia, worked at Walt Disney World and never seemed to run out of energy, helping guests in both Spanish and English. Luis S. Vielma, 22 Juan   25 Joel Rayón Paniagua, 31  —   they were all immigrants from Mexico, working mostly in tourism, too. If you visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, you might have seen Mr. Vielma. Among those who survived and saw their friends die or be wounded, there are even more  —   including Adrian López. An immigrant from Cuba, he stood up before Orlando’s Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday night and through tears, after apologizing for his rusty Spanish, told his heroic tale of escaping the shooting, then running back in to try to save his husband, who was wounded. The police SWAT team that killed Mr. Mateen also included at least two Latino officers. The Orlando Police Department is about 18 percent Hispanic and includes officers “from just about every Latin American country and other parts of the world,” said Deputy Police Chief Orlando Rolon. Then there is the Orlando Regional Medical Center, the tall modern hospital a few blocks from Pulse. Dr. Ibrahim, who is 39 and speaks with a drip of Tennessee drawl, said that as he worked on victim after victim early Sunday morning, he was surrounded (as usual) by colleagues with ties to other parts of the world  —   nurses of Asian and Hispanic descent, technicians from Jamaica, and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. “We worked side by side, without question,” he said. In the days that followed, he said, he heard many arguments for “taking the country back” and keeping out Muslims. It was mostly on talk radio, as he drove to work for surgery. And while the hosts focused on Mr. Mateen’s father, Dr. Ibrahim contemplated his own dad, an immigrant from Egypt, who married an American and practiced medicine in Tennessee. “It’s difficult,” Dr. Ibrahim said, noting that he would not be here if that kind of policy had been in place when his father wanted to leave Cairo. “I just have to believe that those people have not met the right individual. There are a lot of people who never meet Muslims who are kind, gentle and giving. ” Stephen Miller, a policy adviser to Donald J. Trump, said Mr. Trump  —   who has spent months condemning immigrants from Mexico and the Muslim world  —   simply wants to “select immigrants who support, defend and uphold our values. ” Mr. Miller described Mr. Trump’s proposal to stop all immigration from Muslim countries until a broad security assessment could be put in place as “about as mainstream and common sense as it gets. ” But Dr. Ibrahim said what he heard was mostly an appeal to ignorance and fear. He said he moved to Orlando from Tennessee in part so his twin boys, who are 11, could grow up around different kinds of people. Like their father, whose looks make him hard to place in terms of ethnicity, they represent a mixture of cultures: Their mother is white, Anglo in the lexicon of Orlando, born and raised in Tennessee. But as a family with Ibrahim for a last name, they are still sometimes seen as outsiders. Dr. Ibrahim said his wife was once denied a loan because her name was confused with someone on a European terror watch list. He and his wife also struggled with whether to continue the tradition, common in the Middle East, of passing on his second name, Abdellatif, to their oldest son. In the end, they went for it: Abdellatif now links grandfather, father and son, three generations of  . Dr. Ibrahim is hoping that he won’t regret it. “Hopefully by the time he’s of age,” he said, “people will be even more tolerant. ”",1
25622,Who Can Compete in Our Elections?,"opednews.com - Advertisement - 
In the last two articles of this series we described the makeup of voters and considered the likely outcomes under a variety of different voting systems. Here we will repeat that thought-experiment but consider a different makeup of the voter attitudes. 
In the chart below, the results for the various voting systems are shown for both systems, serving both as a review and as a preview. But more importantly, the chart illustrates the difference between traditional voting systems and balanced ones. It is worth noting that in the traditional column, only Celeb (celebrity) candidates are competitive whereas in the balanced column the non-celebrity (Ghost) candidate is consistently at least competitive. Who Has a Chance of Winning(image by Paul Cohen) License DMCA 
Clearly, by these results, the balanced systems tend to be open to more candidates, and sometimes different candidates, than traditional systems. The difference stems from the fact that balanced voting systems consciously take into account both support and opposition of candidates -- whereas traditional systems only consider support. 
This election is between three candidates, two of whom are celebrities, well known by nearly all voters. Al Celeb has strong support from 35% of voters but is strongly disliked by 60%. Beth Celeb is strongly supported by 33% of the voters but very much disliked by 52%. The other candidate, Ghost, draws his support from the 12% of voters, who disapprove both of the Celeb candidates. Ghost is well regarded by the relatively small number of voters who know much about him. 
You might now take some time to think about which of the four candidates deserve to win the election. 
If the election were held using plurality voting, it is pretty clear that Al Celeb would be the winner with 35% of the vote. The fact that both Celeb candidates have more opposition than support does not matter because opposition is not a factor in traditional voting systems like plurality voting. 
On the other hand, if the election were held using balanced plurality voting , then presumably 35% of the voters would vote for Al Celeb and 33% would vote for Beth Celeb. But each of the Celeb candidates will face opposition votes as well. Al Celeb might have as much as 60% of voters casting votes against him, or as few as 48% against him if all 12% of voters who favor Al Ghost choose to vote for Ghost. So Al Celeb will have a net vote of somewhere between -13% and -35% of the voters. By the same reasoning, Beth Celeb will receive a net vote between -7% and -19% of the vote. Ghost, with between 0% and 12% of the vote will win the election. When opposition to them is taken into account, celebrity candidates lose their great advantage. - Advertisement - 
With approval voting , Al Celeb and Beth Celeb will respectively get 35% and 33% of the vote while Ghost will get only 12%. As with plurality voting, Al Celeb will be declared the winner. 
With balanced approval voting , (where the voter is asked to indicate approval or disapproval -- or neither - for each of the candidates), Al Celeb and Beth Celeb will respectively get -25% and -19% of the vote while Ghost will get 12% so Ghost will be declared the winner. 
In this election there are few enough candidates that one might question the motivation for using ration voting , but for the sake of providing an example we can consider it nonetheless. Each voter would be handed three plurality ballots (it could be more or less than that, but three seems reasonable with just three candidates). It seems likely that a Ghost voter would cast all three ballots for Ghost, giving Ghost 12% of the vote. But Al Celeb and Beth Celeb would respectively receive 35% and 33% of the vote. Al Celeb would be declared the winner. However, if sentiment among Ghost voters favored Beth Celeb over Al Celeb then some might cast some of their ballots for Beth Celeb and this could turn Beth Celeb into the winner. 
If this election were held using balanced ration voting, each voter would be handed three balanced plurality ballots. Any outcome is possible for this election, the voters have free reign to decide. This may not immediately obvious to you -- it was not to me. I had to set up a spread-sheet to try out scenarios to see this to be the case. 
It is the Ghost voters who will make the selection between the two Celeb candidates and that will be by deciding how many of their 12% of ballots will go to Celeb candidates. If 2% more of those 12% are cast against Al Celeb than are cast against Beth then the race between the Celeb candidates is a tie. Of course if more than 2% go against Al Celeb then he will lose and the contest will be between Ghost and Beth Celeb. If that margin is less than 2% then the contest will be between Ghost and Al Celeb. - Advertisement - 
Also as might be expected, whether Ghost can win will depend on how many of the Celeb voters decide to vote against the candidate they dislike (rather than for the Celeb candidate they like). If 23% of voters (Celeb voters) decide to cast votes against the Celeb candidate they dislike then the race becomes a toss-up. 
It is worth mentioning that voters will likely make these decisions according to their real feelings. They will cast votes against a candidate they dislike and they will vote for candidates they like. With balanced voting methods, voters can freely express dislike for particular candidates and that means they are not forced to resort to strategic methods to express this very real and very natural belief. 
With IRV , Celeb voters are likely to put the candidate they favor in first place on their ballots. Ghost will garner at most 12% of the vote, so Ghost will be eliminated in the first round of counting. Now the Ghost voters may all decide to not even list a second choice since that would mean voting for a candidate they dislike. The choice between the two Celeb candidates lies in the hands of these Ghost voters who do not like either of them. If just a little more than 2% more voters (necessarily these would be Ghost voters) list Beth Celeb as a second choice than those who list Al Celeb as second choice then that would give the election to Beth Celeb rather than to Al Celeb. Under IRV, the Ghost supporters would be well advised to give some serious consideration to whom they consider the lesser of the two evils. As with other traditional systems, with IRV a little-known candidate does not stand a ghost of a chance and the only real choice is apt to be between two celebrities. 
With IRBV , voters have more freedom of expression. Might any voters decide to cast their first priority against some candidate? Since there will be only two counts of the votes, some Celeb voters may well choose to cast their first-ranked choice as a vote against the Celeb they dislike. Presumably they would do that if they preferred Ghost to win rather than letting the wrong Celeb candidate winning. If enough voters choose to vote against one or the other of the Celeb candidates then Ghost actually could survive to the second round of voting and if a preference for Ghost by the voters whose Celeb candidate lost in the first round then it is quite possible for Ghost to become the winner. Under IRBV, this race is wide open with any of the three candidates having a chance to win.",1
25626,Inside the Invisible Government,"Photo by Diego Torres Silvestre | CC BY 2.0 
The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. 
The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term “public relations” as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. 
In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade – behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” 
Bernays’ influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was “engineering the consent” of people in order to “control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it”. 
He described this as “the true ruling power in our society” and called it an “invisible government”. 
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. 
Imagine two cities. 
Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. 
But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. 
In the second city – in another country nearby – almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. 
The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by “us” – by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. 
Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city – which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. 
Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. 
What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. 
Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. 
Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was “vindicated” for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell’s fabrications. 
The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, “What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?” 
He replied that if journalists had done their job, “there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq”. 
It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question — Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. 
In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. 
There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. 
When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria – and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande’s bombast about France being “at war” and “showing no mercy”. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. 
“When the truth is replaced by silence,” said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, “the silence is a lie.” 
The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. 
The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an “agreement” that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. 
As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. 
From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics – the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. 
Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: “We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.” 
The West’s medieval client, Saudi Arabia – to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars’ worth of arms – is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. 
Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs – “our” bombs – that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. 
The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news. 
Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education – Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia — and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . 
These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. 
And they love war. 
While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. 
In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. 
In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call “regime change” in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi’s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. 
So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, “We came, we saw, he died!” 
The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : “Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.” 
Intervention — what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. 
According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 “strike sorties” against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, “most [of them] under the age of ten”. 
As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS. 
Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. 
All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato. 
This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington’s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. 
The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine – except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count. 
Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. 
There is almost the joie d’esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. 
The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. 
But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America’s design for the 21 st century. 
This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. 
To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. 
In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, “I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over.” That was not news. 
Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. 
The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world – unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. 
Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to “totally obliterate” Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. 
She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria — a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime –a distinction for which the competition is fierce. 
Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. 
That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. 
Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way – in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. 
Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton’s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays’ “torches of freedom”. 
George Bush’s press spokesman once called the media “complicit enablers”. 
Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. 
In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: “Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.”

25637,Janet Yellen Says Labor and Inflation Complicate Fed’s Plans to Raise Rates - The New York Times,"BOSTON  —   Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, did not talk on Friday about the Fed’s plans for its benchmark interest rate. Instead, she talked about why those plans have been so hard to make. In a   speech, Ms. Yellen said the Fed was struggling to understand the behavior of the labor market and the weakness of inflation. It is reconsidering how changes in monetary policy ripple through the economy, and the impact of international events. In short, as often happens after a crisis, the Fed is sorting through some existential issues. “The events of the past few years have revealed limits in economists’ understanding of the economy and suggest several important questions I hope the profession will try to answer,” she said at a conference here hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Fed has indicated it is likely to raise rates in December if economic growth continues, although it has repeatedly retreated from similar predictions in the last nine months. Investors now see more than a 70 percent chance of a December hike, according to CME Group, and Eric S. Rosengren, the Boston Fed’s president, buttressed those expectations Friday. “The market seems to think that there’s a very high probability of December,” Mr. Rosengren told CNBC. “We’ll see how the economic data actually comes in, but I think that is priced appropriately. ” Mr. Rosengren, however, was ready to raise rates in September. Ms. Yellen and most of her colleagues were not. The debate among Fed officials revolves in part around the consequences of holding down interest rates to push unemployment to an unsustainably low level. A certain amount of unemployment lubricates labor markets, maintaining a ready supply of workers for businesses that are expanding. In the past, pushing unemployment below that level has increased inflation. Mr. Rosengren has warned that could force the Fed to raise rates more sharply, potentially driving the economy into recession. But an unusually large share of American adults are neither working nor counted among the unemployed. They are not trying to find jobs. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have raised the possibility that a low unemployment rate could persuade some of these people to start looking. That could increase growth without increasing inflation. “If strong economic conditions can partially reverse   damage after it has occurred, then policy makers may want to aim at being more accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional view,” Ms. Yellen said on Friday. Ms. Yellen described this outcome as “plausible” but not proven. Businesses buoyed by strong sales might expand workers might find it easier to move into better jobs increased investment in research might even lead to higher productivity growth. The Fed is embarked on the experiment. Officials predicted in December that they would raise rates four times this year. So far, they have not raised rates at all. The Fed’s benchmark rate remains in a range between 0. 25 percent and 0. 5 percent, a low level that encourages investment and  . And over the last year, the unemployment rate has held steady while the labor force has expanded. The question is how much further the Fed can go. The presenters at the Boston Fed conference, which was devoted to the slow pace of growth in recent years, generally attributed a large share of the economy’s underperformance to issues that would seem beyond the reach of monetary policy, including demographic shifts and slow productivity growth. “Just pushing down unemployment, by itself, is unlikely to draw large numbers of workers back into the labor force,” said Gabriel   a professor of economics at Harvard University. James Stock, also a Harvard economist, said annual growth during this expansion has been about 1. 74 percentage points slower than the last three expansions. He said demographics and productivity accounted for about 0. 9 percentage points of the shortfall. He attributed most of the rest to insufficient government spending and weak demand for exports. Yet few drew the conclusion that the Fed should raise rates. Peter Ireland, a professor of economics at Boston College, described himself as “really, really nervous” about the judgment that the central bank’s work is done. “My December vote is no,” said Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economist. The Fed is unlikely to act at its next meeting, in November, just a few days before the presidential election on Nov. 8. Patrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Thursday that the election could cause significant economic disruptions. “It may be prudent to wait until we have resolved some of that uncertainty,” Mr. Harker said. The Fed’s last meeting of the year, in December, looks more likely for a rate change. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said early this month that he wanted the Fed to move forward slowly, but that he did not regard the exact timing of the next rate increase as important. December would be “fine,” Mr. Evans told reporters in Auckland, New Zealand. “I am less concerned about the timing of the next increase than I am about the path over the next three years. ” Ms. Yellen surveyed a number of the issues that are perplexing Fed policy makers. The conventional understanding of monetary policy is that the Fed raises or lowers interest rates, which moves markets, which changes the behavior of businesses and consumers, and so the American economy grows or slows. But the Fed has struggled to stimulate the economy. One possible reason, Ms. Yellen said, is that households and businesses with relatively large debts were unwilling, or unable, to take advantage of low interest rates. She said that the Fed also needed to improve its understanding of the economic impact of changes in financial conditions. The behavior of inflation is another mystery. It fell less than expected during the recession it has strengthened more slowly than expected in the aftermath. “The influence of labor market conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been commonly thought,” she said. Finally, she mentioned the impact of global economic weakness on domestic growth. “This is a wonderful time to be an academic,” Mr. Rosengren said in introducing Ms. Yellen. But, he continued, “I empathize with the challenges our chair has” in charting policy with so many uncertainties.",1
25644,Uncle Sam Wants You — Or at Least Your Genetic and Lifestyle Information - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Government scientists are seeking a million volunteers willing to share the innermost secrets of their genes and daily lives as part of an ambitious   research project to understand the causes and cures of disease. Those selected to be members of the “precision medicine cohort” will be asked to provide a detailed medical history and blood samples so researchers can extract DNA. They will also be asked to report information about themselves  —   including their age, race, income, education, sexual orientation and gender identity, officials said. But the project involves much more than statistics and laboratory work. The government plans to collect information about a person’s lifestyle  —   diet, exercise, smoking, drinking, sleep patterns and other behavior  —   and the environment in which a person lives, so researchers can identify possible risk factors, including air pollution or high lead levels in drinking water. Those wishing to participate will be able to sign up by computer or smartphone, and even by using an ordinary telephone to contact a traditional call center. The project, begun as part of President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative, seeks to develop treatments tailored to the characteristics of individual patients. “Anybody anywhere can raise their hand and say they want to participate,” said Kathy L. Hudson, deputy director of the National Institutes of Health, which is leading the effort. Health care providers, including a number of hospitals and community health centers, will invite their patients to participate. Enrollment is scheduled to begin in November or December, with a goal of signing up a million or more people within four years. “There are a lot of enticing reasons to participate,” said Mark Masselli, president and chief executive of the Community Health Center in Middletown, Conn. one of a   clinics chosen by the government to recruit patients. “Perched on your shoulders will be the best and brightest researchers, working on your behalf. ” The project is being orchestrated by Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, who in a previous job led the government’s successful effort to map the human genome. Congress in December provided $130 million to the National Institutes of Health for the   research cohort. Mr. Obama has requested $230 million for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, and the appropriations committees in both houses of Congress have approved the request as part of a spending bill for 2017. That bipartisan support strongly suggests that the project will continue after Mr. Obama leaves office. The scale of the project dwarfs most other   health research in the United States, such as the Framingham Heart Study, which has produced valuable insights on heart disease by following about 15, 500 people enrolled at different times since the late 1940s. “In the Precision Medicine Initiative,” Dr. Hudson said, “we hope to follow people for at least a decade. The longer it lasts, the more value it will have. ” People can sign up through academic medical centers at Columbia University, Northwestern University in Illinois, the University of Arizona and the University of Pittsburgh, each of which is working with local partners. Columbia, for example, is collaborating with   Hospital, Harlem Hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine. Participants will be recruited to reflect the geographic, racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the nation. To help achieve that goal, officials have enlisted community health centers, where more than 90 percent of patients have annual incomes less than twice the poverty level (less than $23, 760 for an individual). About   of health center patients are Latinos, and about   are  . Officials said they wanted patients to be partners in the research, not just “human subjects. ” To that end, patients will have access to all the information about themselves, including laboratory and genetic test results. Doctors could eventually use the data to shape treatment for an individual patient, rather than using standard treatments that may not work for everyone. Patients will help guide the research, sitting on its steering committee and advisory board. The government intends to collect data from online questionnaires, physical exams, electronic health records and   devices like Fitbit. Using smartphone apps and wearable sensors, participants could report information on their blood pressure, heart rate and other vital signs. Officials hope to recruit 150, 000 patients from community health centers. Anne Kauffman Nolon, president and chief executive of Hudson River HealthCare, a community health center serving 10 counties of New York, said her patients would need help to overcome several obstacles. The patients, she said, include homeless people, migrant seasonal farm workers, people with low literacy skills and people who have neither computers nor smartphones. Dr. Carmen Chinea, the chief medical officer of the Hudson River health center, said that participants would not receive instant gratification, but could eventually receive “more precise treatments” for conditions including diabetes, cancer and depression. The Mayo Clinic will create a huge biobank to collect, analyze and store 35 million samples of blood, DNA and other materials from participants. Vanderbilt University will operate a data center to store information. Some of the data will be made available, without personal identifiers, to researchers and “citizen scientists,” officials said. Cancer doctors already choose drugs for certain types of cancer based in part on genetic characteristics of tumors. Dr. Joshua C. Denny, the principal investigator for the project at Vanderbilt, said his research had identified genetic mutations that increase the risk of heart attack or stroke for people taking a certain   medication. Dr. Rhonda K. Trousdale, chief of endocrinology at Harlem Hospital, said she was reaching out to church and community leaders to seek their help in publicizing the project and enrolling volunteers. “A big motivation for researchers is to use this data to find correlations between people’s lifestyle, family history, environment and genomic data  —   to figure out what factors contribute to disease and if they affect different populations in different ways,” Dr. Trousdale said. “That’s what precision medicine is about. ”",1
25646,Trump Keeping Promise to Ensure America’s Energy Independence in First 100 Days,"In his Contract with the American Voter pledge, President Donald J. Trump, then the Republican nominee, promised to move America in the direction of becoming energy independent through a series of executive orders, actions, agency directives, and guidance. [Under the heading “Seven Actions to Protect American Workers” in the contract, Trump spelled out how he would advance that goal in his first 100 days in office, which concludes on Saturday.  “I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of   American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal,” Trump said. He also pledged to “lift the   roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward. ” In a memorandum issued on January 24, 2017  —   four days after taking the oath of office  —   Trump put his seal of approval on the Keystone XL Pipeline that the Obama administration held up for years based on protests from climate change activists and some Native American tribes. On January 26, the State Department announced the Keystone construction could move forward: Acting on behalf of the president under delegated authorities in accordance with Executive Order 13337 and the January 24, 2017 Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs determined that issuing a Presidential permit to Keystone to construct, connect, operate, and maintain at the border of the United States pipeline facilities for the import of crude oil from Canada to the United States as described in the Presidential permit application for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project would serve the national interest. Accordingly, the request for a Presidential permit is approved: “A significant milestone for the Keystone XL project,” said Russ Girling, president CEO https:  .  #TimeToBuildKXL,  —   TransCanada (@TransCanada) March 24, 2017,  Also on January 24, Trump issued a memorandum on the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, which Obama put on hold to appease protesters, including Native America tribes and allies who claimed environmental damage would result from the pipeline crossing under the Missouri River. But in the end, the people camping out on the land caused about $1 million in damage to the land that was repaired with American taxpayer dollars. “I believe that construction and operation of lawfully permitted pipeline infrastructure serve the national interest,” Trump said in the memorandum approving the final phase of construction for the Dakota Access pipeline. “We support the   and   direction President Trump has taken on energy with his approval of KXL, DAPL and his actions to streamline regulations,” Sabrina Fang, spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, told Breitbart News. “We look forward to working with this administration and Congress on   energy policies that will help ensure the United States continues to lead the world in the production and refining of oil and natural gas and in reducing carbon emissions. ” “With the right policies, we have a     opportunity to create more jobs, continue to help consumers, and improve the environment all at the same time,” Fang said. In February, Trump signed an executive order calling for the review of the Waters of the United States’ rule, part of the Clean Water Plan, which put restrictions on waters on private land, harming farming and ranching operations across the country. “Since its introduction in 2015, the rule has been greeted with frustration and litigation from many farming groups, including the Michigan Farm Bureau, which called the rule ‘a regulatory land grab of Biblical proportions,’” the Lansing State Journal reported. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt joined the president for the announcement of the executive order and issued this statement: EPA intends to immediately implement the Executive Order and submit a Notice to the Office of the Federal Register announcing our intent to review the 2015 Rule, and then to propose a new rule that will rescind or revise that rule. The President’s action today preserves a federal role in protecting water, but it also restores the states’ important role in the regulation of water. The rule, however, was already held up from implementation because of lawsuits filed by 13 states, but Trump’s order makes its implementation virtually impossible in the coming years. On March 28, surrounded by coal miners, Trump signed the “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth” executive order. “My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,” Trump said in a speech prior to signing the executive order. In the order, Trump spells out his vision for America’s energy future: It is in the national interest to promote clean and safe development of our nation’s vast energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain economic growth, and prevent job creation. Moreover, the prudent development of these natural resources is essential to ensuring the Nation’s geopolitical security. It is further in the national interest to ensure that the Nation’s electricity is affordable, reliable, safe, secure, and clean, and that it can be produced from coal, natural gas, nuclear material, flowing water, and other domestic sources, including renewable sources. Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that executive departments and agencies (agencies) immediately review existing regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources and appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden the development of domestic energy resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. In addressing coal in the sweeping order, Trump asked Ryan Zinke, secretary of the Interior Department, “to lift any and all moratoria on Federal land coal leasing activities related to Order 3338. The Secretary shall commence Federal coal leasing activities consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. ” The order also calls for review of restrictions on gas and oil production, including regulations on hydraulic fracturing. Trump took dead aim at the Obama administration’s climate change regulations, including ordering a review of the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s Climate Action Plan, and a slew of other actions taken during the past eight years. The order also called for the disbanding of the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases. “The action I’m taking eliminates federal overreach, restores economic freedom and allows our workers to thrive, compete and succeed on a level playing field for the first time in a long time,” Trump said about the order. “That’s what this is all about  —   bringing back our jobs, bringing back our dreams, and making America wealthy again,” Trump said. And in addition to the public executive orders and memorandums, a leaked working document from the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) reveals how Trump wants to return the vast amount of land held by the federal government to allow not only recreation, hunting, and accessibility for law enforcement and the military, but for energy exploration, development, and production. “Several conservation and government watchdog groups say they’re concerned about the direction the Bureau of Land Management is headed after a draft list of agency priorities under the Trump administration surfaced this week,” Greenwire’s EE News reported. “The draft   ‘BLM Priority Work’ list, first reported on   …     by EE News, calls for the agency to focus on increasing energy development in suitable areas of the 245 million acres BLM manages (Greenwire, April 10),” EE News reported. The document is divided into five sections  —   “Making America Safe through Energy Independence,” “Making America Great Through Shared Conservation Stewardship,” “Making America Safe  —   Restoring Our Sovereignty,” “Getting America Back to Work,” and “Serving the American Family. ” “It also prioritizes streamlining unspecified ‘processes’ mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as well as ‘land use planning to support energy and minerals development and other priorities,’ including ‘   processing for pipelines, transmission lines, and   projects,’” EE News reported.",1
25647,Study Calls Snub of Obama’s Supreme Court Pick Unprecedented - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   How unusual is the Republican blockade of the nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Obama’s pick for the Supreme Court? After a comprehensive look at every past Supreme Court vacancy, two law professors have concluded that it is an unprecedented development. Senate Republicans say they will not consider any nominee offered by Mr. Obama to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. The power to appoint Justice Scalia’s successor, they say, should belong to the next president. That categorical stance is new in the nation’s history, the professors, Robin Bradley Kar and Jason Mazzone, wrote in a study published online by The New York University Law Review. The Senate has never before transferred a president’s appointment power in comparable circumstances to an unknown successor, they said  —   an argument that many Democratic lawmakers have also made. In every one of the 103 earlier Supreme Court vacancies, the professors wrote, the president was able to both nominate and appoint a replacement with the Senate’s advice and consent. This did not always happen on the first try, they wrote, but it always happened. “There really is something unique about the position Republican senators are taking with respect to the Scalia vacancy,” said Professor Mazzone, who teaches at the University of Illinois. “You really cannot find any single comparable case,” he said. “We really did not find any precedent for the idea, notwithstanding the Senate’s very broad powers in this area, that a sitting president could be denied outright the authority to offer up a nominee who would receive evaluation through normal Senate processes. ” The study was the subject of a thorough critique by Edward Whelan, a prominent conservative legal blogger, who said Professors Kar and Mazzone had to perform semantic gymnastics to discern a consistent historical practice. The study considered only nominations to the Supreme Court, though the Senate must also confirm other federal judges and senior executive branch officials. “It is nonsensical to read into the Constitution one rule governing Supreme Court justices and another rule for everyone else,” Mr. Whelan wrote in a series of posts on National Review’s Bench Memos blog. The professors also excluded nominations from three presidents who gained office by succession rather than election, saying that the constitutional status of unelected presidents was contested until the adoption of the 25th Amendment in 1967. In addition, they excluded three presidents who started the nomination process after their successors had already been elected. You can make a decent case for both exceptions. It is harder to ignore President Lyndon B. Johnson’s failure in 1968, an election year, to fill Chief Justice Earl Warren’s seat. Johnson ultimately withdrew his nomination of Justice Abe Fortas. The study’s authors “gerrymander their way around this inconvenience,” Mr. Whelan wrote, by saying that there was no actual vacancy to fill because Warren had merely declared in a letter to Johnson that he was prepared to step down “effective at your pleasure. ” The Fortas affair helps both sides in the debate. Some senators opposed his nomination on the grounds that the next president should make the appointment. But the Senate Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings and sent the nomination to the Senate floor. The nomination failed, but mostly on the basis of an individualized assessment of Fortas’s qualifications to be chief justice. “There is a difference,” Professor Mazzone said, “between the Senate rejecting, as it’s quite entitled to do, a particular nominee on the merits, and the Senate taking the position that a president cannot exercise a constitutionally delegated power. ” Should it matter if the Senate has always given presidents a real shot at appointing a Supreme Court justice? At a minimum, the authors say, the historical precedents establish “a benchmark of fair dealing. ” More controversially, they say that historical practices “can ripen into constitutional rules. ” That is not obviously true, but the Supreme Court seemed to say something similar in 2014, in a case on recess appointments. But even if the constitutional argument is a stretch, tradition counts for something. “History draws a distinction between rejecting a candidate and rejecting a presidential power,” said Professor Kar, who also teaches at the University of Illinois. “It’s a norm of fair dealing in the Senate. Procedure matters, and this breach is a dangerous one. ” Mr. Whelan wrote that the study supplied an answer to the wrong question. The right one, he said, is “how to deal with (a) a nomination by an   president, (b) in an election year, (c) that threatens to dramatically alter the ideological composition of the court. ” That is a good description of current political realities. Professors Kar and Mazzone say they instead tried to discern a neutral principle from centuries of unbroken practice. I asked Professor Mazzone what he would tell a Republican senator to do in considering Judge Garland’s nomination. “You do what the Senate has always done in comparable circumstances,” he said, “which is you proceed with a   evaluation of the candidate on the merits. ”",1
25648,Subdued Cuba Prepares Memorial for Castro - The New York Times,"HAVANA  —   Cuba is preparing for Fidel Castro’s final public appearance: a   memorial offering Cubans a chance to pay their respects. Details of Mr. Castro’s death on Friday night, at the age of 90, have yet to be made public. But as if performing a play that had been rehearsed for a decade, the government continued to roll out plans for what official statements have called a   period of “Duelo Nacional,” or national mourning. Government employees have begun setting up speakers and yellow   gates at the Plaza de la Revolución, where the memorial will begin on Monday. Granma, the main government newspaper, published a special edition on Mr. Castro’s life and achievements. Statements and articles in government news outlets have also been lionizing Mr. Castro’s life and achievements  —   “All of Cuba With Fidel,” said one headline  —   while warning that liquor sales would be limited nationwide until next Sunday, when the mourning period is scheduled to end at noon. “Public activities and events will be suspended, and national flags will fly at   in public buildings and military installations,” Granma reported. “Radio and television will continue with programming that is informative, patriotic and historical. ” All across Havana on Saturday night and Sunday morning, Cubans seemed quieter, more cautious, less certain of what the future might hold. Several nightclubs stayed closed on Saturday night. Traffic lessened, and the usual weekend music and revelry seemed dialed back. Many predicted that the somber mood  —   both sincere and enforced by the state  —   would hold until Mr. Castro’s ashes were interred in Santiago de Cuba next Sunday after a procession along the country’s central highway. Elian Gonzalez, the center of an international custody battle waged by Fidel Castro nearly two decades ago, returned to the public eye on Sunday to praise the leader who fought to return him to Cuba. Echoing the    adulation on state media, Mr. Gonzalez said on   television that the Cuban leader’s legacy will long outlive him. It’s “not right to talk about Fidel in the past tense . .. but rather that Fidel will be,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “Today more than ever, make him omnipresent. ” At one of Havana’s most popular   hot spots  —   behind the imposing Capitolio building, which is being restored to hold the country’s national legislature  —   the crowds were smaller than usual after dark on Saturday. Several young Cubans could be seen scrolling through Facebook and pointing out what relatives and friends around the world were sharing about Mr. Castro’s death. Only a handful were talking to those relatives by video chat, which is usually the most popular activity in the hot spots spread across Havana. Tourists in the group said they were surprised but pleased to have been on the island during such a historic moment. “I’m definitely going tomorrow to see everyone saying goodbye to Fidel,” said Miguel Castillo, 52, a visitor from Costa Rica. “He was a symbol of resistance. The people of Latin America had long been listening to his voice, to his call for autonomy. ” Marini Danilo, 30, a tourist from Italy, said he couldn’t believe his vacation had turned into a chance “to live in such a big story. ” “For me, he was just another dictator,” Mr. Danilo said. “He was not my dictator, he was Cuba’s, but it feels crazy to be here. ” At least on Sunday, the scale of the goodbye for Mr. Castro was hard to gauge. Cubans have long known that when the world is watching, so are the state authorities: During international conferences, during President Obama’s visit in March and, now, after Mr. Castro’s death, the presence of state security becomes more intense, both in the streets and behind the scenes. Even without such clear warnings, Cubans  —   after decades of living under Mr. Castro and his brother Raúl  —   know that in such moments they are expected to behave and to say very little, especially to visiting reporters. So far, grief and memorialization have been dominated by the state. There have been only occasional public expressions or gatherings of any kind: a few students from a young Communist group getting together to grieve publicly on Saturday a small group of Cubans waving flags on the Malecón, the city’s seaside boulevard. At the Plaza de la Revolución on Saturday night, the wide expanse of concrete was empty except for the police, some soldiers  —   and exactly four visitors snapping photos. But starting on Monday, Cubans expect to see thousands of others, for the final spectacle of the Fidel Castro era.",1
25649,"Sleepwalking into a New Cold War, Pentagon Style","Written by Franklin C. Spinney   Pentagon’s five year plan has been planted (or in Pentagon-speak, “front loaded”) with the seed money for a top-to-bottom modernization of our nuclear forces — a new bomber, new inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBM) (even though the Minutemen III has just been completely modernized and is essentially a new missile), new nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBM), upgraded (read “new”) submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), a new cruise missile, and big upgrade (read “new”) to the B-61 dial-a-yield nuclear bomb (including precision guidance which implies going back to the looney tit-for-tat nuclear war-fighting doctrines of late 1970s), a new nuclear-hardened satellite based command and control system to manage all these goodies in a nuclear war, even more money for the strategic defense initiative (SDI) (the shield to protect the aforementioned swords), and a rebuilding of the nuclear lab infrastructure. The current estimate for all of this is one trillion dollars, with a spending tail out to at least 2080. That number is surely a grotesque underestimate, because no one really has a clue what these as yet undesigned systems will cost to buy, much less to operate in the distant future. And if the problem-plagued F-35 has proven anything, it is that the Pentagon’s ability to predict the future budgetary consequences of high-complexity weapons development programs is laughable. If you were a Russian with proud and painful memories of the bloodletting, terror, bravery, and patriotic myths of the 1812, WWI, WWII, and the Cold War, how would you react when a possible adversary becomes hell-bent on shoveling money into such a program? Would you believe it is for deterrence only? These nuclear modernization programs need time (at least 3-5 years) to gestate — i.e. to impregnate the US body politic with a politically-engineered flow of money to as many congressional districts as possible. Once the congressional districts become addicted to its money flows, the nuclear modernization program will become unstoppable for the same reason the F-35 is unstoppable, and an escalating cold war will be necessary to justify them over the long term. Should that happen, we won’t see the end of Cold War II in our lifetimes. Think of the front-loading, political engineering power games (as I explained in a 1990 pamphlet and again in congressional testimony in 2002) as a programmatic right-to-life politics, Pentagon style. Hence the central warmongering role of think tanks, the press, and self-styled foreign policy mandarins described by Dennis Kucinich’s this excellent opinion piece . Their hyped hysteria will distract attention away from the Pentagon’s systematic front-loading operation. The goal is to buy time for the Pentagon and its contractors to infiltrate the political system to build the politically-engineered social safety net of dependent congressional districts from the bottom-up. I’ve seen this kind infiltration operation before (in the late 1970s and again in early 1990s) from the perspective on the inside of the “giving end,” just as Members of Congress like Dennis Kucinich have seen the effects of the politically engineered result before from the “receiving end.” The name of the game is to create an unstoppable one-two punch for higher defense budgets — as became evident in the early 1980s and late 1990s. Unless it is nipped in bud, this will become evident again in the next few years. Finally, once the Cold War II gets legitimated, and tensions are heightened by Russia’s natural reaction to the US nuclear “modernization” program, it will become easier to inflate conventional threats (say to the new NATO countries in Eastern Europe) to create the permanent state of fear needed to justify a high-tech, high-cost expansion and modernization of our conventional military forces — e.g., an F-22 follow-on, more Ford-class carriers, a new family of armoured vehicles, etc. So, yes, money is at the center of America’s sleepwalk into a New Cold War — and time is rapidly running out to stop the current generation of sleepwalking mandarins who think they can steer the ship of state while the boys and girls in the boiler room of the Pentagon are busy cutting the cables connecting the steering wheel to the rudder.

25651,"As Evening Commute Gets Darker, It Also Gets More Dangerous, Officials Warn - The New York Times","The end of daylight saving time next month will create a more dangerous evening commute as people find it harder to see on the streets, New York City officials say. The earlier sunset and darkness have been linked to an increase in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured by vehicles, according to an analysis by the city’s Department of Transportation of data from 2010 to 2014, the most recent years available. In the latest instance, a    woman was fatally struck by a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus on Friday evening as she walked in Lower Manhattan. The bus driver was arrested and charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian, according to the police. As a result, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio will announce on Thursday a new $1. 5 million “dusk and darkness” safety campaign that will include radio and television advertisements, signs on buses, and billboards to warn drivers as well as pedestrians to be more careful, especially at that time of day. In addition, the police will target drivers during those hours who speed, fail to yield to pedestrians, text on cellphones or block bike lanes. The campaign is part of the city’s Vision Zero plan, a set of proposals that aims to eliminate fatalities and injuries caused by vehicles. This year, as of Monday, there have been 192 traffic fatalities, 114 of which involved pedestrians  —   the rest involved people in cars, bicyclists and people on motorcycles. In contrast, there were 177 traffic fatalities during the same period last year, of which 96 involved pedestrians. “To meet our ambitious Vision Zero goals, especially during the more dangerous reality of this season’s evenings and nights, we have focused our efforts even further,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. “Our key Vision Zero agencies have teamed up to not only study crash data, but to work closely together and make critical adjustments that we believe will literally save lives. ” It is the first time that the city has adjusted traffic policy based on time and seasonal changes, though in the past, it has stepped up traffic enforcement at the beginning of the school year or during the winter holidays. Nationally, a similar pattern has emerged, according to Michael Flannagan, an associate research professor at the University of Michigan, who has studied traffic safety nationally. “You do see a big jump in pedestrian fatalities and injuries in the evenings in the fall when the change back to standard time makes the evenings suddenly darker,” he said. Dr. Flannagan added, however, that the increase was not caused by a disruption of sleep from the time change, but instead “simply because it was dark” and it becomes harder for drivers to see pedestrians. Conversely, in the spring, when the transition to daylight saving time makes the evenings suddenly lighter, there is a corresponding decrease in pedestrian fatalities and injuries nationally, he said. The city’s traffic analysis showed that between 6 p. m. and 7 p. m. during the week  —   the prime commuting time  —   the weekday hourly average rate of severe injuries and fatalities involving pedestrians rose to 2. 44 in   or nearly triple the average rate of 0. 84 in August. “It’s certainly much more dangerous at dusk both for pedestrians and motorists,” said Dr. Daniel M. Laby, the director of the Sports and Performance Vision Center at the State University of New York College of Optometry. Dr. Laby added that even people with normal eyesight could not see as well at dusk because the human eye does not adapt well to decreasing light. Vision becomes less sharp, with less contrast and depth perception. In addition, he said, there is typically more glare from uneven lighting as the sun sets, and more visual distractions compared with nighttime, when headlights help to focus attention. “You put this all together,” Dr. Laby said. “It almost makes you not want to go home at night. It’s risky. ” Amy Cohen, 51, a social worker in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said that, sadly, she was only too aware of the dangers on city streets at dusk. Her son, Sammy Eckstein, 12, was fatally struck by a van not long after 5 p. m. in October 2013 while retrieving a ball that had rolled into the street. Ms. Cohen, who helped found the advocacy group Families for Safe Streets, said that while she supported the new campaign, the city also needed to take more steps to permanently redesign streets and slow traffic, such as widening sidewalks, increasing the crossing time at traffic lights, narrowing driving lanes and installing traffic cameras that record speeding vehicles. “Education is a good start but much more needs to be done,” she said. The city’s traffic analysis found that dusk and evening crashes were often the result of drivers trying to make turns. In particular, there was a surge in severe injuries and fatalities from November to March, according to the analysis. “Through education and enforcement with our sister agencies, every driver needs to learn about the limited visibility of this season and the dangers of fast turns, especially in the evening hours,” said Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner. Ms. Trottenberg said the problem was underscored last year by a rash of nine pedestrian fatalities  —   three of which occurred during daylight hours  —   in the eight days after daylight saving time ended on Nov. 1. In total, there were 138 pedestrian fatalities in 2015, the lowest number since 1910. As part of the new safety campaign, city officials will seek to publicize the dangers of dusk and darkness through radio ads that are timed to run during the evening commute, and cards that will be handed out urging drivers to slow down, especially when turning, and to “look closely” since “more pedestrians are hurt in crashes around sunset than any other time. ” Pedestrians are also reminded to watch for turning cars. In addition, the city is specifically contacting people at senior centers, and taxi and livery drivers.",1
25654,"Iraqi Army Seen as Ill Equipped to Retake Mosul From ISIS, Despite U.S. Aid - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   An exhausted and   Iraqi Army faces daunting obstacles on the battlefield that will most likely delay for months a   major offensive on the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, American and allied officials say. The delay is expected despite American efforts to keep Iraq’s creaky war machine on track. Although President Obama vowed to end the United States’ role in the war in Iraq, in the last two years the American military has increasingly provided logistics to prop up the Iraqi military, which has struggled to move basics like food, water and ammunition to its troops. Without the help, Americans commanders said, the offensive against Mosul would most likely fail. Americans are ferrying equipment and spare parts directly to the battlefield by cargo plane, helping arrange purchases of ammunition for   equipment and pressing the Iraqis to adopt measures to improve a supply chain that would run over 200 miles from Defense Ministry depots in the Baghdad area to Mosul. But no matter how hard the Americans push, the Iraqis can go only so fast. The pace of ground operations is likely to become even slower in the summer’s searing heat and during the coming holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims often fast during the day. Much of the Iraqis’ equipment needs to be repaired or replaced, and many Iraqi units will require additional training before attacking Mosul. “A lull won’t be sexy, but it’s the hard and important work that needs to be done to generate combat power,” said Col. Steven Warren, who until this month was the top American military spokesman in Iraq. The logistical challenges are far from the only hurdles facing the United States as it struggles to deal with the complexities in Iraq. Iran is supporting tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, police officers and Shiite militiamen who are preparing for an assault against the Islamic State in the Sunni city of Falluja in western Iraq, which has raised fears of a sectarian blood bath. Prime Minister Haider   of Iraq ordered the Falluja offensive over the objections of American advisers who urged him to focus on the bigger prize of Mosul, Iraq’’s   city and the de facto headquarters of the Islamic State in Iraq. But after a series of Islamic State suicide bombings last month killed hundreds in Baghdad, Mr. Abadi faced growing domestic pressure to stop the threat in Falluja, which is about 35 miles west of the capital. The Iraqis have long struggled with their military organization, but the problem worsened in the summer of 2014 when the Islamic State seized wide swaths of territory in western and northern Iraq and stole much of the military’s trucks and other equipment used to move troops and supplies. Since then, American logisticians have been working directly with the Iraqis to try to improve their supply chain. The problem has been complicated because the Iraqi military is made up of a mix of equipment and weapons from the Soviet era, the United States and elsewhere. The Iraqis rely on an antiquated maintenance system that sends broken equipment to Baghdad to be fixed, and they do not have an automated system for tracking their supplies. American advisers have worked to overhaul the maintenance system, encouraging the Iraqis to develop the ability to do repairs closer to the battlefields. The Americans have also arranged for other countries in the coalition fighting the Islamic State to give or sell the Iraqis the ammunition and parts they need to keep their military functioning. The Americans have also taken the lead in preparing detailed schedules for moving troops, training them, and delivering ammunition and equipment to the battlefield. “As the Iraqis move farther away from their depots at places like Taji, they will have to adopt similar sustainment practices,” Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, the top American commander in Iraq, said in an email, referring to a city just north of Baghdad. “To do this requires a good deal of reorganization. ” “Extending the reach of the Iraqi security forces also requires logistics planning,” General MacFarland said. “We are doing a great deal of that for the Iraqis because we recognize that Rome wasn’t built in a day. ” The Iraqis have had some success against the Islamic State since December. This year, for the first time since the fighting against the Islamic State began in August 2014, the terrorist group has not gained any additional territory. The Iraqis have reclaimed the city of Ramadi and several smaller cities in western and northern Iraq. Backed by   air power, Iraqi forces have regained 45 percent of the territory the Islamic State seized in 2014, American commanders say, an increase from 40 percent at the beginning of the year. Bombing by Americans and other European countries involved in the fight, including the British and French, has halved the Islamic State’s oil production and cut its revenues between 30 and 50 percent, American intelligence analysts say. But the analysts have concluded that many of the areas that the Iraqis need to reclaim  —   including Mosul  —   will be more difficult to seize because the Islamic State has controlled them for a longer period and has heavily fortified them. The Islamic State has roughly 19, 000 to 25, 000 fighters, about half in Iraq and half in Syria, Colonel Warren said. Most of the 10, 000 to 12, 000 in Iraq are concentrated around Mosul, in the Tal Afar area, and elsewhere in Nineveh Province. The expected delay in the Mosul offensive highlights the frustrations of the Obama administration with the seesaw nature of the Iraqi ground campaign. But Mr. Obama and his commanders decided that it was better for Iraqis to control the tempo of the counteroffensive, even with its fits and starts, than for the United States to reclaim a leading combat role that Mr. Obama thought he had ended when he withdrew all American troops in 2011. “Logistics is one of the things we are most concerned about, so we look to do everything we can to keep the timeline on track,” said Col. Christopher Garver, the United States spokesman for the coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq. “Yes, there’s a danger of things slipping to the right on the calendar, as we say, pushing into the future, but we have a whole team working to prevent that from happening. ” In interviews, Iraqi commanders in the Falluja operation acknowledged some of the challenges facing their troops, but they sought to discount the impact on their operations. “We have a lot of experience fighting in the hot weather and are used to it, but, yes, fighting in the heat is a very difficult thing,” said Abdul Wahab   the commander of military operations in Falluja. “The enemy in front of us is ISIS, and it is not an easy enemy and we don’t want to give it the impression that our fighters are getting tired in the hot weather. So no matter high the temperatures are, we will continue fighting until liberating Falluja entirely. ” The commander of operations in nearby Ramadi said the military would make some tactical adjustments because of the heat but not stop fighting altogether. “Let’s be frank: In Iraq, even if we go to market we get annoyed by the heat,” said the commander, Ismael  . “But we must beat the heat and put the appropriate plans in place to get over it and continue operations. We will take advantage of the dawn times to attack. ” Asked for a description of the air campaign in the coming months, Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. the American air war commander, said he would keep the pressure on the Islamic State, even if the tempo of the Iraqi ground offensive eased. “As the Air Force, we’re able to strike ahead of the ground maneuver,” General Brown said. “I know where the next fight is going to be. Then what I want to be able to do is actually soften up that with strikes ahead of the ground maneuver. ”",1
25656,Re: Do You Believe In Miracles?,"Do You Believe In Miracles? By Michael Snyder, on November 9th, 2016 
We have never seen anything like this in the history of American politics. Donald Trump’s shocking victory on election night is nothing short of a modern day miracle. Several weeks ago I told my readers that it would take the biggest political miracle ever in order for Trump to win, and I had been strongly urging them to vote , but even early on election night I was skeptical that Trump could actually pull it off. Initially the results coming out of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio looked rather ominous, and a lot of Trump supporters were freaking out. But those initial numbers strongly reflected early voting results, and those results typically favor Democrats. Once the Election Day numbers started rolling in, it was clear that there was a massive unanticipated wave of momentum for Trump. 
Once I saw that Virginia was going to be much more tightly contested than anticipated and that Trump had jumped out to a lead in Michigan, I realized that Trump had a really good shot at winning the whole thing. Over Skype I told a stunned audience that the numbers were looking really good for Trump, but it was still so early in the evening that I don’t know if a lot of people believed me. And I certainly didn’t blame them, because I could hardly believe it myself. 
Once Trump took the lead for good in Pennsylvania, I knew that it was all over. My wife and I looked at each other in disbelief, and we are still trying to come to grips with a future that we didn’t think was possible. 
Watching Donald Trump speak to the American people after he had been declared the winner was a surreal experience. At this moment, it still doesn’t seem real to me that he could become the next president of the United States a little more than two months from now. But at this point it looks like that is precisely what is going to happen. 
After it was all over, I kind of stumbled around my home lost in my thoughts. I was happy, confused, hopeful, stunned and pensive all at the same time. Like so many others, what I thought I knew about politics turned out to be wrong. But in other ways, the election of Donald Trump has confirmed so much of what I know to be right about America. 
Ultimately, it was the American people that decided this election, because the elite were doing their best to absolutely bury him. 
Never before has the mainstream media been so openly biased against a major party presidential candidate. For months on end they dumped sewage on Trump, but it didn’t work. 
Never before has a major party presidential candidate faced a civil war in his own party on the eve of the election. A whole host of big names in the Republican Party publicly announced that they would not vote for Trump, but it didn’t work. 
Never before have we seen a bigger October surprise than the lewd tape from 11 year ago that came out and shocked the world. That would have instantly killed the campaign of any normal politician, but it didn’t kill Trump’s campaign. 
From the very beginning it seemed like Trump was at war with almost everyone, and somehow he came out on top in the end. 
He beat the Bushes and the Clintons. 
He beat the Republicans and the Democrats. 
He beat Hollywood and the mainstream media. 
He beat the pollsters and the pundits. 
He beat the never-Trumpers and the billionaire donors. 
He beat Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Jay Z, Beyonce, George Clooney, Matt Damon and Lebron James. 
He beat the forces of globalism, elitism and political correctness. 
He beat CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and Barack Obama. 
He beat them all. 
Of course Donald Trump is not perfect and he is not going to be a perfect president. 
But this is about as perfect a moment as you are going to get in American politics. 
Donald Trump took on the entire American political universe and he won. 
We have never seen anything like it before, and I doubt we will ever see anything like it again. 
And I want to apologize for being so skeptical to those that kept trying to tell me that Trump was going to win. As a former attorney, I was trained to be skeptical and to look at the cold, hard numbers. And the cold, hard numbers kept telling me that a Trump victory was nearly impossible. 
I kept strongly urging people to vote, particularly because the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency was absolutely horrifying for me personally, but I was not optimistic. 
In hindsight, perhaps we all should have recognized that the signs were there. For example, it seems a very strange “coincidence” that Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. This is a man that appears to have had a date with destiny, and we shall see what happens in the months to come. 
Yes, there will be great challenges ahead, but those discussions are for another day. 
Today I am just happy. 
I am happy that the American people have elected a man that I will be proud to call president. 
And I am happy that we are not going to have to endure four years under the most wicked, vile and corrupt politician that the United States has ever seen. 
Against all odds, Donald Trump won. 
At this point I am not exactly sure what comes next for America, but things are definitely looking a lot brighter today than they did yesterday. BATTLE LOG 
You missed one!

Mondo, same thing for the Brexit. Either people don’t tell what they think when they are polled or the polls are manipulated/fixed by the MSM. 
Coming year there will be elections in several countries in Europe and it is possible that extreme right (= Eurospeak for real Republicans) will win more votes than the polls suggest. If for instance Marine le Pen wins the French presidency, that may end the euro and even the EU. 
Fact is that ordinary people are fed up with the political elites. df NJ

Trump VS. The American Aristocracy 
David VS. Goliath. Satirist 1976 
America definitely made the wrong move. It saddens me that Hillary was unjustly vilified. Hillary is devoted to her country. Also she is a champion of woman’s rights, the environment, and tolerance. 
When it comes to understanding the importance of protecting the environment Trump is at the apex of ignorance. He wants to undo the Clean Air act and dismantle the Paris accord. Global warming is a serious issue that must be dealt with urgently. 
The unemployment rate is at 4.9% Since the height of the recession the unemployment rate has dropped by more than half. 
America has enjoyed over 6 straight years of private sector job growth. 
Yearly GDP has finished positive for 6 straight years. 
PMI indexes have been consistently over 50. A reading over 50 indicates expansion. 
Obamacare is a gift from God. It will end up saving thousands of lives. 
Millions of Americans have become more cognizant of the importance of respecting and not marginalizing minorities. 
Weekly unemployment claims have been under 300K for over 80 straight weeks. The longest such streak in over 40 years. 
Americans everywhere should thank Obama for his faithful service to America. kfilly

Michael……maybe now you can start blogging about more inspirational stories and ideals, and try to bring hope to people rather than the gloom and doom that pours from your sad self. Maybe you need to be on an antidepressant, it’s worth looking into at least.

I think people finally woke up. K 
Yes, far more than the numbers indicate.You see I believe the landslide was so great it overcame the fraud and the manipulation. I believe that God in his mercy, gave us one last chance. A chance to turn from the evil this Country has become.If we waste this chance. I would not expect, to be thrown another lifeline. kfilly 
I still see something far more sinister behind this. I want to see if Trump sticks to the Constitution or becomes a tyrant by usurping it. As far as the sinister part, I potentially see conservative/freedom movements getting set up for the coming global economic collapse. The freedom Brexit movement and now the election of Donald Trump ensure two of the biggest players in the Western World can wreak a lot of havoc on the global economic system. I fear the elite will collapse the economy in 3, 2, 1. These people have back up plans for their plans. They will not give up simply because their favorite puppet lost. I see a potential future where freedom lovers get blamed for the destruction of the economy that was intentionally destroyed by globalists (communists) which is similar to what Nazi Germany did to the Jews. greanfinisher . 
I wouldn’t describe the Trump upset as a miracle, but rather a travesty. Well, you people bought him so now you will have to pay. chris

Spot on Michael and Maranda! My wife and I felt the same watching and listening to the last minute skeptics on Fox, Juan Williams and a few others. We believed from near the beginning of Donald Trumps campaign that He was God’s chosen. I don’t think anyone who believed in Donald Trump didn’t feel at times because of the overwhelming criticism by, as you listed, so many Americans in all venues of people, even Christians! We all prayed more for Donald Trump and his family more than any other candidate for president, and for good reasons, as you stated. Right On! Now, the work begins though. As in everything good, it never comes easy. Our Lord is now requiring of us to pray not only for Donald Trump and his safety, safety of his family, but for all America to put their trust in God once again, not for just a few weeks or a month as in the past. This will be a long time of diligent prayer, humility and trusting the Lord. The enemy is dug in already in America and will not give up easily. We need to focus on Jesus, pray for revival and especially for our own protection. The hardest thing I see right now is for us to ” Love our enemies and pray for them.” But that is what our Lord Jesus Christ is asking us to do. We must trust and obey Christ in this command. If we don’t do it now in the divided USA, we will not succeed. Our heavenly Father has given us all we need to succeed in loving our enemies who are against the Lord’s will. He has given us His Spirit, the Holy Spirit to overcome. We have the commissioned assignment, the Authority of Christ…now we just need to get with it immediately. The Victory is in Jesus. The Lord bless America and His people, in Jesus name. JC Teecher 
I am with you on the thumbs up for Michael and Meranda. They are true soldiers on the battlefield for Christ. another true soldier on the political battlefield is our new (soon to be) Vice president of the US of A, Mike Pence. 
He is the chosen one sent to right the wrongs of the evil doers that have controlled the White House, and rented it out for personal gain since 1988. 
When a man and his family walks up on the stage, and first thing said is to thank God and for His mercy and grace, then we have a true leader. Trump is not an evil man, but prefers to keep his spiritual self separate from his business self. The potus position for him is “all” business, and with a strong amount of compassion for all peoples, from all walks of life, and all skin colors. 
He is not a selfish man or a hater of women like the left wants to portray him. he will do all he can to right the ship that has been listing for almost 30 years. he just may be the deadly wound spoken of in Revelation. Since one of the Seven heads is the USA, as a superpower, it could be that it becomes the one head that becomes a wound or set back to the NWO system. Voila’ and Eureka. Why hasn’t any of the so-called evangelical leaders thought of this or received the unction from the Spirit, as to this possibility? 
Because they haven’t asked, is the only reasoning I can come up with. Anyways, the times are bringing about prophetic enlightenments and revelations, that has never been before, and we are entering the last of days..aks asin the last of years, decade and some. Amen! Satirist 1976

Jackie-O was a gracious and very lady like woman, and put up with Jack’s adulterous affairs and such, but none have been as stunning and intelligent as Melania Trump.

25657,The Fed Is Searching for a New Framework. New Minutes Show It Doesn’t Have One Yet. - The New York Times,"The quandary facing the Federal Reserve this summer is the same as it was back in the spring, and winter, and last fall: By traditional guideposts like the unemployment rate, it looks as if it is time for the Fed to be raising interest rates. Yet the global economy seems to be locked in a     world in which raising interest rates is at best unnecessary and at worst dangerous. That tension was on display Wednesday in the minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting, which raised the possibility of rate increases as early as September. As is the Fed’s standard practice, the description of the meeting was stripped of names and summarized in bloodless language. But reading between the lines, it is clear there was a rich debate over what factors the Fed should be weighing, and how, in making its next move. Some policy makers saw evidence that the labor market was getting tighter, the result of which should be higher wages and prices. Others “saw little evidence that inflation was responding much” to the low jobless rate. With inflation low, “many judged it was appropriate to wait for additional information” before considering raising rates. “Several” suggested there would be plenty of time to react if inflation did rise and so wanted to defer raising rates until it was clear inflation was holding near its desired target of 2 percent. “Some other participants” viewed the economy as already being near full employment, meaning that another rate increase “was or would soon be” warranted. The result of all that debate at the July   meeting was affirming the status quo  —   agreement that “it was prudent to accumulate more data in order to gauge the underlying momentum in the labor market and economic activity” and that “members judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on incoming information. ” That continues a volatile year for market perceptions of when, and how much, the Fed might make the shift toward tighter money. At the start of 2016, it seemed nearly certain the Fed would follow up its interest rate increase in December with more of them this year. Weak growth in the United States and abroad, combined with a volatile first half of the year in financial markets, drove the odds of a rate increase down to 12 percent by July 1, based on prices in futures markets. That had gone back up to 53 percent by Tuesday. (It edged down very slightly, to 51 percent, after the release of the minutes Wednesday.) In public comments this week, Fed officials have suggested that markets are underrating the possibility of a September rate increase. “We’re edging closer toward the point in time where it will be appropriate, I think, to raise interest rates further,” the New York Fed president, William C. Dudley, told Fox Business on Tuesday. The Atlanta Fed president, Dennis Lockhart, told reporters that one or two rate increases were possible this year and that economic data would suggest strong consideration of raising rates next month. The Fed faces a profound question: Is the basic framework it has used over the last generation to set monetary policy the correct one in this moment, or has something fundamental shifted in the global economy that calls for a new one? If this is just a standard economic expansion that has been slowed by some bad luck, then the central bank’s usual rules apply. That rule book involves examining how close the economy is to functioning at its full potential, and trying to move up and down to keep on that steady path so as not to let inflation get out of control. By that standard, it is past time to be raising interest rates. The unemployment rate is 4. 9 percent, around the level the Fed believes is sustainable in the longer term, and job growth is strong. Inflation was 1. 4 percent over the last year, according to the index the Fed watches most closely, not too far below the 2 percent the Fed aims for. And mainstream economic models project it should rise in the years ahead given the relatively tight job market. But there is plenty of evidence  —   and a vocal contingent of officials inside the central bank  —   that the usual way of thinking isn’t quite working. For one thing, the rest of the world is growing so slowly that it is creating a steady downdraft on inflation and growth that may mean the usual worries about inflation don’t apply. Rising wages for American workers over the last year or so have been counteracted by other forces preventing inflation from taking off, including falling energy prices and slack demand for goods and services from overseas. Moreover, any step the Fed takes toward tightening the United States money supply seems to be offset by an opposite reaction elsewhere. With other countries easing monetary policy with ultralow interest rates and quantitative easing, small moves to tighten American policies have created outsize rallies in the dollar, which disadvantages American exporters and creates ripple effects through the global credit system. That has led Fed officials to steadily mark down both their expectations for how quickly to raise   interest rates and where those rates will settle in the longer run  —   meaning they think that low rates may be more a new normal than a   aberration. The San Francisco Fed president, John Williams, raised the possibility this week of more significant change in how the Fed thinks about its goals, even raising the possibility of increasing the Fed’s 2 percent target for inflation, or of the Fed’s replacing its inflation target with a goal for nominal gross domestic product. The Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will have a prime opportunity to elaborate on her own views in this debate next week, in a scheduled speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. But for now, Fed officials are openly discussing the need to approach policy choices differently, and holding off from interest rate increases as a result, but not quite concluding that the old rules no longer apply and embracing an alternate approach. It’s an awkward place for a central bank to be, but until Ms. Yellen and her colleagues can find consensus around what the new framework for monetary policy ought to be  —   or conclude that the old models still have some usefulness  —   the uncertainty evident in the July minutes won’t change.",1
25660,Walmart Rewrites Its E-Commerce Strategy With $3.3 Billion Deal for Jet.com - The New York Times,"Traditional retailers have spent more than a decade and billions of dollars trying to transform their    businesses for the online shopper. Yet Amazon and other digital upstarts continue to lap them. Now Walmart, the world’s largest retailer and the dominant player of   stores, is turning to someone else’s technology and talent. On Monday, the company said it was buying Jet, the   online bulk retailer, for $3. 3 billion, the largest deal ever for an   company. The purchase, and a shuffling in the executive ranks that comes with it, are Walmart’s clearest acknowledgments yet that its online strategy is not working. It also sends a strong message to the rest of the consumer and retail industry: When it comes to competing against Amazon, not even the mightiest    stores can go at it alone. “The other retailers are going to be looking up to it and saying, ‘You know, absolutely, we’ve been failing at doing this,’” said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst at Thomson Reuters. “Bringing in an expert might be the key to it. ” Over all, Walmart’s   sales have stalled. The online business grew just 7 percent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company’s president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was “too slow. ” Most recently, the company has focused much of its online strategy on expanding its curbside grocery pickup business. Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Walmart. com has fallen short and could energize its sagging online growth. Walmart said Jet offered it access to “urban and millennial customers,” two groups that the retailer’s large rural footprint has been slow to attract. Walmart said on Monday that Jet had added more than 400, 000 users monthly. Jet says it uses a complex formula to offer items 10 to 15 percent less than competitors by adjusting prices based on the quantity of products bought at once. The company relies heavily on suppliers, and Walmart offers more pricing power and potentially better distribution operations through its vast network of warehouses across the country. Still, the $3. 3 billion figure is   given that Jet. com started selling products barely a year ago. Walmart is not valuing Jet. com solely based on traditional metrics like profitability, which the   does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something  —   or someone  —   else: Marc Lore. Mr. Lore, a serial   entrepreneur who started Jet. com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon’s edge. “If you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn’t be worth what they’re paying for it,” said Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm covering venture capital. “They’re trying to inject Marc and probably some of the veterans on his team, and try and help Walmart figure this out. ” Mr. Lore, 46, will take over responsibility for Walmart. com in the United States and will continue running Jet, which will operate separately, Mr. McMillon said in a call with reporters. Walmart will be “thoughtful” about how it merges the two companies, and will focus on expanding both brands in the   he said. Mr. Lore will replace Walmart’s current top   executive, Neil Ashe, who will leave the company. Mr. McMillon said that now was the “natural inflection point” for a leadership change and praised Mr. Ashe for doing an “outstanding” job building the company’s online business. Mr. Lore   a company, Quidsi, that grew into a collection of   websites, including Diapers. com and Soap. com. The company was sold to Amazon in 2010 for more than $500 million. He stayed at Amazon for two years, then left to figure out a new project. Investors lined up to back Mr. Lore on his next venture, Jet. com. He raised more than $200 million before the company sold a single product, and more than $500 million over all. In the latest funding in November, the company was valued at $1. 5 billion, according to data compiled by CB Insights. He is seen as someone who can bring a unique approach when it comes to   according to Adam Silverman, an analyst at Forrester, a research firm. “Marc has been a creative force within the industry, creating pretty innovative business models, including Jet. com,” Mr. Silverman said in a phone interview. “He’s proven that he can create businesses from scratch, and Walmart needs a bit of that entrepreneurship within their   business. ” Recently, though, Jet. com has struggled. The company has been quickly burning through much of the cash it has raised, spending freely on hiring and marketing. To attract new customers, it dropped its annual $50 membership fee. The strategy has caused Jet. com to lose money on every shipment, something that would not have been reversed for another five years, Mr. Lore predicted in a 2015 interview. Connecting with Walmart could help Jet. com amplify its business without the stress of private   in a market that has become more challenging for unprofitable companies. Under the terms of the deal, Walmart will pay $3 billion in cash, a portion of which will be distributed to Jet. com stakeholders over time, while $300 million will be paid in Walmart stock over time, according to a statement released by the companies on Monday. Walmart said that while it would incorporate some of Jet’s ideas and talent into Walmart. com, Jet would remain a separate brand, too. Yet both sites will continue to face a daunting reality: Amazon. com continues to wallop the competition. Amazon does more business online than any other retailer, yet still reports   growth. In 2015, Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent to $79. 3 billion, while Walmart reported that global annual   revenue had risen 12 percent, to $13. 7 billion, in its latest fiscal year. For Walmart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O’Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody’s. “We view this as a race for second,” Mr. O’Shea said. “Amazon’s lead is so great that it’s going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them. ” While legacy retailers continue to struggle with how best to compete online,   represents only 8 percent of all sales, Mr. O’Shea said. “All Walmart has to do is be better than the other    guys,” he said.",1
25661,Dozens of U.S. Missiles Hit Air Base in Syria - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump said Thursday night that the United States had carried out a missile strike in Syria in response to the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attack this week, which killed more than 80 civilians. “Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the air base in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched,” Mr. Trump said in remarks at his    estate in Florida. “It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. ” Mr. Trump  —   who was accompanied by senior advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist Reince Priebus, his chief of staff his daughter Ivanka Trump and others  —   said his decision had been prompted in part by what he called the failures by the world community to respond effectively to the Syrian civil war. “Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically,” the president said, referring to President Bashar   of Syria. “As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen, and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies. ” The Pentagon announced that 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired at Al Shayrat airfield in Syria. The missiles were aimed at Syrian fighter jets, hardened aircraft shelters, radar equipment, ammunition bunkers, sites for storing fuel and air defense systems. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, told reporters Friday morning that the strike “deals a significant blow to relations between Russia and America, which are already in a poor state,” according to the news agency RIA. Mr. Peskov said the strike did nothing to combat international terrorism. “On the contrary, this creates a serious obstacle for building of an international coalition to fight it and to effectively resist this universal evil,” he said. Fighting terrorism was Mr. Putin’s stated goal when he dispatched the Russian military to Syria in September 2015, though its main effect has been to shore up Mr. Assad. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Russian forces had been notified in advance of the strike. “Military planners took precautions to minimize risk to Russian or Syrian personnel located at the airfield,” he said. No Russian aircraft were at the base, military officials said. “We are assessing the results of the strike,” Captain Davis added. “Initial indications are that this strike has severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure and equipment at Shayrat airfield, reducing the Syrian government’s ability to deliver chemical weapons. ” The cruise missiles struck the airfield beginning around 8:40 p. m. Eastern time on Thursday, and the strikes continued for three to four minutes. According to Captain Davis, the missiles were fired from the destroyers Porter and Ross in the eastern Mediterranean. Talal Barazi, the governor of Homs Province, where the base sits, told Reuters early Friday that ambulances and fire trucks were scrambling to respond to fires there. Administration officials described the strikes Mr. Trump ordered as a graphic message to the world that the president was no longer willing to stand idly by as Mr. Assad used horrific weapons in his country’s long civil war. To do otherwise, they said, would be to essentially bless the use of chemical weapons by Mr. Assad and others who might use them. “This clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters in Florida. He said Mr. Trump had concluded after seeing the results of the chemical attack that the United States could no longer “turn away, turn a blind eye. ” “The more we fail to respond to the use of these weapons, the more we begin to normalize their use,” Mr. Tillerson said, a thinly veiled reference to President Barack Obama’s decision to refrain from strikes in 2013. Mr. Tillerson added that the United States had not informed Mr. Putin about the coming missile strikes and that Mr. Trump had not spoken with the Russian leader in the hours afterward. The decision to act came with a swiftness that took observers of the new president by surprise. After being briefed on the chemical attack shortly after it occurred, American intelligence agencies and their allies worked quickly to confirm the source of the chemical weapons, administration officials said. In Washington the next day, the president convened a meeting of senior members of his National Security Council, where military aides presented him with three options. Officials said Mr. Trump peppered them with questions and directed them to focus on two of those options. On Thursday, after Mr. Trump traveled to Florida for his dinner with President Xi Jinping of China, he convened what officials described as a “decision meeting” with his top national security aides  —   many of them with him at    and others on secure video screens from Washington. After what aides called a “meeting of considerable length,” Mr. Trump authorized the missile strikes before starting the dinner with Mr. Xi. “It was important during the president’s deliberations,” said H. R. McMaster, the president’s national security adviser, to weigh the risk of action against the “risk of this continued, egregious, inhumane attacks on innocent civilians with chemical weapons. ” A military official said the attack was at the more limited end of the military options presented to Mr. Trump on Thursday by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The official said the strike was intended to send a signal to Mr. Assad about the United States’ intention to use military force if he continues to use chemical weapons. It was the first time the White House had ordered military action against forces loyal to Mr. Assad. Mr. McMaster said the missile strikes would not eliminate Mr. Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons, but would degrade it. He said the United States military had specifically sought to avoid hitting what it believes is a facility containing more sarin gas at the airfield. He said the military had also sought to “minimize risk” to citizens of other countries  —   specifically Russians  —   who might have been in the area at the time. The Pentagon on Thursday night released a graphic showing the flight track of Syrian aircraft as they left the Shayrat field on Tuesday and carried out the chemical attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province. The speed with which the Trump administration responded  —   and remarks earlier in the day by American officials who said that options were still being considered  —   appeared intended to maximize the element of surprise, and contrasted sharply with the Obama administration’s methodical scrutiny of a military response. It was Mr. Trump’s most important order so far for the use of force  —   virtually all of his administration’s other operations in Syria, Yemen and Iraq have been carried out under authorization delegated to his commanders  —   and appeared intended to send a message to North Korea, Iran and other potential adversaries that the new commander in chief was prepared to act, sometimes on short notice. Two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, praised the strike in a statement and called for Mr. Trump to go further: to “take Assad’s air force  —   which is responsible not just for the latest chemical weapons attack, but countless atrocities against the Syrian people  —   completely out of the fight. ” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel also expressed support. Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Tuesday. Administration officials said the strike was intended to put Mr. Tillerson in a position to tell the Russians that they should use their leverage to ensure that Mr. Assad’s government does not carry out more chemical weapon strikes and to facilitate a diplomatic resolution to the civil war in Syria. The events of Thursday night marked a dramatic turnabout for Mr. Trump, who until this week had displayed virtually no interest in a deeper role for the United States in the long, bloody conflict. Well before he became a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump pleaded with Mr. Obama in 2013 to avoid the kind of strike that he has now ordered. As recently as this week, before seeing images of dying children gasping for breath during the chemical attack, Mr. Trump and his top aides hardly appeared inclined to more forcefully assert American power in the country. But the change seemed to emerge during a Rose Garden news conference Wednesday afternoon, as Mr. Trump reacted to news, and images, of the attack with horror and a newfound desire to respond. In less than 24 hours, his shift was reflected at the Pentagon, where senior Defense Department and military officials began drafting options for Mr. Trump, and in Florida, where Mr. Tillerson hinted at a strong response to Mr. Assad’s actions. In remarks late Thursday evening to a small group of reporters, recorded and quickly broadcast to the world, Mr. Trump announced his decision. “We ask for God’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world,” Mr. Trump said solemnly. “We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who passed. And we hope as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will in the end prevail. ”",1
25666,Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs To Israel,"Videos Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs To Israel Israel is using a fragment of an old tax bill is meant to undercut Muslims', and UNESCO claims to the important site. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A view of the Dome of the Rock Mosque in the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City, Monday, May 2, 2016. 
While the UNESCO resolution which recognized the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a “Muslim holy site of worship” was barely reported around the world, and considered fairly non-controversial, Israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. 
And the Muslims may have a huge, ancient mosque that has been a key part of Islam for 1,300 years, but Israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave, which they’re pretty sure is a far more conclusive document, since it mentioned the word Jerusalem and was written in Hebrew. 
Israeli officials have claimed that the UNESCO resolution, in recognizing the mosque as important to Islam, was tantamount to denying Israel’s absolute and eternal control over the entire city of Jerusalem. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem “was and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.” 
The al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory.

Contrary to the propaganda of the Judeo-fascists, the Palestinians DID have a state – called Canaan, that lasted for over 2000 years and built the city of Jerusalem – until they were destroyed by ethnic cleansing and genocide by the J6ws for the purpose of stealing the land now called Palestine. The survivors of that genocide are in Palestine and scattered throughout the region. 
When the Jews were finally driven out of Palestine, for treachery and terrorism, the great majority of them went North into Eastern Europe. Some scattered into other regions of the Middle East and North Africa, where they integrated and lived among the other tribes before and after the transition to Islam. The J6ws that went into Europe, over the centuries, were driven from state to state because of their conspiracies, treachery, arrogance, usury and all of the other characteristics they exhibit today in Palestine and on Wall and Fleet Streets. 
After the Jewish “kingdom” in Canaan was defeated, by the Assyrians in 351 BCE, the Jews never were allowed to rise to power again. Their >600 year reign in Canaan was marked by oppression of non-Jews, marauding and attacks on the most heavily traveled trade route in the world. After 66 BCE, for a time, Rome made the error of trying to allow the Jews limited self-rule, which ended in rioting, conspiracy and terrorist attacks by the J6ws on both Romans and the other tribes of Palestine. 
From the time of the final defeat of the last Jewish terrorists in 135 CE, until the early 20th Century, Palestine was one of the most peaceful regions of the world. It benefited from a lack of obvious oil resources – avoiding attention from Western greed. The only upsets during that almost 2000 years were the defeat of the Byzantines (the remnants of the Roman Empire), the European “Crusades”, a couple of Asian incursions and a few tribal squabbles. 
By 1900, Palestine was one of the most productive agricultural regions of the Middle East and a major exporter of citrus and olives. Its “Jaffa Brand” oranges were famous throughout the world (I’ve never eaten one. But, I have a crate with most of the paper label in my office). 
The Jew claim that all of the land they obtained in Palestine was purchased is ludicrous. They went to some FORMER land owners of the DEFUNCT Ottoman Empire and paid them something to sign bills of sale to land they didn’t own and had probably never seen. 
I read one report by a British officer in the Palestine Mandate. His unit was sent to investigate an attack on a small Palestinian town. They found the ENTIRE POPULATION of the town slaughtered, many of the bodies mutilated and most of the women and girls raped, with some tortured. The animals, including house pets, had all been killed and many mutilated. After further investigation, the British Army concluded that the massacre had been carried out by Irgun terrorists and that Menachem Begin almost certainly led the slaughter. This is the sort of sub-human that Jews “elect” as their Prime Minister. 
The Zionists have the delusion that they can re-write history to suit their cult. They are sadly mistaken. Lonny 
Not contrary to you being a racist @$$hoIe, you spend every day of your life whining about Jews for several hours a day. tapatio

Mint Press, you disingenuously fail to state the true objection of Israel to the UNESCO vote. That it fails to also include the Jewish origins of the site. In fact, the resolution appears to state that Jerusalem is only holy to Muslims. It negates the prior Jewish and Christian connections. That is the objection, not the inclusion of the later Muslim connection. tapatio Lonny 
TapaDILDO still trying to get negative attention from Jews. Little crybaby never got enough attention from mommy. tapatio 
Since the Jews invaded and committed GENOCIDE in Canaan/Palestine about 3000 years ago – yup, they were there before Muslims or Christians. The Christians appeared 2000 years ago and the Muslims came 1400 years ago. But, since the Jews’“claim” to Palestine is based on their genocide of the Canaanite kingdom after the Jews were driven from Egypt, that claim would seem to be shaky at best. 
And, ancient Judaism became functionally extinct at tel Megiddo in 135 CE – 1881 years ago. The “Jews” that we see today are the descendants of Eastern European barbarians who were converted to Judaism by the few survivors of their terrorist war against Rome. 
Today’s Jews and their ancestors NEVER saw Palestine until Rothschild’s Zionist disease. The FEW (about 17,000) Jews that lived in Palestine before Zionism were ALL Europeans, living on European charity – mostly in Jerusalem. They were ultra-orthodox whose entire function was to “study” the Torah and pornographic Talmud – the NEVER worked. 
Humanity really needs to comprehend fully that this cult, that has been driven from more than 100 countries in the last 2000 years is NOT “PERSECUTED”. JUDAISM IS A TOXIC CULT-URE THAT LIVES ON THE BLOOD OF OTHERS – VAMPIRES, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, VOLTAIRE AND OTHERS. 
GREAT JEWISH LEADERS 
There goes Tapadildo inventing a fake history again, as always. 
Jews didn’t invade. Jews lawfully immigrated under the Ottomans and so did the Arabs. 
Jews committed no genocide there. The Arab population grows at one of the fastest rates on the planet. 
There hasn’t been a Canaan for 3500 years… but you’re whining about it as though it was last week. No mention of all the genocides against non-Muslims over the last 1400 years? How about the ones this year?

NO Jew has more than a trace of Semitic DNA. That was almost eradicated at tel Megiddo in 135 CE. The traces that exist in SOME Jews are from the terrorists that managed to escape from Megiddo (all men) and breed with the barbarians of Southeastern Europe.

Well, then America belongs to the native, original peoples, so, the rest of us should start packing their bags and go back to where we come from. Same thing with Europe. It was a Roman Empire, so, Europe belongs to the Italians then. Can the “israelis” stop the crap of ancient documents? in which world they think they are living? During thousands of years everybody invaded, killed and squattered each other. So, if we go for history, NOTHING BELONGS TO NOBDY!! Michael Hess 
The supreme irony is that Islamophobes are always going on about how backwards Muslims are wanting to protect their culture going back to ancient times, yet Hasbarians do the same thing. 
Meanwhile, as the article states, there is simply nothing at all that is controversial in this resolution, the scandal is as made up as Benghazi and Ambassador Stevens and Hillary. 
The fact is, there was no state of Israel prior to May 14th, 1948. So these people need to get it out of their heads because you cannot claim sovereignty to a single dunam of land before that. Of course, as more people learn that Palestine was an officially and legally created country twenty-four years before Israel, things are getting far more interesting. 
Worse yet still for Israel, the rogue state has no legal hold over Jerusalem at all in the real world not rules by little fragments of papyrus and religious imagery back when people did not bathe and thought that the stars were oil lamps that someone lit up each night. 
UN Security Council resolution 476 and about eighteen others prove that Israel holds no legal sovereignty in Jerusalem whatsoever, this is precisely why the US Embassy Act of 1995 is waived every six months because by moving the embassy, that would put the US in violation of more than several Security Council resolutions. Lonny 
Sorry, moron. You are always lying about Jews. Who’s criticizing Arabs for protecting their culture? You mean, when there are those among them who ATTACK OTHER cultures that you think is an attack on Islamic culture? You think it’s a preservation of Islamic culture when ISIS began perpetrating a genocide on the Yzidis? 
There is something controversial, numbnutted goatface… They refuse to use the Jewish terms for the places, even though those are the terms which have been the prolific ones for thousands of years. 
The fact is, goatfaced Jew-hater… Israel was around 2000 years ago, so there was a state of Israel before May 14, 1948, and Jews have been praying at the Western Wall for millennia. And they certainly had sovereign land there historically. You really are one heck of a Jew-hating loser, goatface! 
Israel has plenty of legal hold over Jerusalem in the real world, goatface. See how it exercises its legal hold? Who are you claiming it belongs to? You know who REALLY never had sovereignty over a single dunum of the land over there? Palestinian Arabs. 
Your misapplication of what you think are laws are not credible. And misusing the 4th Geneva Convention is what is not valid. ivanacardinale 
You puke violence through your words, and also ignorance. Violence is the weapon of the people that has no reason. We know very well the history of that land. And you seem to invent it. And I laugh when i read every year about “Israel Independence”. From whom got the independence? From which Empire? the Palestinian? the Roman? the ottomans? or from the UN? Most countries has battle for years for independence against an empire. Israelis got it through what? as far as we know, you are being called the haggana? Lonny 
Actually, the only reason people puke around you is they see your face. 
Violence is what you use to defend yourself, stupid. You come on here and attack me… I never attacked you… and then you want to pretend you’re innocent on top of it! What a dumb hypocrite! 
You clearly don’t know the history if you think there wasn’t a Jewish kingdom there before. 
Israel got independence from a region which hadn’t been sovereign in 2000 years. The last people who ruled it were the Ottomans, and very temporarily the British. There were no nation-states in that region at the time. Suddenly, there were, because that’s how the Allies set it up after beating Germany and the Ottomans. 
Didn’t know that, did you?

TRANSLATION OF FEIGLIN’S FACEBOOK POST………….. 
With God’s Help Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Mr. Prime Minister, We have just heard that Hamas has used the ceasefire to abduct an officer. It turns out that this operation is not about to be over any too soon. The failures of this operation were inherent to it from the outset, because: a) It has no proper and clear goal; b) there is no appropriate moral framework to support our soldiers. What is required now is that we internalize the fact that Oslo is finished, that this is our country – our country exclusively, including Gaza. There are no two states, and there are no two peoples. There is only one state for one people. Having internalized this, what is needed is a deep and thorough strategic review, in terms of the definition of the enemy, of the operational tasks, of the strategic goals, and of course, of appropriate necessary war ethics. (1) Defining the enemy: The strategic enemy is extremist Arab Islam in all its varieties, from Iran to Gaza, which seeks to annihilate Israel in its entirety. The immediate enemy is Hamas. (Not the tunnels, not the rockets, but Hamas.) (2) Defining the tasks Conquest of the entire Gaza Strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters. (3) Defining the strategic goal: To turn Gaza into Jaffa, a flourishing Israeli city with a minimum number of hostile civilians. (4) Defining war ethics: “Woe to the evildoer, and woe to his neighbor” In light of these four points, Israel must do the following: a) The IDF [Israeli army] shall designate certain open areas on the Sinai border, adjacent to the sea, in which the civilian population will be concentrated, far from the built-up areas that are used for launches and tunneling. In these areas, tent encampments will be established, until relevant emigration destinations are determined. The supply of electricity and water to the formerly populated areas will be disconnected. b) The formerly populated areas will be shelled with maximum fire power. The entire civilian and military infrastructure of Hamas, its means of communication and of logistics, will be destroyed entirely, down to their foundations. c) The IDF will divide the Gaza Strip laterally and crosswise, significantly expand the corridors, occupy commanding positions, and exterminate nests of resistance, in the event that any should remain. d) Israel will start searching for emigration destinations and quotas for the refugees from Gaza. Those who wish to emigrate will be given a generous economic support package, and will arrive at the receiving countries with considerable economic capabilities. e) Those who insist on staying, if they can be proven to have no affiliation with Hamas, will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel, and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem. f) When the fighting will end, Israeli law will be extended to cover the entire Gaza Strip, the people evicted from the Gush Katif will be invited to return to their settlements, and the city of Gaza and its suburbs will be rebuilt as true Israeli touristic and commercial cities. Mr. Prime Minister, This is the a fateful hour of decision in the history of the State of Israel. All metastases of our enemy, from Iran and Hizballah through ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood, are rubbing their hands gleefully and preparing themselves for the next round. I am warning that any outcome that is less than what I defined here means encouraging the continued offensive against Israel. Only when Hizballah will understand how we have dealt with Hamas in the south, it will refrain from launching its 100,000 missiles from the north. I call on you to adopt the strategy proposed here. I have no doubt that the entire Israeli people will stand to your right with its overwhelming majority, like myself – if only you will adopt it. With high regards, respectfully,

ב”ה 
ראש הממשלה בנימין נתניהו 
אדוני ראש הממשלה זה עתה נודע כי החמאס ניצל את הפסקת האש בכדי לחטוף קצין. מסתבר שהמבצע הזה לא עומד להיגמר כל כך מהר. הכשלים במבצע היו טמונים בו מתחילתו כי: 
א – אין לו מטרה נכונה וברורה. ב – אין מעטפת מוסרית ראויה התומכת בחיילינו. 
מה שנדרש כעת הוא להפנים שאוסלו נגמר, שזו ארצנו – רק ארצנו, כולל עזה! אין שתי מדינות ואין שני עמים – יש רק מדינה אחת לעם אחד. 
בעקבות ההפנמה הזו נדרש שינוי אסטרטגי עמוק ויסודי – הן בהגדרת האויב, הן בהגדרת המשימה, הן בהגדרת היעד האסטרטגי וכמובן – בהגדרת מוסר הלחימה הנכון והנדרש. 
1 – הגדרת האוייב האויב האסטרטגי הוא האסלאם הערבי הקיצוני על כל גרורותיו מאיראן ועד עזה המבקש לחסל את ישראל כולה. האויב בעין הוא החמאס. (לא המנהרות, לא הרקטות – החמאס) 
2 – הגדרת המשימה: כיבוש הרצועה כולה וחיסול כל הכוחות הלוחמים ותומכיהם. 
3 – הגדרת היעד האסטרטגי: להפוך את עזה ליפו. עיר ישראלית פורחת עם מינימום אזרחים עוינים. 
4 – הגדרת מוסר הלחימה:“אוי לרשע ואוי לשכנו” 
לאור ארבעת הנקודות הללו על ישראל לבצע מיד את הפעולות הבאות: 
א – צה”ל יגדיר שטחים פתוחים על גבול סיני ובסמיכות לים בהם תתרכז האוכלוסייה האזרחית- הרחק מהשטח הבנוי ואזורי השיגור והמנהור. באזורים אלו יוקמו מחנות אוהלים עד לאיתור יעדי הגירה רלוונטיים. אספקת החשמל והמים לאזורים שהיו מאוכלסים – תנותק. 
ב – האזורים שהיו מאוכלסים יופגזו בכוח אש מקסימלי. כל מתקני החמאס האזרחיים והצבאיים, אמצעי הקשר והלוגיסטיקה – יחוסלו עד היסוד. 
ג – צה”ל יבתר את הרצועה לאורכה ולרחבה, ירחיב מאוד את הצירים, ישתלט על אזורים שולטים וישמיד קיני ההתנגדות במידה וייוותרו כאלה. 
ד – ישראל תחל באיתור מדינות ומכסות הגירה לפליטי עזה. המעוניינים להגר יזכו בחבילת סיוע כלכלית נדיבה ויגיעו לארצות הקולטות עם יכולת כלכלית משמעותית. 
ה – מי שיתעקש להישאר ויוכח כי אין לו כל קשר לחמאס, יידרש לחתום באופן פומבי על הצהרת נאמנות לישראל ויקבל תעודת זהות כחולה בדומה לזו של ערביי מזרח ירושלים. 
ו – עם שוך הקרבות יוחל החוק הישראלי בכל הרצועה, מגורשי גוש קטיף יוזמנו לשוב ליישוביהם והעיר עזה ובנותיה ייבנו כערי תיירות ומסחר ישראליות לכל דבר. 
אדוני ראש הממשלה! זוהי שעת הכרעה גורלית בימיה של מדינת ישראל. כל גרורות האויב, מאיראן והחיזבאללה ועד דע”ש והאחים המוסלמים – חוככות כעת את ידיהן בהנאה ומכינות עצמן לסבב הבא. 
אני מתריע שכל תוצאה שהיא פחות ממה שהוגדר כאן, משמעותה עידוד המשך האופנסיבה נגד ישראל. רק אם יבין החיזבאללא כיצד טופל החמס בדרום, ימנע מלשגר את 100,000 הטילים שלו – מצפון. 
אני קורא לך לאמץ את האסטרטגיה המוצעת כאן. אין לי כל ספק שכמוני, עם ישראל כולו יעמוד ברוב מוחץ לימינך – אם רק תאמצנה.

Jew-boy, you fail to comprehend that I couldn’t care less about your ad hominem drivel. It only reinforces the reality that Judaism, especially the Zionist form is a FILTHY DISEASE – just like its cells – YOU. 
For more than 3000 years, from their expulsion from Egypt and from the money changers Jesus is said to have driven from the temple steps to the predatory global Rothschild banking cartel to the lowest loan shark in NY, to the Internet propaganda shill, the IDF thug and Mossad scum and their rabbis preaching the delusion of a “chosen” master-race, this predatory cultl posing as religion and ethnicity has most closely resembled a malignant cancer metastasizing through our world, corrupting and spoiling everything it touches. 
When one or a few cultures find a particular culture toxic, it could be bigotry. When almost EVERY culture finds Judaism toxic, JUDAISM IS TOXIC . 
Every expulsion of Jews below was preceded by widespread and extreme crime and abuses BY JEWS. The Jews have been expelled from more than 100 countries. Listed below are ONLY expulsions that could be directly linked to RAMPANT JEWISH CRIME. They had NOTHING to do with “persecution” of Jews. However, often, innocent Jews suffered because of guilt by association with their predatory culture. 
The expulsions of Jews were acts of SELF-PRESERVATION by non-Jewish cultures.

25667,Angela Merkel Accepts Responsibility for Party’s Losses in Berlin Election - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   Throughout the almost 11 years Chancellor Angela Merkel has been in office in Germany, her nation has been reassuringly stable in the midst of tumult throughout Europe, maintaining a steady economy and stolidly predictable politics. But it is becoming increasingly clear that Ms. Merkel’s decision last year to allow hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the country has set off aftershocks that continue to upend politics in Germany and beyond. And on Monday, a day after voters in Berlin dealt her party another stinging loss in the second regional vote in two weeks, she was left to convince voters that she was not out of touch with their anger and anxiety over the flood of immigrants. “If I could, I would turn back time by many, many years to better prepare myself and the whole German government for the situation that reached us unprepared in late summer 2015,” Ms. Merkel said after meeting with leaders of her party, the   Christian Democratic Union. “Nobody, including myself, wants a repeat of this situation. ” In a speech that was at times personal, Ms. Merkel took responsibility for her party’s   showing in balloting in Berlin. She also acknowledged a role in the party’s humiliating   finish, behind the Social Democratic Party and a nationalist party, Alternative for Germany, two weeks ago in her home state,  . She pledged to work to regain voters’ trust. Since her decision to welcome refugees from Syria and other poor and   countries, the effects across Germany and Europe have only grown more intense. The main political beneficiary of the backlash in Germany has been Alternative for Germany  —   a trend that has played out across much of the Continent, where     parties are on the rise in many countries. The question of how far to go in assimilating the migrants has exposed a deep rift between Eastern and Western Europe, and the economic and cultural challenges of absorbing so many people have contributed to rising nationalism in countries including France, the Netherlands and Austria, and to Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. On Monday, instead of gathering with President Obama and other world leaders in New York at the United Nations, Ms. Merkel stayed home to shore up her political standing a year before general elections, deflecting questions about whether she would even run again. The chancellor defended her decision as “absolutely right,” but she acknowledged that “ultimately, it led to a time when we did not have enough control over the situation. ” She pointed to legislation and efforts since then aimed at helping to regain control and integrate the new arrivals. Her conservative party’s loss on Sunday in the state elections in Berlin, she acknowledged, was the result of the mass arrival of refugees and a resulting protest vote against the party. But there were several other reasons, she said, including the emergence of “a   world, where people are not necessarily interested in facts, they are just following their feelings. ” The   behavior of voters and politicians this year  —   most stunningly seen in Britain’s vote to leave the European Union  —   has upset faith in opinion polls and in institutions developed since World War II to contain the   or   thought that is now attracting populist support. Many Germans found their country’s chaotic response to the influx of migrants worrying to the point that they felt a threat, whether real or perceived, to their personal stability and prosperity, said Constanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “To many, the German state appeared not to be capable of handling this wave of migrants,” Ms. Stelzenmüller said. “That raised questions of safety of their own personal life. That showed, right or wrong, their country’s institutions were not as strong as people thought they are. The shock of the initial wave is still in people’s bones. ” Ms. Merkel said it was vital to recognize the economic roots of insecurity, suggesting that globalization and new trade patterns could have profound effects on people, from the German farmer to the young population of Africa. Making that connection, she argued, is essential for a decent future. Germany “won’t let itself be rattled to its core,” she said, adding, “That didn’t happen even in such a   indeed extremely unsettling, year as the past one. ” Germans in rural areas  —   where Christian Democrats hold more sway than in cities  —   are deeply worried that even if they are doing well, they have lost faith in their prospects for the future, she said. “When the young people all leave the villages, when one can only with difficulty sell one’s home,” she noted, there is drama and uncertainty “which thicken into a fear, or at the very least a worry about the future. ” After 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the spread of freedom across Europe, she said, made it seem that Europe was on a victorious course and could not be overtaken. Now, she added, “something has developed where we notice that in the globalized world, we are not necessarily in the forefront. ”",1
25668,A Supreme Court Not So Much Deadlocked as Diminished - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court has gone into hibernation, withdrawing from the central role it has played in American life throughout Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’s decade on the court. The court had leaned right until the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. According to the conventional wisdom, the court is now evenly divided and large numbers of    ties are inevitable. But the truth is more complicated. The court is not deadlocked so much as diminished. The justices will continue to issue decisions in most cases, but many will be modest and ephemeral, like Monday’s opinion returning a major case on access to contraception to the lower courts for further consideration. “We’re seeing an even greater push for broad consensus and minimalist rulings, and a majority of the court seems willing to go along with that approach,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. Opinions vary about whether a Supreme Court that does little is good for the nation, but the trend is certainly a testament to Chief Justice Roberts’s leadership. He has long said he favors narrow decisions endorsed by large majorities, and it turns out that goal is easier to achieve on an   court. In public remarks in April, Justice Elena Kagan described a court that is now “especially concerned” about finding ways to achieve consensus. “All of us are working hard to reach agreement,” she said. “I give great credit to the chief justice, who I think in general is a person who is concerned about consensus building, and I think all the more so now,” she added. “He’s conveyed that in both his words and his deeds. ” The resulting minimalism is good news, said Eric J. Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University. “Yesterday’s contraception case shows why an equally divided court among liberals and conservatives has many benefits for our country, and also why the    claims by many court watchers about an   court are overstated,” he said Tuesday. In the contraception case, Zubik v. Burwell, No.   the court’s unanimous unsigned opinion urged lower courts to find a compromise, one that Professor Segall said “may lead to a better solution for both sides. ” The opinion sought to bridge the gap between religious groups that wanted no part in providing contraception coverage to their female employees and the Obama administration, which wanted to make sure the coverage remained easily accessible “This type of consensus decision making,” Professor Segall said, “is a welcome change from the normal political and sometimes partisan approach we normally see in important   opinions, where one side can impose its own agenda on the parties and the country. ” Republican senators have vowed not to confirm President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, saying the choice of a replacement for Justice Scalia should go to the next president. That would leave the court   for many more months. In the meantime, the   Roberts court is in important ways dominated by the court’s   liberal wing, which can now block efforts to move the law to the right. A prime example came in March, when the court deadlocked in a case that had threatened to cripple   unions, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, No.  . When the case was argued in January, the court’s conservative majority seemed ready to say that forcing public workers to support unions they had declined to join violated the First Amendment. Justice Scalia’s questions were consistently hostile to the unions. There are many other ways to assess the shift in the balance of power since Justice Scalia’s death. Four days before he died, the court blocked the Obama administration’s effort to combat global warming by regulating emissions from   power plants. The vote was 5 to 4, with the court’s conservatives in the majority. Just three weeks later, in a significant victory for the Obama administration, Chief Justice Roberts refused to block a different regulation limiting emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from   power plants. And last Thursday, a deadlocked court refused to vacate a stay of execution of an Alabama man, Vernon Madison, with the court’s four conservatives saying they would have let the execution proceed. Had Justice Scalia lived, Mr. Madison would almost certainly have died. The court has three major decisions left to decide before the justices take their summer break: on abortion, immigration and affirmative action. In the first two, tie votes would leave in place conservative appeals court decisions but set no Supreme Court precedent, allowing the justices to return to the broader legal issues in later cases. At the argument in March in the abortion case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, No.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that it could be useful to return the case to the lower courts to develop more evidence. That approach would yield another minimalist decision. When the court agreed in January to hear the immigration case, United States v. Texas, No.   conservatives hoped for a major ruling on presidential power. They were particularly heartened when the court took the unusual step of asking the parties to address the question of whether Mr. Obama had violated his constitutional obligations to enforce the nation’s laws. But when the case was argued before eight justices in April, a deadlock seemed likely and a sweeping decision on executive power was off the table. There is one case in which the court could still take a step to the right, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, No.   a challenge to the university’s   admissions plan. Justice Kagan has recused herself, based on her work on the case as United States solicitor general. That means Justice Scalia’s death eliminated rather than created the possibility of a tie. All of this term’s blockbusters were added to the court’s docket before Justice Scalia died. Since then, the justices have agreed to hear just seven cases, and none of them concern issues of broad public interest. Several involve intellectual property and procedural issues unlikely to produce ideological splits. The next term, which starts in October, is thus shaping up to be a thin and quiet one. Until the next justice arrives, the Supreme Court will remain on the sideline of American life. “The court will be on the front pages less often,” said David A. Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago. “The justices won’t have so much trouble with relatively technical cases, and some of those can be very important to the legal system,” he added. “But they will either stay away from the most controversial cases or do what they’ve been doing over the last few months  —   deciding those cases in a way that postpones, maybe indefinitely, the day of reckoning on the most divisive questions. ”",1
25669,"A Malaysian Political Cartoonist on Facing His Fears, and Prison, for Art - The New York Times","HONG KONG  —   When protesters disrupted an art exhibition by Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque, a political cartoonist, at the George Town Literary Festival in Malaysia on Saturday, he assumed that the police would want his help identifying those responsible. Instead, said Mr. Zulkiflee, who goes by the name Zunar, he was questioned by the police, detained for a day and informed that he was under investigation for producing cartoons that purportedly defamed Prime Minister Najib Razak. It was not the first time Mr. Zulkiflee, who already faces nine charges of sedition and is barred from leaving the country, has courted trouble with his pen. His cartoons frequently target Mr. Najib, who is accused of taking millions of dollars from a state investment fund. Mr. Najib has faced widespread calls to resign, most recently at an anticorruption demonstration this month that drew tens of thousands in Kuala Lumpur, the capital. In an interview, Mr. Zulkiflee, 54, discussed how social media has become an increasingly important channel for political dissent in Malaysia, and why he continues to use his art to investigate corruption and injustice without dwelling too much on the risks. Do you feel that the climate for creating your art has changed in recent years? People are really not happy with the government  —   more and more people  —   but there are laws stopping them from being in the front row and being very, very vocal. So they will use any type of form, of tool, to express their view or protest. So now, social media is something that is a very effective tool. People are starting to be creative in social media by using drawings, cartoons, posters or video clips. The government feels this is very dangerous for them, so they start to introduce laws. As an example, the Sedition Act was introduced by the British government in 1948. And in 2012, the prime minister made an open pledge to Malaysia that he would abolish the Sedition Act, live on TV. But he uses it more now, and it’s going to be strengthened.  Do these kinds of regulations affect your creative process?  I’m facing so many laws three laws have been used against me so far. But one thing I keep in my mind  —   one very, very important thing  —   is that the biggest enemy for anyone in the world is  . For me, talent is not a gift but a responsibility. People ask, do I have fear? Yes, I have fear, I’m human. But responsibility is bigger than fear. So I don’t want to really think what the government will do next to me. I just concentrate on what I’m supposed to do. That can help me continue and draw more cartoons. If I start to think about law, I start to think about prison, I start to think about government action, I will definitely start to practice    —   and this is no good. So I will draw as usual.  Your cartoon about the person in chains with the Sedition Act around his neck and the Penal Code as handcuffs   …     That’s a self portrait.  What were you trying to say there?  You see that three laws, which I mentioned earlier, have been used against me. First is Sedition Act, second is penal code, third is Printing Presses and Publications Act. I was chained with these laws  —   hand, neck and leg. But if you go to my shirt, you can see my philosophies there. Among them are “I will keep drawing until the last drop of my ink” and “How can I be neutral   …     even my pen has a stand. ” So this drawing shows that even though there’s a law to stop me, even though there’s a regulation to stop me, even though they tried to ban my books  —   actually, not tried, they already banned my book  —   I will keep drawing. That is why, without hands, I still use my mouth or my teeth to draw. This is to show the philosophy and determination to fulfill my duty as a cartoonist in Malaysia.  You have said that you are expecting a 10th sedition charge. Even without that, you’re looking at upward of 40 years as a maximum prison sentence. How do you feel about the prospect of potentially having to serve so much time? You have to understand this is a politically motivated charge, it’s got nothing to do with the law. In Malaysia, it’s very, very difficult for us with politically motivated charges. You just need to look at what happened to the opposition leader’s case in Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim. Even though he had strong evidence and witnesses, it was political. It will be very difficult for us to fix that. But this is a very important case for me to create awareness around the world about the state of freedom of expression and human rights in Malaysia. I’m going to face it.",1
25670,Fear Spurs Support for Health Law as Republicans Work to Repeal It - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump and congressional Republicans appear to have accomplished a feat that President Obama, with all the power at his disposal, could not in the past seven years: They have galvanized outspoken support for the Affordable Care Act. People who benefit from the law are flooding Congress with testimonials. Angry consumers are confronting Republican lawmakers. And Democrats who saw the law as a political liability in recent elections have suddenly found their voice, proudly defending the law now that it is in trouble. Thousands of people across the country held rallies over the weekend to save the health care law, which Republicans moved last week to repeal with a first but crucial legislative step. A widely circulated video showed Representative Mike Coffman, Republican of Colorado, eluding constituents who had wanted to meet with him to express their concerns on Saturday at a community event in Aurora, Colo. Rallies on Sunday to save the health law drew robust crowds around the country. “We are here today  —   thousands strong in Boston, and at more rallies all across this country  —   because we will make our voices heard,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, told a crowd outside Faneuil Hall in Boston. “If Republicans try to rip health care out of the hands of millions of Americans, we will fight them every step of the way. ” And progressive groups are planning a     bus tour to fight the repeal effort, starting Tuesday. With their quick strike on the law in the first days of the new Congress, Republicans had hoped to begin the repeal process before a backlash could develop or opposition could be organized. But congressional Republicans are at risk of losing the message war, especially since they are fighting on two fronts. On one side, the   has repeatedly lobbed disruptive demands at them, such as his insistence that they prepare a replacement health bill almost immediately. To that, he added a new promise over the weekend: that the Republican version would provide “insurance for everybody. ” On the other front, Democratic lawmakers have taken to quoting grateful constituents to personalize what can be an arcane legislative fight: Bryce in Seattle Randy in Rhinelander, Wis. Nicole in Hockessin, Del. and many more. The focus of public attention appears to be shifting from the   defects of the health care law to the plaintive pleas of people terrified of losing insurance if the law is repealed. “I want to thank President Obama from the bottom of my heart because I would be dead if it weren’t for him,” Jeff Jeans, a   man from Sedona, Ariz. who described himself as a lifelong Republican, told Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Thursday at a    meeting televised on CNN. Republicans acknowledge their constituents’ concerns, but they say supporters of the health law are manufacturing them. Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia, blamed Democrats for “amping up anxiety” with “fear mongering. ” “The anxiety is real,” Mr. Woodall said, “but it’s real based on the failures of the president’s health care law. ” Republicans will soon face a new challenge: maintaining anger at “Obamacare” without Mr. Obama in the White House to stir their passions. Regardless of its provenance, the law’s support has until now received less attention. Appearing on the NBC News program “Meet the Press” five days after Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, predicted that as people learned about the law, “it’s going to become more and more popular. ” Around 20 million Americans have gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s online insurance marketplaces or through its expansion of Medicaid, and enrollment has continued to grow. About 11. 5 million people have signed up for marketplace plans or had their coverage automatically renewed for this year, nearly 300, 000 more than at this time last year, the Obama administration said this month. But the popularity bounce never came. Public opinion remains deeply divided, with the law no more popular today than when it was passed. In December, according to a monthly tracking poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 46 percent of Americans had unfavorable views of the law, up from 40 percent in April 2010. The share with favorable views slipped to 43 percent, from 46 percent in April 2010. “In the short term, the A. C. A. has been a political disaster for President Obama and the Democrats,” Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a health policy adviser in the Obama White House from 2009 to 2011, said in a 2014 book. As Congress took a first step last week toward rolling back Mr. Obama’s signature domestic achievement, Mr. Trump celebrated. “The ‘Unaffordable’ Care Act will soon be history!” he said on Twitter. Some Democrats distanced themselves from the Obama administration after HealthCare. gov crashed on its debut in 2013. More recently, with premiums soaring and insurers defecting from the Affordable Care Act marketplace in many states, Democrats were hard put to defend the law, which was passed without any Republican votes. But as Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans race to repeal the law, Democrats are taking a more aggressive stance. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, told the story of Sonja L. Podjan, a    blueberry farmer in Watervliet, Mich. who was in pain for several years until she got insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which covered the cost of surgery to repair a severe tear in the meniscus of her right knee. In an interview, Ms. Podjan said she “started freaking out” after the election and sent an email to Ms. Stabenow. She said she was “flabbergasted” when she heard back from the senator’s office. Ms. Podjan said that the premium for an insurance policy covering her and her husband was about $1, 000 a month, but that they paid just $62 after receiving government subsidies provided under the law. “I am scared to death we will lose our insurance, and what happens then?” said Ms. Podjan, who reported that she and her husband had medical expenses totaling $41, 000 in the past two years. Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, told the story of a constituent, Kevin Kargacin, whose daughter Amber takes drugs costing more than $60, 000 a year for multiple sclerosis. “Kevin is scared because the cost of treating Amber’s disease is so high,” Mr. Udall said. In an interview, Mr. Kargacin said he wrote to Mr. Udall because “we are terrified that without the Affordable Care Act, Amber could be denied insurance or run into lifetime caps on expenditures for her treatment. ” Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said: “Many Minnesotans have contacted me in the last few months, frightened about the future of their health care coverage. I heard from a man in Orono. His wife was diagnosed with cancer this year. On top of everything his family is now dealing with, he is terrified that his family will lose coverage if there is a repeal. ” Whether such concerns reflect a change in public opinion is difficult to say. Over the past six years, Republicans have collected stories from hundreds of constituents complaining that their insurance policies were canceled, their premiums have shot up and their deductibles are so high that the insurance is nearly worthless. “Scott from Hickory has had his health insurance canceled three times now, disrupting his continuity of care,” said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina. “Patricia from Kernersville now has a whopping $6, 550 deductible. ” Representative Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio, reported that a constituent named Kimberly had difficulty obtaining treatment for a brain tumor because, she said, “virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance. ” The differing accounts are not necessarily in contradiction. Some people have benefited from the law while others have seen their coverage disrupted. Republicans said the Obama administration had been slow to recognize and acknowledge problems with the Affordable Care Act. Administration officials said insurance rate increases of 25 percent or more were not a significant problem because   people could get subsidies to help defray the cost  —   even though millions of people buying insurance on their own do not receive subsidies. The administration insisted that insurance markets were “stable and vibrant” even as large insurers pulled out of Affordable Care Act exchanges where they were losing hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2015, the administration said that “claims data show healthier consumers” in the exchanges, but some insurers disputed that assessment, saying they had not seen an influx of healthy people to help cover the costs of sick people.",1
25671,"In ‘Glory,’ Britney Spears Promises Pleasure, but Offers Nothing Personal - The New York Times","Britney Spears strives mightily to be   on “Glory,” her ninth studio album. But Ms. Spears has plenty of back story she’s a    working mother, the headliner in her own Las Vegas spectacle and a performer who has weathered teenage fame, backlash, public meltdowns and wave after wave of tabloid headlines. “Glory,” her first album since 2013, is her latest attempt to reclaim her place on the pop charts, which are now crowded with younger performers who have studied her the way Ms. Spears studied Madonna. Her latest strategy is relentless and unambiguous: Stick to sexy. Ms. Spears’s albums in the 2000s, like “Blackout” and “Femme Fatale,” showed that she and her advisers know something about the dynamics of celebrity and media, as she toyed with provocation and selective revelation. Hits like “I’m a Slave 4 U” and “Toxic” teased at the power dynamics of lust and romance. But “Glory” has shallower aims it’s all   and promises of pleasure, as if the only intimacies that matter are physical ones. “To know each other   your love all over me,” she coos in “Invitation,” the breathy, Janet    Glass enticement that opens the album. For songwriting and production, Ms. Spears drew from the talent pool that also supplies material for her pop peers and rivals, among them Selena Gomez, Nick Jonas, Fifth Harmony, Demi Lovato and, yes, Madonna. Her vocal producer, Mischke, has a résumé stretching from Michael Jackson and the Spice Girls to Gwen Stefani. Unlike Will. i. am, the producer who filled Ms. Spears’s 2013 album “Britney Jean” with   clichés, her new collaborators make musical space for her. They look toward the melting tones, echoey hollows and   constructions of recent releases by Ms. Gomez and Justin Bieber. Heavy bass lines and kick drums are all but banished, perhaps to return in remixes. Instead, syncopations are sketched in the midrange by handclaps, keyboard chords, electronic plinks or bits of guitar. The album’s peppiest song, “What You Need,” matches a track that sounds like     Motown to a vocal that flaunts its electronic warbles. Throughout the album, Ms. Spears’s voice  —   no doubt still processed, but far less obviously robotic  —   has emphatically returned to the foreground. In verses, she recalls the flirty singer, with the knowing scratch in her   voice, who conquered 1990s pop. She sounds more involved, more present, than she has in a decade. Choruses, like those in “Make Me  …   ” sometimes layer her voice into an ecstatic choir. Yet even with her voice upfront, Ms. Spears isn’t singing anything particularly personal. “Glory” is one long, often catchy, announcement of availability. Ms. Spears declares “nobody should be alone if they don’t have to be” in the   “Do You Wanna Come Over?” “Slumber Party,” which eases into a   chorus, promises, “We ain’t gonna sleep tonight. ” In “Love Me Down,” she says, “You say we don’t talk any more  ’m thinking we talk too much,” preferring communication by touch. A song on the deluxe version of this album, “Change Your Mind (No Seas Cortés),” sets out to seduce a guy who is “trying to be a gentleman” and doesn’t want to “cross the line” by urging, in Spanish, “don’t be polite,” adding “I’m   desperate. ” And often, behind the sleek electronics and the tidy vocals, a certain desperation comes through. “Just Luv Me,” one song, begs. Ms. Spears’s previous album, “Britney Jean,” was her commercial nadir, and the singles preceding the release of “Glory”  —   “Make Me. .. ” and “Pretty Girls,” a collaboration with Iggy Azalea that’s not on this album  —   weren’t smashes. Another preview, “Private Show,” was introduced alongside a new perfume of the same name. It casts the singer as a stripper: “Slide down my   me spin it and twerk it. ” Working for others, the songwriters behind “Glory” have come up with other messages, particularly for female singers. Teen pop now abounds with   messages of doubts overcome, of pride, of confidence, of empowerment that doesn’t depend on pleasing a guy. Ms. Spears, with turbulent decades of experience, might connect her life with her songs, as divas do, and find herself forging a stronger bond with listeners. But “Glory” doesn’t make that reach. It’s as if, after all her fans and fame, Ms. Spears can still only present herself as that most generic pop commodity: a sexpot.",1
25674,"Donald Trump, Aleppo, FARC: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The presidential race gained new intensity as both candidates faced increased scrutiny. For Hillary Clinton, it’s about her embrace of a strategy of counterattack on women who said during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign that they’d had sexual encounters with him. And for Donald Trump, tax documents from 1995 show that he declared a loss so big that it might have allowed him to avoid paying taxes for the next 18 years. (Our reporter found the documents in her mailbox.) Separately, his foundation has also been ordered to stop soliciting donations in New York because it is not registered to do so. ____ 2. The   candidates will be tasked with defending their running mates during Tuesday’s debate, which will be their lone      this election. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia has already faced some tough questions about Mrs. Clinton, but he hasn’t been forced to play cleanup the way that Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana has for Mr. Trump. But it may just come to down to this: “Don’t screw up  —   that’s the goal of a V. P. debate,” a Republican communications specialist said. ____ 3. The United States formally suspended its talks with Russia about the war in Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry threatened to do so last week as Russia and Syria carried out a brutal bombing campaign in   parts of Aleppo, where 275, 000 civilians  —   including about 100, 000 children  —   are trapped. Plans for jointly targeting jihadists have also been shelved. ____ 4. President Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, will almost certainly have to change to survive  —   even Mr. Obama has acknowledged that more work is needed. But how it will change is dependent on the election. Both parties agree that for too many people, insurance plans are too expensive and inaccessible. Mrs. Clinton wants to increase government involvement in an effort to change that Mr. Trump would seek to decrease it. ____ 5. A surprise defeat  of a referendum on a peace deal left Colombia in shock, but both the government and the rebel group it warred against for decades vowed they would not go back to fighting. Many Colombians felt that the deal was too lenient on the rebels, known as the FARC. “There’s no justice in this accord,” said one voter. ____ 6. The first Nobel Prize of the year was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi, above, a Japanese cell biologist. He won the physiology or medicine prize for deciphering how cells recycle their content, a critical process that led to a new field and inspired hundreds of researchers around the world. Five more Nobel Prizes will be awarded this week and next. We talked to eight previous winners about how they received the good news: Many were asleep, thanks to a time difference. One relayed that his mother said to his wife, “That’s very nice, but don’t let it go to his head. ” ____ 7. In the Caribbean, people are bracing for Hurricane Matthew, above, to bring flash floods, mudslides and winds up to 140 miles per hour. The Category 4 hurricane is expected to hit Haiti by Monday night and then continue north, threatening other Caribbean nations and potentially the U. S. too. And Hurricane Sandy caused enormous damage when it slammed the East Coast in 2012, but one lasting impact may  be positive. The storm surge opened a passage between the ocean and Great South Bay, on New York’s Fire Island, bringing in new life. ____ 8. Major League Baseball is taking the night off. The regular season wrapped up on Sunday, playoff matchups are set and the postseason will kick off Tuesday. The Toronto Blue Jays will host the Baltimore Orioles in the A. L.   game on Tuesday. The Orioles lost the A. L. Championship Series in 2014. The Blue Jays lost it last year. And on Wednesday, the Mets will host the National League   game against the San Francisco Giants at Citi Field. ____ 9. Bad news for kids (and parents): There’s no nasal spray version of the flu vaccine this year. Get ready for the needle. Federal officials pulled the spray vaccine (the brand name is FluMist) because it has been less effective in the past couple of flu seasons. Experts say that distracting children remains “the most proven technique” for making shots easier. Distraction remains your briefing writer’s vaccine technique, too. ____ 10.

25675,Supreme Court Rejects Puerto Rico Law in Debt Restructuring Case - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an effort in Puerto Rico to allow public utilities there to restructure $20 billion in debt, striking down a 2014 Puerto Rico law. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority in the    decision, said the law was at odds with the federal bankruptcy code, which bars states and lower units of government from enacting their own versions of bankruptcy law. Puerto Rico is struggling with $72 billion  in debt and has argued that it needs to restructure at least some of it under Chapter 9, the part of the bankruptcy code for insolvent local governments. But Puerto Rico is not permitted to do so, because Chapter 9 specifically excludes it, although it is unclear why. In 2014, the island tried to get around that exclusion by enacting its own version of a bankruptcy law, intended for its big public utilities, which account for about $26 billion of the total debt. But that attempt, called the Recovery Act, ran afoul of the part of the code that says only Congress may enact bankruptcy laws. Puerto Rican officials had argued that the Recovery Act addressed a gap in the way its debts are treated. Under the bankruptcy code, they said, states may authorize their cities, counties, public utilities and other branches of government to restructure their debts under Chapter 9 of the code. But that law excludes Puerto Rico and all branches of its government, including its public utilities. Utility creditors challenged the Recovery Act in federal court, arguing that the bankruptcy code displaced, or   it. The justices agreed. The federal law, Justice Thomas wrote, “bars Puerto Rico from enacting its own municipal bankruptcy scheme to restructure the debt of its insolvent public utilities. ” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan joined him. Justice Thomas wrote that the decision was compelled by a straightforward reading of the federal law. In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the majority’s approach was too mechanical and failed to take into account the purpose of the bankruptcy law and the impact of its decision. The Recovery Act, she wrote, “is the only existing legal option for Puerto Rico to restructure debts that could cripple its citizens. ” “The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its municipalities are in the middle of a fiscal crisis,” she wrote. “The combined debt of Puerto Rico’s three main public utilities exceeds $20 billion. These utilities provide power, water, sewer and transportation to residents of the island. ” “With rising interest rates and limited access to capital markets, their debts are proving unserviceable. Soon, Puerto Rico and the utilities contend, they will be unable to pay for things like fuel to generate electricity, which will lead to rolling blackouts,” Justice Sotomayor added. “Other vital public services will be imperiled, including the utilities’ ability to provide safe drinking water, maintain roads and operate public transportation. ” The majority’s approach ignores those realities, she wrote, “rejects contextual analysis in favor of a syllogism” and leaves Puerto Rico “powerless and with no legal process to help” its citizens. Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress, said: “The practical significance of the court’s holding is crystal clear. Only Congress can provide the Puerto Rico government with the authority to restructure its debts. ” He said action by Congress “is essential if the territory is going to overcome its severe  —   and worsening  —   economic, fiscal and demographic crisis. ” The case has been vexing for all parties because when Congress amended the bankruptcy code to exclude Puerto Rico, in 1984, it left no written record explaining why. Yet the rule barred the island from the only way under United States law that a debtor can legally reduce debt over the objections of creditors. Besides passing its own bankruptcy law in 2014, Puerto Rico tried to persuade Congress to delete the 1984 exclusion. It said the provision was inexplicable and may have been inserted by mistake. Those arguments did not sway Congress. But last year lawmakers realized the United States Constitution gave them the power to “make all needful rules and regulations” for territories, including Puerto Rico. Using that approach, the House of Representatives passed a   bill this month that would apply to all territories (though only Puerto Rico is in dire need at the moment). Obama administration officials have expressed hope that the Senate will take up the measure quickly and enact it before July 1, when Puerto Rico is supposed to make debt payments totaling nearly $2 billion. It is expected to default, which would normally prompt creditors to sue. As now drafted, the bill would stay such lawsuits, put Puerto Rico under federal oversight and give it other legal powers similar to those found in bankruptcy. In the majority opinion, Justice Thomas noted that Puerto Rico had also been seeking help from Congress. “After the parties briefed and argued these cases,” he wrote, “members of Congress introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to establish an oversight board to assist Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities,” adding that “the bill does not amend the federal bankruptcy code. ” Justice Sotomayor responded that “the government and people of Puerto Rico should not have to wait for possible congressional action to avert the consequences of unreliable electricity, transportation and safe water  —   consequences that members of the executive and legislature have described as a looming ‘humanitarian crisis. ’”. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. recused himself from the cases, Puerto Rico v. Franklin California   Trust, No.   and   v. Franklin California   Trust, No.  . As is the court’s custom, he did not explain why.",1
25676,Split Over Donald Trump Threatens to Tilt Republican States - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump’s intensifying battle with his own party is tearing open the nation’s political map, pulling Republicans across the country into a   feud that could imperil dozens of lawmakers in Congress and potentially throw   states into Hillary Clinton’s column. Democrats are moving swiftly to exploit Mr. Trump’s crumbling position in the presidential race, aiming to run up a big margin of victory for Mrs. Clinton and extend their political advantage into the congressional elections next month. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has concluded that at least two traditionally Republican states, Georgia and Arizona, are realistic targets for her campaign to win over. And Republican polling has found that Mr. Trump is at dire risk of losing Georgia, according to people briefed on the polls, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mrs. Clinton now holds such a strong upper hand that Priorities USA, a “super PAC” backing her campaign, may direct some of its war chest into Senate races, two people said, and may begin broadcasting ads for those contests as soon as next week. Congressional Democrats also hope to persuade Mrs. Clinton to continue pouring money and campaign resources into states like Virginia and Colorado, where they believe her victory is assured, in order to lift other Democratic candidates. In a signal of Democrats’ growing focus on the House and Senate, Mrs. Clinton used a visit on Tuesday to Miami to attack both Mr. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio, whom Mrs. Clinton blasted for what she described as his indifference to climate change. “We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously,” Mrs. Clinton said, adding, “It is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change, to say, ‘I’m not a scientist. ’” Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, told reporters that she would continue to call out   Republicans. Mr. Rubio is among the Republicans whom Priorities USA may seek to defeat, if the group decides to intervene in Senate races, one strategist said. Increasingly anxious Republicans have not come up with a unified strategy for containing the damage from Mr. Trump’s embattled candidacy, and several strategists and party officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they were awaiting a new round of polling before settling on a course. But, in a sign that Republicans now view the presidential race as a lost cause, several Senate candidates are preparing ads asking voters to elect them as a check on Mrs. Clinton in the White House. Yet Mr. Trump himself, having been rejected in recent days by dozens of Republican elected officials, has indicated that he will make any separation an exceptionally messy and painful ordeal for the party. Mr. Trump lashed out publicly on Tuesday morning at two of his   critics: Senator John McCain of Arizona, who withdrew his endorsement of Mr. Trump over the weekend, and Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who informed congressional Republicans on Monday that he would no longer defend Mr. Trump. Seething on Twitter, Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Ryan as “weak and ineffective” and described Mr. McCain as “very foul mouthed. ” And in a Fox News interview, Mr. Trump mocked both men as disloyal, reserving special venom for Mr. Ryan. “Paul Ryan opened borders and amnesty and bad budgets,” Mr. Trump said. He declared himself a liberated man, writing on Twitter:. “It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to. ” Should Mr. Trump continue deriding the leaders of the institutional Republican Party, it could have profound consequences down the ballot, potentially depressing turnout by demoralizing the party or leading Mr. Trump’s ardent supporters to deny their votes to Republicans who abandoned him. But there is little Republicans can do to control Mr. Trump’s behavior: The party’s donors have no leverage over him, he is relying largely on small donors and, at 70, he is not mindful of any future campaign. The emerging dynamic may be especially toxic for Republicans in swing states that are also home to competitive races for the House and Senate, where the party’s candidates must choose between two unpalatable options: alienating much of their party’s base, or standing behind a nominee who is unacceptable to most mainstream voters. The voting bloc that especially concerns Republican officials are the      voters who usually favor Republican candidates but cannot abide Mr. Trump. These voters can make up anywhere between a quarter to a third of the party’s electoral coalition. “That voter is clearly not going to vote for Donald Trump,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist who is working on several Senate races. “But if they don’t vote at all, it’s catastrophic for us. ” The nightmare possibility for the party is that swing voters punish the party because of Mr. Trump, the   Republicans stay at home and Mr. Trump’s base casts a ballot for him and then leaves the polls. Under those conditions, Senate races in places like Pennsylvania and North Carolina could fall to Democrats, while Senate and House races in places like Missouri, Arizona and Kansas could move to the center of the battlefield. Already, Republicans view Mr. Trump’s sharp downturn in the presidential race as having jeopardized their majorities in Congress. A poll published on Tuesday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by nine percentage points nationally and drawing just 37 percent of the vote. No   nominee since World War II has received a smaller share of the vote. But in an illustration of the bind Republicans are in, the poll found that   of Republicans believed their candidates should stay loyal to Mr. Trump. In Nevada, the Republican candidate for Senate, Representative Joe Heck, withdrew his support from Mr. Trump over the weekend, and is facing a furious backlash. Sandie Kirwin, a Las Vegas retail manager supportive of Mr. Trump, said she might now vote for a Democrat over Mr. Heck in a critical Senate race. “I think of Joe Heck the same I do of any Republican not supporting Donald Trump,” said Ms. Kirwin, 52. “I will never support any of them, and I will do what I can to get them out of office. ” But other   voters say they may punish those who fail to denounce Mr. Trump. Several Republicans in difficult Senate races have criticized Mr. Trump in strong terms without coming out in opposition to his candidacy, including Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Mr. Rubio. In Pennsylvania, Jaye Steuterman, a registered Republican and a real estate agent in Doylestown, said she was still undecided on which presidential candidate to vote for. She said she was deeply unsettled by Mr. Trump’s past comments about forcing himself on women, but that might not be enough to stop her voting for him. “I don’t know what’s more important to me  —   that, or the fact that Hillary is a liar,” Ms. Steuterman said. In the Senate race, she is inclined to vote for Mr. Toomey because he is a Republican, but her decision could depend on whether he supports Mr. Trump. Even the drastic step of denouncing Mr. Trump may not be enough to shield Republicans from his unpopularity. In a conference call on Tuesday with the Democratic caucus, Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that party polling found voters drawing scant distinction between Republicans who endorsed Mr. Trump and those who abandoned him out of political expediency, according to people who participated in the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was supposed to be private. On the same call, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the   House Democrat, expressed concern that Mrs. Clinton might abandon states that she is all but sure to win, but where Democrats are still locked in competitive races. Mr. Clyburn asked Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, to contact Mrs. Clinton’s campaign to ensure it would not withdraw resources from Virginia and Colorado. “Most people think the House now could be in play,” said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky. “There’s a little bit of scrambling going on to identify races that could flip if the presidential race somehow gets to a   margin. ” Like their Republican counterparts, Democrats do not plan to make final strategy decisions until they receive new polling. But they have already begun aggressively attacking Republicans, even as those officials retreat from Mr. Trump. Three Democratic congressional candidates have started running ads this week that showcase footage of Mr. Trump describing sexual assault in graphic terms, from a 2005 recording. Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who is challenging Senator Kelly Ayotte, used the footage in a campaign video on Tuesday, saying Ms. Ayotte recently denounced Mr. Trump only to “protect herself. ” And outside groups supporting congressional Democrats have begun to reallocate their spending to take advantage of the shifting environment. The House Majority PAC, the principal outside group supporting House Democrats, this week made a $1. 2 million reservation to contest the suburban Philadelphia seat held by Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick, who is retiring. In affluent, suburban areas, which were already trending strongly toward Democrats after the first presidential debate, Republican survival may depend on the willingness of voters to separate their feelings about the presidential race from their voting behavior in all other elections. Outside a ski shop on Tuesday in Aurora, Colo. Sharon and Les Sparks said they were disappointed by Republicans pulling away from Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Sparks described as “spoiled little entitled brats. ” Among those lawmakers is Representative Mike Coffman, a   congressman who has been critical of Mr. Trump for months and recently called on him to end his campaign. Still, Mr. and Ms. Sparks said they would vote for Mr. Coffman, despite their frustration. “They need to unite,” said Ms. Sparks, 49, a project manager in the health industry. “If you’re going to be in the Republican Party, you need to start standing behind the party. ”",1
25677,U.S. Traffic Deaths Rise for a Second Straight Year - The New York Times,"Over the last decade, new cars have gotten electronic stability control systems to prevent skids, rearview cameras to prevent fender benders and more airbags to protect occupants in collisions. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on campaigns to remind the public of the dangers of drunken driving, failing to buckle up and texting while on the go. Despite all that, more Americans are dying on roads and highways than in years, and the sudden and sharp increase has alarmed safety advocates. The latest batch of bad news arrived Wednesday in traffic fatality estimates released by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization that works closely with federal   regulators. According to its estimates, 40, 200 people died in accidents involving motor vehicles in 2016, a 6 percent rise from the year before. If the estimates are confirmed, it will be the first time since 2007 that more than 40, 000 people have died in motor vehicle accidents in a single year. The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the   increase  —   14 percent  —   is the largest in more than a half a century. “Why are we O. K. with this?” Deborah Hersman, the National Safety Council president and chief executive, said at a news conference. “Complacency is killing us. ” Part of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing. They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers’ eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist. “It’s not just talking on the phone that’s a problem today,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “You now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones. ” Government officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures. A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense  —   meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense  —   drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations. “It’s still the same things that are killing drivers  —   belts, booze and speed,” Mr. Adkins said. About half of all traffic fatalities involve unbelted occupants, and almost a third involve drivers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal government’s main   agency. In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state’s 103, 000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabama’s Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the state’s 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving   crashes. “Total crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent,” he said in an interview. “I think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there’s no one there to deter it. ” In some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1, 500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher. In the fall, the N. H. T. S. A. the National Transportation Safety Board and several nongovernmental organizations, including the National Safety Council, began the Road to Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities within 30 years. The effort places heavy emphasis on the promise of autonomous vehicles. But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. “The way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the    measures, not   cars,” the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October. Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring   occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking. In presenting its 2016 fatality estimates, the National Safety Council endorsed those ideas and also called for bans on all use of smartphones by drivers, even if they use   calling or messaging. The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired. The safety council’s figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N. H. T. S. A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.",1

But despite conducting business professionally and legally, nearly 30 heavily armed San Diego police and DEA agents broke into and destroyed Med-West Distribution, stole all the legal products inside, confiscated his computers and servers — and proceeded to clean out his entire family’s life savings, including the accounts of his high school and college-aged daughters, and his 84-year-old mother’s safety deposit box. 
By obstinately refusing to acknowledge Med-West’s legal status, law enforcement used highly contentious federal civil asset forfeiture (CAF) law to rob the Slatics of everything they’d earned — including $324,000 in proceeds from the lucrative medical cannabis business, according to the Institute for Justice (IJ). 
“This case is not about crime fighting,” IJ attorney Wesley Hottot, who now represents the Slatics, explained. “This case is about policing for profit, and it illustrates the abusive power of civil forfeiture at its worst.” 
As countless families and individuals around the country have been shocked to learn, the State can rob you blind, taking everything of value — bank accounts, vehicles, electronics, and even houses, etc. — without proof any crime has been committed. 
James Slatic has never been convicted or charged with any wrongdoing in the matter — but the nightmare of civil asset forfeiture doesn’t end with a lack of charges or conviction. In fact, attempting to reclaim property and cash can be a nightmare of red tape, court appearances and legal fees — and, even then, isn’t always a successful venture. And like so many others, Slatic had not been familiar with this legal, policing-for-profit scheme prior to his firsthand encounter. 
“I’ve done nothing wrong,” he told the Institute for Justice. “It’s beyond frustrating that my family’s money was taken without any criminal charges being filed. My wife and teenage daughters had nothing to do with my business whatsoever, and the District Attorney took their college savings accounts. This is not just wrong; it is unconstitutional.” 
While he certainly might be right, CAF is federal law — a brief reprieve in January, when the Department of Justice suspended the program, only lasted through early April — because the ability of police to steal people’s stuff and either use it or the proceeds from its sale is just too damned profitable. 
Indeed, police and other agencies — particularly the Drug Enforcement Agency — make a killing in this legalized State robbery sham, and many departments have come to rely on CAF profiteering to bolster their funding. 
“Civil forfeiture is one of the greatest threats to property rights in the nation,” said IJ attorney Allison Daniel, also representing the Slatic family. “Civil forfeiture takes the American principle of innocent until proven guilty and flips it on its head, treating property owners worse than criminals by making them prove their innocence.” 
At 7:30 in the morning on January 28, 2016 — as surveillance cameras outside and inside Med-West captured on video — the San Diego Joint Narcotics Task Force used a sledgehammer to break down the door of Slatic’s legal business, and stormed in, pointing automatic weapons at the heads of innocent employees inside. 
Needlessly and recklessly, around 28 officers took everything of value inside, destroying and scattering property in the process. 
As Slatic told IJ, in addition to assets stolen from the business, the greedy cops cleared family bank accounts of over $100,000 — leaving his daughters scrambling to pay for school supplies, like college textbooks, while putting their tuition and fees in jeopardy. 
Annette Slatic, James’ wife, who works as a nurse at the Veterans Administration, found out about the raid and financial seizure when she tried to pay for groceries that morning and had her card declined. Then her daughter, Penny, a high-schooler, tried to pay using her ATM card — and was also declined. Without notice, the Slatics suddenly found themselves essentially penniless and unsure how to afford basic needs. 
Now they’re fighting to get everything back, since under California law, “probable cause” a crime has been committed must be established before officers can use civil asset forfeiture to seize property and cash. 
As the Institute for Justice explains, “Because police and prosecutors ignored Med-West’s status as a legal marijuana business, they did not have probable cause to seize the Slatics’ money. Even if Med-West had been an illegal operation (and it was not), the Slatics’ personal money is not connected to the business.” 
Perhaps the Slatics will have better luck in getting justice than innumerable others who have been unfortunate enough to be victims of legalized robbery. 
Despite massive controversy surrounding the program — and one of its creators now denouncing the policing-for-profit scheme it has become — civil asset forfeiture won’t be going anywhere soon. 
While some states have severely curtailed cops’ ability to take your stuff, by implementing strictures requiring a conviction and similar limits, others have taken CAF to new levels. Oklahoma Highway Patrol began using a device called an ERAD , which scans bank and prepaid cards — right from a person’s wallet — to seize all cash in an individual’s account during a traffic stop if an officer even suspects a person of committing a drug-related offense. 
“Three decades ago, I helped create our civil asset forfeiture system,” wrote Brad Cates in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal , “now it’s time to end it.” 
This is what it’s like to run a legal business, pay taxes, and follow the law in a Police State: Share",1
25681,Russia’s Most Potent Weapon: “Hoarding Gold”,"Russia’s Most Potent Weapon: “Hoarding Gold” 11/02/2016 
SHTFPLAN.COM 
This article was written by Jay Syrmopoulos and originally published at The Free Thought Project . 
Editor’s Comment: He who holds the gold makes the rules? Fresh attempts at containing Russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves. Russia appears to be building strength in every way. Putin and his country have no intention of being under the American thumb, and are developing rapid resistance as the U.S. petrodollar loses its grip and China, Russia and the East shift into new currencies and shifting world order. 
What lies ahead? It will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets; and China and Russia have positioned themselves very well. Prepare for a changing economic landscape, and one in which self-reliance might be all we have. 
Russia is Hoarding Gold at an Alarming Rate — The Next World War Will Be Fought with Currencies 
by Jay Syrmopoulos 
With all eyes on Russia’s unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the “SATAN” missile , as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow’s most potent “weapon” may be something drastically different. 
The rapidly evolving geopolitical “weapon” brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia’s native currency, the ruble. 
Take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order – potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift – and much sooner than you might think. 
image: http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bankofrussia-e1475520013798.png 
The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia’s national currency. 
Similar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (£), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (€), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. 
After the failed “reset” in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. 
Instead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn’t solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , New Development Bank). 
According to the Corbett Report : 
New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led “resistance bloc” breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led “Washington Consensus.” 
For those who don’t know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system’s near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. 
This is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. 
Recently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book “Currency Wars,” wrote that “Russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit.” Rickards believes a “strong turnaround” is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. 
While still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. 
The Bank of Russia, that nation’s central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: 
Monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. 
In layman’s terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are “an integral part of the state policy” in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia’s military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. 
Below is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: 
Since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia’s state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia’s state holdings of gold tripled. 
Within just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
According to the Business Insider : 
In July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves — 200,000 ounces — is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold’s Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. 
At that same rate — 200,000 ounces per month — in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick’s massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada. 
Currently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It’s clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country’s gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. 
Rickards, in his 2011 book “Currency Wars,” theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China — it’s likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. 
The U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. 
Imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF’s gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. 
Russia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it’s weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall – thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. 
The reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode — and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it’s printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a “weapon.” 
Ultimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 
It’s not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the “rights” of corporations over that of people .

25683,Illegal Alien Support Group Forces Border Patrol to Get Warrants,"A group known in Arizona for assisting illegal aliens through the desert after they cross the border forced U. S. Border Patrol agents to obtain a warrant to search for migrants in their camp. The agents later arrested four Mexican nationals. [Border Patrol agents assigned to the Tucson Sector used technology surveillance to detect four suspected illegal aliens who crossed the border along a known human smuggling route. The four individuals were wearing camouflage as they walked northward from the Mexican border, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by U. S. Border Patrol officials.  Other agents working near Arivaca, Arizona, tracked the four migrants to a No Mas Muertes (No More Deaths) Camp. No Mas Muertes is an organization that assists illegal aliens in their march through the Arizona desert. When agents contacted camp officials to search for the alleged illegal border crossers, the officials refused. “Tucson Sector Border Patrol reached out to No Mas Muertes Camp representatives to continue a positive working relationship and resolve the situation amicably,” Border Patrol officials stated. “The talks, however, were unsuccessful. ” Agents subsequently sought and obtained a warrant to search the camp and question the four suspected illegal aliens. Agents found the migrants and questioned them about their citizenship and legal right to be present in the U. S. Satisfied that the four people were illegally present in the country, agents took them into custody. A similar incident occurred a month earlier, officials stated. Agents detected eight individuals entering the camp. The negotiations with camp officials, in that case, were successful. Agents arrested the eight illegal aliens and subsequently learned that at least two of the foreign nationals had significant criminal histories from previous illegal entries into the U. S. Two other illegal aliens were in need of medical attention. Those migrants were transported to an area hospital for evaluation and treatment. Camp officials reacted harshly to this week’s arrest of illegal aliens in their camp. “Today’s raid on the medical   is unacceptable and a break in our   agreements with Border Patrol to respect the critical work of No More Deaths,” Abuse Documentation and Advocacy Coordinator Kate Morgan stated in an article published on the group’s website. They claim to operate their camps “as a medical facility under the International Red Cross Standards, which the say gives them the right to refuse cooperation with Border Patrol agents. “The Border Patrol acknowledged that they tracked a group for 18 miles, but only after the migrants sought medical treatment did the Border Patrol seek to arrest them,” No More Deaths Founder John Fife claimed. “The choice to interdict these people only after they entered the No More Deaths camp is direct evidence that this was a direct attack on humanitarian aid.  At the same time, the weather forecast is for   deadly temperatures. ” While the group’s website claims their goal is to help the illegal aliens in their efforts to enter the U. S. at least one of article posted on their site could place migrants in more danger. The article written by Aljazeera America, titled “For migrants in Arizona who call 911, it’s Border Patrol on the line,” appears to warn migrants in distress in the desert against calling 911. “When most people dial 911 due to a medical emergency, they don’t expect to talk to Border Patrol,” the group states. “But that’s exactly what happens to many undocumented migrants who call for help from Arizona’s southern desert. ” The article continues: When 911 calls come in to BORSTAR, supervising agent John Redd said, quite often callers in distress don’t realize they have been transferred to Border Patrol. And the agency doesn’t inform them, according to Redd: “[W]e don’t tell them it’s the Border Patrol, because we’re trying to preserve life. But the fact is we’ve got another job to do, too. If we do tell them it’s Border Patrol, when we get there, they’re going to be gone. ” If agents manage to find migrants in distress, they stabilize them medically and then book them, Redd said. Advocates for migrants say this system prioritizes the apprehension and deportation of migrants and leads to needless deaths. Calls from migrants in distress sometimes bounce from one agency to another, with no mechanism to ensure accountability or track how cases are handled. Determining whether a caller is an undocumented migrant is at the discretion of the 911 dispatcher who picks up the phone call and is often based on racial profiling, said Cristen Vernon, the   project coordinator with Derechos Humanos, an immigration advocacy group in Tucson. However, Breitbart Texas has reported regularly on illegal aliens in distress that are rescued by Border Patrol agents and BORSTAR rescue teams. Earlier this month, Pima   dispatchers notified Border Patrol of a 911 call from a distressed alien in the desert. Border Patrol agents found the man struggling for his life. BORSTAR agents responded with their emergency medical training, giving him immediate help. Agents called a Life Flight evacuation helicopter for transport. Life Flight flew the illegal migrant flown to a Tuscon hospital for treatment. Had the man not called 911 and had Border Patrol agents and BORSTAR not responded, the man likely would have died alone in the desert. In May, Border Patrol agents rescued five other illegal aliens near the Ajo Station. On balance, it is the ruthless   human smugglers who put these illegal aliens at risk in the desert. If a person being smuggled falls behind for any reason, such as dehydration, injury, or exhaustion, the coyotes will simply leave them behind to die in the desert. In May, U. S. Customs and Border Protection officials issued a warning about the dangers of crossing the border in the heat of the summer. “Unscrupulous smugglers often abandon migrants in the desert who fall behind. ,” CBP officials stated. “As a result, many perish every year. Border Patrol officials encourage anyone in distress to call 911 or activate a rescue beacon before becoming a casualty. In the fiscal year 2016 Tucson Sector Border Patrol agents rescued over 1, 400 persons with many of those rescues conducted in the western Arizona region. ” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

25684,Trump Supporters Have the Most to Lose in the G.O.P. Repeal Bill - The New York Times,"The people who stand to lose the most in tax credits under the House Republican health plan tended to support Donald J. Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, according to a new Upshot analysis. Over all, voters who would be eligible for a tax credit that would be at least $1, 000 smaller than the subsidy they’re eligible for under Obamacare supported Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton by a   margin. The voters hit the hardest  —   eligible for at least $5, 000 less in tax credits under the Republican plan  —   supported Mr. Trump by a margin of 59 percent to 36 percent. These estimates are based on data from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (C. C. E. S.) a large survey of tens of thousands of Americans. Kaiser estimated whether individuals would gain or lose under the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, based on their income, age and insurance market. We matched the data to the C. C. E. S.’s postelection survey, which asked individuals about their health care and how they voted in the 2016 presidential election. The end result: an estimate for how much every respondent of the survey would gain or lose under the Republican plan, based on age, income and county. Like any result based on a survey, the estimates are imperfect. But the Republican plan offers less assistance to older and   Americans, especially in rural areas, according to the Kaiser data. These groups generally backed Mr. Trump. Most of all, President Trump’s white   supporters often make enough money to be ineligible for Medicaid, but not enough to afford costly health insurance that might even become more expensive under the Republican plan. The plan would hit older and rural Americans hardest because it wouldn’t provide a larger tax credit to people with more expensive plans. Older Americans pay the highest premiums, and the law would allow insurers to raise premiums for older customers even further. The AARP opposes the bill as a result. Rural areas often have higher premiums because there’s less competition. Residents in those areas would receive the same subsidy as people in cheaper markets. This analysis is limited to people who don’t receive Medicare or Medicaid. But Medicaid recipients, who also stand to lose under the law, lean more Democratic. Nationwide, Medicaid recipients supported Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 55 percent to 39 percent, according to the C. C. E. S. data. The effects of the Republican plan on Medicaid recipients are less clear. Many of them might lose their Medicaid coverage or see their benefits pared back as a result of the bill. The law would reduce funding for a major expansion of the Medicaid program for poor Americans in more than 30 states and cut future Medicaid funding across the country. Most of those 30 states supported Mrs. Clinton, but Mr. Trump led by   percent among Medicaid beneficiaries in the nine red expansion states that have voted Republican in the last two presidential elections. Republican senators from those states are among those most skeptical of the repeal bill, and many of the same states have large rural populations that stand to lose the most under the plan’s tax credits. It’s important to note that while many of Mr. Trump’s supporters might be eligible for a smaller tax credit under the Republican plan, only a fraction of those voters would be immediately affected. According to the C. C. E. S. about 4 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters purchased a plan on exchanges last year. The estimates include all people with the potential to be eligible for the subsidy and don’t receive Medicare or Medicaid, not just those who purchased health care on the individual market and already receive a subsidy under the Affordable Care Act. The data on the slice of voters who currently have insurance purchased on an exchange is thinner. Over all, people who bought their health insurance on exchanges supported Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 55 percent to 39 percent, according to the C. C. E. S. But among the small sample of respondents who would lose more than $5, 000 under the Republican plan, more were Trump supporters than Clinton supporters.",1
25690,Mind Over Body: Playing in the N.F.L. at 38 - The New York Times,"MINNEAPOLIS  —   Terence Newman usually views film of the Vikings’ next opponent at the island in his kitchen, but on this night, three days before Minnesota was to host the Arizona Cardinals, he had relocated to a more comfortable spot. Lounging in an oversize leather chair, his legs dangling over the edge, Newman cradled a   digital tablet containing hours of video clips. He pulled up the   plays Arizona had run this season. Even though Newman, as a cornerback, is charged with making receivers disappear, on every snap he also studies the habits of running backs, tight ends and quarterbacks and how they work in concert. Once, he figured out that a team would pass whenever one of its receivers fiddled with his gloves before the snap, and now he was hunting for another subtle hint to tip off what might be coming next. “Ooh!” Newman said. He blurted an expletive and rewound the play he had just watched three, four, five times. “I just picked up something,” he said. “Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, baby. See that?” Motioning for a visitor to come closer, Newman cued up the clip again. The play, from just before halftime of Arizona’s Week 8 loss at Carolina, featured four receivers, two on each side of the formation, with quarterback Carson Palmer lined up in the shotgun. As some of Carolina’s players realigned, Palmer glanced right and then left while twirling his index fingers in the air like helicopter blades. “It’s the same signals both sides,” Newman said. “And they’re both running the same routes. ” The outside receivers bolted across the middle, and the inside receivers, crossing in front to disrupt the coverage, darted toward the back pylons. No defenders followed, both outside receivers came open, and Palmer, with his pick of either, threw left for the touchdown. Earlier, Newman had seen Palmer make that same gesture, but he needed a recurrence to feel confident jotting his discovery, in small and neat penmanship, into a notebook. “That,” Newman said, “was superconfirmation right there. ” These revelations often occur when he is alone, in the sanctity of his apartment in the vibrant Uptown neighborhood here, where he lives by himself. His kitchen counter is speckled with the foodstuffs of a    bachelor  —   cans of vegetable soup, a   loaf of old bread, a bag of dried mango  —   and those who know Newman well credit his longevity in part to his having never been married. By 38, most N. F. L. cornerbacks have retired or, in far fewer cases, switched to the less physically demanding position of safety, no longer as capable of chasing bigger, stronger and faster receivers around the field. Newman is the oldest cornerback in the league by nearly five years, and by at least some measures, he is also one of the best. According to the analytics website Pro Football Focus, which rates him sixth over all, he has allowed the fewest yards (0. 64) per coverage snap. As Newman acknowledged, his freedom to do what he wants when he wants has prolonged his career. It has enabled him to obey what he called an intuitive understanding of his body, nurturing it with as much sleep, exercise and sustenance as he feels it needs. He keeps himself in such good shape that Minnesota’s strength and conditioning coach, Brent Salazar, said Newman would be ready to play a game in June. It also helps  —   and Newman shuddered, fearful of being jinxed, when this was mentioned  —   that through nearly 14 seasons he has managed to avoid the sort of devastating injury that has ended or curtailed the careers of many of his peers. Newman remains an incredible athlete. But as his speed, power and quickness have deteriorated, he has relied ever more on his cognitive skills. His capacity for decoding opponents’ tendencies through film study has mitigated his physiological decline. His aptitude for processing those tidbits and applying them on the field has preserved his livelihood. “He can think about what’s going to happen and get his body to do it,” Vikings safety Harrison Smith said. “He can make plays with his mind. ” Mike Zimmer, now Minnesota’s coach, witnessed that gift up close when he served as Newman’s defensive coordinator with Dallas from 2003 to 2006 and with Cincinnati from 2012 to 2013. Zimmer endorsed signing Newman, then 36, before the 2015 season, confident that he would be an asset in the Vikings’ secondary and a positive influence on the team’s young cornerbacks. They have spent two seasons absorbing his wisdom, accepting his red wine recommendations and poking fun at the old guy, presenting him with adult diapers, a walker and a cane that Newman keeps in his kitchen. But they have yet to take his job. A few minutes after 11 a. m. on a recent Tuesday, a day off for the Vikings, Newman walked into the makeshift auditorium at the team’s complex in nearby Eden Prairie. It is cordoned off by black curtains in a corner of the indoor practice field. Accompanied by cornerbacks Mackensie Alexander and Trae Waynes, Newman set down his daily cup of black tea, the only caffeine he ingests, on a table in the front row. He could be mistaken for an eager pupil if he were not the stern teacher. It was the first such tutorial for Alexander, who was told the previous day by the secondary coach Jerry Gray to watch film with Newman. “I want to soak up as much knowledge before he’s gone,” Alexander said. Newman prefers to study solo, or with people who respect his intensity and his mandate for silence. The only time he wears glasses is during these sessions. “I want that clarity,” Newman said. “When football comes on, my senses are at their peak. I want my brain to be able to process and diagnose all the information and then retain it. ” He sat before a computer and clutched a remote that linked to a large projection screen that loomed on a stage. Newman clicked on Arizona’s   and   pass plays and went through them in his favored manner, from most frequent to least, one formation at a time. He developed this methodology soon after entering the N. F. L. in 2003, taken fifth over all in the draft by the Cowboys, for whom he made two Pro Bowls. Teammates like Mario Edwards, Roy Williams and Darren Woodson mentored him, helping Newman expand his scope to focus on nuances like body language. He recognized that a team would run every time a receiver kept his hands on his knees, and he learned to eliminate certain routes if a receiver aligned with his outside foot up rather than his inside foot. “You see how their bodies move and how their feet are,” Newman said. “You understand there’s only certain places you can go. ” Early on in Dallas, Zimmer would give Newman homework: Return with all the routes a team ran out of a formation. He would watch every piece of footage to report his findings, and over the years he simplified his approach. Soon, he detected patterns. “By the end of the week, he’d know everything about everybody,” Mark Carrier, Newman’s position coach in Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview. For instance, by watching every play in sequence that a team has run when two receivers line up on each side of a formation, Newman can divine concepts and combinations. He scrutinizes how close each receiver lines up to the quarterback. He notices what routes they run when they line up on the bottom of the numbers  —   the digits that denote   increments  —   compared with the top. He examines if the quarterback is under center or in the shotgun. If a tight end is in, Newman scans to see if routes go toward or away from him. There are finite possibilities, he knows, and soon they mesh in his mind, categorized by down and distance. He backs up those mental files in his notebook, which devotes two pages to every opponent. Reminders are written beneath a general heading and more detailed logs of personnel and formations organized by downs. “I’ve always been a person where if I could see something, I pretty much remember it,” Newman said. Over dinner at a downtown steakhouse, he demonstrated his recall. The conversation shifted to Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, whom Bengals receiver A. J. Green had beaten for a long touchdown in the teams’ season opener. Newman cited the details, from the length of the play (54 yards) to the route that Brandon LaFell had run across the middle to paralyze the safety who was supposed to assist Revis, as if he were on the sideline that September afternoon. How many times did Newman watch that play? “Just once,” he said. In training camp, Minnesota teammates playfully accused Newman of conspiring with Norv Turner, then the Vikings’ offensive coordinator. He called out routes so many times that they assumed Turner had told him the plays in advance. He had not. Newman just knew them  —   or rather, he had deciphered them. Now his fellow cornerbacks sat observing as Newman cycled through one play after another, pausing only to rewind or scrawl a note. He said little, if anything. A few other players appeared, and the chatter increased. Newman pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his bald head. When the   session ended, he packed up his gear and walked out, off to receive treatment. Because Newman knew this above all: No matter how diligently he prepares watching film, his discoveries are useless if he is not healthy enough to employ them. After last season, Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman had something to tell Newman. Also, to ask him. “You’re going to be 38 coming up, and you played at a high level this year,” Spielman said he told him. “I did not expect what you were able to do for us. How does your body feel? Do you think you can go another year?” Minnesota’s analytics, Spielman said, revealed that Newman was an outlier. Based on data culled over the last two decades, Newman had defied what Spielman called a “critical age,” when cornerbacks’ effectiveness almost always declines. Players who endure deep into their 30s, and even into their 40s, are mostly specialists  —   long snappers, punters and kickers, like Adam Vinatieri, Indianapolis’s    marvel  —   or quarterbacks, like    Tom Brady, because they tend to absorb fewer     collisions. Few cornerbacks last that long because the position is just too taxing, demanding of its practitioners exceptional speed,   quickness, athleticism, anticipation, footwork and technique. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the   cornerback in the league is    Tramon Williams of the Cleveland Browns. Newman is the first corner to start at least eight games at 38 since Otis Smith in 2003, according to Elias. “You do the most unnatural thing, which is running backward, turning and then sprinting,” Newman said. “How many people do you know that can run backward as somebody’s running full speed at you?” Mark Verstegen, the founder and president of EXOS, which operates   training centers nationwide, has for 16 years served as the director of performance for the National Football League Players Association. He called the action Newman described  —   acceleration to deceleration to reacceleration  —   the most stressful on a player’s body beyond collisions. “The amount of pure   mileage that he has put on his body  —   it’s immeasurable,” Verstegen said in a telephone interview. Comparing Newman to a racecar, Verstegen added, “But if you’re taking care of your car really well and you know how to drive it smarter, you’re still going to win the checkered flag even if you might have less horsepower and a little less tread on the tires. ” Newman takes an iconoclastic approach to his wellness. For one thing, he does not use a nutritionist. In maintaining his muscular 195 pounds, the    Newman does not deprive himself  —   at the steakhouse, he ordered lamb chops and a Caesar salad with anchovies  —   but he rarely indulges. With few exceptions, he limits his movement between team headquarters, where he eats a smart breakfast (  eggs without the yolk, half a waffle, oatmeal with berries) and lunch, and his apartment, which is near a tangle of food options. He orders the same food at the same restaurants on the same night (crab leg Wednesdays! ). At the Japanese place where he dines on Thursdays, he sits at the same seat, on the far edge of the bar, to await what the bartender calls Newman’s usual: a teriyaki chicken bowl (sauce on the side) and a lava roll (shrimp tempura and avocado topped with yellowfin tuna and sauce) complemented by a healthy pour of pinot noir. “I try to pay attention to some of the stuff that I put in my body now that I’m older,” said Newman, who also takes multivitamins,   fatty acids and supplements promoting joint and   health. “I don’t know if my metabolism is going to get superslow. But I’ve still got abs and stuff. How many     have abs?” Newman has never tested positive under the league’s    policy and is so fastidious about what he puts in his body that he does not understand how players get caught. “You have all the tools to find out what’s good and what’s bad you got an app to tell you all that,” he said, adding, “It’s simple. ” In the   he does not follow the team’s strength and conditioning program and for the past few years has not even worked out regularly with a trainer. He enjoys the spontaneity of tapping thoughts into his phone at breakfast and then amending the plan, if necessary, at the LA Fitness he visits five minutes from his   residence in Dallas. “I’ve worked out all my life, so I’ve learned all this free information,” Newman said. “I know I need to do whatever they ask after a certain period of time, so I work on the things I feel like I need to work on. ” His goal, when he was younger, was just “to get big. ” He realized the fallacy of that strategy when a misdiagnosed knee injury in his second N. F. L. season affected his strength and mobility for several years, even if it took until his fifth season for him to miss a game. He loves doing squats, and his former Bengals teammate Leon Hall, who is now with the Giants, said he rued that he would always have to remove weight plates if he   after Newman. But Newman concentrates on working the smaller, stabilizing muscles around his joints. A former champion sprinter at Kansas State, Newman now runs as fast as he needs to. The winner of the shuttle drill, which evaluates lateral movement and    skills, at the 2003 scouting combine, Newman now is as quick as he needs to be. He will never regain those attributes. But in the spring and summer, he wards off regression with   pickup basketball games, three times a week, against former N. B. A. and college players, a cardiovascular workout that he modifies to fulfill his needs. Newman reaps no physical benefits from scoring. He channels his energy into suffocating defense. He guards the opposition’s best offensive player. “They understand why I’m there,” Newman said. To work on quickness, many cornerbacks set up cones every 5 yards and then backpedal and break, again and again. That drill is popular, Newman said, but not functional. “That’s not reactive,” Newman said. “Our sport is 100 percent reactive. ” He continued: “I do the same things, just in a different way. In football, you turn and you reach out with your hand, use your arms, but in basketball you can’t do that you use all feet. You pick up a guy full court, you shuffle back, and then you’re breaking, turning and opening and cutting him off, trying to stay in front. If he gets by, you’ve got to cut him off and take the right angles. It’s literally the same thing as a corner. ” As he has gotten older, Newman has not dedicated additional time to recovery. But he has a standing appointment with the Vikings’ contracted acupuncturist, Hilary Patzer, on Tuesday mornings even though he hates needles  —   or rather, he hated them until Patzer treated his tight back. “I thought she was a witch at first, from Salem,” Newman said, laughing. “But I’ve never looked back. ” Newman considers this hour, which also includes the ancient Chinese healing method known as cupping, a vital part of his weekly recovery. Depending on how much hitting he did in the previous game, pain often does not set in until Wednesday, when practice resumes. It usually dissipates by Thursday. “Out of nowhere, I’ll feel like I’m 26 again,” Newman said. He devotes part of his afternoon a few days a week to napping, this on top of the eight hours of sleep  —   up at 7:20 a. m. in bed by 11 p. m.  —   he makes sure he gets. Instead of braving   traffic, he remains at the complex an extra 30 to 45 minutes, sitting in the massage chair or donning compression boots to facilitate leg circulation. When he returns the next day, he invariably hears some younger teammates talking about their aches. And this is what he tells them: “You’re walking around like I’m supposed to be walking around. You feel like I’m supposed to feel. ” Newman said he had not decided when he would retire. Could be after this season, or maybe next, depending on the demand for his services. But it will be soon, which saddens Gray, his secondary coach, who said he had seen no evidence that Newman’s body or mind was betraying him. Asked for an example of Newman’s mastery, Gray offered two, each of which resulted in an interception. The first came in a Week 10 victory last season at Oakland. Newman was supposed to thwart Amari Cooper’s release and then linger on the outside. But knowing he had a chance to undercut Cooper, Newman trusted his intuition and swooped inside. “I’m watching and thinking there’s no way,” Gray said. “I knew he knew that play because I know I didn’t coach him. ” The second example reflects Newman’s acumen. Late in the third quarter of a Week 3 win at Carolina this season, Newman matched up against Ted Ginn Jr. Trying to gain separation, Ginn ran tight with him for about 13 yards before making a move intended to force Newman to turn his hips in the opposite direction. It did not fool him. He knew that Ginn would come back, and when he did, Newman dashed in front to grab the ball along Carolina’s sideline. “It’s kind of like batters looking for pitches,” Newman said. “You try to see the ball coming out of their hand and see where the release point’s at. For us, though, it’s not as   as that. ” At the line of scrimmage, he tries decrypting the quarterback’s cadence and audibles. He uploads receivers’ mannerisms. When the ball is snapped, the play unfolds, to him, in slow motion. He begins expecting a catalog of possible routes, all of which are predicated on timing, and based on the receiver’s release or the depth of the quarterback’s drop, he starts winnowing them down. Zimmer favors an aggressive defensive scheme that often asks cornerbacks to play press coverage, denying the receiver a free release off the line. Newman rides receivers, feeling the route, aiming to run it better than they can. But when he plays off coverage, leaving space between him and the receiver, Newman cheats, he said, by watching the first three steps of the quarterback’s drop  —   and sometimes even the first five. From studying the quarterback, Newman knows exactly how he receives the ball, steps, plants and turns his shoulders to throw. There are plays, Newman said, when he knows precisely what will happen. As he spoke, he happened to look up at the television in his apartment, which was showing a Monday night game between the Giants and the Bengals. Based on where Green, his former Cincinnati teammate, lined up, Newman predicted he would run a stop, a slant or, more likely, a screen (which is was Green did). Once Newman thought he had cracked Palmer’s copter signal from his armchair, he wanted to delve a bit into some of Arizona’s receivers. He prompted a snippet of Michael Floyd running a comeback, a basic route in which a receiver runs, stops and turns toward the quarterback. Only the most adept can stop without having their momentum drive them downfield. Many receivers, particularly bigger ones, slow themselves by making rapid chopping movements with their hands and dropping their bodies. “I’m not watching his hips I’m watching his entire frame,” Newman said. “When I see the body go from high to low, I know he’s making his move. That’s when I start to break. ” Newman moved on to Larry Fitzgerald, who lined up behind other receivers at the top of the screen. As Fitzgerald went in motion, Newman correctly posited that he was getting a jump on his over route, an angled dash across the middle. Newman did not know whether he would be defending Fitzgerald, but generally speaking, he said, he prefers playing taller receivers like Fitzgerald off the ball so that he can counter their height with his quickness. “It’s knowing what I do well versus what they don’t do as well,” Newman said. That is the essence of Newman’s preparation, the hours he invests scouring film, surveying weaknesses, searching for clues that will sustain his value to the Vikings. His pursuit consumes him, and no matter how often he talks on FaceTime with his “kind of girlfriend” in California, in those spare moments away from his teammates  —   or the restaurant staff members who know him, or the apartment building concierge who invited him to watch the Vikings play, not realizing Newman would be busy that day  —   loneliness still descends. “Football’s like my escape,” Newman said. “It’s my everything. ” He yawned. His tablet needed recharging, and so did he. Newman has many hobbies  —   golfing, traveling, flying drones  —   but as a budding oenophile, he is perhaps most passionate about wine: strictly red, usually cabernet sauvignon or pinot noir. When he drifts off to sleep, exhausted, his mind is blank, he said, blissfully uncluttered by routes and formations, quarterbacks and receivers, his football mortality. Except for one thing. “I just think about grapes,” he said.",1
25691,"Geert Wilders, Dutch Far-Right Leader, Is Convicted of Inciting Discrimination - The New York Times","AMSTERDAM  —   Geert Wilders, the   politician who is seen as a likely contender to become prime minister when Dutch voters go to the polls next year, was convicted on Friday of inciting discrimination and of insulting a group for leading an   chant at a political rally in the Netherlands. The   judiciary panel found that Mr. Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom, violated Dutch law with his remarks on March 19, 2014, but it elected not to convict him of inciting hatred, and it imposed no punishment, rejecting the prosecutors’ request to fine him 5, 000 euros, or about $5, 300. Mr. Wilders was found to have violated laws on inciting discrimination and group offense when he led a crowd at a political rally around the time of municipal elections in The Hague in chanting, “Fewer, fewer” to the question “Do you want more or fewer Moroccans in this city and in the Netherlands?” The court, however, said that Mr. Wilders was not guilty of   charges in connection with comments he made about Moroccans in a nationally broadcast TV program recorded at a public market a week before the rally. The effect of the verdict on Mr. Wilders and on his party’s chances when the Dutch elections are held in March is unclear, but the trial seems to have improved his party’s standing, rather than diminishing it, among voters. If the Party for Freedom wins the most seats in the elections, Mr. Wilders could become prime minister, and he would then have to form a coalition government with other willing parties. Prime Minister Mark Rutte, leader of the   People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, said a year ago that he would refuse to join such a coalition unless Mr. Wilders retracted his comments about Moroccans. Mr. Rutte confirmed that sentiment at his weekly news conference on Friday, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Wilders, whose defense team said he would appeal the decision next week, was not present when the verdict was read by the chief judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, at a secured courtroom on a military base near Schiphol Airport, outside Amsterdam. The site was chosen to protect Mr. Wilders, who has been under constant guard because of death threats related to a long history of inflammatory comments, as well as the judge and prosecutors. “The most important thing is that he is found guilty of group insult and inciting discrimination,” said a spokesman for the public prosecution service, Frans Zonneveld. “For now, we’re very satisfied that he has been found guilty of these two charges. ” In their ruling, the judges said that Mr. Wilders’s comments at the rally had contributed to the further polarization of Dutch society by using “nationality as an ethnic designation” and that mutual respect was imperative in the “pluralistic” Netherlands. “He said that he was supported by millions of people and therefore was not to blame of offending a group,” Judge Steenhuis said. “It’s important to answer the question of whether he was guilty of this. That question is answered in our court system. We state that you cannot offend groups of people and discriminate against them. ” Mr. Wilders, who has taken a page out of   Donald J. Trump’s playbook  —   he adopted the campaign slogan “Make the Netherlands Great Again” and attended the Republican convention in the United States  —   has repeatedly made vitriolic and inflammatory remarks about Islam, the Quran, immigrants and Dutch minority groups. Since the election of Mr. Trump, the Party for Freedom has been surging in the polls. “I still cannot believe it, but I have just been convicted because I asked a question about Moroccans,” Mr. Wilders said in a video that was posted online. “The Netherlands have become a sick country,” he added. “I have a message for the judges who convicted me: You have restricted the freedom of speech of millions of Dutch and hence convicted everyone. No one trusts you anymore. ” Peter Kanne, a pollster with IO Research, an independent Dutch polling organization, said the most recent data, released on Nov. 25, indicated that the Party for Freedom had gained support and was currently about even with the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, the leading party. “A lot of people mentioned that they’re really getting angry that he is being accused and judged only for what he said,” Mr. Kanne said. “They think that he said something that is true, and they’re very angry that a politician cannot say that in a society where there is freedom of speech. ” After Mr. Wilders’s comments about Moroccans in 2014, more than 6, 400 Dutch citizens filed complaints against him at local police offices. Of those complaints, 41 became individual claimants in the criminal trial, asking for up to €500 in “immaterial damages” per person. None will receive compensation from Mr. Wilders in the case, the panel ruled. Michiel Pestman, a lawyer representing some of the claimants, said that his clients were “happy with the results” but added that it was rare for criminal courts in the Netherlands to convict someone without imposing a penalty. “It’s a bit weird,” he said, but “the principled nature of the decision is more important than the compensation. ” He added, “The judge has ruled for the first time in the Netherlands that there are limits to what even a politician can say. ” Just before the official court proceedings began on Oct. 31, Mr. Wilders said on his blog that he would boycott what he called “a travesty” against freedom of speech, but he changed his mind and testified during the defense’s closing arguments. Regardless of the verdict, he said, “no one will be able to silence me. ”",1
25692,"Race Relations Are at Lowest Point in Obama Presidency, Poll Finds - The New York Times","  percent of Americans say race relations are generally bad, one of the highest levels of discord since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles during the Rodney King case, according to the latest New York   News poll. The poll, conducted from Friday, the day after the killing of five Dallas police officers, until Tuesday, found that six in 10 Americans say race relations were growing worse, up from 38 percent a year ago. Racial discontent is at its highest point in the Obama presidency and at the same level as after the riots touched off by the 1992 acquittal of Los Angeles police officers charged in Mr. King’s beating. Relations between black Americans and the police have become so brittle that more than half of black people say they were not surprised by the attack that killed five police officers and wounded nine others in Dallas last week. Nearly half of white Americans say that they, too, were unsurprised by the episode, the survey found. Despite President Obama’s insistence at a memorial service for the fallen officers that the races in the United States are “not as divided as we seem,” the poll found that black and white Americans hold starkly different views on race, particularly regarding the treatment of   by the police. Asked whether the police in most communities are more likely to use deadly force against a black person than a white person,   of   answered yes, and only about half as many white people agree.   percent of whites said that the race of the suspect made no difference in the use of force only 18 percent of black Americans said so. When asked to rate the job their local police department was doing, four in five whites said excellent or good a majority of blacks answered fair or poor. More than   of black people say the police in their communities make them feel more anxious than safe. By wide margins, whites and Hispanics say the police make them feel safer. “I have been in situations where the police have made situations worse rather than better,” Ayesha Numan, 22, a black woman living in Kansas City, Mo. said in a   interview. “That’s not to say that I write them off as all bad. I just have to be cautious of how they’re acting around me. ” Mr. Obama on Tuesday spoke at a memorial service in Dallas honoring the officers killed when Micah Johnson, a    black Army veteran, opened fire at a protest last Thursday. Last week was among the most wrenching since the Black Lives Matter movement began three years ago: On    days, videos were released showing the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of the police, and the Dallas attack followed a day later. Black and white opinion is sharply divided on the aims and the approach of the Black Lives Matter movement. Seventy percent of   are sympathetic to the movement, compared with only 37 percent of whites. Among all Americans, 41 percent agree with the movement, 25 percent disagree and 29 percent do not have an opinion either way. Support for Black Lives Matter correlates directly to age, with 50 percent of all adults younger than 30 saying they agree with the movement, compared with 20 percent who disagree with it. Among those 45 and older, 36 percent agree and 29 percent disagree. “The Black Lives Matter movement has given a younger generation a voice in civil rights,” Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, said. “The police are a flash point. The broader situation is always the underlying issues: the criminal justice system being broken, the higher unemployment among   the slower recovery from the recession, the assault on voting rights and voter suppression. ” The nationwide   News Poll was conducted July 8 to 12 on cellphones and landlines with 1, 600 adults, including 171 black respondents and 1, 207 whites. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults, three points for whites and nine points for blacks.   percent of Americans have heard or read at least some news about the last week’s racially tinged violence  —   the shootings in Dallas and deaths of Mr. Castile and Mr. Sterling. Some feel skeptical of what they have seen and heard of police shootings. “A lot of the times you see video, and most of it’s after the altercation. You really don’t see what happens before that,” said Roger Boulanger, 46, who is white and lives in Mendon, Mass. He said that race relations were generally bad, but he did not perceive them as being worse recently. “I don’t want to say it’s 100 percent that every time someone gets shot, it’s just the police being racist,” he said. “I don’t think that. ”",1
25693,‘Brexit’ Is Locking In the Forces That Already Haunt the Global Economy - The New York Times,"Sometimes, something bad happens, and it creates huge financial market swings and   economic ripples. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were an example, as was the 2011 Japanese nuclear disaster. But the   Brexit is different. The immediate financial downturn after Britain voted Thursday to leave the European Union resembles the fallout from those disasters. But the other events were largely disconnected from the broader economic currents of their time. They were   events, at least in terms of their economic ramifications. What makes Brexit so concerning is that it accentuates and deepens global forces that have been building for years. So far, governments have been unable to limit any of it. And those forces have     dimensions that make it a particularly perilous time for the global economy, even though the type of   panic that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 looks unlikely. Britain accounts for less than 4 percent of world G. D. P. Most people on Earth don’t really have a rooting interest in the exact details of the nation’s trade relationship with the rest of Europe. But its decision to leave the European Union is making more powerful six interrelated forces that already weigh on the global economy: Low inflation There is a glut of global commodities, particularly oil. There is a glut of labor, with elevated unemployment in much of the world. Inflation has been persistently below the 2 percent mark that major central banks aim for, and shows little sign of rising. And since the Brexit decision, markets are signaling that those forces have become even more energized. The price of oil fell 7. 5 percent from Thursday to Monday’s close, despite little reason to think that the British referendum will cause any major changes in, for example, the supply of oil from oil reserves that the nation controls. And bond markets are priced at levels that imply the years ahead will have lower inflation that was priced in before the Brexit news. While high inflation is often seen as the greater threat, in the last few years economists have viewed   inflation  —   which can discourage spending and investment and make debts more onerous  —   as the more pressing concern. In the United States, bond market prices imply that investors now expect annual inflation of 1. 37 percent a year through 2026, down from 1. 55 percent on Thursday before the vote’s results, a drop of 0. 18 of a percentage point in Germany, the drop was 0. 13 of a point and in Japan 0. 10 of a point. (The one exception: Britain itself, which will almost certainly see much higher inflation in the coming years because of a drop in its currency. Strong dollar The United States dollar has been on a tear. The dollar index, measuring its value against six other major currencies, is up more than 20 percent in the last two years. Some of this reflects good health: The United States economy is reasonably strong, with steady growth since 2009 and a 4. 7 percent unemployment rate. That has led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates once and contemplate further moves. Some of the dollar rally reflects a more negative global outlook. The economies of Europe, Japan and many emerging markets have remained exceptionally weak, making the United States look comparatively fantastic. Factor in the United States’ traditional role as the beacon of stability in turbulent times, and American assets look more attractive than their underlying economics would suggest. Most worrisome is that there are some feedback loops between the strong dollar and economic weakness abroad. Many international companies, especially in China and emerging markets, owe debt in dollars, so a stronger dollar makes their debts more onerous and creates spillover economic weakness. And the stronger dollar is undermining American exporters, slowing growth in the United States. Brexit is only accentuating this. The dollar index is up 3 percent since Thursday, most significantly because of the collapse in value of the British pound, but it is also up against the euro. Impotent monetary policy The world’s central banks are well aware of these forces, of course, and are trying to combat them. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are in the middle of huge programs to try to pump money into their financial systems by buying assets. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have been delaying interest rate increases in hopes of achieving higher inflation and more solid growth. So far it hasn’t been enough to get inflation persistently up to 2 percent or achieve sustained strong growth. And it is an open question if more of the same will change anything, particularly given that the economic challenges emanating from Britain are more because of existential questions of national identity than because of a   business slowdown. Nonetheless, in the aftermath of Brexit, analysts and financial markets are now pricing in even slower interest rate increases for the Fed and the Bank of England, and a real possibility of yet more easing programs by the E. C. B. and the Bank of Japan. Low interest rates Remember back in December when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates? That day,   Treasury bonds were yielding 2. 3 percent. Those bonds had fallen to 1. 74 percent by Thursday (the Fed controls   interest rates directly, but   rates are set in the open market). In the two trading days since the Brexit vote, that rate has fallen to 1. 44 percent. Other bond markets, including across Europe and in Britain itself, have also experienced falling   rates. Germany, Switzerland and several other European countries even have negative   interest rates, meaning a person who buys a bond and holds on to it will lose money. That’s very much related to the decline in investors’ expectations for lower inflation and more central bank activism. But it may also reflect a “fear premium” as investors throw money into anything that seems safe  —   even if it means they are guaranteed to lose money. Weak growth This is the underlying story behind all of these other market currents. Europe is only now returning to its 2007 level of economic output Japan’s growth is so low it is constantly bouncing in and out of recession status. In developing markets, Brazil is in recession and China is slowing. Britain and the United States are doing better, but only by the diminished global standards of the 21st century. You can have endless debates about the underlying causes. Is this the inevitable result of a lull in productivity growth, a result of bad policy or bad luck, or some mix? Either way, the reality is that the global economy seems locked into lower growth than had been the norm in the decades before 2007. Britain’s E. U. vote raises the risk of further dragging down that growth rate, particularly if there is a prolonged period of uncertainty around the country’s fate or a permanent breakdown in the trade ties that make an economy richer. Political instability All of this is creating a toxic political environment in much of the advanced world, driving greater polarization and the flocking of voters to candidates outside the mainstream. Brexit is the most recent example, supported as it was by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. The rise of   nationalist parties in Continental Europe is another prime example, as are the popularity of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders in the United States Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and the   Podemos party in Spain. Of course, less conventional politicians could turn out to succeed at generating stronger economic conditions where parties of the center have failed. But if nothing else, the widening of the ideological spectrum creates a wider range of possible outcomes  —   including some that would surely be very negative for financial markets and the global economy. Again, none of these stand in isolation. Each is deeply related  —   either as cause, effect or both. And each has been pushed further by Britain’s choice. Where the cycle ends, and when, no one knows.",1
25694,Can The American People Defeat The Oligarchy That Rules Them? — Paul Craig Roberts,"By Paul Craig Roberts on November 3, 2016 Hillary’s crimes might cost her the election, but she won’t go to jail. 
by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts The Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing another slew of emails related to Hillary Clinton’s private server. 
Aren’t you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven’t blamed Putin for FBI director Comey’s reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary. 
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don’t need to worry about Hillary’s crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? 
The presstitutes’ cry is that Comey’s alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation. 
In July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary’s violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls. 
Actually, Hillary’s standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate’s public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election. 
Hillary’s problem has the ruling American Oligarchy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. 
What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn? Dominique Strauss Kahn indicted by Grand Jury and out on six million dollar bailout, but could he have been set up? 
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington succeeded in removing Strauss-Kahn as a challenge to its French vassal, Sarkozy. 
This is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans’ minds. 
The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let’s see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. 
While we wait, let’s concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. 
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent’s power makes them immune to law. Hillary’s crimes might cost her the election, but she won’t go to jail. 
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. 
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have “banks too big to fail,” unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. 
Not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists.

Did Alec Baldwin Pay $190,000 for the Wrong Picture? - The New York Times","Ten years or so ago, as the actor Alec Baldwin remembers it, the gallery owner Mary Boone sent him an invitation to a show of work by the painter Ross Bleckner, an artist whom she represented and he had befriended. The card featured a reproduction of Mr. Bleckner’s “Sea and Mirror,” a work from 1996, when the artist was at the height of his popularity. So began Mr. Baldwin’s love affair with the painting  —   an infatuation that has ended with Mr. Baldwin, who occupies a central role in New York’s cultural life, now pitted in a bitter dispute with two formidable players in the city’s rarefied world of art and money  —   Ms. Boone, a prominent art dealer, and Mr. Bleckner, one of her notable talents. This has, to say the least, become awkward. For years, Mr. Baldwin said he carried the image of “Sea and Mirror” in his shoulder bag, alongside a picture of one of his daughters and his father. In 2010, he asked Ms. Boone to find the collector who owned it and pry it away. “There was a kind of beauty and simplicity” to the work, Mr. Baldwin recalled in an interview this month. Happily, she reported back, the collector would sell  —   but at a premium. Mr. Baldwin put up the $190, 000. “I love this thing so much,” he said in a 2012 speech about support for the arts at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, proudly recounting his quest. “Three months later it was hanging in my house, in my apartment in New York. ” But Mr. Baldwin said that something about the painting always gave him unease. The colors weren’t quite the same. It smelled, somehow, new. In fact, he said, just a few months ago he discovered that he had not bought the painting he pined for. Instead, he said, for reasons that remain disputed, Ms. Boone sent him another version of the painting. He claims she passed it off as the original. “I thought she had made my dream come true,” Mr. Baldwin said. Instead, he said he believed that Ms. Boone, frustrated that the collector would not agree to sell, persuaded Mr. Bleckner to take an unfinished work from the same series, finish painting it and sell it to him without saying a word. Mr. Bleckner’s office said he could not be reached for comment. Ms. Boone, through her lawyer, disputed Mr. Baldwin’s account, asserting he was never misled about the identity of the work. “He’s wrong that the painting is a copy it’s an original and very fine work of art by Ross Bleckner,” Ms. Boone’s lawyer, Ted Poretz, said in a statement. Mr. Baldwin, however, has emails that buttress parts of his account. The Boone gallery also stamped a number  —   7449  —   on the back of the painting it sold to Mr. Baldwin, the same number it had listed next to the work it had said it was pursuing from the collector. Mr. Baldwin said he met with the Manhattan district attorney’s office this summer but was told that a criminal case could not be made. Ms. Boone’s lawyer declined to address in full the issues raised by the emails or the number next to the painting. “The gallery never likes to have unhappy clients,” Mr. Poretz said in his statement, “and it has turned cartwheels to try to satisfy Alec Baldwin. It has repeatedly offered Alec Baldwin a full refund, among other things. ” The interaction is hardly the first to end badly in an opaque, largely unregulated art market. It raises questions about why works created in one era by an artist, operating under one set of motivations, are sometimes different in value and reputation, compared with works that were perhaps created by the same artist in another era. But to Mr. Baldwin, the concerns are not nearly so esoteric: He contends he was betrayed. “Ross was a kind of friend of mine,” Mr. Baldwin said. He continues to be a Bleckner supporter. Mr. Baldwin’s foundation helped to underwrite an exhibition this month on Long Island that featured Mr. Bleckner’s paintings. He owns five of Mr. Bleckner’s works. Mr. Baldwin said that the flamboyant, outspoken Ms. Boone, from whom he sometimes bought art, admitted this year that she had switched the works. “She said, ‘I didn’t want to disappoint you,’” he said. Mr. Baldwin, who met Mr. Bleckner at parties in the Hamptons, where the actor owns a home, became an admirer of his work in the 1990s. Mr. Bleckner, who had a Guggenheim retrospective in 1995 at 45, had been an ascendant art star of the 1980s. He belonged to a stable of young artists who helped Ms. Boone build her reputation in the ’80s, though two of her stars from that time, Eric Fischl and David Salle, have since left for rival dealers. Mr. Baldwin bought his first Bleckner from Ms. Boone in 2010, and during that transaction mentioned that he really wanted “Sea and Mirror. ” The painting had sold at auction at Sotheby’s in 2007 for $121, 000. Ms. Boone told Mr. Baldwin in an email that the collector now sought $175, 000 for it. “The Gallery normally charges ten to twenty percent for this kind of transaction,” she wrote. “To make this a friendly deal, we would charge you even less  —   $190, 000,” before adding, “I know Ross is so thrilled for you to have a painting and so am I. ” Mr. Poretz said that shortly afterward Mr. Baldwin was told that, in fact, he was getting a different version of “Sea and Mirror. ” “By the time Alec Baldwin paid for the painting and it was delivered to him, he should not have misunderstood what he purchased,” Mr. Poretz said in his statement. Mr. Baldwin denies he was ever told he would be receiving a different work. He said that when he received the canvas, he noticed the composition lacked a feathery quality in the brush strokes he had admired in the photos of the work sold at Sotheby’s, and seemed brighter. Ms. Boone told him, he said, that it had been newly cleaned as a courtesy. This year, his suspicions growing, he sent emails to Mr. Bleckner and Ms. Boone inquiring about the collector from whom he had bought the painting and about the cleaning. According to copies of the emails, Mr. Bleckner responded that he did not know the name of the collector. Mr. Baldwin says Mr. Bleckner did not point out that that transaction had never gone through. Mr. Bleckner also discussed how he might have done the cleaning. “I would usually do that,” he wrote to Mr. Baldwin, “although I don’t actually remember. ” Mr. Baldwin finally had a Sotheby’s expert compare his painting to a catalog image from the 2007 auction. The expert said, “This is not that painting,” Mr. Baldwin recalled. He then confronted Ms. Boone and Mr. Bleckner. He said they acknowledged having given him another work. Mr. Baldwin has an email in which Mr. Bleckner is deeply apologetic but does not directly address about what. “im so sorry about all of this,” he wrote. “I feel so bad about this   …     what can I do to make this up to you?” He said Mr. Bleckner told him that he had started the painting in 1996 and finished it in 2010, though he had dated it 1996. “I don’t know what Ross knew,” Mr. Baldwin said. “Ross may have been instructed to make a copy. I don’t know. ” This summer, as Mr. Baldwin complained to Ms. Boone, he gave her an ultimatum. “Deliver to me the painting that I bought. The one you sold me,” he wrote in an email. Ms. Boone again asked Sotheby’s to contact the owner of the painting sold at auction in 2007, according to an email supplied by Mr. Baldwin. The collector, whose identity remains a mystery, was still not interested in selling. Ms. Boone’s lawyer, Mr. Poretz, also contacted Mr. Baldwin to try to settle the matter. In an interview, Mr. Baldwin acknowledged that the work he has was created by Mr. Bleckner and that it looks quite similar to the painting he coveted. But he said it was not the work he had fallen in love with  —   not a painting, in his view, created when the artist was at the peak of his fame. Still, he told Ms. Boone in a recent email, he did not want to hurt Mr. Bleckner. “I’m less worried about you, Mary,” he wrote, “as you are more of an armadillo and I’m sure you have been blasting your way out of corners like this on more than one occasion. ” Ms. Boone wrote back to say that she was working to get him the work he wanted. “I am not an Armadillo however,” she added.",1
25705,"Sheldon Silver, Ex-New York Assembly Speaker, Gets 12-Year Prison Sentence - The New York Times","Sheldon Silver, who rose from the Lower East Side of Manhattan to become one of the state’s most powerful and feared politicians as speaker of the New York Assembly, was sentenced on Tuesday to 12 years in prison in a case that came to symbolize Albany’s culture of graft. The conviction of Mr. Silver, 72, served as a capstone to a campaign against public corruption by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has led to more than a dozen state lawmakers’ being convicted or pleading guilty. But none had the power, cachet or longevity that Mr. Silver, a Democrat, had enjoyed, and prosecutors sought to make an example of him. They asked that he receive a sentence greater than the terms that had been “imposed on other New York State legislators convicted of public corruption offenses. ” The longest such sentence cited by the government was 14 years, the term imposed last year in the case of another former Democratic assemblyman, William F. Boyland Jr. who was tried and convicted in federal court in Brooklyn. Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court in Manhattan noted that even before Mr. Silver’s arrest, when some of his fellow legislators had been arrested on corruption charges, he remained undeterred. “One would think that the image of Mr. Silver’s colleagues being arrested and led off to jail would have caused someone who was basically honest to reappraise what was going on,” Judge Caproni said. Instead, she said, Mr. Silver “stopped nothing,” continuing to lie to his staff and to the press while holding himself out as “a paragon of virtue. ” Judge Caproni said that there had been an “incalculable, intangible harm” to the people of New York, and that the cumulative effect of public corruption “makes the public very cynical. ” She then listed some of Mr. Silver’s misdeeds and addressed him directly: “Mr. Silver, those are not the actions of a basically honest person. ” In court, Carrie H. Cohen, an assistant United States attorney, had asked that Mr. Silver’s sentence “reflect the massive damage caused to the public by his crimes. ” The sentence, Ms. Cohen continued, should send a message that this is not the way “business is done in Albany, or at least that it shouldn’t be, and that no one, including Sheldon Silver, is above the law. ” Mr. Silver briefly addressed the court before his sentence was delivered, saying he had let down his constituents, family and colleagues. “I’m truly, truly sorry for that,” he said. Mr. Silver was convicted on Nov. 30 of charges that included honest services fraud, money laundering and extortion. Upon his conviction, he forfeited his Assembly seat. Two weeks later, Dean G. Skelos, who as majority leader had been Mr. Silver’s Republican counterpart in the State Senate, was also convicted of corruption. Mr. Skelos is to be sentenced on May 12 a week later, John L. Sampson, a former leader of the Senate Democrats, will face his own sentencing. Prosecutors’ scrutiny of New York lawmakers continues: Several inquiries are now focused on possible wrongdoing connected to the administrations of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats. To date, however, Mr. Silver’s precipitous fall has no recent rival in the world of New York politics. In a statement issued moments after the sentencing, Mr. Bharara said that the “stiff sentence is a just and fitting end to Sheldon Silver’s long career of corruption. ” Mr. Silver had served for more than two decades as the Assembly speaker, imposing his will on matters large and small he had a reputation as a staunch defender of New York City, a shrewd negotiator in budget talks and, at times, a recalcitrant opponent of anything he disliked. But during a   trial last fall, a different side of Mr. Silver emerged. Evidence showed that he had obtained nearly $4 million in illicit fees in return for taking official actions that benefited a prominent cancer researcher, Dr. Robert N. Taub, at Columbia University, and two real estate developers, Glenwood Management and the Witkoff Group. Mr. Silver had expressed regret that his actions made the State Capitol the object of ridicule. In a letter sent last month to Judge Caproni, he offered an emotional apology, saying that he had “failed the people of New York. ” His lawyers had argued that the former speaker should be allowed to use his “unique talents” to benefit others, and that a sentence that incorporates “extensive community service and little  —   if any  —   incarceration could do that. ” Mr. Silver’s lawyers had suggested that he could work with the Fortune Society to help current and former inmates find jobs. One of Mr. Silver’s lawyers, Joel Cohen, told the judge that his client had been “devastated” and “crushed” by everything that had happened. Notwithstanding everything he has done, Mr. Cohen said, “his obituary has already been written. ” Another prosecutor, Howard S. Master, on Tuesday questioned the authenticity of Mr. Silver’s contrition, noting he had insisted that he would be exonerated “until the very moment of the jury’s verdict. ” Judge Caproni, citing Mr. Silver’s age, said she would not adhere to sentencing guidelines that recommended a term of roughly 22 to 27 years, calling such a sentence “draconian and unjust. ” The court’s probation office had recommended a   sentence. The judge ordered that Mr. Silver forfeit more than $5 million in proceeds from his crimes and pay a $1. 75 million fine. She rejected a defense assertion that Mr. Silver’s actions had not caused “discernible harm. ” She said the specter of corruption made it impossible to know whether government officials were making decisions for the right reasons or for personal financial gain. His crimes “cast a shadow over everything he has done and has thrown into doubt every difficult decision any legislator has ever made,” the judge said. Mr. Silver must surrender himself by noon on July 1 his lawyers have requested that he serve at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N. Y. a prison known for its familiarity with the housing of prisoners who, like Mr. Silver, are Orthodox Jews. Governor Cuomo said on Tuesday: “Today’s decision sent a simple message that officials who abuse the public’s trust will be held accountable. Justice was served. ” Last month, prosecutors, in a written submission to the judge, offered what they said was additional evidence of the ways Mr. Silver had abused his office “for personal benefit,” by helping two women with whom he had conducted extramarital affairs. One of the women had regularly lobbied Mr. Silver on behalf of clients with business before the state he had “used his official position,” prosecutors said, to help the other woman get a state job. Mr. Silver’s lawyers said after the hearing that his case would be appealed. Mr. Silver, addressing a crowd of reporters, said, “I believe in the justice system in this nation, and we’ll pursue whatever remedies the system makes available. ”",1
25706,'Amazing idiots' will never isolate Russia's Crimea - Putin,"Print version Font Size On Wednesday, October 26, Russian President Vladimir Putin took part in the plenary session of ""Forum for Action. Crimea"" in Yalta. Putin paid special attention to urgent problems for residents of the peninsula.The forum is organized by the All-Russian People's Front with over 300 people participating - People's Front activists, federal and regional experts, representatives of executive authorities and journalists.Putin reminded that the People's Front was the first public association to have started working in the Crimea after the referendum on the status of the peninsula. A lot has been done since then, but there is even more to do, the Russian president said. According to Putin, one needs to focus on sensitive issues in the first place. It goes about such issues as the modernization of social infrastructure, transport sector update and creation of new jobs.""I hope that activists of the People's Front will continue their work to monitor and analyze most pressing problems that the people of the Crimea worry about most,"" said Putin. Previous forums (""Forum for Action"" took place in Stavropol and Yoshkar-Ola this year - ed.) have shown that such events provide an opportunity not only to exchange views, but also to find ways to solve problems.Putin spoke about the measures to overcome attempts to blockade the peninsula .According to him, the issues of energy and water blockade of the peninsula have been solved and removed from the agenda within the shortest period of time possible. The construction of the transport passage across the Kerch Strait continues according to schedule, the president added. ""I hope that all approaches to the bridge and all the necessary infrastructure will be ready on time and with quality,"" he added.In the future, the Crimean bridge will allow to transport up to 14 million travelers and 13 million vehicles a year.Those who try to blockade the Crimea are ""amazing idiots,"" Putin said. ""Did they think that the people would kneel and beg in front of them? Amazing idiots,"" Putin said. ""With regard to the termination of water or electricity supplies - all this stands on the verge of a crime against humanity. Let's take a sufficiently large region with many millions of people living in it - 2.6 million people live in the Crimea - and cut the region from water and electricity supplies in winter,"" the president said. ""It appears that our human rights organizations have swallowed their tongues and sown up their mouths and do not say a word, but as a matter of fact, it goes about a serious crime,"" Putin stressed out. Putin stressed out the importance of the process of the rehabilitation of Crimea's indigenous people. The federal program of development of the peninsula will assign ten billion rubles for the purpose. ""First of all, we are talking about the socio-economic support, because political issues have been resolved. It goes about language, culture and education in people's mother tongue,"" Putin said.The president noted that many villages of the Crimean Tatars remain in a deplorable state and lack even essential merits of civilization, such as electricity and roads. This resource, the president said, is limited and would only embrace the indigenous peoples who live on the peninsula at the moment.""Any funds allocated by either the Russian Federation or a republic, or by Sebastopol should be kept under public control,"" the president said.Vladimir Putin has the right to visit any Russian regions, including the Crimea, official spokesman for the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, said commenting on a note of protest from Kiev. Ukraine sent a note of protest to Moscow in connection with Vladimir Putin's visit to the Crimea. ""Ukraine traditionally protests, as we traditionally do not take these protests into account. The President visits the regions of the Russian Federation that he considers necessary to visit. This is an internal affair of Russia, and it does not concern any other state, including Ukraine,"" Peskov added. According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the visits of Russian top officials to the Crimea demonstrate Russia's disregard of the state sovereignty of Ukraine. The Crimea became part of Russia as a result of the referendum held on March 16, 2014. According to the electoral commission, 95% of the population of the Crimea voted to reunite with the Russian Federation. Anton Kulikov",1
25708,Meet The Man Who Started The Illuminati,"Today, they are the source of ‘all conspiracy theories’ they are the inspiration behind many fiction novels, movies.

Illuminati is considered as the secret organization that is really controlling the world, pulling strings from behind ‘the scene’ and steering the world towards a New World Order. But this all started back in 1776, Ingolstadt, Germany by a man named Adam Weishaupt who was a respectable professor.


Adam Weishaupt’s idea was creating a better world. As a boy he was an avid reader, consuming books by the latest French Enlightenment philosophers in his uncle’s library. He was convinced that the monarchy and the church were repressing freedom of thought.
Adam Weishaupt was not, he said, against religion itself, but rather the way in which it was practiced and imposed.  His thinking, he wrote, offered freedom “from all religious prejudices; cultivates the social virtues; and animates them by a great, a feasible, and speedy prospect of universal happiness.” To achieve this, it was necessary to create “a state of liberty and moral equality, freed from the obstacles which subordination, rank, and riches, continually throw in our way.” In this period Freemasonry was steadily expanding throughout Europe. This secret group offered appealing alternatives to freethinkers. Adam Weishaupt wanted to join this lodge, however, he decided later to create his own.

On the night of May 1, 1776, the first Illuminati met to found the order in a forest near Ingolstadt. Bathed in torchlight, there were five men.

There they established the rules that were to govern the order.

All future candidates for admission required the members’ consent, a strong reputation with well-established familial and social connections, and wealth.

At the beginning the order had only 3 levels: ‘novices, minervals, and illuminated minervals…’ The name “Minerval” referred to the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva, reflecting the order’s aim to spread true knowledge, or illumination, about how society, and the state, might be reshaped.

A novice preparing to pass to the higher level of minerval, for example, had to present a detailed report on the titles of the books he owned, the identity of his enemies, and the weak points of his character. All members had to pledge the needs of a society before their personal.

THE RISE OF THE ILLUMINATI: 


Over the years the secret order grew considerably in size and diversity. By the end of 1784, the Illuminati had 2,000 to 3,000 members.

Although, at first, the Illuminati were limited to Weishaupt’s students, the membership expanded to included noblemen, politicians, doctors, lawyers, and jurists, as well as intellectuals and some leading writers, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

They included important people in Bavarian public life, such as Baron Adolph von Knigge and the banker Mayer Amschel Rothschild, who provided funding.

Baron von Knigge played a very considerable role in the society’s organization and expansion. As a former Freemason, he was in favor of adopting rites similar to theirs.

Members were given ‘secret’ names from famous history characters. Weishaupt was Spartacus, for example, and Knigge was Philo.

With more members the number of levels in the Illuminati had to increase. There were 13 degrees of initiation, divided into three classes.

HERE IS THE COMPLETE LIST OF ILLUMINATI CLASSES AND LEVELS: 


FIRST CLASS 
Each novice was initiated in humanitarian philosophy until he became a minerval. He then received the order’s statutes and could attend meetings.
Initiate Novice Minerval Illuminatus Minor 
SECOND CLASS 

The various degrees in this class were inspired by Freemasonry. The illuminatus major supervised recruitment, and the illuminatus dirigens presided over the minervals’ meetings.
Apprentice Fellow Master Illuminatus Major Illuminatus Dirigens 
THIRD CLASS 

The highest degree of philosophical illumination. Its members were priests who instructed lower-degree members. The lower orders of this class were themselves under the authority of a king.
Priest Prince Magus King 
THE PROHIBITION OF ILLUMINATI: 


The secret society stood for some controversial opinions. They considered that suicide was legitimate, that its enemies should be poisoned, and that religion was an absurdity. However, when the Duke-Elector of Bavaria found the secret society was planning to conspire against Bavaria on behalf of Austria, it was then when he issued an edict in June 1784 banning the creation of any kind of society not previously authorized by law.

Bavarian police found highly compromising documents, including a defense of suicide and atheism, a plan to create a female branch of the order, invisible ink recipes, and medical instructions for carrying out abortions.

The evidence was used as the basis for accusing the order of conspiring against religion and the state. In August 1787, the duke-elector issued a third edict in which he confirmed that the order was prohibited, and imposed the death penalty for membership.

Adam Weishaupt lived the rest of his life in Gotha in Saxony where he taught philosophy at the University of Göttingen.

The Bavarian state considered the Illuminati dismantled.

THE ILLUMINATI WAS JUST GETTING STARTED: 


Adam Weishaupt was accused of helping to plot the French Revolution.

This was the start of a war that will give birth to some of the greatest money machines that still exist today.

The secret society shifted its goals. They already had connections and knowledge. They didn’t need their society to be legal to exist.

Members chose to use the connections for making more money and profit because they realized with enough money you can control the world. You can control the laws. You can establish your agendas without being conflicted by ‘less’ enlightened people’s opinions.


The Illuminati have been fingered in recent events, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Weishaupt’s ideas have also influenced the realms of popular fiction, such as Dan Brown’s Angels & Demons and Foucault’s Pendulum by Italian novelist Umberto Eco.

Although his group was allegedly disbanded, Weishaupt’s idea still exists, pulling the strings.
But this article raises one really important question. Considering Adam Weishaupt’s first intent ‘a state of liberty and moral equality, freed from the obstacles which subordination, rank, and riches, continually throw in our way’ is it possible for this to be achieved and integrated into a society where people are not fully awaken?

25713,"As Leaders Argue, South Korea Finds China Is No Longer an Easy Sell - The New York Times","INCHEON, South Korea  —   Until recently, Beyond Cosmetics could not fill Chinese orders fast enough for its Green Piggy Collagen Jella Pack, a creamy beige substance containing pig collagen, or its Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask, which leaves the user’s face covered with foam. Then, in November, international politics struck this South Korean maker of skin care products. As China’s ire grew over plans by Washington and Seoul to park a missile defense system on South Korean soil, sales of the two beauty aids fell to   of Beyond Cosmetics’ sales, from  . Now, as the deployment of the system begins this week and China threatens to punish South Korea further, companies like Beyond Cosmetics have been bracing for worse. The intensifying diplomatic ruckus is exposing deep cracks in South Korea’s economic success story and forcing the nation to confront its dependence on China, its largest trading partner. Even before the current crisis, Beyond Cosmetics had started to look beyond China, where it was increasingly running into problems like tougher government rules and rising homegrown competition. “We thought we could do something better with our time than attempt to go further into the Chinese market,” said Kim   the company’s vice president, adding that he traveled regularly to promote   products in Malaysia, a predominantly Muslim country, and   matte lipsticks that can withstand the humidity in Thailand. An export powerhouse that began its upward trajectory decades before Beijing embraced capitalist economics, South Korea has long benefited from China’s rise. Chinese factories are major buyers of   components. A growing Chinese middle class embraced Korean devices, cosmetics, television shows and music, often in shopping trips across the Yellow Sea. All of that may be in jeopardy now. Consumer boycotts have hit Korean chain stores in China.   shows there have been canceled. Just last week, the Chinese National Tourism Administration ordered regional travel agencies to halt sales of package tours to South Korea. But even before China began lashing out at South Korea, the economic relationship between the industrial giants had started to shift. China is increasingly a competitor as much as a customer for South Korea. Chinese companies have improved product quality and can compete on price, both at home and abroad, in everything from complex components to cosmetics to smartphones. That presents major challenges for a country where a bribery scandal has engulfed both the country’s president and the de facto chief of its biggest conglomerate, Samsung, and raised questions about whether an economy driven by exports and close ties between officials and big business have reached their limit. To thrive long term, experts say, South Korea needs to consider overhauls that will help empower entrepreneurs and spread wealth domestically. “A key question is whether Korea is going to be able to make a shift away from a   and   growth model that brought them dramatic economic success,” said Mark W. Lippert, who recently left Seoul as the American ambassador to South Korea. Chinese manufacturers have started to make the parts and components that South Korean companies have been selling into China, where factory workers assemble them into products destined for European or American consumers. This   intermediary trade currently accounts for about   of all of South Korea’s exports to China. Chinese companies are also making more of their own consumer goods such as cars, phones and   television screens. Samsung, which commanded a 20 percent share of the Chinese cellphone market in 2012, now has only 6 percent, according to GfK, the market researcher. The top four   cellphone brands in China, according to IDC, the technology research firm, are now made by Chinese companies. Mr. Kim, of Beyond Cosmetics, says Chinese cosmetics manufacturers have wooed South Korean research employees with salaries that are three times higher than what his company can offer, in addition to benefits like housing and cars. In 2015 and 2016, South Korea’s exports fell for the first time in close to 60 years, the Korea International Trade Association said. Last year, exports to China slid 9. 3 percent compared with a year earlier as the Chinese economy slowed down, though those figures were up in the first two months of this year. “Regardless of the industry, Korea has depended on China too much,” said Kang   professor of trade and economic studies at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. Beijing has protested South Korea’s agreement to host the missile defense system  —   called the Terminal   Area Defense system, or Thaad  —   and the Chinese state news media have been calling for a boycott, affecting everything from South Korean pop stars and television programs to   supermarkets. This week, alarmed by the most recent test of ballistic missiles by North Korea, the United States began to deploy the system. That is affecting an effort by South Korea to reap more economic power from its popular culture. Several musical events featuring its performers in China have been canceled, and South Korean dramas have been pulled from Chinese online video services. Lotte, a South Korean conglomerate that is providing land for the Thaad deployment, has reported that its online stores in China have been hacked and that half its   shops have been shut down for reported fire code violations. Although Lotte is reluctant to blame the Thaad backlash, Chinese consumers seem ready to do so. Over the weekend, hundreds of angry protesters, waving Chinese flags and singing, assembled outside Lotte shops and demanded that the public boycott South Korean products. In Incheon, a port city less than 250 miles from the nearest port in China, visiting Chinese consumers arrive by ferry to snap up items like rice cookers, toilet seats, food and makeup. Still, local merchants are experiencing what they say is a slowdown in tourist activity from China. Incheon officials said that this month, several large Chinese businesses that were planning to send thousands of employees to company workshops in the city canceled the visits. Although the number of Chinese visitors to Incheon rose in 2016 over a year earlier, when an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome caused tourism to plunge, the numbers have not returned to 2014 levels. Yoo   Incheon’s mayor, said in an interview at city hall, “If we didn’t have these geopolitical security issues, I think these 2016 figures would have been much higher. ” Lee   65, owner of a small dealer of   rice cookers, said he used to sell about 30 cookers a day to Chinese visitors. On a recent Wednesday, he was unable to sell even one and cited the Thaad deployment as the biggest factor. In the underground Sinpo International Market, a warren of small retail stalls selling clothing, handbags and used cellphones, business was sluggish on a recent visit. “Things are really bad right now,” said Kim   52, owner of Mirae Mobile, where he sells recycled cellphones and iPads. “But to be honest, what can the government do? This is such a sensitive political issue. ” Down the hall, at a tiny skin care salon, Kim   57, the owner, sat alone on a small stool waiting for a customer to stop by. An ethnic Korean who was born in China, Ms. Kim opened her stall two years ago. About half of her business came from Chinese visitors, including a steady stream of cruise ship and ferry workers who wanted facials. Now, she’s lucky to get one or two customers a day. Ms. Kim never thought she would need to pay so much attention to politics. “I think the politicians have not done well,” she said. “Because for the economy to be good, we have to have a relationship with China. I think Korea should be smarter by trying to cooperate with China. ”",1

Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the “Banished” video on Danney Williams’ page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : “This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.” 
The video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton’s Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. 
Attempt to silence Danney Williams? 
Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
“The behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney’s account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,” Gilbert said. 
Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
“The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, ‘to run him off the plantation’ as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor’s mansion in 1990,” Gilbert said. 
“Danney cannot be silenced any longer,” he continued. “Hillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it’s not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.” 
See the Danney Williams video feature: 
WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. 
No definitive DNA test 
WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams’ claim first surfaced. 
Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a “DNA showdown” proving Bill Clinton was not Williams’ father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, “There was no match, nothing even close.” 
But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
“I don’t remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton’s DNA,” Bunton told WND. 
Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. 
He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. 
“We got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,” Bunton recalled to WND. “We thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.” 
The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. 
‘Twitter rules’ 
Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as O’Keefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of “Twitter Rules.” The notice said he “must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users’ private information” or violating “other rules.” In a statement, O’Keefe said he relies on social media to “bypass the media and directly reach the public.” On Monday, O’Keefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block “bizarre.” Earlier this month, O’Keefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn’t show up on Google’s “trending” list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his “Gays for Trump” party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie “I’m Not Ashamed,” about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movie’s entire channel was suspended . 
Among the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friend’s account being censored. Facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schooler’s account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giuliani’s comment that Obama “doesn’t love America.” The admin of a pro-Trump group was banned for saying Trump is not anti-Muslim, but anti-ISIS.",1
25719,Hackers Publish Nude Pictures on Leslie Jones’s Website - The New York Times,"Leslie Jones, a   of this year’s “Ghostbusters” movie who has been besieged in the past month by online abusers who have targeted her appearance and her race, was victimized again on Wednesday when her personal website appeared to have been hacked. The hackers inserted a picture of the gorilla Harambe on the site, and exposed what appeared to be explicit photos of the actress, along with pictures of her driver’s license and a passport, and images of her with stars like Rihanna, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West. The website was taken offline after the hack, which was initially reported by TMZ. An email to a representative for Ms. Jones was not immediately returned on Wednesday. The website, which had contained information about her comedy career and her past work in film, appeared to have been retooled to display the personal photos and information. There was no way to independently confirm that the photos were of Ms. Jones and whether the identification documents were real, but the address on the driver’s license appeared to correspond with information about Ms. Jones that is available through public records. Ms. Jones, 48, had spent much of the past month battling online trolls who sent her a stream of racist imagery, pornography and abusive language. She briefly left Twitter, but later returned to tweet about the Rio Olympics. In the hours after Ms. Jones’s site was taken offline,   defenders offered public support. “These acts against Leslie Jones are sickening,” the musician Questlove wrote in a post on Twitter. “It’s racist  sexist. It’s disgusting. This is hate crimes. This ain’t ‘kids joshing round.’ ” Others, including Paul Feig, the director of the “Ghostbusters” film, the comedian Patton Oswalt and the singer Katy Perry defended the actress on Twitter. Brendesha Tynes, a professor of education and psychology at the University of Southern California who specializes in social media and cyberbullying, said in an interview that part of what was fueling the attacks against Ms. Jones was a “serious   woman problem in the U. S. ” Dr. Tynes noted the criticism levied at the Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas while she was competing in Rio, and said, “Even the slightest perceived infraction leads people to get bullied. ” Ms. Jones herself had stood up for Ms. Douglas while in Brazil. Sameer Hinduja, the   of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of Criminology at   University, applauded Ms. Jones for standing up to those who have victimized her over the past several months. “She was an advocate for others that have been victimized and haven’t spoken up, and that has led to more attention, and has, perhaps indirectly, led to policy change on Twitter’s part,” he said in an interview, referring to the company’s taking action against some of the accounts that had hurled racist insults at Ms. Jones. He added that Ms. Jones’s willingness to remain an active   presence may have made her a more tempting target for bullies and hackers. “Some of those that cyberbully attempt to identify something that you’re particularly sensitive about, and because they know that it will get under your skin,” Dr. Hinduja said. “Or they’re just biased and intolerant, as perhaps was the case considering the racial hatred in some of the attacks on Leslie Jones. ” Dr. Tynes said that the hack on Wednesday felt particularly harrowing after Ms. Jones had seemed to prevail over those who attacked her earlier this summer, elevating her public presence by using social media sites such as Twitter and Snapchat prolifically during the Olympics. “I have to say, as a human being, it’s heartbreaking,” Dr. Tynes said. “As a researcher, I haven’t seen in the adolescents I study anything this heinous. ” She said that attacks like these could have serious consequences on a victim’s mental health, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. “I’m hoping that people will once again rally behind her, show her love, and hopefully serve as a buffer against some of the potentially negative consequences,” Dr. Tynes said. “I’m at a loss for words, but I do know that people will rally behind her once again. ”",1
25720,"Mark Zuckerberg, Don't Get Hoodwinked by Media and Politicians","3 Shares

Shortly after Hillary Clinton's crushing defeat, the media came up with another spin: Zuckerberg and Facebook were held responsible for her debacle! What crap! Facebook apparently carried ""fake news"". Didn't the media invent and promote precisely this kind of ""news"" to bounce Hillary over the last hurdle? It's convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and Hillary's corrupt campaign organization for her defeat. Clinton labeled ordinary Americans ""deplorables"", displaying her contempt for half of the population. Hillary Clinton was favorite puppet of the Establishment. She was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system. And the American people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image. An estimated 95 per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husband's corrupt Clinton Foundation.
The real reason behind the attempt to blame Zuckerberg's Facebook is, that it makes everyone (and no one) responsible. What is posted on Facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class. They lost control of public opinion. Established methods of mind-control do not work any longer. The fawning media report only what they are fed by government spin-doctors. It is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters. This holds true for US media, as well of the media class in the European vassal states. German media were, for example, as manipulative as those in the United States. They celebrated President Obama as the embodiment of ""good America"", ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency, incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extra-legal executions. But he possessed a great advantage, he was black, or if you wish, non-white. Obama was thus a non-white and smarter version of George W. Bush.
When Mark Zuckerberg visited Berlin in February 2016, he was bootlicked by the German political and media class. The Springer group, the most outspoken mouthpiece of U.S. interests US in Germany, awarded him the Axel Springer Award. Of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between Zuckerberg and Chancellor Angela Merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against so-called hate-speech on the internet. The Merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy. Merkel’s minister of justice, Heiko Maas, has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for ""hate speech"", whatever that means.
There is no agreed upon definition what ""hate speech"" implies, hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily. The range of ""Hate speech"" can range from anti-Muslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call ""to kill every Jewish Zionist"". There is a duty of government under the ""International Convention for the Abolition of All Forms of Racial Discrimination"", to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda. Ergo, there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of ""hate speech"".
Even restrictions to “free speech” extend to other spheres, such as prohibition of deceitful advertising, slandering other people, and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in Iceland. Human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values. There is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights.
In Germany, this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as ""klicksafe.de, ""jugendschutz.net"", ""Gesicht zeigen"" (Show your Face), to name a few. The most eminent of these is the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, run by a former Stasi agent by the name of Anetta Kahane, who claims to fight racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia. Today, she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of Merkel's policy of government failure.
Internet giants such as Facebook, Google (and YouTube) and Twitter also participated ""voluntarily"" in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up. In September 2015, this new ""censorship body"" was established in the German Ministry of Justice and works since then without legal basis! The participants agreed on ""best practices"" in handling hate messages. There are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize ""hate speach"". That means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily. There are no rules or statutory provisions. Those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship. Despite such arbitrary practice, the interim results, which were presented in the Ministry of Justice on 27 September 2016 were not satisfactory. Google (and YouTube) and Facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results. From August to September, 622 punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Justice was not satisfied.
Thus, it is not only the American political class which is blaming Facebook for the defeat of its minion Hillary Clinton but also the German political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on Facebook, fearing that ordinary people could endanger Merkel's quest for a renewed mandate as Chancellor. But what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the ""deplorables"", i.e. the mass of ordinary people, do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editors-in-chief. The attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of Facebook and Google.
At the beginning, Zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for Clinton's defeat. After a while, it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in. On Friday, November 18, 2016, Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook that the amount of ""misinformation is relatively small"", nonetheless there is ""much work ahead on our roadmap"". The following work in progress was outlined by him:
""A stronger detection system. The most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.
- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster.
- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more.
- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them.
- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed.
- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.
- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them.""
Apparently, Zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue. I beg to differ. The issue is not about fake news, it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mind-control industry, owned by a few families on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. If they lose this control of public opinion, they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges.
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, take courage, and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class.
When one discusses freedom of expression and the role of Facebook one point needs special scrutiny, namely the private character of this entity. The private character of an entity precludes transparency. Citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances, let alone participate in determining Facebook projects and policies. As a citizen, one cannot accept that one unelected person, however, nice he may be, could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings. Such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule. One can see this operating within Wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of 9/11 or the Israel/Palestinian conflict. It's impossible to even insert critical question because they don't pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control. Google is another such Leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership. How such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer. The first step would certainly be for civil society, without influence from the corporate world, to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services. It would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal.",1
25722,Rep. Chaffetz Subpoenas ATF Agents Involved in Obama’s Fast and Furious Op,"Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz subpoenaed two agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to appear before his committee in connection with the Obama Administration’s   program, Fast and Furious. Firearms from the former president’s scheme were allegedly involved in the 2011 murder of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata in Mexico. [Chaffetz, who serves as chairman of the House Oversight Committee issued the subpoenas after the two ATF agents failed to appear voluntarily before the committee.  “I’m tired of hearing from just [Justice Department] management, I want to hear from the people that actually are on the front lines doing this,” Chaffetz told Fox News.  Chaffetz wants to hear directly from ATF Agent William Temple, special agent in charge of the Dallas Field Division, and Associate Director Ronald Turk. The hearing marks the first effort by Congress to   the investigation into President Obama’s Fast and Furious gun trafficking scheme since he left office in January. ICE Agent Zapata was killed by one of the guns involved in this program, and Special Agent Victor Avila was injured during the attack in Mexico. Following the attack on the two ICE agents, Breitbart News reported: Agent Zapata’s partner Victor Avila spoke out about the attack that left Agent Zapata dead and him wounded. His twin sister Magdalena   spoke for him in the Univision special on Fast and Furious. Avila is so scared and hurt by the attack he did not speak out until he knew he was in a secure location. No one knows for sure why Agent Zapata and Agent Avila, assigned to the US Embassy, were asked to travel on road 57, a road controlled by the Zeta Cartel and extremely dangerous. They didn’t even know why they were given the mission to retrieve electronic surveillance equipment. The urgency made it even more suspicious. Agent Zapata and Agent Avila met with American consulate agents in Monterrey and received 14 boxes of equipment. They did stop for something to eat on road 57 before heading back to Mexico City. About a half hour after leaving the restaurant they noticed two cars closely following them. Within seconds the vehicles surrounded them and 14 heavily armed men formed a circle around their car. Unfortunately, Agent Zapata put the car in park, which forced the doors to automatically open. Agent Avila said they thought their diplomatic plates would protect them and the screamed they were American agents. The men didn’t care and demanded them to exit the vehicle. The agents refused to leave their vehicle. They frantically tried to relock the doors, but instead Agent Avila accidentally lowered his window. A rifle and handgun came in through the small opening and the man opened fire. Agent Avila pressed the emergency satellite button, but it did not work. He also tried to place an emergency call to the embassy, the Mexican capital, and the First Post of the Regional Security Command. They told Avila a Mexican Federal Police helicopter would be there in 40 minutes. 90 bullets were fired. Five hit Agent Zapata and three hit Agent Avila in his right leg. Agent Zapata turned to Agent Avila and said, “I am going to die. ” Agent Avila responded, “No, you are not going to die. Be strong, help is on the way, you are not going to die. While in the rescue helicopter Agent Avila was informed Agent Zapata did, in fact, die. On Thursday, the two ATF officials failed to appear before the committee looking into the assault on the agents. ATF   Thomas Brandon, an Obama Administration holdover appointed in 2015, claims he did not order the two ATF officials to skip the hearing Fox News reported. However, he said he agreed with their decision to bypass the Oversight Committee’s hearing. The failure of the two ATF officials to voluntarily appear before Congress sparked the issuance of a subpoena and sharp rebukes from both sides of the aisle. “That puts us in a kind of awkward position. We got the boss, ‘OK guys, you don’t have to show up.’ And that sends a hell of a message. That’s a problem,” Elijah Cummings ( ) the ranking Democrat on the committee, said. Chaffetz complained that the ATF “continues to insist” that his committee should not speak directly with the two officials. Assistant U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas John Craft also failed to appear. Chaffetz said his committee issued the invitation to Craft late and he would not be issuing a subpoena for him at this time. Fox News reported on an ATF Inspector General report that was completed in 2012 but not released until March 1, 2016. Fox reported: The IG said the ATF were aware in 2010 that Osorio and his brother might be trafficking firearms to Mexico, but they did not follow up or further investigate until after Zapata’s death. Otilio Osorio and Riendfliesh were arrested in late February 2011 after the ATF confirmed weapons used in Zapata’s murder had been purchased by them. The report faulted ATF for its handling of the case, saying there was “probable cause” to arrest Osorio and his brother “after ATF witnessed the Osorios complete a transfer of 40 firearms on November 9, 2010. ” The IG said: “Overall, we found numerous problems with ATF’s assimilation of information concerning [the suspects]   …     and the timeliness of ATF’s response to mounting evidence that they were committing firearms offenses. ” The report states that two weapons used in the murder of Agent Zapata and wounding of Agent Avila traced back to a   gun show purchase by Otilio Osorio, and a purchase by Robert Riendfliesh at a gun store in Beaumont, Texas. The report continues, stating the ATF suspected the two men were trafficking firearms to Mexico but failed to further investigate the purchases until after the murder of Agent Zapata. ATF agents eventually arrested the two men in connection with the purchases. Despite the length of time since the incident, the creation of the report, and its issuance, Director Brandon told Chaffetz he was not prepared for the hearing. “That’s a bunch of crap,” Chaffetz snapped at the ATF acting director. Chaffetz responded that he received a draft of the report in December. The murder of U. S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010 is also connected to the Fast and Furious   scheme. Two guns involved in Fast and Furious were found at the scene of his murder. Terry and other members of his elite Border Patrol BORSTAR team engaged a group of Mexican bandits. The bandits opened fire. Terry was shot in the back and died before reaching the hospital. The Terry family met with   candidate Donald Trump several times during the campaign. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas, the Terry family expressed hope that President Trump would get to the answers their family has been searching for over the past six years. “I want people to grow a conscious and come clean as to what transpired, what was covered up and what the hell were they thinking,” Terry’s sister, Kelly   told Breitbart Texas. She said she had heard many promises by many people. “If Mr. Trump can get those skeletons out and expose the truth then my family can finally get closure and justice for Brian,” Kelly explained. “I think there are a lot of people scared that just might happen. It may take time, and we will be patient, but the truth always reveals itself. I hope Trump can make that happen. ” On Friday, Terry’s brother, Kent Terry, spoke out about the new hearing and the subpoena issued to the two ATF officials. “We have the House, Senate, and the White House now,” Kent Terry said. “There should be absolutely no reason we should fail to get the answers and accountability for the deaths of Agent Zapata and my brother. Their mothers have been put through Hell since these murders occurred. They deserve to know why their sons, who served every day, were killed by criminals armed by our government. ” “Enough time has gone by,” an exasperated Kent Terry explained. “I respect their hands were tied with the Obama Administration’s executive privilege taken on the Fast and Furious documents. But why hasn’t the Oversight Committee gone after the ATF agent who no longer works there? Why hasn’t the committee asked why who has been fired in connection with the program?” The full report on the hearing held by the committee on March 9 is available on the Oversight Committee’s website. The committee is expected to hear from the two ATF officials under subpoena later this month. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

25727,"California Voters Face Choice: End Death Penalty, or Speed It Up - The New York Times","HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.  —   Beth Webb remembers talking with friends at her sister’s Christmas party several years ago, wondering aloud if she would support the death penalty if someone she knew were murdered. Then, in 2011, her sister, Laura Webb Elody, was killed along with seven other people  as she worked at a hair salon in nearby Seal Beach. For weeks, Ms. Webb wanted revenge. And the local district attorney promised she would get it in the form of the death penalty. But five years later, the man who killed her sister and wounded her mother is still alive, and Ms. Webb is now helping to lead the campaign to abolish the death penalty here. Tami Alexander has waited even longer. The man who killed her    and    has been on death row for more than two decades. The death penalty has long been one of the most contentious issues in the state. Though California has executed only 13 people since the 1970s, it has sentenced hundreds to death and has more prisoners on death row than any other state. California has repeatedly been criticized for keeping those people in a suspended state for years, costing Californians billions of dollars. There have been attempts before to reform the system  —   just four years ago a ballot proposition failed in its effort to abolish the death penalty entirely. Now voters are being presented with their latest choice in the matter: Should the state get out of the business of capital punishment completely or enact a plan to make executions happen more quickly? Both proposals accept that the state’s death penalty system  —   which costs an estimated $150 million a year for trials, appeals and death row facilities  —   is broken. The state’s process is so prolonged, “with only the remote possibility of death,” that it is tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment, a federal judge wrote in a 2014 ruling, calling the system dysfunctional and arbitrary. The 747 inmates on death row remain in a legal limbo: There has not been an execution in the state since 2006, as the state’s lethal injection protocol remains tied up in the courts. This year, voters will decide between two competing ballot measures: Proposition 62, which would end the death penalty and replace it with life without parole, and Proposition 66, which would speed up the executions by accelerating appeals for inmates on death row. A victory for either side will transform the state’s system for capital punishment. When the death penalty was last on the state ballot, the focus remained primarily on money  —   with opponents arguing that the state was spending billions without executing anyone. In California, most inmates spend at least two decades on death row. Far more have died from natural causes or suicide than have been executed. After the measure to repeal it lost by four percentage points in 2012, supporters of the death penalty quickly pulled together to find a way to get their proposal to voters as quickly as possible. “We knew we needed to say to California voters as quickly as possible that we have to get this fixed,” said Mike Ramos, the San Bernardino district attorney and one of the leading proponents of Proposition 66. “Citizens are getting rightly frustrated that we are holding the worst of the worst, people who are evil, on hold indefinitely. The families would like justice, the people want justice, and what we have does not work. ” This time, the arguments are as much about moral and philosophical issues as financial, with Ms. Webb and Ms. Alexander each seen as key advocates for the opposing measures. “There is no way to know how much hatred you have in your heart until someone you know is murdered,” Ms. Webb said in a recent interview. “That’s what the people who want this understand  —   the frustration of somebody doing this to you and you not being able to do anything is overwhelming. ” Though national polls show that a majority of voters favor the death penalty, there have been notable victories in attempts to repeal it. In the past decade, legislatures in New Jersey, New Mexico and Illinois have all voted to end it, and other governors have declared moratoriums on executions. And two other states  —   Oklahoma and Nebraska  —   will also vote on ballot propositions this year. “There are a few counties that are overproducing death penalties, and it is coming at an enormous cost to everyone in the state,” said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “You no longer have to be against the death penalty in theory to be against the way the death penalty is practiced in the United States. We used to look at it dogmatically, and now we are looking at it pragmatically. ” While opponents of the death penalty argue that eliminating death row would save $150 million, supporters similarly argue that speeding up the process would save the state more money in the long run. Proposition 66 would force courts to process death penalty cases more quickly, but opponents of the measure say there are not enough lawyers with the ability to handle the cases to move cases off the docket. “Our family doesn’t care if it takes 100 years if it’s a case where the innocence is in question, but that’s not what happens,” Ms. Alexander said. “What happens is that we wait an eternity for someone who is already found guilty and that a jury found deserves to die. They can appeal over and over again on things that have nothing to do with the crime itself. ” And the delays in execution, once an exception, are now routine for myriad reasons. In addition to the guilt phase of a criminal trial, the penalty phase can go on for years as lawyers compile thick histories of the suspect’s criminal and mental health record, and few defense lawyers are interested in taking on such cases, said Ellen S. Kreitzberg, a law professor at Santa Clara University who has studied how the death penalty is carried out in California. “In the counties where you have a lot of death penalty cases, you’ve got 35 percent of a court’s staff time spent on those,” she said. “That means the system is not working. It’s not equipped to deal with this. ” Ms. Webb said it was not until her sister’s case began to drag on that she began to rethink her views on the death penalty. “The offer that the death penalty is somehow going to relieve your pain is on so many levels unfair,” she said. “Because what they are saying is that if you hold on to that anger long enough we are going to release it for you when we murder this person. But I cannot live with the idea that somebody else’s death is going to set me free. It would validate the very thing that he did. ” Ron Briggs, who helped draft a ballot measure expanding application of the death penalty in 1978 and was one of the leading proponents of the attempt to repeal it in 2012, said that despite the narrow loss, he thought a quick return to the ballot was the best way to persuade voters to end capital punishment in the state. “That gives all the closure the family needs and ends these endless appeals,” Mr. Briggs said. “I think Republicans and fiscal conservatives are really beginning to get the message that this is costing a lot of money and not doing a lot of good. ”",1
25728,Will Trump Go After Nafta With Tweezers or a Hammer? - The New York Times,"We’re resurfacing this article in light of President Trump’s recent comments on Nafta. After calling it the “worst trade deal,” he seems to be softening his stance.  It was a deal that created a deeply intertwined economy stretching from the Arctic to Central America and a generation of mostly warm relations between the United States and its two neighbors. It has also contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and added to   discontent in the communities that lost them. That, in turn, helped propel a sharp critic of the deal to the White House. So with Donald J. Trump in charge, what happens now to the North American Free Trade Agreement? It’s one thing to assail it as the “worst trade deal ever” as the president did during the campaign. It’s quite another to come up with an arrangement that is more advantageous to American workers and businesses. “Nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with,” said Wilbur Ross, the president’s nominee to be commerce secretary, in his confirmation hearing. It will be, he said, a “very, very early topic in the administration. ” So what might that actually mean? What can the president actually do, what benefits might be attained for the United States and what could go wrong? Trade experts say there really is room to make major change in the    agreement. A renegotiation could well lead to a better deal for all three countries. But it will require the United States to make concessions that the Trump administration may be wary of offering. If not approached carefully, revamping an agreement that has created the economic underpinning of major industries would risk American jobs as well as higher prices for consumers. And the closer the Trump administration gets to blowing up the deal, the larger those risks loom. Before diving into what could go wrong  —   and right  —   as President Trump looks to rework Nafta, it’s worth starting with the basics. What is Nafta? On Oct. 7, 1992, President George H. W. Bush stood in San Antonio flanked by the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada. “This meeting marks a turning point in the history of our three countries,” he said. “We are creating the largest, richest and most productive market in the entire world. ” Mr. Bush’s successor, Bill Clinton, was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress. By 1994, the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that, in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages, lashed their economies together. It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana. What have been its results? As the election showed, whether Nafta was a good thing for voters in the United States or a bad one continues to be argued. But there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon. The North American economy really does work as an integrated whole. United States exports to Mexico, for example, are now 3. 5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation. They have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy. Trade between the United States and Canada has been pretty well balanced over time, but the United States has had about a $60 billion per year trade deficit with Mexico, importing more than it exports. In the auto industry, for example, supply chains crisscross North American borders, with work of different complexity done in different countries. Your Ford made in Michigan might contain a dashboard made in Juarez and a transmission made in Windsor, Ontario. This complex supply chain has helped make the U. S. auto industry competitive with manufacturers in Asia and Europe, which also contain both   and   countries with different specialties. The impact on jobs and incomes in the United States is less clear. Economists broadly supportive of free trade deals argue that Nafta essentially encouraged a shift of jobs in the United States toward   more productive work, raising wages and having negligible impact on the total number of jobs. Those more skeptical of the deal view it as having created   competition across the border in Mexico that accelerated the loss of manufacturing jobs. (See a more detailed explanation of the competing views here and here.) One way to reconcile those two views: Nafta may have increased overall G. D. P. and average incomes in the United States  —   but at the same time contributed to the decline in   U. S. manufacturing jobs that tended to be concentrated in certain cities and among certain groups of people, mostly   men. Can President Trump kill the deal? In theory, yes. But it would be a mess, particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat. Article 2205 of  Nafta says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. But if President Trump did that, it would unleash disarray in major industries ruin the ability to have   negotiations with Canada and Mexico and most likely cause a legal showdown with Congress (which passed Nafta all those years ago and wouldn’t want it abrogated without a say). That doesn’t sound like what the Trump administration has cooked up. It’s more likely to reopen the deal. “I’m optimistic that we can renegotiate the deal that’s both advantageous to us and advantageous to Mexico, that’s a   for both countries,” said Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, in his confirmation hearing. Will Canada and Mexico come to the table for a renegotiation? Sure looks that way. The White House has announced plans to meet separately with the leaders of both countries, and all signals are that they’re up for new talks. In the case of Mexico, President Enrique Peña Nieto has said he wants talks to cover a wider gamut than trade alone  —   implicitly threatening to become less cooperative on fighting drug trafficking and other frontiers if the Trump administration is excessively punitive in trade talks. And, of course, Mr. Trump’s announcement today that he will build a wall on the border  —   and that Mexico will eventually pay for it  —   could cause Mexico to rethink its outlook on trade negotiations altogether. So what is the United States going to ask for? We don’t know for sure, but some hints have emerged. One strong possibility would be to focus on “rules of origin” governing what counts as an automobile or other finished good produced within the free trade area. For example, a steering wheel might be assembled in Mexico but include parts made in China the rules of origin state how many of those parts can come from China while still counting as a Mexican steering wheel and thus enjoy the benefits of the free trade zone. If the required share of North American parts were increased  —   from its current 62. 5 percent for many auto parts to 75 percent, for example  —   it would give an advantage to manufacturers in the United States and reduce competition with the   countries of Asia. Another example of a possible United States priority: asking Canada and Mexico to be more liberal in allowing goods to be shipped into their countries with no taxes and little paperwork. (To be precise, asking them to raise the value of what would count as a “de minimus” shipment exempt from the usual customs process). That would be good news for American companies looking to sell into those countries. The United States has long complained that the tribunals that settle trade disputes among the three countries are stacked against U. S. interests, and it could seek changes. Those sure seem like perfectly normal things for trade deals to focus on. They are. But there was one more goal for the United States that Trump argued for during the campaign, and it would be a bigger source of friction if his negotiators chose to pursue it. Mr. Trump characterized the   tax that both Mexico and Canada have as unfair to U. S. companies. The tax is 16 percent in Mexico when a Mexican firm exports goods to the United States, it receives a rebate for the tax it paid, and when a U. S. firm exports to Mexico, a comparable adjustment is added. Mr. Ross, the Commerce secretary nominee, and Peter Navarro, a Trump White House trade adviser, argued in a white paper during the campaign that this amounts to an unfair export subsidy that penalizes the United States. Canada and Mexico aren’t likely to see it that way, and will resist if the United States seeks a change to the rules so that a VAT adjustment is no longer added to U. S. exports into their countries. In their view  —   and that of mainstream economists  —   their approach to taxing is the only way to avoid unfairly penalizing their domestic companies. The VAT is similar to a sales tax, and to the Mexican government, the Trump position will sound like the equivalent of Massachusetts demanding that it be able to sell its goods in Connecticut without a sales tax slapped on them. So if that issue ends up at the center of the negotiation, things could get rocky. But a deal should get done, right? Maybe. But keep in mind: This won’t be a   street. Both Canada and Mexico expect concessions from the United States in return for concessions they make. And some of the things that the Mexican government most covets will rankle many Trump supporters. For example, Mexico wants better access to a program, widely enjoyed at the Canadian border, in which shippers that pass a security review are allowed to cross the border with a less intensive customs process (this is the international trade equivalent of the “T. S. A. PreCheck” security line at the airport). Mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for Mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the United States. Needless to say, making it easier for Mexican trucks and Mexican workers to get into the United States isn’t exactly what Trump campaigned on. But that’s the kind of concession that may be needed to get a trade deal. Is there a chance Nafta completely blows up? There is  —   though not necessarily in catastrophic fashion. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out a possibility in which the Trump administration does eventually withdraw from Nafta, but in a context in which it has worked out separate deals with Mexico and Canada that maintain most of the trade arrangements codified in Nafta. President Trump and his advisers have often spoken of a preference for bilateral deals instead of big multicountry trade deals. It is potentially a pathway for Trump to be able to proclaim that he ended a trade deal he assailed on the campaign trail, without wrecking the economy. Even that wouldn’t necessarily be painless, however. “It would be like ” Mr. Hufbauer said. “There will be firms and communities in the U. S. that will be adversely affected, that will close down if you disrupt these supply chains. That won’t make for good newspaper coverage, and presumably the Trump team will want to avoid that. ” Just how urgent is renegotiating Nafta? Campaign promises aside, even some people who have been opposed to Nafta and other trade deals don’t view this as a   priority. U. S. trade with Canada is reasonably well balanced, and the trade deficit with Mexico is smaller than that with some giant Asian economies. Robert E. Scott, the director of trade and manufacturing policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, sees more to be gained by rethinking the trade relationship between the United States and China, Japan, South Korea and even Germany. “Those are accountable for 80 percent of   job losses over the last 20 years,” he said. “To me, Nafta is not a top priority. ” “There are much bigger fish to fry,” he added.",1
25729,Pentagon Unsure if There Will Be ’Role for Turkey’ in Assault on Islamic State Capital,"The Pentagon cast substantial doubt on a possible role for Turkey in the assault on Raqqa, the Islamic State’s capital in Syria, during a press conference in Iraq on Wednesday. [“We have made clear  …     that we are open to a Turkish role in the continued operations to defeat ISIS in northern Syria. We haven’t come to an agreement about what that role will be or if there will be one,” Dorrian said, “but we talk to Turkey through military channels and I believe at diplomatic levels every day,” said spokesman Col. John Dorrian, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.  Fighting ISIS savages to the death in the cramped streets of downtown Raqqa is probably not a prospect Turkey relishes, but it is very eager to keep the Syrian Kurds and their military alliance out of the battle. Turkey links the Syrian YPG Kurdish militia to the violent PKK separatists it has been battling at home and fears Kurdish territorial gains in Syria could lead to the Kurds carving out Turkish territory for an independent state or at least exacerbating the PKK problem. “I think I’d like to leave it at we would expect Kurds to be involved. And that’s probably about where we’re at,” said Dorrian. He noted the U. S. wants Raqqa liberated by a force that is demographically consistent with its historic population, which includes a fair number of Kurds. That won’t go over well in Ankara, as the Washington Examiner recalls Senate Armed Services chair John McCain warning last week. “I’m not sure there’s an understanding of how seriously Erdogan views this issue, and I’m not sure we appreciate the importance of the role Turkey plays in our effort to retake Raqqa, particularly in the use of Incirlik and other activities that require Turkish cooperation,” said McCain. “I foresee a train wreck here. I think there’s a possibility of an impending conflict between Turkey and the Kurds. ” Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik said in February that the Trump administration would not insist on a Kurdish role in the battle of Raqqa. “If we want the Raqqa operation to be successful, then it should be carried out with Arab forces in the region and not the YPG. The new U. S. administration has a different approach to the issue. They are not insisting anymore that the operation should definitely be carried out with the YPG. They haven’t yet made up their minds,” Isik said on that occasion. Writing for the Associated Press, Sarah El Deeb suggests Turkey has annoyed both the U. S. and Russia by constantly denouncing, and occasionally shooting at, the Kurds. The Syrian government is even more irritated because some of the artillery shells Turkey fired at Kurdish forces have hit Syrian positions instead. “As a result, Ankara has effectively unified Russia and the U. S. in the goal of limiting Turkish expansion in the north. Syria experts say Ankara has lost influence to realize its aim of pushing the Kurdish forces back to the east of Manbij across the Euphrates. Moreover, Washington is pushing ahead with partnering with the   forces in the planned attack on Raqqa, despite Turkish opposition,” El Deeb writes. She sees the capture of Manbij by   Syrian Democratic Forces units, a major military ally of the United States, as the event that pushed Turkey into a more aggressive posture. The Turks may be hoping that keeping Manbij in their sights will oblige the Kurds to commit SDF forces to its protection, leaving them less manpower to invest in Raqqa. Turkey would then offer its own forces to take up the slack. U. S. forces flying highly visible American flags are now parked between the Turks and Kurds outside Manbij, while Russia created another buffer zone with Syrian government troops, but it won’t be possible to keep them safely separated for much longer. As American Lt. General Stephen Townsend put it, all of the forces converging on Raqqa are now “within   range of each other. ” “All of this is a reminder of the risk in a rushed attempt to get to Raqqa If Turkish interests are not at least placated to some extent,” Noah Bonsey of the International Crisis Group told the AP. “There is a lot that can go wrong. ”",1
25732,Is A War In The Making — A Third World War? Instigated By A Declining Imperial Power,"Source: Global Research 
Is a war in the making — a third world war? 
If there is much talk about such a possibility, it is mainly because of the tensions between the United States and Russia. Tensions between the two most powerful nuclear states in the world have never been this high since the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
There are at least two flash points, one more dangerous than the other. In Eastern Ukraine, Russian backed rebels will not surrender to the US supported regime in Kiev because they see US control over Ukraine as part of a much larger agenda to expand NATO power to the very borders of Russia. This has been happening for some years now. 
But it is the Washington-Moscow confrontation in Allepo, Syria which portends to a huge conflagration. The US is protective of major militant groups such as Al-Nusra which has besieged Eastern Allepo and is seeking to overthrow the Bashar al-Assad government. Washington has also set its sight on ‘regime change’ in Damascus ever since the latter’s determined resistance to Israeli occupation of the strategic Golan Heights in Syria from 1967 onwards. The drive for regime change intensified with the US-Israeli quest for a “new Middle East” following the Anglo-American invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. It became more pronounced in 2009 when Bashar al-Assad rejected a proposal to allow a gas pipe-line from Qatar to Europe to pass through his country, a pipe-line which would have reduced Europe’s dependence upon Russia for gas. Russia of course has been a long-standing ally of Syria. Together with Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah, it is helping the Syrian government to break the siege of Eastern Allepo and to defeat militants in other parts of Syria. 
It is obvious that in both instances, in Ukraine and Syria, the US has not been able to achieve what it wants. The US has also been stymied in Southeast Asia where its attempt to re-assert its power through its 2010 ‘Pivot to Asia’ policy has suffered a serious setback as a result of the decision of the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to pursue an independent foreign policy that no longer adheres blindly to US interests. At the same time, China continues to expand and enhance its economic strength in Asia and the world through its One Belt One Road (OBOR) projects and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and via its leadership of BRICS. China’s regional and global economic role is leading to its pronounced presence in security and military matters. As a result of all this, the US’s imperial power has clearly diminished. It is a hegemon in decline. Source of image: lhvnews.com 
It is because it is not prepared to accept its decline that some US generals are threatening to demonstrate US’s military might. If a hegemon is a danger to humankind when it is at its pinnacle, it becomes an even greater threat to peace when its power is diminishing. Like a wounded tiger, it becomes even more furious and ferocious. A new US president may be inclined to give vent to this frustration through an arrogant display of military power. 
How can we check such wanton arrogance? There will be elements in the elite stratum of US society itself who would be opposed to the US going to war. We saw a bit of this in 2013 when those who were itching to launch military strikes against Syria based upon dubious “evidence” of the government’s use of chemical weapons were thwarted by others with a saner view of the consequences of war. It is also important to observe that none of the US’s major allies in Europe wants a war. Burdened by severe challenges related to the economy and migration, the governments know that their citizens will reject any move towards war either on the borders of Russia or in Syria and West Asia. 
This also suggests that a self-absorbed European citizenry may not have the enthusiasm to mobilise against an imminent war. Let us not forget that it was in European cities from London to Berlin that the biggest demonstrations against the war in Iraq took place in 2003. Anti-war protests will have to be initiated elsewhere this time. 
Governments in Moscow and Beijing, in Tehran and Jakarta, in Pretoria and La Paz, should come out openly against war. They should encourage other governments in the Global South and the Global North to denounce any move towards a war that will engulf the whole of humanity. Citizens all over the world should condemn war through a variety of strategies ranging from signature campaigns and letters to the media to public rallies and street demonstrations. 
In this campaign against an imminent war, the media, both conventional and alternative, will have a huge role to play. It is unfortunate that well-known media outlets in the West have supported war in the past. It is time that they atone for their sins!",1
25735,Israeli Soldier Who Shot Wounded Palestinian Assailant Is Convicted - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   The fate of just one   Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance. But for many Israelis, the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state. When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground, they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised. Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March, the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands. With the 50th anniversary of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank approaching, the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society. The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed: Hours after it was rendered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned. “This is a difficult and painful day for us all,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon, which can be granted by Israel’s president or the army’s top officials. Referring to the Israel Defense Forces, he added, “The soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters, and they need to remain above any dispute. ” Prof. David Enoch, an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he thought the manslaughter conviction was “justified” but added, “I’m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public. ” The military’s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated, but that once the threat is neutralized, they should not be killed. Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger, particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks by Palestinians. The Hebron killing, caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide, for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force, and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification. But in Israel, a country where military service is a part of national identity, many Jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that Sergeant Azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal, since that would have put his commanders in a bad light. Israel’s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called Wednesday’s decision “a tough verdict. ” “The first thing I ask of all of us  —   those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less  —   we are all obligated to respect the court’s decision,” Mr. Lieberman said. “We are obligated to maintain restraint. ” Mr. Lieberman, as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment, had attended the military court to support Sergeant Azaria and called the legal proceedings a “theater of the absurd. ” But on Wednesday, he said, “We must keep the army above and beyond all political argument. ” Politicians to Mr. Netanyahu’s right and left have also called for a pardon, including the education minister, Naftali Bennett, and Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party, who said that “Azaria’s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure” the case has exposed. Some Israeli experts compared the Azaria verdict to the Kafr Qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago, after border police officers fatally shot 49 Arab men, women and children as they returned from work in the fields, unwittingly breaking a curfew. The murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a “patently illegal order” that carries a “black flag” of criminality. It helped shape the army’s ethos. Now, some fear that in the lower ranks, it has begun to erode. In a measure of the tensions, the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military’s headquarters in Tel Aviv, rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held, to keep demonstrators at bay. Video footage showed Sergeant Azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause, and he was embraced by his family and friends. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound, shouting slogans like “free the boy. ” Col. Maya Heller, one of the military judges, spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict. She systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been “no justification” for the shooting, according to reports from the courtroom. Describing Sergeant Azaria’s telling of the event as “twisting” and “evolving,” the judge said the defense had tried to “hold the rope at both ends. ” On one hand it asserted that the victim, Abed     appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving, and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time Sergeant Azaria shot him in the head. The judge seemed to give great weight to statements Sergeant Azaria, a medic who was 19 at the time, made at the scene, indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge. A soldier testified that before the shooting, Sergeant Azaria had said, “How is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive?” After the shooting, a commander who was at the scene recalled Sergeant Azaria saying, “The terrorist deserved to die. ” Ilan Katz, one of Sergeant Azaria’s lawyers, vowed to appeal. The military’s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened, calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct. But Israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued Palestinian attacks, many   politicians and celebrities, along with Jewish parents of soldiers, hailed Sergeant Azaria as a hero. Mr. Netanyahu first condemned Sergeant Azaria’s actions, then phoned the soldier’s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly. Local television stations frequently showed images of Sergeant Azaria’s distraught parents hugging him in court. Appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism, and where most Jewish    are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service, his supporters portrayed him as “everybody’s child. ” In remarks recorded before the verdict, the military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, tried to puncture that narrative. “An    in the Israeli Army is not ‘everybody’s child,’” he said. “He is a fighter, a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this. ” The episode began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron. Israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other, Mr. Sharif, 21. Sergeant Azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later. The video showed calm had been restored. Yet 11 minutes after the initial attack, he cocked his rifle and shot Mr. Sharif as he lay on the road. Lawyers representing Sergeant Azaria said he had acted to save his comrades, in the belief that Mr. Sharif, who was still moving, might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket. But Sergeant Azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away. During the trial, Sergeant Azaria’s company commander, Maj. Tom Naaman, said he “did not feel any danger” from Mr. Sharif, undercutting the defendant’s claims. Yusri   Mr. Sharif’s father, told reporters that the verdict was “a good step” but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing, which is scheduled for Jan. 15. Ahmad Tibi, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, said on  Twitter that dozens of soldiers and commanders who killed Palestinians should have been convicted. “Fifty years of occupation add up to much more than one Azaria,” Mr. Tibi wrote.",1
25736,Rick Perry Regrets Call to Close Energy Department - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Rick Perry, the former Texas governor and   Donald J. Trump’s nominee as energy secretary, said in his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday that he regretted having recommended the abolition of the Energy Department in the past. He addressed his awkward history on the issue up front, telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after “being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy,” he no longer believed, as he said while running for president in 2011, that it should be eliminated. Mr. Perry also offered a   reversal of his views on the science of   climate change, which he called a “contrived, phony mess” in a 2010 book. “I believe the climate is changing,” he said. “I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by   activity. The question is: How do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy or American jobs?” Mr. Trump, by contrast, has called climate change a “hoax” and has continued to express doubts about established climate science. Mr. Perry also appeared to signal a somewhat different position from Mr. Trump on nuclear weapons policy, the Energy Department’s chief portfolio. Mr. Trump has said the United States must “greatly strengthen and expand” its nuclear capability, “Let it be an arms race,” he said. But Mr. Perry, asked by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a “dangerous idea,” replied, “I think anyone would be of the opinion that if we never have to test another nuclear weapon that would be a good thing for the world. ” He added, “I think nonproliferation is a good thing. ” Asked if he would support the Iran nuclear deal  —   which Mr. Trump has derided and which was largely negotiated by the current energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz  —   Mr. Perry said he had not received classified briefings on it. “If D. O. E. has a role to make sure that Iranians are living up to the deal, message delivered, sir,” Mr. Perry said to Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. Last month, when Mr. Trump offered Mr. Perry the job of energy secretary, he accepted with the understanding that the role would be largely focused on promoting American energy development, according to people who have briefed him. Only later did he learn that the agency’s central portfolio is the oversight and management of the nation’s nuclear weapons complex, as well as 17 national scientific laboratories. “This confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me,” Mr. Perry said, citing his conversations with Mr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist. He highlighted his experience as an Air Force pilot from 1972 to 1977 as among his qualifications to oversee the nuclear weapons complex. Mr. Perry is expected to be easily confirmed by the full Senate. But Democrats pressed him sharply on his views on climate science, noting that the Energy Department is a major science agency, with thousands of research scientists across the country. Democrats expressed concern that his past views, so at odds with established mainstream science, could be a serious impediment. They also pressed him on reports that Mr. Trump’s team is considering making cuts to the Energy Department’s offices of energy efficiency, renewable energy and fossil energy. The last is focused on research to lower   carbon emissions. Mr. Perry said he was unaware of such reports. “Maybe they’ll have the same experience I had and forget that they said that,” he said to laughter, referring to the moment in a 2011 presidential debate when, asked which agencies he wanted to eliminate, he could not recall the name of the Energy Department. What Mr. Perry later called his “oops” moment was widely seen as sinking his campaign. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel’s top Democrat, said, “Like many of my colleagues, I am deeply concerned by some of the things that Governor Perry has said in the past about climate science. ” She added: “The Department of Energy’s scientific horsepower is key to understanding these trends. I hope you can understand there is widespread anxiety about   Trump’s intention to dismantle these scientific capabilities or simply just starve them for resources. ” Ms. Cantwell pushed Mr. Perry on whether he would protect the agency’s budget for climate science. “I’m going to protect all the science, whether it’s related to climate and all other aspects of what we are doing,” he replied. Ms. Cantwell also asked Mr. Perry about a questionnaire sent to Energy Department employees by Mr. Trump’s transition team that appeared to target the agency’s climate science research. Mr. Perry disavowed the questionnaire, saying it was sent out before he was selected as the nominee. “I didn’t approve it, I don’t approve it, I didn’t need the information, I don’t want that information,” he said. “That’s not how I manage. ” The hearing was leavened with some humor. Asked by Mr. Franken, who had earlier pushed him sharply on nuclear weapons and climate change in his Senate office, “Did you enjoy meeting me?” Mr. Perry responded, “I hope you are as much fun on the dais as you were on your couch,” before adding, “May I rephrase that, sir?” “Please. Please,” Mr. Franken replied. “Oh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord. ” “Well, I think we’ve found our ‘Saturday Night Live’ sound bite,” Mr. Perry said.",1
25737,Re: Rights? In The New America You Don’t Get Any Rights!,"Rights? In The New America You Don’t Get Any Rights! By Michael Snyder, on January 9th, 2012 
One of the unique things about the Constitution of the United States was that it guaranteed certain rights for its citizens. Those rights provided the foundation for an era of freedom and prosperity that was pretty much unprecedented in human history and dozens of other nations eventually copied many of the ideas contained in our Constitution and Bill of Rights because they worked so well. Of course our system never functioned perfectly, but when you compare it to what has gone on for most of human history, it truly was a bright light in a sea of oppression and totalitarianism. Unfortunately, our rights are now being systematically taken away from us. In America today, the politicians have convinced most of us that in order to keep us all “safe” we must give up many of our rights and move toward becoming a totalitarian police state. In the “new America”, you don’t get any rights. They tell us that giving people rights is too dangerous. Instead, you get some limited “privileges” which can be revoked at any time by the authorities. Sadly, most Americans have become so dumbed-down that they don’t even realize what is happening. 
How many Americans do you think have actually read the Constitution? 
Personally, I went through high school, college and even law school without ever being required to read the Constitution of the United States. 
Isn’t that amazing? 
Most Americans don’t even understand that they have rights because they have never even read the documents that grant them those rights. 
You can find the text of the U.S. Constitution right here . If you have never taken the time to read the whole thing, you really should. 
According to the U.S. Constitution, the following are some of the rights that we are supposed to have…. 
-Freedom of religion 
-Freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures 
-The right to due process of law 
-The right to a speedy and public trial 
-Freedom from cruel and unusual punishments 
Unfortunately, all of those rights are under attack in America today. 
In most cases, a right is not taken away all at once. Instead, opponents of these rights take what is known as an “incremental approach”. 
For example, we are told that there are certain limits on the freedom of speech. We are told that we cannot yell “fire” in a crowded theater and we accept that because it sounds reasonable. But then once everyone agrees that there are “limits” on that right, the control freaks that run things just keep trying to tighten those limits in thousands of different ways until our freedom of speech is whittled away to almost nothing. 
It is imperative that we stand up for our liberties and freedoms. If we don’t defend them now, eventually they will be gone for good. 
The following are some examples of how our rights are under attack in America today…. 
The federal government has become absolutely obsessed with monitoring everything that Americans say. This chills free speech because it gives people the feeling that there is always somebody “watching”. 
It has recently been revealed that the Department of Homeland Security plans to monitor social media outlets on the Internet. If you use the wrong “keywords” or if you are a key “influencer” on the Internet, there is no doubt that someone from the federal government will be keeping tabs on you. 
The following comes from a recent RT article …. 
Under the National Operations Center (NOC)’s Media Monitoring Initiative that came out of DHS headquarters in November, Washington has the written permission to retain data on users of social media and online networking platforms. 
Specifically, the DHS announced the NCO and its Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) can collect personal information from news anchors, journalists, reporters or anyone who may use “traditional and/or social media in real time to keep their audience situationally aware and informed.” 
In particular, the powers that be seem to have become absolutely fascinated with Facebook, Twitter and blogs. 
As I have written about previously , the Federal Reserve has decided to start monitoring social media sites and blogs in order to keep track of what is being said about them. 
And as a recent Fox News article detailed, the Department of Homeland Security is also developing such a system…. 
Though still in development, DHS is looking to establish a system for monitoring “forums, blogs, public websites and message boards.” The idea is to gather and analyze publicly available information, and then use that information to help officials respond to disasters and other situations. 
So why do they have to spend so much time, energy and money keeping track of what we are all saying on the Internet? 
Why don’t they just let us be? 
One would think that the federal government has bigger problems to deal with at this point. 
Unfortunately, this trend toward endlessly snooping on American citizens is not likely to reverse any time soon. 
So could what you say on the Internet get you labeled as a “trouble-maker” or as a “potential terrorist”? 
Recently, Barack Obama signed a new law which allows the U.S. military to arrest “potential terrorists” on U.S. soil, hold them indefinitely without trial and even ship them off to Guantanamo Bay for endless “interrogation” sessions. 
The insanity of this new law was detailed in a recent article by Henry Blodget …. 
The reason this law is horrifying is not that terrorists deserve to be handled with kid gloves. They don’t. The reason it’s horrifying is that, without due process, it is too easy for the government to just declare someone a terrorist who isn’t actually a terrorist. It’s too easy, in other words, for government employees to do what everyone else does: Make mistakes. 
If you don’t think it’s possible for the government to mistakenly assume that someone is a terrorist who isn’t, read this story by Lakhdar Boumediene , who was just held as a terrorist by the U.S. government in Guantanamo for 7 and a half years. At Guantanamo, Boumediene says he was tortured for not telling his U.S. captors what they wanted to hear–that he was a terrorist. He was only eventually freed after his case went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court ruled that it might be a good idea to ask the government to present the evidence that led it to believe that Boumediene was a terrorist (the government didn’t present any). 
Sadly, according to Obama this new law just reaffirms what he already had the power to do. In his signing statement, Obama stated that he already had the authority to arrest American citizens, hold them without trial and ship them off to prison camps. 
Of course that would come as a complete shock to the original drafters of the U.S. Constitution, but very few Americans seem concerned with what the U.S. Constitution actually says these days. 
Now there is a new bill before Congress that would even give the federal government the power to instantly strip individuals of citizenship if they are suspected of being “hostile” to the United States. 
It is known as the Enemy Expatriation Act, and you can read this new bill for yourself right here . 
According to the bill, you can be stripped of your U.S. citizenship for “engaging in, or purposefully and materially supporting, hostilities against the United States.” 
So what does it mean to “materially support” hostilities against the United States? 
Does simply criticizing the government fall under that category? 
Unfortunately, when you have a law that is really vague it gives authorities the leeway to do pretty much whatever they want. 
At least we still have the Internet where we can communicate with one another and share all of this information, right? 
Well, maybe not for long. 
As I have written about previously, a new law under consideration by Congress would permanently change the Internet forever and could potentially silence thousands of important voices. That is why we must stop SOPA . It is a horrible law which could be used to brutally censor the Internet. 
Some of the biggest names in the Internet community are speaking out against SOPA. For example, a recent CNN article contained some stunning quotes about SOPA from one of the co-founders of Google…. 
Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, has been outspoken against the efforts. 
The bills “give the U.S. government and copyright holders extraordinary powers including the ability to hijack DNS (the Internet’s naming system) and censor search results (and this is even without so much as a proper court trial),” Brin wrote last month on his Google+ page as Congress was considering the measures. “While I support their goal of reducing copyright infringement (which I don’t believe these acts would accomplish), I am shocked that our lawmakers would contemplate such measures that would put us on a par with the most oppressive nations in the world.” 
Everywhere you turn these days, our liberties and our freedoms are being attacked. There is a relentless assault on everything that it means to be an American. No matter how hard you try, it just seems like you can’t get away from it. 
For example, many of us have been so disgusted with the TSA that we simply do not fly anymore. 
Well, the TSA is not content to just monitor airports anymore. Now they are bringing their own special brand of “security” to thousands of other locations across the country as the Los Angeles Times recently detailed …. 
The Transportation Security Administration isn’t just in airports anymore. TSA teams are increasingly conducting searches and screenings at train stations, subways, ferry terminals and other mass transit locations around the country. 
“We are not the Airport Security Administration,” said Ray Dineen, the air marshal in charge of the TSA office in Charlotte. “We take that transportation part seriously.” 
The TSA’s 25 “viper” teams — for Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response — have run more than 9,300 unannounced checkpoints and other search operations in the last year. Department of Homeland Security officials have asked Congress for funding to add 12 more teams next year. 
So even if you never fly again, there is still a good chance that you will get the “rubber glove treatment” from a TSA “viper team” at some point. 
Without a doubt, this country is slowly becoming a giant prison . 
And one group that gets targeted by the government almost more than anyone else is Christians. In America today, there is a war against Christianity. The Christian faith is being attacked in hundreds of different ways , and under the Obama administration this attack has only just intensified. 
There seems to be an obsession with pushing Christianity out of every single shred of public life in this country. For example, family members were recently banned from bringing Bibles to wounded veterans at Walter Reed National Medical Center. The following is from a recent CNSNews article …. 
In a Sept. 14 policy memorandum, Col. Chuck Callahan, chief of staff of Walter Reed National Medical Center, banned family members from bringing Bibles and other “religious items” when visiting wounded military personnel at the facility. 
Thankfully, this policy was later reversed after a tremendous national outcry, but there are dozens and dozens of other “policies” like this that have not been reversed. 
They say that we still have “freedom of religion” in this country, but there is a non-stop effort to push it into a box that is getting smaller and smaller with each passing day. 
Our 2nd Amendment rights area also being brutally assaulted. 
Restrictions on gun owners keep getting tighter and tighter and tighter. Things have gotten so bad that now even gun manufacturers don’t even know what is legal and what is not. 
The following comes from a recent article in the Washington Times …. 
Despite overseeing an industry that includes machine guns and other deadly weapons, ATF regulations for the manufacture of weapons are often unclear, leading to reliance on a secretive system by which firearms manufacturers can submit proposed weapons for testing and find out one at a time whether they comply with the law, critics say. 
The ATF recommends that manufacturers voluntarily submit weapons for case-by-case determination. But those judgments are private and, it turns out, sometimes contradictory. Critics say nearly identical prototypes can be approved for one manufacturer but denied for another. 
But it is not just the federal government that is becoming incredibly oppressive. We are seeing state and local governments all over the country also move in the direction of totalitarianism. 
Here are just a couple of examples that have been brought to my attention in recent days…. 
*Up in Massachusetts, police were recently sent to collect an overdue library book from a 5-year-old girl . 
*In St. Louis, a proposed law would make it mandatory to spay or neuter all cats and dogs and would make it mandatory to microchip all cats and dogs. 
When you step back and look at the bigger picture, a clear trend emerges. 
As 2012 began, over 40,000 new laws went into effect all over America. Some of these new laws are good, but most of them are about restricting the liberties and freedoms of individual Americans. 
We have become a nation of control freaks. 
In the final analysis, we don’t have any absolute rights anymore. Instead, what we have are “privileges” that are being systematically stripped away. 
But this is not how America was supposed to be. 
We were supposed to be the freest nation on the face of the earth.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in every aspect of the nation. General Frank Salzedo, chief of FEMA’s Civil Security Division stated in a 1983 conference that he saw FEMA’s role as a “new frontier in the protection of individual and governmental leaders from assassination, and of civil and military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion, or a global audience in times of crisis.” FEMA’s powers were consolidated by President Carter to incorporate the…

I thought they needed to pull this off before the conforming generations (born previous to 1946) were still a major voting block. While I see it before my eyes one would think the people that came of age in the 1960s would know better then to surrender rights to the government.

He is the only candidate who is running to restore civil liberties, ending senseless, grinding people into hamburger wars, and restoring sanity to fiscal and monetaruy policy. Is that what the masses want? Of course not. But they will finally get a taste of the iron fist when the FEMA Camp roundups begin DB200 
What is a FEMA Camp? Observer 
FEMA was empowered to set up camps, mostly in highly unpopulated areas in the western US, where populations could be moved to ostensibly save them from extreme danger from such things as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, other natural disasters, that threaten their homes & communities. Each camp can hold thousands of people. Knowing the propensity of our government to “protect” us from ourselves, these camps are also capable of holding all those rounded up who are in opposition to anything the government wants at any given time. They are the modern version of the Japanese internment camps employed during WWII. Citizens opposed to government policies and practices are prime targets for placement in these camps, especially now that the NDAA says that US citizens even simply suspected of ‘terrorist’ thoughts or activities (and who defines what a terrorist is? – the government, of course) can be indefinitely held, without charge or trial. Anyone who thinks ANY current administration is wrong can now be branded a terrorist, and 99% of the commenters here, if found, could also be sent to the FEMA camps. The powers that be are just waiting for the one major calamity it would take to execute the FEMA camp orders ~ and that calamity is most probably going to be an economic one, with natural disaster (with concomitant economic collapse) a close secondary excuse to round up We, The People, who need Big Brother’s ‘help.’ Only God can help those who believe in “Live Free or Die” ~ armed insurrection will be met with instant execution, so there’ll be no need for internment at FEMA camps. Once the believers in the 2nd Amendment are exterminated, the entire geography of the United States will comprise one extremely large FEMA camp. Igos

25738,A Motivational Tool: Believing That Tennis’s Big Four Era Is Over - The New York Times,"On the way to a Wimbledon final this summer, Milos Raonic took a crash course in the attitudinal psychology of advanced men’s tennis. The curriculum offered a straightforward application of positive thinking, said his instructor, or coach, Carlos Moyá. “What I tried to convince Milos is that this Big Four thing, it’s over,” Moyá said. Foregone conclusion, or wishful thinking? Heading into the United States Open, the year’s final Grand Slam tournament, the answer on both counts  —   depending on the criteria  —   is yes. The chronically injured Rafael Nadal never did make it to London after withdrawing from the third round of his beloved French Open with a bad wrist. Novak Djokovic, the holder of all four Grand Slam tournament titles before Wimbledon, was stunned there in the third round by the American Sam Querrey. That opened the door for Raonic, the      Canadian, to rally against an aging and ailing Roger Federer in the semifinals from a     deficit. Left in Raonic’s path to a first major title and perhaps a new men’s tour order was Andy Murray. The last of the establishment vanguard, Murray defended the compound and won the crown in three competitive sets, the 42nd victory for the Big Four in the last 46 Grand Slam (or big four) events. Even without a breakthrough by Raonic or a handful of other   ordained prodigies, the men’s game  —   driven by a familiar and popular narrative for the better part of a decade  —   has felt the ground shift, though not yet seismically. According to Moyá, the needle has moved just enough to demonstrate that the Big Four is no more. “Even knowing that Stan Wawrinka beat Djokovic at the French last year, you still felt that these four guys were in control of the game,” he said in an interview at the Rogers Cup in Toronto this month. “Now, to me, things are different. ” Nadal, 30, has resumed playing, but Federer, 35, stepped aside after Wimbledon for the remainder of the year to rest his surgically repaired knee. Djokovic’s aura of invincibility was pierced by Querrey and then by a healthy Juan Martín del Potro in a stunning and     defeat at the Olympics. Murray is entrenched as the world’s   player and has had a brilliant summer, but can he sustain his excellence long enough to make a run at the top? “The gap is still big with the two players  —   Djokovic and Murray,” Moyá said. “But it’s about being there, being consistent and believing that their level is going to drop, that they can be beaten now, and it’s you who can be the one. ” Not getting too far ahead of himself, Moyá meant the one at any given major, not necessarily the world’s No. 1. Querrey, who is 6 feet 6 inches and has a   ranking of No. 17 in 2011, was the unlikely one who ended Djokovic’s   streak in a   victory that temporarily left him feeling, he said, “like I was No. 2. ” At Wimbledon, he accepted   in the locker room and congratulatory texts from all over. At home in Los Angeles, he threw out the first pitch at a Dodgers game. At hardcourt tournaments in Washington and Toronto, he snapped photos with fans who normally would have acknowledged him as a player, just not sure which one. “It’s kind of funny that you go around the grounds and the guys want to thank you for beating Novak,” Querrey said. “It’s not so much ‘Good job you won.’ It’s more like ‘Good job he lost. ’” Such had been the paradox of Djokovic’s ascendance, which in the past two years has taken the shine off the Big Four era, even as Federer defied chronological norms and chased Djokovic into major semifinals and finals, only to lose, disappointing the masses who were wishing him one more Grand Slam trophy as a topping to his record 17. A decade ago, when Federer reached a level all his own, the sport and its global fan base celebrated his artistry, his supremacy, his global stature as tennis’s ambassadorial Tiger. Djokovic, a thoughtful, droll and driven Serb, has encountered waves of sentiment for Federer, still the people’s choice in most places, and for Murray, the Scotsman, at Wimbledon. But in completing his career Grand Slam in Paris in June, Djokovic was finally rewarded with an outpouring of affection by the Roland Garros crowd for how badly he wanted to win his first French Open. In Toronto, where he recovered from Wimbledon by brushing aside Kei Nishikori for the title, Djokovic called the climax in Paris an “unforgettable moment, remarkable, a divine sensation to experience, honestly. ” “It’s one of those feelings that stick with you forever,” Djokovic said. To their competitors, it can feel that long since Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray began their reign, though Toni Nadal, Rafa’s uncle and coach, declared the Big Four era unofficially over in 2014. That year, Wawrinka beat Djokovic and Nadal in winning his first Grand Slam title in Australia, and Marin Cilic bludgeoned Federer in the semifinals on the way to winning the United States Open. “It is a normal thing  —   the domination of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic is now less,” Toni Nadal said, explaining that the increasingly physical demands of a technologically enhanced game were taking their inevitable toll, especially on his grinding nephew. At the time, he envisioned Raonic, Nishikori and Grigor Dimitrov crashing the Big Four party and said that they would soon after be joined or eventually surpassed by Alexander Zverev, the    German many believe will be the next player to win multiple Slams. Others would add to the mix Dominic Thiem, 22, of Austria the talented but turbulent Australian Nick Kyrgios, 21 Borna Coric, 19, of Croatia and an American, Taylor Fritz, 18. “There’s a lot of young talent, but I rate Sascha Zverev as someone who is going to do incredible things in this game,” the American veteran John Isner said. “I practice with him quite a bit in Florida, and for a big kid who hasn’t quite grown into his body just yet, he’s got immense talent. ” These and other supposed heirs are also why  —   Moyá’s claim aside  —   most discussions of the Big Four’s demise are punctuated with a question mark, not an exclamation point. With all their physical setbacks this year, Federer and Nadal were still ranked in the top four with Djokovic and Murray immediately after Wimbledon. But entering the Open, Wawrinka has risen to No. 3. In addition to staying healthy, Nadal must prove he can regain his prime career form. He reached the semifinals in singles at the Rio Olympics and won the gold medal in men’s doubles. But were his subsequent   losses to Nishikori in the bronze medal match and to Coric last week at the Western  Southern Open more about rust than career recession? What remains an open question is who, besides Raonic, might soon fill any sustained Big Four vacancies? Paul Annacone, the former tour player and coach of Federer and Pete Sampras, said that the contemporary career span had been stretched in what is more of an   sport because of technology and   athletes. That has made it difficult to determine the timetable for   maturity. Moyá said he had reminded Raonic, 25, that Wawrinka was 28 when he won in Australia. Murray lost his first four major finals before beating Djokovic at the 2012 United States Open and appears to be peaking at 29. “Back when I was playing, if you didn’t win a Slam when you were 21, 22, and were not a   player, forget about doing it,” Moyá said. “So now I feel like being 20 years ago is now 25, 26. I can tell Milos, your best days are ahead of you. ” Greatness has always been much easier to project than to attain. In reaching the 2014 Wimbledon semifinals, where he lost a tight match to Djokovic, Dimitrov, now 25, appeared ready to build on his “Baby Federer” appraisal, only to precipitously slide in the rankings and cite the Federer likeness as “a little burden” that “didn’t help at all. ” Half the battle against the Big Four is establishing belief, Moyá said, having had the experience of watching Raonic rally against Federer at Wimbledon two years after Federer crushed him there in straight sets. A hard lesson was learned on that same semifinal stage, and this time, Raonic was ready to capitalize when Federer   twice and blew a   lead at   in the fourth set. “You get to know a player after spending time with him, and I could tell from his body language he was going to break Roger,” Moyá said. “I knew he was ready. ” For Querrey, the notion of outlasting Djokovic, the fittest of the Big Four, was less about psychological preparation and more about convincing himself on court. “They have separated themselves so much that walking out there you’re already thinking you’re in trouble,” Querrey said, “since they’re the only guys who pretty much have won Slams over the last eight years. And so it’s not until I get out there and feel like I’m able to play with them that I think, ‘Oh, I’m in this,’ or ‘Hey, I feel like I’m being overwhelmed here. ’” Beyond Moyá’s tactical motivations, few are ready to even speculate that Federer and Nadal may be too old or infirm to keep the Big Four united. But Nadal’s last major victory was the 2014 French Open, while Federer, close calls aside, has gone four years since defeating Murray in the 2012 Wimbledon final for his 17th major title. Murray followed his second Wimbledon title with a repeat Olympic gold medal in singles. But with only three career Grand Slam titles, he is the Big Four’s least credentialed member. A case could be made that Wawrinka  —   who denied Djokovic a   Slam in Paris last year and reached a   No. 3 ranking in 2014  —   has been a deserving Big Four   the last three years. “What puts them apart is their consistency, which is unbelievable,” Wawrinka said in Toronto. That is why Djokovic’s sudden and surprising summer stumbles  —   compounded by an aching wrist sustained in Rio  —   have raised hopes that anything might be possible in New York. “I wouldn’t say the door is ajar, but it’s cracked,” Isner said. “Guys are starting to reel them in a little bit. ” Djokovic agreed, without conceding that anyone’s run  —   most of all his  —   was over or close to it. Until one or more of the younger players becomes a rainmaker, he said, the death of the Big Four remains a forecast. “We are all aware it’s not going to stay forever, you know,” he said. “Somebody’s going to come in the mix. Whether that’s going to happen later this year, next year, or in few years, that’s something that we don’t know. But, you know, still the four of us guys that have been, you know, very fortunate to dominate a sport in last 10 years have been staying consistently there in those spots. ” Annacone coached Sampras when he was dismissed as a serious contender for majors on the far side of 30 and called him a cautionary tale for those writing off Federer and Nadal. “I lived it with Pete people said he’d never win again,” Annacone said, referring to the final match of Sampras’s career, a   takedown of Andre Agassi in the 2002 United States Open final for his   14th major title. “These guys are   greats, and we’ve come to expect so much that the evaluations do get a little skewed. ” Results do matter, though, the years do pass, and it would appear that the Big Four, beyond the individual fortunes of its members, is beginning to be recognized as a fading concept. “The shadow they cast was massive,” Isner said. “And I don’t think it’ll ever be seen again like that. ”",1
25741,What It’s Like to Be Trapped by a Category 5 Hurricane - The New York Times,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.  —   When you are born in Miami, your hurricane experiences tend to start early. Mine began in utero  —   my mother was pregnant with me when Hurricane Cleo touched down in Miami. Two weeks before my arrival, Hurricane Isbell set its sight on the Everglades. And just as I neared my first birthday, she hurriedly pushed my baby carriage down the street with my brother and sister to seek shelter at my godfather’s house. Hurricane Betsy, a doozy, was headed to Miami (It landed in Key Largo). Now, I’m waiting for Hurricane Matthew at a Homewood Suites hotel here about 100 miles north of Miami. I’m not one to be overly cavalier about powerful hurricanes. They can be wildly underestimated, although in today’s   news cycle of breathless reports, that seems impossible. Most people I have talked with here are already shuttered away in their homes, surrounded by ice, food, generators, flashlights, radios, fuel and water. This is a new experience for many Floridians, given the uncharacteristic paucity of major storms over the last decade and the   influx of newcomers to the state. But they should all know that in a really bad storm, preparation goes only so far. That became all too clear when I rode out Hurricane Andrew on Aug. 24, 1992, inside a Comfort Inn in Florida City, about 28 miles south of Miami, ground zero for the monumental Category 5 storm. The hurricane destroyed the southernmost parts of Dade County. It also demolished the Comfort Inn. Ending up in Florida City was the luck of the draw. I was a reporter at The Miami Herald at the time. The editors tossed out assignments. My fellow reporter and boyfriend (now my husband) Don Van Natta Jr. and I shrugged and headed out to the last city before the Florida Keys. A photographer for the paper, Carlos Guerrero, drove us there in his car, the only one headed south when we arrived around 10 p. m. There were 18 tourists, some from as far away as Japan, inside the   motel, the kind with rooms opening to the outside. It was calm for a few hours. We assumed a good story had passed us by. People called into radio stations from Miami, shouting about the ferocious winds. We debated toasting our first hurricane together with some beer. We opened our Comfort Inn door, and all was still. Until it wasn’t. The sounds were the first clues. Nearby electrical transformers started exploding, streaking the night with blue and green light. Then our power went out. Another hour passed. We could hear the sound of glass shattering and metal being sheared off the roof or scraping the pavement. A chunk of the motel roof flew off. We took a deep breath and dashed for the next room. A group of us huddled together. Flashlights and candles glowed. We talked a little but mostly listened to the hurricane’s groans. When ceilings started leaking, we changed rooms. Just past 5 a. m. our ears popped from the drop in barometric pressure. The sound of twisting and crashing metal intensified. The storm’s eye approached, bringing the briefest of lulls. It was pitch black outside, but we could spy the cars in the parking lot. They looked banged up. Windshields were shattered. We could live with that. But, like any good suspense story, the second half tumbled into terrifying. The motel manager, an   man, persuaded everyone to move to the motel’s north side because he knew the winds would shift after the eye passed. He very likely saved our lives. We didn’t know the wind around us was punching at 165 miles an hour. But we could feel its power. We ran from room to room with our hurricane friends. In one room, the ceiling started to crack, crumble or fly off in chunks. Just as the ceiling threatened to collapse, the door wouldn’t open. The pressure had sealed it shut. We were trapped. Nine of us crowded into the bathroom. We heard a boom. Something nearby had exploded. Water started leaking into the bathroom. One man crawled under the sink. A few people stood in the bathtub. Someone cried. One woman, panic in her voice, shouted for air. Everyone pressed together. We prayed out loud. Don and another man struggled to hold up the sagging ceiling. Plaster tumbled. Everything talked to us  —   the toilet and ceiling, the pipes and the walls. We tried the door again, but it still wouldn’t yield. That’s when we heard an even more frightening sound  —   the   rumble all around us. After what felt like an eternity, the door opened and we dashed to Room 240. The manager was there with a few other guests. The ceiling seemed secure. Still shaking, we exhaled. Dawn approached, and with it the storm gradually began to subside. We opened the door and peered out just as the sun rose. The Comfort Inn was nearly entirely blown away. All I could see around me was rubble and debris. We found a German tourist under a mattress in his roofless room, petrified and shaking. One of the guests, wearing military fatigues and carrying a long gun, started to loot a gas station nearby. Our room was mostly in pieces. Our suitcases were gone. I ventured into the bull’   —   Florida City  —   the first reporter on the ground. Stunned and soaked residents stumbled out of their badly mangled houses. One older man, carrying a small bundle of clothes, could barely speak. Frightened dogs roamed in packs (soon the monkeys unleashed from Monkey Jungle, a local tourist attraction, would join them). Ninety percent of the town was destroyed. Neighboring Homestead was trampled, too. No landmarks remained. People got lost in their own neighborhoods. Soon the National Guard would arrive,   tent cities would rise, people would guard their houses with shotguns, and an army of roofers and insurance adjusters would arrive. Our reporting done, we climbed into the photographer’s   car. The engine actually started. We covered our faces with towels to avoid the shattered windshield glass that flew at us. We headed north, bypassing downed poles, trees and power lines. We walked into The Miami Herald and filed our stories. In my pocket, I stashed one keepsake: the beige key to our Comfort Inn room, No. 216.",1
25742,Obama Needles Clinton and G.O.P. Field at Correspondents’ Dinner - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama poked fun at Hillary Clinton’s lack of appeal among young people Saturday night, joking at the annual White House press corps dinner that Mrs. Clinton was like an aging relative who cannot figure out how to use Facebook. “Did you get my poke? Is it on my wall?” he said, imagining Mrs. Clinton trying to use the popular social media site. “I’m not sure I’m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary. ” Mr. Obama also needled Mrs. Clinton for paid speeches she gave for Goldman Sachs. He noted that if his comedy routine, during his final appearance at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, was successful, he could earn “serious Tubmans”  —   a nod to Harriet Tubman, the American abolitionist whose image will be printed on future $20 bills. He referred to Senator Bernie Sanders, who was in the audience, as “comrade,” a reference to his political status as a democratic socialist. But the president reserved his most biting commentary for the Republicans running for president, repeatedly turning to the party’s chaotic nominating contest for comedic fodder. Mr. Obama mocked Senator Ted Cruz for calling a basketball hoop a “basketball ring” while campaigning in Indiana. “What else is in his lexicon?” Mr. Obama asked, working hard to contain a broad smile. “Baseball sticks? Football hats?” He paused, then added: “But sure, I’m the foreign one. ” The president showed a picture of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio eating pancakes as he noted that “some candidates aren’t polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. ” And he tweaked Republicans in the audience for their search for an alternative candidate, noting that the options for dinner were steak or fish. “A whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan,” he said. “You may not like steak or fish. But that’s your choice. ” And then there was Donald Trump. Mr. Obama riffed at length about Mr. Trump, the     who was not in attendance. The president wondered aloud why Mr. Trump had chosen not to be there. “You’ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he said no,” Mr. Obama said. “Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald?” He joked that Mr. Trump had some foreign policy experience because “he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. ” And he noted that Mr. Trump may be the best person to succeed in closing the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. “Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground,” Mr. Obama said. The president delivered his remarks with deft comic timing in a lengthy monologue that was both ironic and introspective. Members of the news media did not escape the president’s acerbic sense of humor. He joked that the movie “Spotlight,” about The Boston Globe’s investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests and holding the powerful accountable, was “the best fantasy film since ‘Star Wars. ’” And he tweaked the news media for giving Mr. Trump “the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. ” Mr. Obama’s most personal jab at a journalist was aimed at Jake Tapper, the host of “The Lede” on CNN. He noted that several journalists had left the White House beat in recent years, and then added: “Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN,” prompting Mr. Tapper to raise a wine glass. As has been his habit, Mr. Obama made fun of himself. He joked about his age  —   and the common maladies that afflict men over 50  —   suggesting that he felt far older than he did when he became president. “Hillary once questioned whether I’d be ready for a 3 a. m. phone call,” he recalled. “Now I’m awake anyway because I’ve got to go to the bathroom. ” He also noted that he had spent two days in London recently having lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, playing golf with Prime Minister David Cameron, and seeing a Shakespeare performance at the Globe Theater. “Just in case anyone is debating whether I’m black enough, that should settle the debate,” he said. Perhaps the most surprising moment of the president’s appearance came in a video produced by the White House showing Mr. Obama considering how to spend his time after leaving office. In the video, Mr. Obama first turns to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for advice. But then the president decides to call someone else for help  —   former House Speaker John A. Boehner, a Republican who was once a fierce adversary. The video shows the president and Mr. Boehner sitting in the White House movie theater watching the ending of “Toy Story. ” Mr. Boehner notes that he finally got the “grand bargain” that had eluded the two leaders during budget talks. “On a sweet Chevy Tahoe,” Mr. Boehner says, pulling out a pack of cigarettes and offering one to Mr. Obama, who has spent his presidency chewing nicotine gum to try to kick his smoking habit. The president’s eyes go wide. Mr. Obama closed his appearance on a serious note, saluting Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter who had been held in an Iranian prison, and who attended the dinner Saturday night. He promised that his administration would “continue to fight” for journalists held against their will. And he praised the Washington press corps for trying to resist the commercial pressures to dumb down journalism, saying that “there are so many of you who are pushing against those trends. ” He then offered just two words: “Obama out. ” He dropped his microphone, and turned from the podium.",1
25743,"Two years later, still no investigation into the suspicious death of American journalist Serena Shim","Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:02 UTC © nsnbc international Serena Shim, American journalist October 19 marks two years since the very sudden and suspicious death of American journalist Serena Shim near Suruç, Turkey, close to the Syrian border. Although all signs point to foul play, indeed murder, by Turkish intelligence, until now the US government has neither conducted nor demanded an inquiry into the events of the alleged car accident which Turkish officials say was the cause of Shim's death, let alone offer condolences to the family. Serena Shim was at the time reporting on Ayn al-Arab (Kobani), from the Turkish side. She was, in her own words, one of the first, if not the first, on the ground to report on ,""Takfiri militants going in through the Turkish border"". These include not only ISIS but also terrorists from the so-called Free Syrian Army (FSA). As Shim's sister Fatmeh Shim stated in 2015 , ""She caught them bringing in ISIS high-ranked members into Syria from Turkey into camps, which are supposed to be Syrian refugee camps."" Serena Shim's January 2013 expose , Turkey's Pivotal Role in Syria's Insurgency: PressTV Report from Inside Turkey, showed footage of what she estimated to be 300 semi-trucks ""awaiting militants to empty them out""; included testimony explaining how Turkey enables the crossing of foreign terrorists ""freely"" into Syria; spoke of the funneling of arms via the Incirlik US Air Base in Turkey to terrorists in refugee camps or on through to Syria; and highlighted the issue of terrorist training camps portrayed as refugee camps, guarded by the Turkish military. Shim named the World Food Organization as one of the NGOs whose trucks were being used to funnel terrorists' arms into Syria, and stated this in her last interview, just one day before being killed. Notably, in that interview she also explicitly stated that she feared for her life because Turkish intelligence had accused her of being a spy. She told Press TV: ""Turkey has been labeled by Reporters Without Borders as the largest prison for journalists, so I am a bit frightened about what they might use against me... I'm hoping that nothing is going to happen, that it's going to blow over. I would assume that they are going to take me in for questioning, and the next hope is that my lawyer is good enough to get me out as soon as possible."" Two days later, Press TV announced her death , stating: ""Serena was killed in a reported car accident when she was returning from a report scene in the city of Suruch in Turkey's Urfa province. She was going back to her hotel in Urfa when their car collided with a heavy vehicle."" This was the official version of her death, although in subsequent versions the story changed. In a report one month later, Russia Today (RT) spoke with Shim's sister, who said: ""There's so many different stories. The first was that Serena's car was hit by a heavy vehicle, who proceeded to keep on driving. They could not find the vehicle nor could they find the driver. Two days later, surprisingly, they had found the vehicle and the driver, and had pictures of the heavy vehicle hitting my sister's car. Every day coming out with new pictures of different degrees of damages that have happened to the car."" ""Serena and my cousin who was the driver of the car were taken to two different hospitals. She was reported first dead at the scene. Then coming out with later reports that she passed away at the hospital 30 minutes later from heart failure?! "" POLITICAL BLACKOUT, MEDIA BLACKOUT When on November 20, 2014, at a Daily Press Briefing, RT journalist Gayane Chichakyan twice pressed Director of Press Office, Jeff Rathke, for updates on Shim's death, he unsurprisingly gave none: Chichakyan: ""It's about the journalist Serena Shim, who died in Turkey under very suspicious circumstances. Did her death raise suspicions here at the State Department?"" Rathke: ""Well, I think we've spoken to this in the briefing room several weeks ago, after it happened. I don't have anything to add to what the spokesperson said at the time, though."" Chichakyan: ""But then she died several days after she claimed she had been threatened by the Turkish intelligence. Have you inquired about this? Have you asked questions? Is there really nothing new about this?"" Rathke: ""Well, I just don't have any update to share with you. Again, this was raised shortly after her death. The spokesperson addressed it. I don't have an update to share with you at this time."" Chichakyan: ""I just want to go back to Serena Shim. You rightly said the State Department commented on her death several weeks ago, and you say there is no update. Why is there no update? A U.S. citizen dies days after she said she'd been threatened by the Turkish intelligence."" Rathke: ""Well, I simply don't have any information to share at this time. I'm happy to check and see if there's anything additional. We spoke out about it, as I said, at the very start several weeks ago after her death, so I - but I don't have anything with me right now to offer. I'm happy to check and see if there's more that we can share."" Of course, neither he nor any US government official has followed up . Last year, Shim's mother, Judy Poe, replied to me in a message: ""There is no doubt in my mind that my daughter did not die in a car accident. There was not one single scratch on her there was no blood absolutely anywhere. I have tried to contact the American Embassy in Turkey with the cell phone numbers they gave me originally when I was going to get my daughter. Absolutely no response from the American Embassy in Turkey, including via personal cell phones."" Shim's sister in her RT interview stated, ""We've got no support whatsoever, nor have we got condolences."" None of the major journalist organizations have pursued a just investigation into Shim's murder, much less lamented it. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) turns up zero results when Shim's name is searched on their website . Yet, the CPJ does have a list of journalists killed in Turkey since 1992, and as recent as Feb 2016, obviously minus Shim's name. Likewise, a search on the Reporters Without Borders website turns up zero results . A December 19, 2014 article at the Greanville Post does have a CPJ spokesperson stating: ""The Committee to Protect Journalists has investigated the events surrounding Serena Shim's death in Turkey and at this time has found no evidence to indicate that her death was anything other than a tragic accident. Unless her death is confirmed to be in direct relation to her work as a journalist, it will not appear on our database. In the event that new evidence comes to light, CPJ would review her case."" The article Greanville Post notes, ""As of February 2016, the CPJ has not changed its position."" The International Federation of Journalists does have a short entry on Shim: ""Serena Shim, the female correspondent for Press TV in Turkey was killed in a car accident on the Turkish-Syrian border. She was returning from an assignment in Suruç, a rural district of Şanlıurfa Province of Turkey when her car collided with a truck."" But no call for inquiry and no questioning of official narrative. In a November 21, 2014 article at Shim's death, RT noted that, ""the office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media at the OSCE told RT that Turkey is carrying out an investigation."" It cited OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Gunnar Vrang, as saying: ""The representative has been following the case since the first reports appeared about the car accident that claimed the life of journalist Serena Shim. According to information available to her office, the Turkish authorities have started investigation into the details of the car accident."" Searching the OSCE for Serena Shim's name also results in zero hits. On February 5, 2016, Judy Poe tweeted: Clearly the representative went with the Turkish rendition of events. Few in corporate media have looked into Shim's suspicious death. In one surprising exception, Fox News reported on Shim's death, citing a US State Department spokesperson as saying the State Department ""does not conduct investigations into deaths overseas."" Given that Turkish intelligence threatened Shim, according to her testimony, and that Turkey is notorious world-wide for its imprisonment and murder of journalists, the US State Department's lack of concern is incriminating in itself. In stark contrast to the silence around Shim's death, John Kerry at least twice publicly mourned the death of James Foley, lauding as a hero the journalist who snuck into Syria via Turkey to report embedded with al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and giving sincere condolences to his family. Without a trace of irony, in August 2014, Kerry said of Foley , and never of Shim, ""We honor the courage and pray for the safety of all those who risk their lives to discover the truth where it is needed most."" In September, 2014, Kerry directly contradicted the above-mentioned words of the State Department spokesperson, saying: ""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took. And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes."" On the media and political blackout around Serena Shim's suspicious death, Shim's former colleague, Afshin Rattansi, host of RT's Going Underground posited: ""There were a few press reports, but nothing like the kind of reporting about a brave young journalist that one would expect. Was this because the story she was covering was so dangerous that a NATO ally like Turkey should be cooperating with ISIS... was that the reason that this story has not been more widely broadcast? We don't know."" Indeed, this would not be the first time the US administration has not pursued justice for the murder of one of its citizens by an ally. Rachie Corrie's March 16, 2013 murder by an Israeli soldier driving a bulldozer was not only witnessed by numerous rights activists with Corrie in Rafah, occupied Palestine, but was filmed. There is no denial that the Israeli soldier saw Corrie, drove his dozer over her and then reversed back, crushing her twice. Yet, in spite of the efforts of her family and supporters, the US has never pursued justice for this American citizen either. Judy Poe said that Serena's favourite motto was: ""I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees."" Shim lived the motto. She was 29, with two children, when killed. Eva Bartlett is an independent writer and rights activist with extensive experience in Syria and in the Gaza Strip, where she lived a cumulative three years (from late 2008 to early 2013). She documented the 2008/9 and 2012 Israeli war crimes and attacks on Gaza while riding in ambulances and reporting from hospitals. From June-August 2016, she visited Syria for her fifth time. Her writings can be found on her blog, In Gaza (www.ingaza.wordpress.com) Comment: It seems evident Shim was too close to revealing the true situation and the players involved. It is a tragedy that the price was her life.",1
25744,How a Putin Fan Overseas Pushed Pro-Trump Propaganda to Americans - The New York Times,"The Patriot News Agency website popped up in July, soon after it became clear that Donald J. Trump would win the Republican presidential nomination, bearing a logo of a red, white and blue eagle and the motto “Built by patriots, for patriots. ” Tucked away on a corner of the site, next to links for Twitter and YouTube, is a link to another social media platform that most Americans have never heard of: VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook. It is a clue that Patriot News, like many sites that appeared out of nowhere and pumped out   hoaxes tying his opponent Hillary Clinton to Satanism, pedophilia and other conspiracies, is actually run by foreigners based overseas. But while most of those others seem be the work of young, apolitical opportunists cashing in on a conservative appetite for viral nonsense, operators of Patriot News had an explicitly partisan motivation: getting Mr. Trump elected. Patriot News  —   whose postings were viewed and shared tens of thousands of times in the United States  —   is among a constellation of websites run out of the United Kingdom that are linked to James Dowson, a   political activist who advocated Britain’s exit from the European Union and is a fan of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. A vocal proponent of Christian nationalist,   movements in Europe, Mr. Dowson, 52, has spoken at a conference of   leaders in Russia and makes no secret of his hope that Mr. Trump will usher in an era of rapprochement with Mr. Putin. His dabbling in the American presidential election adds an ideological element that has been largely missing from the   landscape of websites and Facebook pages that bombarded American voters with misinformation and propaganda. Far from the   Macedonian teenagers running fake news factories solely for profit, Mr. Dowson made it his mission, according to messages posted on one of his sites, to “spread devastating     memes and sound bites into sections of the population too disillusioned with politics to have taken any notice of conventional campaigning. ” “Together, people like us helped change the course of history,” one message said, adding in another: “Every single one of you who forwarded even just one of our posts on social media contributed to the stunning victory for Trump, America and God. ” In a recent email interview from Belgrade, where he has met with Serbian nationalists, Mr. Dowson explained how his decision to establish an American social media presence was similar to the move into European markets by Breitbart News, the conservative provocateur media operation run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist. “Simple truth is that after 40 years of the right having no voice because the media was owned by the enemy, we were FORCED to become incredibly good at alternative media in a way the left simply can’t grasp or handle,” Mr. Dowson said. “Bottom line is: BREXIT, TRUMP and much more to follow. ” While it is easy to overstate the influence of fringe elements whose overall numbers remain very small, the explosion of fake news and propaganda sites and their possible impact on the presidential election have ignited alarm across the American political spectrum. A recent study found that most people who read fabricated stories on Facebook  —   such as a widely circulated hoax about Pope Francis endorsing Mr. Trump  —   were inclined to believe them. Then there is the added element of Russian meddling. The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Moscow put its thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump through the release of hacked Democratic emails, which provided fodder for many of the most pernicious false attacks on Mrs. Clinton on social media. Some of those attacks found a home on Russian websites such as the one for Katehon, a   Christian think tank aligned with Mr. Putin. Katehon recirculated   conspiracies under headlines like “Bloody Hillary: 5 Mysterious Murders Linked to Clinton. ” Another Russian site that urged support for Mr. Trump, called “Just Trump It,” is linked to the International Russian Conservative Forum, an annual gathering of   leaders in St. Petersburg that has featured Mr. Dowson, among others, as a speaker. The site, which seems mostly aimed at selling Trump   was registered to an individual at a Russian company that trademarked a logo used to certify that merchandise was not made with migrant labor. Some analysts see danger signs in the nexus of Russian interests and   agitators in Europe and the United States. Social media can amplify even the most obscure voices, giving them a stage from which to broadcast a distorted message to credulous audiences. “These messages seep into the mainstream,” said Alina Polyakova, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan international affairs institute in Washington. “They may have been extreme or fringe at one point in time, but they have been incredibly influential in shaping people’s views about key geopolitical events in a very specific direction. ” Russia is particularly adept at playing this game, Ms. Polyakova said. “Moscow specifically encourages and facilitates” the spreading of propaganda through proxies, she said, as well as through events like the Russian conservative forum, which showcases views and narratives favored by the Putin government. At the inaugural forum in March 2015, Mr. Dowson praised Mr. Putin as a strong defender of traditional values, while belittling President Obama and the United States itself as “feminized men. ” In the email interview, Mr. Dowson said he was not supported by Russia in any way, and he accused critics of trying to tar conservatives as dupes of Moscow. “I look on this rebirth of     hysteria by the LEFT as a hilarious reaction born out of the left’s inability to realize THEY elected Trump, not me, not the Russians, not even the right,” he said via email. A colorful if somewhat enigmatic figure in Britain  —   The Times of London recently described him as “the invisible man of Britain’s far right”  —   Mr. Dowson, at first blush, would not be an obvious mouthpiece for Russia. Formerly a church minister in Northern Ireland and the father of nine, he became involved in   campaigns, joined the British National Party in the   and, later, founded Britain First, a stridently   group opposed to what it called a creeping Islamic threat to traditional British values. He publicly split with the group in 2014 after some of its leaders started invading mosques and threatening Muslims, which he criticized as   and counterproductive. While involved with Britain First, Mr. Dowson made deft use of social media and websites to promote its work and convey the impression of a mass following. A British watchdog group called Hope Not Hate, which has tracked Mr. Dowson’s online activities, concluded that he has “a rather canny knack for building up protest groups and movements on the basis that it was your Christian duty to follow his work. ” Mr. Dowson claims to have reached millions of Americans across all of his online platforms in the   to the November presidential election, a number that could not be verified, in part, because he would not confirm all of his sites. Online visits to Patriot News did not come close to that, although when combined with several other sites that appear to be connected to Mr. Dowson, the total number edges above a million most viewers were in Britain. Whatever the precise numbers, there is little question that postings on the sites and Facebook pages linked to him were viewed and shared hundreds of thousands of times. Many of the postings appear to be lifted from other conspiracy websites, repackaged and launched back into the social media maelstrom. Another site that trafficked heavily in   news was run by Knights Templar International, a militant religious group that Mr. Dowson is involved in, which has recently supported   militias patrolling border areas in Bulgaria and Hungary. For Mr. Dowson, such activities are in keeping with his philosophy that traditional Christian values are under siege because of feckless leadership by America and European powers. The success of Mr. Trump, he said, is the logical result of voters’ rejection of the weakness of global elites. Mr. Dowson has long been optimistic about the effectiveness of social media. During the 2015 conservative forum in Russia, he spoke presciently about the looming online battle for the attention of American voters. “We have the ability to take a video from today and put it in half of every single household in the United States of America, where these people can for the first time learn the truth, because their own media tell lies, they tell lies about Russia,” Mr. Dowson said then. “We have to use popular culture to reach into the living rooms of the youth of America, of Britain, France, Germany, and bring them in,” he said. “Then we can get them the message. ”",1
25746,Extremist Imam Tests F.B.I. and the Limits of the Law - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   For more than a decade, Suleiman Anwar Bengharsa has served as a Muslim cleric in Maryland, working as a prison chaplain and as an imam at mosques in Annapolis and outside Baltimore. He gave a   course in 2011 on Islamic teachings on marriage at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, where President Obama made a   visit this year. But in the last two years, Imam Bengharsa’s public pronouncements have taken a dark turn. On Facebook, he has openly endorsed the Islamic State, posted gruesome videos showing ISIS fighters beheading and burning alive their enemies and praised terrorist attacks overseas. The “Islamic Jurisprudence Center” website he set up last year has condemned American mosques as   and declared that homosexual acts should be punished by death. That is not all. An affidavit filed in federal court by the F. B. I. says that Imam Bengharsa, 59, supplied $1, 300 in June 2015 to a Detroit man who used it to expand his arsenal of firearms and grenades. The man, Sebastian Gregerson, 29, a Muslim convert who sometimes calls himself Abdurrahaman Bin Mikaayl, was arrested in late July and indicted on explosives charges. Nearly a year ago, in fact, the F. B. I. said in a court filing  —   accidentally and temporarily made public in an online database  —   that agents suspected the two men were plotting terrorism. “Based on the totality of the aforementioned information and evidence, there is reason to believe that Bengharsa and Gregerson are engaged in discussions and preparations for some violent act on behalf of” the Islamic State, an agent wrote. Yet Imam Bengharsa has not been arrested or charged. It appears that the authorities do not have clear evidence that he has broken the law. His inflammatory statements are protected by the First Amendment, and agents appear to have no proof that he knew Mr. Gregerson planned to buy illegal explosives. In his checkbook, next to the notation for the $1, 300 check, Imam Bengharsa wrote “zakat,” or charity, the documents show. The case poses in a striking way the dilemma for the F. B. I. in deciding when constitutionally protected speech crosses into inciting violence or conspiring to commit a terrorist act. The bureau was sharply criticized for not acting more aggressively on prior warnings about the men who carried out attacks in Orlando, Fla. in June and in New York and New Jersey last month. And in early August, the F. B. I. arrested a transit police officer from Fairfax, Va. after watching him for six years before charging him with providing support to the Islamic State. It was another case that raised questions  —   even among agents  —   about why the F. B. I. and federal prosecutors waited so long to act, potentially putting the public at risk. In testimony before Congress this week, the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said the challenge for F. B. I. agents was determining when someone has crossed the line from speech to criminal activity. “It’s even protected speech to say I’m a fan of the Islamic State ” Mr. Comey said. When the suspect is a cleric, like Imam Bengharsa, the matter is especially delicate. “It’s very possible that he’s never crossed the legal threshold,” said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who has closely followed the imam’s story. But Mr. Hughes called the situation “perplexing and concerning. ” The imam “can take his supporters right up to the line. It’s like a making a cake and not putting in the final ingredient. It’s winks and nods all the way. ” Imam Bengharsa appears to have plenty of money. Court records say he received $902, 710 in wire transfers in 2014 and 2015, possibly an inheritance. He told The Detroit News that he often helped needy people like Mr. Gregerson. “If that individual turns around and wants to use that money for something else that’s illegal, the person who gave the money cannot be held responsible,” Imam Bengharsa said. “It’s pathetic if they are making those connections. If that’s what this country has become, I’d rather be in jail. ” The documents say he transferred money three times to an unnamed person in Yemen. Investigators are also exploring contacts between Imam Bengharsa and other people suspected of extremism or terrorism. One is Yusuf Wehelie, 25, a Virginia man arrested in July and charged with weapons possession, which would be illegal because he has a previous felony conviction for burglary. Mr. Wehelie first came to public attention in 2010, when he and his brother, Yahya Wehelie, both American citizens, were temporarily detained in Cairo and prevented by the F. B. I. from flying home. American officials said such delays were sometimes necessary to assess whether a person posed a security threat. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on   Relations protested that the rights of such travelers were being violated. At Yusuf Wehelie’s detention hearing in July, the authorities said he had told undercover agents that he supported the Islamic State and that if he couldn’t join it overseas, he would attack a military recruiting center, possibly using explosives. (Mr. Wehelie’s lawyer, Nina Ginsberg, said that in later recorded conversations, he disavowed those statements and later stopped replying to the undercover agents.) In Baltimore, another young man named Maalik Alim Jones was arrested late last year and charged with joining a terrorist group in Africa. Imam Bengharsa had preached on occasion at a Baltimore mosque Mr. Jones attended, but it is not clear that they knew each other. The F. B. I. has been closely watching the imam for months, law enforcement officials say. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment. The authorities are concerned that Imam Bengharsa, who claims an impressive list of scholarly credentials, may be spreading the Islamic State message that violence can be justified against perceived enemies of the faith. In view of the payment to Mr. Gregerson, they also fear he may be financing other supporters of the Islamic State. The F. B. I. has said in court that he is under investigation for conspiring and providing material support to the Islamic State. Imam Bengharsa did not reply to emails, phone messages or a note left at his townhouse in Clarksburg, Md. a town equidistant from Baltimore and Washington. In comments to The Detroit News, which first reported the link between Mr. Gregerson and Imam Bengharsa last month, the imam said the government was engaging in “McCarthyism” and that the accusations were “ridiculous. ” He denied that he supported the Islamic State but said: “It might appear that way. I am an advocate of the United States and the West getting the hell out of the Middle East and the Muslim world. ” He added a question: “If this was the case, why haven’t they come to arrest me?” Imam Bengharsa, who was born in Libya, moved to the United States at age 10, according to a biography he posted online. He claims to have received a degree from Al Azhar University in Cairo, and additional degrees in economics and Islamic studies. He lived in Texas and later, after embracing religion, worked as a chaplain in Maryland prisons from 2006 to 2009, as an imam at the Islamic Society of Annapolis from 2009 to 2010 and at Masjid Umar, a small storefront mosque outside Baltimore, from 2011 to 2014. Last year he created the Islamic Jurisprudence Center, whose street address turns out to be a mailbox at the UPS Store near his home in Clarksburg. The authorities said he also frequently visited another mosque, Dar   in the Baltimore suburb of Ellicott City. Imam Bengharsa appears to have long held very conservative views. In his 2011 lectures at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, for example, he said Muslims must strictly follow the shariah, or Islamic law, no matter where they live. “It doesn’t help if you say ‘I’m now living in America’ or ‘I’m now living in England,’ or ‘My culture says such and such.’ ” he said. But Imam Bengharsa’s harsh recent pronouncements set him much farther from mainstream American Islam. On the Islamic Jurisprudence Center site in April, he condemned by name the leading Muslim organizations in the United States, 12 prominent clerics he called “evil ” and a list of 22 mosques  —   including the two where he previously worked. Since the court documents naming him were made public, he removed those pages from his site, though they remain available in the Google cache. In his standoff with the F. B. I. Imam Bengharsi appears to have scant support in the American Muslim community. Muhammad Jameel, the president of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, said that the imam’s marriage lectures five years ago were his only connection to the mosque and that his recent statements were “against all the tenets of Islam. ” “He’s a nut,” Mr. Jameel said. “He has freedom of speech. But if he’s a criminal, I want to see him in jail. ”",1
25747,Comment on Study Links GMO Animal Feed To Severe Stomach Inflammation And Enlarged Uteri In Pigs by Confirmed: DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them – The Modern Gnostic,"  Genetically modified (GM) crops have infiltrated human food and animal feed in increasing amounts since they were commercially released in 1996. It is now normal for a large portion of pigs to have a complete GM diet. Human beings have become desensitized to inhumane animal practices. Not only do we consume the flesh of a living, breathing, feeling, intelligent sentient and loving being, we do it in mass amounts, and do it after they have been fed with feed that contributes in making human beings sick as well. It’s no coincidence that the same financial institutions that hold majority stock in both the food/ biotech industry also hold major stock in the pharmaceutical/health industry. GMO testing on animals is inhumane, and is really not needed with all of the evidence already available to show how GMOs are very hazardous to human health. advertisement - learn more A study by scientist Judy Carman, PHD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health (1). Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs. GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs. The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren’t fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is defiantly another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States. Although GM fed pigs seem to be the norm across North America, it’s unnecessary to use animals for testing. Although animal testing does provide information, it is simply not needed, and extremely inhumane. Again, we do not need any more studies to show that GMOs are harmful to the health of all. It’s not natural, world hunger and food shortage is a scam. We could easily feed the entire planet, and have multiple ways to do it. There should be no debate on the subject. There is a worldwide genocide happening right under our nose, if we don’t speak up for these animals, who will? How can we consume these beings? It seems we have drifted so far away from our souls voice. How can we feed them GMO feed, and then feed that to ourselves? Any being foreign to this world would have a hard time looking upon it without feeling sick and hurt. We kill billions of animals for consumption every year. You can read more about the worldwide genocide on animals here . GMOs are gaining a lot of attention worldwide. The chinese government recently destroyed multiple shipments of GM corn, you can read more about that here . Japan and South Korea rejected U.S. wheat found to be polluted with GMOs, you can read about that here and here . Recently, a hidden viral gene that’s harmful to human health was discovered in GMO crops, you can read more about that here . Scientists also discovered that Bt toxins found in Monsanto crops damage red blood cells, which you can read about here . Feel free to browse through our site for more information on GMOs. All of these studies show that when it comes to GMOs the body is not meant to take them in. Much Love.",1
25750,Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University,"Professor Dr. Mujahid Kamran, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Punjab, on the Suspension without Pay of Prof. Tony Hall 1 Shares

Professor Mike Mahon President and Vice Chancellor Lethbridge, Canada
Dear Professor Mike Mahon,
It is with a sense of great sadness that I have learnt of the suspension, without pay, of Professor Anthony Hall, one of the most distinguished scholars, not only of the , but a researcher and writer who is recognised and respected globally. In a country like Pakistan, which is far behind Canada in term of education, research and scholarship, no teacher, or non-teacher, of any university can be suspended without pay. When someone is suspended, he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension. If Canada is doing better than us on various scales, then one would expect that suspension without pay puts Canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play. I may add respectfully that in Pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing. The decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment.
 From his writings, that I have read over a period of time, it is evident that Professor Anthony Hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state. His analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly. And his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation. , or any university for that matter, should have been proud to have Professor Hall on its faculty. His suspension creates an impression, even from this distance from where I write, that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech, have targeted people like Professor Anthony Hall, who speak out for democracy, decency, peace and justice.
I have found out from the internet that B’nai Brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech. It is quite evident that the charge that Professor Anthony Hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious. To the contrary, it appears that an anti-Muslim bias has been created in your institution by Professor Hall’s unfortunate suspension.There is also a strong impression that B’nai Brith has taken over the administrative decision making at Lethbridge.
MORE... Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Irish human rights activists against freedom of speech? B’nai Brith attack on Canadian professor has roots in Zionist false flag tactics It is also worrying that B’nai Brith have now targeted Canadian universities and Canadian society. If this is the case then the situation is disturbing, not just for Lethbridge and Canada, but for all freedom loving people worldwide. When I was a young student at University of Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1970s, I used to meet many Canadian students and I found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice. The suspension of Professor Hall is inconsistent with my image of the Canadian people that I had then formed.
On behalf of the academic community of the University of the Punjab (established 1882) I urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend Professor Hall. It will go a long way in rehabilitating the impression of people worldwide about the upholding of free speech, academic freedom, and genuine scholarly discourse at Lethbridge.

25751,Why Hillary won’t unleash WWIII,"One thought on “ Why Hillary won’t unleash WWIII ” shorty says: October 30, 2016 at 8:01 pm 
SELECT COMMENTS | OVERHEARD (ORIGINALLY ON RUSSIA INSIDER) From time to time we import comments we regard as lucid or thought-provoking to a particular discussion. This is such a thread. Some opinions we agree with, some we don’t. But they all add an edge to this topic. —The Editors 
MMChomek • 16 hours ago Alright, let’s sum this up. 
Hillary can’t launch a No fly zone over Syria, because there is already one in place? Well, the point they are trying to make is that they will get rid of the Russian and Syrian air defenses to launch their own “We can fly-you can’t-zone”. With force. Hillary expressed her willingness to do this several times already. 
Yes, General Dunford said “we would have to go to war with Syria and Russia” You kind of left out the followup, where he says “That is a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I’m not going to make” not, “we can’t do this” e.g, he’s waiting for the order from the commander in chief. 
This was at the very beginning of the article >She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/”humanitarian” imperialist axis. 
So WHO is going to stop her? 
and lastly, first finished Sarmat won’t be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it 
So you basically say “This is why Hillary won’t start WWIII” and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions 
••• 
Mike John Elissen MMChomek • 8 hours ago `and lastly, first finished Sarmat won’t be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it` 
followed by `So you basically say “This is why Hillary won’t start WWIII” and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions` Seems to me the only `non-argumentation` is your view on Billary taking control next year and immediately starting WW3. Even for a war-loving US hawk like her, it will take time to start a war with Russia. 
MMChomek Mike John Elissen • 8 hours ago God, Hillary doesn’t even need to be president to lobby for war. She’s been doing exactly that for three straight decades. Now she has full support of entire D.C behind her back. Even as Kjell mentions one or two good, down to earth generals in Pentagon are not going to be enough, when most of their colleagues lobby for spending and interventions hoping to end up as senior advisors for defense contractor giants. Entire DC, even bah, especially the “progressive think tanks” (who get funded by things like Lockheed Martin and even Saudi Arabia) is crying for cruise missile strikes on Syria as we speak. 
Mike John Elissen MMChomek • 6 hours ago Your argumentation for calling Escobar`s points `non-arguments` is, or rather was ao the fact HRC takes office in january (not february as you claimed) 2017, and the new Sarmat will be in service in 2018. To change the subject (Clinton&Co warmongering and making profits – we all know that) does not change the fact Billary needs time to prepare for a war with Russia. You can call Kjell as a `rescue line` all you want, fact remains your own argumentation is `Non`. 
••• Kjell Hasthi MMChomek • 16 hours ago – Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February Pepe did not say that 
Neil Tana Kjell Hasthi • 7 hours ago She will. Trump is an idiot and is probably acting that way to drive another agenda because he can’t be that stupid. The real questions is how serious is all of this to Russia. I think it is very serious. The US has already shown how they manipulate people to wage war against their government, supply them with weapons, call it a civil war, plant false flags to push it over the edge, call it unhumanitarian to open air war options, then invite others to join in on the fun while selling them weapons in the process to do so. They can easily do this to Russia if Syria falls or not. They just need to excite the 20 million muslims in Russia that borders the middle east. I’d say that Russia is a great risk and should take decisive actions. They could just use air fuel bombs as they are not radioactive but destroy everything in its path like a tactical nuke. To this point, the EU needs to be very worried because they are on the front lines and are sleep walking under the direction of the US who is an ocean away. 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek • 14 hours ago – As I said before, I don’t believe Trump will win 
That is naiv as both Hillary and Kaine are unpopular. In Pentagon, almost hated. 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi • 14 hours ago How is that possible? She is their major job provider. 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek • 14 hours ago There are 90 million made redundant Trump is a more attractive candidate for them The polls presented on telly are all manipulated (when compared to independent polls). Hillary is well behind, and she is losing voters these days. The Putin bashing did not save her. 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi • 14 hours ago Trump has wowed to pull out of middle east, stop babysitting and subsidizing other NATO members and become buddies with the “greatest existential threat” e.g Russia 
How is he a more attractive candidate for the Pentagon, than Hillary who’s seeking armed confrontation everywhere? 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek • 14 hours ago Trump presents the Globalists as an existential threat, and this election as the most important in human history. It is about saving humanity. 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi • 14 hours ago I understand and agree, now please try to fit what you’ve just said into your previous post about Trump being the more attractive choice for the Pentagon, because I’m lost here. 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek • 14 hours ago That is new. Some group of (4 stars?) general approached Trump and asked him to be candidate. Their arguments were about stopping madman Hillary. Trump said yes to them 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi • 14 hours ago So there is an actual anti-war faction inside the Pentagon? That sounds too good to be true. Most of those guys lobby war like madmen, because they get lucrative advisor contracts with defense industries after they retire. Isn’t it just some hearsay? 
••• 
dan kopfz MMChomek • 11 hours ago Unlike the psychopaths in the white house, the vast majority of the military leadership are not completely insane, and would not meekly follow orders when those orders would mean the lives of millions of Americans. 
Should Hillary push for a no-fly zone, it’s not the Russians she’d need to worry about–it’s a military coup. As everyone knows, in a military coup, you eliminate the current leadership. 
dan kopfz dan kopfz • 11 hours ago There’s another reality that the military would be taking into account, that mad Hillary probably wouldn’t. 
China is not stupid. 
An empire doesn’t get to be 8000+ years old by making miscalculations. China knows that if the US is willing to commit to a hot war with Russia, than they’d be next if the US won. That means the Chinese would be looking to make sure that the US doesn’t win, and given the current tensions in the South China, might join the war on Russia’s side as a full ally, openly declaring war against the US. 
Without going nuclear, in an open hot war against China and Russia (and Syria, and Iran, and others), NATO can’t win. The Pentagon won’t make that miscalculation either. 
Peter Jennings • 14 hours ago The US have been fighting lame armies filled with soldiers who would rather be somewhere else. Tending to their crops or animals for example. 
Afghanistan isn’t going as expected. Libya isn’t going as expected. Iraq isn’t going as expected. In Syria they have got bogged down, exposing their proxy war to all, when it was initially advertising as ‘humanitarian intervention’. 
When it comes to Russia, a determined, battle hardened, well trained army with highly advanced weapons, the US will resemble europe during the last world war. Vote in a warmonger, you will get war, that’s where they get their kicks. 
StevenStarr • 14 hours ago Wishful thinking. 
richardstevenhack • 4 hours ago Apparently both Alexander Mercouris and Pepe Escobar have succumbed to what is known as “cognitive dissonance”– the attitude that because something would be impossible to accept, it therefore is impossible to happen. 
While I would expect some members of the Pentagon to school Clinton on the problems of establishing a no-fly-zone in Syria once she is elected, the fact remains that there is no reason to believe she will accept that position. 
As I’ve said before, the goal of the Syria crisis is to set the preconditions for a long war with IRAN. First Syria’s military has to be degraded, then Israel (and possibly NATO) will attack Hizballah in Lebanon into the Bekaa Valley via Syrian territory. Then and only then can Israel initiate a war with Iran, having more or less “disarmed” Iran’s allies right next to Israel. 
If Israel wants to achieve its goal of taking Iran out of the Middle East picture, and the US military-industrial complex wants to achieve its goal of an expensive, profitable, decades long war with Iran, then Syria has to go. Which means that there will be no let-up in pushing for that result. 
And we all know Hillary Clinton is TOTALLY on board with both aims as a warmongering neocon. 
Did the Bush neocons fail to get the Iraq and Afghan wars started? 
Why, then, should be assume, as Alexander and Pepe do, that Hillary Clinton cannot override any Pentagon reluctance and get a war with Syria started, regardless of the enhanced difficulties presented by the presence of Russia? 
Obama was prepared to go to war with Syria in August, 2013. While Russia was not present at the time to make that a more difficult proposition, it proves that the US IS spoiling for war with Syria. The three UNSC Resolutions submitted by the US early on with Chapter 7 language in them to justify such a war were only vetoed by Russia and China, burned on Libya. They prove the US goal is war with Syria. 
The US is not going to back down just because Russia presents a greater difficulty. Many in the Beltway really believe that if the US attacks, Russia will back down. They are probably wrong, but it will be a little late to find out once the war starts. 
For another thing, the notion that doubling down on supplying weapons such as MANPADs to the insurgents will change the situation is ridiculous – and the Pentagon will inform her of that, too. Which leaves her with only one option: a direct US/NATO attack on Syria. 
Short of a straight-up Pentagon revolt, Clinton can and probably will start a war with Syria and Russia.",1
25757,Thyroid Cancer Scare: The Test Removes Your Thyroid Whether it is Cancerous or Not,"Argentina president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had her thyroid gland removed, but test results showed she did not have cancer. Image source . 
by Paul Fassa Health Impact News 
Suppose you went to a doctor for low energy and a raspy throat. You vaguely suspect your thyroid is weak, maybe hypothyroidism. But after a series of tests, tiny nodules were found on your throat and the doctor determined you needed to have your thyroid removed, a thyroidectomy, to determine whether or not the nodules are cancerous. 
Then you are told not to worry, there are medicines that will be prescribed to replace the missing thyroid’s hormone production. You would have to take them for the rest of your life. You figure anything is better than dying from cancer spreading from the thyroid to elsewhere or undergoing chemotherapy, so you go for it. Nipping it in the bud, they say. 
Then after the procedure, you discover that those nodules weren’t cancerous and there was no threat of cancer. You’ll have to take those synthetic pharmaceutical drugs forever, but at least you know you’re cancer free now. 
After several months of taking those drugs, you discover your complaints and symptoms prior to the surgical procedure have been worsening. 
This unfortunate medical procedure is harming people far too often, leading some doctors to declare it needs to stop. Real Life Examples of Those Possible Scenarios 
The first part of my fictitious question was international news in 2011 . That’s when Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner underwent a thyroidectomy to preclude the possibility of cancer that could spread into her neck’s lymph glands and brain. 
The biopsy of El Presidente’s thyroid tissues proved the earlier detected nodules were not cancerous at all. Despite cover-up controversy and corruption surrounding Cristina’s tenure as Argentina’s president, she had many adoring fans who breathed a sigh of relief. The song lyric “don’t cry for me Argentina” was evoked with that discovery. 
Of course, there was no follow-up on how Cristina fared with her daily dose of synthetic thyroid hormones. But a less prominent case concerning a patient of Dr. Jeffrey Dach (pronounced dash) a holistic M.D. in South Florida, provides a perfect example of what to expect after partial or total thyroidectomies used for biopsies. Here is Dr. Dach’s explanation: 
The surgery had disturbed her recurrent laryngeal nerve leaving her with a chronic hoarseness, cough and voice change. The surgery also removed the parathyroid glands leaving her at risk for osteoporosis. The radioactive iodine treatment caused salivary gland damage, leaving her with a chronic dry mouth and bad taste. 
I explained to Lisa that her symptoms of hypothyroidism were due to the small dose of Synthroid, … which contains only T4, does not completely replace the function of her missing thyroid gland. A natural thyroid medication made from desiccated porcine thyroid gland containing T3, T4 and Calcitonin is a far better alternative. Lisa was switched over to her natural thyroid medication, … and 3 weeks later called the office to report a dramatic improvement with relief of chronic fatigue and improved energy levels. 
Dr. Dach mentioned that 36 year old Lisa’s procedures were done “just to make sure.” At first, her doctor perceived a small lump in her neck by touch (palpating) and recommended a thyroid ultrasound, which imaged a 9 mm nodule or lump on her thyroid. Then an ultrasound guided needle biopsy was ordered that determined “papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.” 
Approximate total cost of the procedures was over $20,000 not including her lifetime prescription of synthetic pharmaceutical thyroid hormones needed once her thyroid gland was removed. This life of pharmaceutical hormones is demanded for even partial thyroidectomies that are impaired from optimum operations. A Few Practitioners Argue Against this Aggressive Diagnostic Procedure 
Almost all thyroid cancers found with ultrasound scanning and needle biopsy are the small occult (almost invisible) papillary carcinoma , or OPC, a relatively benign tumor with a 30 year survival rate of 95 percent without treatment. 
A 1985 Finnish study of autopsies from deaths unrelated to thyroid issues or cancers determined what a few have suspected all along, that people live with OPCs and die from other causes without thyroid cancer diagnosis’. From that study: 
Apparently the great majority of the tumors remain small and circumscribed and even from those few tumors that grow larger and become invasive OPCs only a minimal proportion will ever become a clinical carcinoma. … OPC can be regarded as a normal finding which should not be treated when incidentally found. In order to avoid unnecessary operations [emphasis added] it is suggested that incidentally found small OPCs (less than 5 mm in diameter) were called occult papillary tumor instead of carcinoma. (Abstract source) 
Whether the programmed fear of death from cancer motivates aggressively attacking OPCs or simply cancer treatments’ high profits, most likely some combination of both, there are those within mainstream medicine who have expressed disdain over the current OPC approach. 
Radiologist John J. Cronan, M.D., posed this question in his editorial published in the June 2008 issue of Radiology, “ Thyroid Nodules: Is It Time to Turn Off the US Machines? ” 
From the patient perspective, we have hung the psychologic stigma of cancer on these patients and the dependency for daily thyroid supplementation …We accept all these consequences to control a cancer with a 99% 10-year survival. … Realizing the outcome of screening the thyroid, it well might be better to turn off the US machines. In summary, we need to develop an evidence-based strategy that will permit us to escape this flood of nodules. (Source) 
In a 2007 JAMA ( Journal of American Medical Association ) article, neck surgeon Dr. Keith Keller, M.D., a veteran of 1,000 thyroid sugeries over his 28 year career, made this claim: 
I do not believe that this [thyroid cancer] epidemic is real. It is due to improved diagnostic scrutiny, ultrasonography, and other imaging studies and the increasing use of ultrasound-guided FNAB. We may be diagnosing and treating cancers that have no clinical significance. (Emphasis added) 
We have embarked on a quixotic quest to rid our patients of microscopic and probably clinically unimportant thyroid cancer. We need to refocus our efforts, not to detect more occult disease, but to identify and cure those few patients whose disease is likely to shorten their lives. 
We need to improve our accuracy in the evaluation of the indeterminate thyroid nodule. We are performing far too many unnecessary thyroidectomies. [Emphasis added] (Source) Safeguarding Against Thyroidectomies and the Resultant Synthetic Hormones 
The reason behind this is all the diagnostic studies Dr. Keller mentioned are inconclusive for diagnosing truly malignant thyroid cancer that could spread into lymph glands and other areas. The only reason for partial or total thyroidectomies is to determine whether the nodules are not cancerous. 
A minority of courageous mainstream M.D.s have suggested a wait-and-see policy before proceeding to the stage of using a thyroidectomy to determine cancer. The nodules are usually benign after all. 
Some think over 1 mm is time to cut into the thyroid, most of those concerned consider over 5 mm as the time to surgically probe, while Dr. Yasuhiro Ito of Japan recommends extending the wait-and-see approach to 10 mm. That would have spared Lisa all the suffering from which Dr. Dach rescued her. 
Patient advocate and author of several books on thyroid and hormonal issues, Mary Shomon, thinks the latest extension of testing for thyroid cancer might eliminate a lot of unnecessary thyroid removals. 
The Afirma Thyroid FNA Analysis extends the ultrasound guided FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration) with a series of tests to confirm or rule out malignancy. Currently lab facilities are limited and many doctors may not know of this extended procedure. 
The procedure runs around $3500, considerably less than the 15 to 20,000 dollars dolled out for the surgical biopsy that usually renders one’s thyroid gland useless or no longer there and puts one on a lifetime prescription of synthetic hormone drugs. 
An easy way to safeguard yourself from thyroid problems is by supplementing iodine heavily, much more than the FDA recommended dosage of 150 mcg to 300 mcg daily. One should boldly move into the milligrams per dose range, even over 12.5 mg daily to compensate for iodine deficiency. (Source) 
It’s also very important to avoid fluoridated and chlorinated water as well as most commercial pastries and breads commonly made with bromide or sodas that are brominated. All of these compounds block your thyroid’s ability to absorb the iodine fuel it needs. 
If you or a loved one unfortunately undergoes a thyroidectomy to lose that gland’s hormonal activity, at least get off the synthetic hormones and use naturally animal derived desiccated hormones (bovine or porcine) such as Armour. 
A friend of ours lost her life one year after a thyroidectomy that she stubbornly pursued. Her loss of life was not from cancer, it was from complications of the procedure and her forced use of synthetic thyroid hormones.

25758,Good News for MTV’s V.M.A.s: Music Videos Matter Again - The New York Times,"As music awards shows go, MTV’s annual Video Music Awards ceremony  —   the V. M. A.s  —   is by far the loosest, the most vibrant and the most prone to disruption. It has long been the platform where pop stars know a medium amount of misbehavior will be tolerated  —   encouraged, actually. The show isn’t about trophies, but moments. That MTV itself isn’t much in the music business anymore only makes the playing field clearer for provocation: Acting out here is like trashing a hotel room, not your house. Accordingly, in recent years, the most memorable parts of the awards have been   …     not quite musical. There was the Kanye   Swift kerfuffle, still reverberating after all this time. And then there was Miley Cyrus’s   party as a pop fire starter, followed a couple of years later by her squaring off with Nicki Minaj. All of which is fine fun, truly. Just because the show was originally intended to celebrate music video doesn’t mean that’s what it needs to excel at. And yet, for the first time in several years, there’s something exciting about the current collection of nominees, particularly in the video of the year category. Of the five nominated for the show’s Moonman awards on Sunday night, when the event will be broadcast live from Madison Square Garden for the first time, four are state of the art in content, concept or delivery: Beyoncé’s “Formation,” Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” Justin Bieber’s “Sorry” and Kanye West’s “Famous. ” (The fifth, Adele’s “Hello,” is elegant and stars Adele, but that’s about it.) For the first time in recent memory, the awards have the opportunity to be more than an outlandish pop star playground and to serve as a reminder of how essential music video can be as a   art form. This is the ideal year for such a reframing: Video has been an essential part of several important artists’ releases, not just as a secondary element, but also as part of the primary project. Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” album, which added political and psychological depth to her songs of mistrust and hurt, came into the world first as a short film that had its premiere on HBO. The “Formation” video preceded “Lemonade,” setting the table for its messages of black empowerment with rich Southern gothic imagery and provocative messages about police violence against black bodies, which made Beyoncé a   flash point in a way she had never been. For Kanye West, the “Famous” video wasn’t a disruption of his public narrative, but a bold extension of it. The controversial work, in which he and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, lie naked in a large bed, surrounded by nude   of their friends and foes (Taylor Swift, Ray J, Donald J. Trump, Caitlyn Jenner and more) was a reinterpretation of a painting by the artist Vincent Desiderio. It is also a mood piece about innocence, a provocative and unlikely rejoinder to the song’s tabloid DNA. But it, too, ruffled the feathers of those who thought Mr. West’s use of his peers’ images was a violation too far. Beyoncé’s and Mr. West’s uses of music video are aesthetic and conceptual, and their project served as vehicles for extending their public images. What Drake and Mr. Bieber have done is perhaps the opposite: letting go of the wheel and using the music video as a focal point for mass reinterpretation. Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” with its soft pastels and spacious backdrops, is a virtual meme generator. It understands the video art form as a starting point, not a conclusion, and has served as raw material for endless gifs, memes and cover versions. Mr. Bieber’s “Sorry” acknowledges crowdsourcing in a different way: It is a dance video, featuring a host of young female performers, and recalls how, on Vine or Instagram or Snapchat, young people everywhere make themselves the stars of their own dance videos. Mr. Bieber isn’t even present. Each of these videos, in its own way, shows an artist deploying the form as a novel means of garnering attention in an increasingly scattered marketplace, using either provocation or participation. That all these approaches are arriving at once suggests a new era of maturity for music video, one in which the biggest stars are also among the biggest innovators. That’s reminiscent of the 1980s and ’90s, the golden era of MTV, when having an awards show to celebrate the artistry of music videos made the most sense. But as MTV began to retreat from playing videos in the early 2000s,   budgets set aside for music videos shrank  —   gone were the Hype Williams extravaganzas, the   Michael Jackson and Madonna event videos. This coincided with the end of the peak CD era  —    —   the internet was beginning to chip away at all that. By the    2000s, the internet  —   and YouTube specifically  —   became the natural home for music videos, though it still existed largely in the shadow of the outlet that was once that sanctuary, MTV. It felt comparably small, and therefore music video felt diminished. But then an interesting thing happened. Music video rescaled as an art form, and innovations began happening at the smaller end, with independent artists, in an attempt to stand out, pushing the form more aggressively than their   peers. Thanks to the relative affordability of   cameras and software for editing and postproduction, developments began to come ever more quickly. Eventually, the major record labels took an interest in the internet as a distribution channel, and even created Vevo, their own   video site. Music video had recaptured the imagination of a mass audience, and some new artists rose to the occasion, like Lady Gaga, whose   “Bad Romance” and “Telephone” videos were premier events. Now it’s not uncommon for the biggest pop stars to have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of monetizable views on a video, and a sense of flushness has returned to the form. YouTube is widely perceived as the most popular online outlet for music  —   it has a reach exponentially greater than cable TV could ever have. The music video, less and less an afterthought, is often embedded in the album release process. Some artists go so far as to make videos for every song they record, and release the videos first, or, in the case of artists like Beyoncé and Frank Ocean, use video as an integral part of the rollout of their music in the form of a “visual album. ” This     of video is now the new normal, and might make for V. M. A. ceremonies  —   this year’s and beyond  —   in which the videos are once again the stars, not the sideshow.",1
25759,Italy Just Handed the Global Economy Another Giant Variable - The New York Times,"Global markets were not lacking in precarious unknowns. Italy just added another. As voters on Sunday emphatically rejected constitutional changes aimed at streamlining government and making it easier to revive a moribund economy, they enhanced concerns that Italy’s banks could spiral into a disaster. They reinvigorated worries about the endurance of the euro currency and broader European economic integration. And they amplified the sense that Europe is a land of disappointing growth, political dysfunction and seething populism. “Existential crisis” had not been on the ballot, but that was essentially the result. The lopsided tally against the reforms  —   nearly 60 percent rejected them  —   prompted the resignation of Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, leaving Europe’s   economy without clear leadership. As world markets absorbed the result, investors soured on Italian banking stocks. Shares in Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which was involved in Italy’s grandest banking fiasco, surrendered 4 percent on Monday on expectations that a private sector rescue devised by Mr. Renzi had been killed. Investors initially pushed down the euro before it recovered. They cut the price of Italian government bonds, lifting the yield  —   a sign that investors will demand greater reward for the heightened risks of lending to Italy. Investors also unloaded Spanish and Portuguese government bonds. The widening spread between   German bonds and those issued by   European countries amounts to a flashing indicator that investors see risks for the southern periphery. These market moves were muted because the results had been anticipated. Indeed, for Europe and the rest of the world, this dynamic was uncomfortably familiar. For nearly a decade, the 19 nations sharing the euro have lurched from one crisis to the next, with no effective fix. A currency designed to unite the adversaries of World War II has instead generated fresh divisions  —   between creditor and borrower Northern Europe and the Mediterranean. In a year in which Britain voted to abandon the European Union and the American electorate selected Donald J. Trump as the next president, Italy offered its own contribution to the global populist insurrection. Against this backdrop, the basic contours of the world economy are now uncertain. The British vote to exit Europe  —   Brexit, in common parlance  —   threatens to cleave the geography of the world’s largest single marketplace. The American elevation of Mr. Trump hands authority over the world’s largest economy to a man who has threatened a trade war with the   China. The fall of Mr. Renzi creates an opening for the populist Five Star Movement, a party that seeks to free Italy of the euro and its strictures on government spending. Even that possibility threatens Europe with trouble. If investors worry that Italy may leave the euro, they will demand greater rewards for continued lending. Those with the greatest debt burdens  —   Greece, Spain and Portugal  —   could see their borrowing costs rise beyond their ability to pay. For now, such grim scenarios appear remote. The referendum maintains the power of the Italian legislature’s upper chamber, a potent check on the Five Star Movement, or any government pursuing radical change. The most immediate consequences fall on the Italian banking system, now choked with some 360 billion euro, or about $385 billion, in suspect debts. Mr. Renzi tried and failed to inject public funds into Monte dei Paschi, the perpetual locus of fears about an   financial conflagration. The European Union, led by Germany, effectively forbade that step, citing new rules barring taxpayer bailouts to limit the temptation of bankers to engage in reckless lending. Mr. Renzi instead forged a plan that has Monte dei Paschi scrambling to secure €5 billion from private investors. “For Monte dei Paschi, it’s going to be extremely hard to close the capital raise by end of the year,” said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. “The political future is so uncertain. ” Most experts assume a caretaker Italian government will wind up seeking permission from European authorities for some form of a   rescue of Monte dei Paschi, while agreeing to wipe out the investments of a thin slice of bondholders. The consensus is that Italy can patch immediate holes in the banking system. But the referendum has destroyed what momentum existed to address the condition that is both cause and effect of the banking problem  —   a dire lack of economic growth. Italy’s banks are stuffed with uncollectable debts in part because the country’s economy is smaller than it was a decade ago. Bad loans on bank balance sheets reflect that millions of people have lost jobs, eliminating spending power, while companies have seen sales evaporate. Mr. Renzi pursued reforms aimed at spurring companies to invest. He made it easier for companies to terminate   workers to eliminate a chief impediment to hiring them in the first place  —   the fear that giving someone a job was akin to adopting them as a dependent forever. He sought to speed civil processes in the notoriously inefficient court system to make it easier for banks to recoup bad debts by collecting collateral. The constitutional changes he sought were aimed at clearing another blockage to reform. They would have trimmed the powers of the upper chamber of the legislature, a place where proposals die. Voters clearly did not trust Mr. Renzi to wield greater power. Now, they will be represented by someone with less power where it matters a great deal: Brussels and Berlin.   nations in Europe have long argued that their burdens would be lighter if they could spend more money to spur faster economic growth. But the European Union  —   anchored by Germany  —   has cited rules limiting the spending of member governments with big debts. Instead, Brussels and Berlin argue, such countries must deliver   structural reforms, stripping away labor protections and trimming pension benefits. In a testament to the severity of this creed, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble effectively threatened to banish Greece from the euro if Athens did not deliver on reforms it promised as a condition of successive European bailouts. “Athens must finally implement the needed reforms,” Mr. Schäuble told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview published on Sunday, a day before eurozone finance ministers convened to court the participation of the International Monetary Fund in the Greek bailout. “If Greece wants to stay in the euro, there is no way around it. ” Mr. Renzi was a rare leader who carried credibility in such quarters. He gained modest relief from European spending strictures in part by pointing at his reforms. “Renzi is the only leader in recent history who has advanced a structural reform agenda,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy. Now, Mr. Renzi is gone, along with his reform trajectory. What is most palpably still here is an Italian economy that is growing anemically, soon to be presided over by a caretaker government with a limited mandate. “What chance does a less effective prime minister overseeing a caretaker government have of getting a hearing in Brussels and Berlin?” Mr. Rahman said. “It’s just not possible. ” Italy has no fuel for growth. It has no clear way to extricate itself  —   or the other parts of the planet connected to money  —   from the perils of its grinding banking crisis. And the one reinforces the other.",1
25762,Ahead Of Tomorrow’s Fed Meeting There Are Some Very Strange Things Happening,"6 Views November 01, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
Ahead of tomorrow’s Fed meeting, there are some very strange things happening. 
By Bill Fleckenstein President Of Fleckenstein Capital October 1 ( King World News ) – Overnight bond markets continued their recent losing ways again last night, with 10-year German bunds now yielding a massive 18 basis points. That doesn’t sound like much, but it is a long way from the -15 bps it yielded a couple of months ago. Meanwhile, world equity markets more or less looked the other way, although they were slightly lower. The early going here saw the market modestly weaker as well, and acting funky enough that I put on a few shorts… IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
Around midday the leakage accelerated somewhat and the market was 0.5% lower by early afternoon. With a couple of hours to go, when I had to leave, the decline was about 0.75% (but it felt like it might accelerate, so check the box scores). Away from stocks, green paper was a bit weaker, led by a bounce in the euro, oil lost 1%, fixed income was a bit lower, and the metals came to life, led by silver, which popped 3% to gold’s 1%. The miners similarly had a pretty strong day, just as they did yesterday. I didn’t note Monday’s action because I was suspicious it might have something to do with end-of-the-month tape painting, but obviously that was not the case. 
Gold Dog, New Tricks Given the fact that the Bank of Japan did nothing new and the Fed is expected to make hawkish comments tomorrow regarding a December rate hike, it was an interesting time for the metals to pop. I’m sure today’s action has a number of people scratching their head as to how this could be. And I have to admit, I thought there was little chance for gold to start moving until we got past tomorrow’s promise from Fed heads to hike rates, assuming the data continues to be, in their words, “strong enough” (a phrase that is naturally open to subjective interpretation on their part). Having said that, I don’t feel there is going to be a hike because I don’t think the stock market or the economy are going to cooperate. 
Make It Stop There is also the wild card of the election next week and despite the mainstream media and the polls suggesting that Trump is a long shot, I think the tally will be much closer and his chance of winning is nontrivial, although certainly not expected. I mention that because, were Trump to win, I think a lot of markets would be put in motion. 
The stock market has been an accident waiting to happen, and considering how much Wall Street seems to be enamored of a Clinton victory, an upset would probably be enough of a catalyst to send the indices tumbling, which by extension would be a positive for gold — and take a rate hike off the table. On the other hand, in the event Hillary wins, I don’t think the stock market could really go up much. 
In any event, I don’t want to get into too much of a discussion about what is liable to happen, as we will have the data in a few days and can decide exactly what to do in the wake of it from a stock market perspective. Besides, a precious metals position can do well under any number of potential scenarios we may see, and they may have already discounted a rate hike, which we probably won’t get. Included below are three questions and answers from the Q&A’s with Bill Fleckenstein. Bonus Q&A Question: If the bond market has “topped”, isn’t it irrelevant who wins the Presidency. In other words the bond market will be in full control and politicians will be late and simply be responding with desperate measures? Answer from Fleck: “ Yes, the President is irrelevant to a large degree versus the bond market.” Question: Dear Bill, Happy Halloween! If you were going to dress as something scary for Halloween would it be– a) deflation, b) a creepy clown, or c) one of the presidential candidates. Of course b) and c) aren’t mutually exclusive, since clowns can be either gender… Answer from Fleck: “ If I was going out to a party, I would dress as Mr. Politically Incorrect, and I’d try to wear a small bit of any/every costume that is deemed to be “offensive,” (i.e. part Chinese, Japanese, black, Arab, gay, trans, Indian, Mexican, angry clown, Hitler, etc.) I am so sick of microagression and related censorship. We have a right to free speech in this country, but there is no right to “not be offended.” People need to get over themselves. We have far bigger problems in this country than being offended.” Question: Yesterday you wrote “as the belief that the central planners have accomplished what they set out to, nothing can go wrong, and the election will go whichever way it needs to for us to live happily ever after.” I think the S&P 500 being flat for 22 months with fits and starts says something doesn’t it? Frustrating for bulls and bears alike. Answer from Fleck: “ Yeah, it does say something, which is, “without QE, the stock market can’t go up.” *** To subscribe to Bill Fleckenstein’s fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE.

25764,Here Are Six ‘Miracle’ Drugs Big Pharma Now Regrets - Truthdig,"Here Are Six ‘Miracle’ Drugs Big Pharma Now Regrets Posted on Oct 29, 2016 
By Martha Rosenberg / AlterNet Shutterstock 
Are you depressed? It may have less to do with your mood than your birth control pills, high blood pressure pills, antibiotics or even anti-hair-loss drug according to new research. New risks have also emerged with popular gastroesophageal reflux disease medicines and even the top-selling painkiller Tylenol. 
There are two reasons the risks associated with popular drugs seem to trail their aggressive promotion. Certainly, as millions use brand name drugs, dangerous side effects and adverse events are seen that did not emerge in much smaller clinical trials. Who knew? But also, as AlterNet has noted before, dangerous side effects that might be considered major drawbacks to prescribing the drugs often emerge only when drugs have gone “off patent” and all their profit potential is realized. For both reasons, drug safety activists recommend waiting five years before taking a “new” drug—until it is not “new” anymore. 
Advertisement 
Here are drugs and drug classes that have raised new concerns. 
1. Proton Pump Inhibitors 
One of Pharma’s most successful gambits has been its proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Nexium (the “Purple Pill”) and Prilosec that reduce stomach acid. To sell the drugs, Pharma aggressively raised “awareness” of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD a rare condition which, over time, can change the lining of the esophagus and lead to cancer. Actually, most PPI users have simple heartburn. Even babies are now given PPIs for “baby reflux” because they spit up 71 times a day—a normal occurrence that has been pathologized. 
The medical establishment has deplored PPI overuse, pointing out that heartburn can exist without esophageal damage and vice verse and calling PPIs “purple crack.” Now it turns out they are right—acid reducers are addictive. “Once a patient has taken a PPI for longer than a few weeks, acid hypersecretion can occur on discontinuation,” says a recent article in Pharmaceutical Journal. “This causes rebound symptoms, and frequently establishes a vicious cycle of drug reinitiation and long-term continuation.” 
Adverse effects of long-term PPI use are well documented from the risks of the dread intestinal infection Clostridium difficile (“C Diff”), bone thinning and fractures and vitamin and mineral deficiencies to chronic kidney disease and heart attacks. Now there is a new reported risk: dementia. 
A study earlier this year in JAMA Neurology of 73,?679 people 75 or older with no dementia and taking PPIs found the patients “had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving PPI.” Other studies have also found a link. 
2. Antibiotics 
AlterNet has frequently written about underreported antibiotic dangers, most recently of the fluoroquinolone class which includes Cipro and Levaquin. Even as the FDA tries to curtail use of antibiotics on the nation’s farms to make animals grow faster (a use which accounts for most U.S. antibiotic sales) drug use on the farm is actually increasing. The FDA’s 2014 Summary Report on Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food Producing Animals reveals that cephalosporin sales increased by 57 percent between 2009 through 2014, sales of antibiotics like clindamycin increased by 150 percent and sales of antibiotics like gentamicin, a dangerous drug class, increased by 36 percent. 
Antibiotics have a probable role in obesity—why wouldn’t they when they add pounds to livestock? In 1974, Navy recruits were given antibiotics to see if they would gain weight, and after only seven weeks, they did. Similar results were seen in children in Guatemala and in babies . But making people fat or encouraging antibiotic resistant microbes like MRSA are the least of the risks, it turns out. 
We now know that the bacteria in our gut, the microbiome, which antibiotics compromise as they kill the “bad” bacteria, are responsible for much more than good digestion. Antibiotics also affect the brain and “influence our mood and temperament,” says food expert Michael Pollan. “If you transplant the gut microbiota of relaxed and adventurous mice into the guts of timid and anxious mice they become less stressed and more adventurous.” Antibiotic-affected microbiomes may also be behind asthma and autoimmune diseases, acne and even autism, say published reports. 
3. Birth Control Pills You know the long list of side effects and warnings at the end of drug ads? Telling you the drug may cause you to bleed to death or have a stroke while you look at images of sunsets and puppies? We have women’s health advocates to thank for the disclosures. Fifty years ago when the Pill first became available, there was no “disclosure.” Women did not know what effects birth control pills would have on their bodies—or even think it was theirright to know—and were supposed to take them anyway.
By 1970, after The Doctors’ Case Against the Pill by Barbara Seaman was published, Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson held hearings about clear links between the Pill and depression, blood clots and decrease in libido cited nowhere on the label. No women were asked to speak at the hearings, moving Alice Wolfson, a co-founder of the National Women’s Health Network, to say, “It must be admitted that women make superb guinea pigs. They don’t cost anything, they feed themselves, they clean their own cages, pay for their own pills, and remunerate the clinical observer. We will no longer tolerate intimidation by white-coated gods antiseptically directing our lives.” 
Why were feminists so angry about a drug that let them control their reproduction? Because the Pill caused 50 additional physiological changes besides stopping pregnancy, some of which were and are life-threatening. Women were told by the the male-dominated medical establishment not to worry their pretty heads about what the drugs were doing to their bodies, while men were spared any responsibility or medical risks. 
Fast-forward to this year, when medical studies again confirmed links between birth control pills and depression. A Danish study of more than a million women found links between birth control pills and depression, especially in young women, and corresponding higher use of antidepressant drugs. 
Women’s health advocates were finally vindicated. “The risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives,” says Cindy Pearson of the National Women’s Health Network. “It’s been reported by women for 50 years.” 
A 2013 book called Sweetening the Pill: or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control might also be vindicated, writes Lara Prendergast. The book was called “a dishonest anti-Pill treatise” because the author “dared to point out that hormonal contraceptives are ranked by the World Health Organization as a class-one carcinogen alongside tobacco and asbestos,” she writes. 
4. Propecia 
Two years ago, AlterNet told readers about Propecia, a popular treatment for male pattern baldness linked to disturbing side effects in men including sexual dysfunction and actual reduction in penis size. At the time, Propecia’s label assured users that sexual side effects “went away in men who stopped taking Propecia”; however, the current label warns about sexual dysfunction like “erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality” that continues after discontinuation of treatment. 
A September study in BMJ found “the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia [hair loss],” but reports of the disturbing side effects abound in medical j ournals and popular magazines. 
“Emerging research and a slew of lawsuits suggest that finasteride may be more dangerous than previously believed, with side effects — inability to orgasm, painful erections, chronic depression, insomnia, brain fog, and suicidal thoughts — that can last long after patients stop taking the pill,” wrote Men’s Journal last year. 
Despite the life-changing side effects, Propecia/finasteride is still aggressively sold with warnings about its use downplayed and hard to find. In fact, “As of Sept. 26, the World Health Organization Program for International Drug Monitoring’s database of adverse drug reactions contained 13,546 finasteride ADRs [adverse drug reactions], including 3,577 sexual function and fertility disorders, 1,526 depressed mood disorders and disturbances, and 67 completed suicides,” writes the Post-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation . 
5. Tylenol 
Tylenol may be one of the most widely used pain relieving drugs in the world but new safety concerns continue to emerge. The risk of liver damage with Tylenol (acetaminophen) that can occur from taking even a slightly higher dose than directed moved Tylenol maker, Johnson & Johnson to increase warnings in 2014. Unintentional acetaminophen overdoses cause as many as 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths per year reported the FDA. 
Soon after the increased warnings, medical journals linked acetaminophen to birth defects in the children of women taking the drug such as poor motor development, behavior problems and language delays. A study in JAMA Pediatrics identified an increased occurrence of ADHD by the age of seven in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. A study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children more likely to have behavior problems and slow motor development by the age of three if their mothers had taken acetaminophen. Not all medical voices concur. Some said the studies were poorly designed or that fevers , for which the mother presumably took acetaminophen, are responsible for the birth defects. 
In recent years, acetaminophen has been found to have psychological and mental effects not before described. The pain reliever may “blunt individuals’ reactivity to a range of negative stimuli in addition to physical pain,” says one study. Another study found acetaminophen reduced the psychological pain caused by social rejection. 
6. Beta Blockers 
One out of three American has high blood pressure and beta-blockers like atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol, propranolol (Inderal), sotalol (Betapace) and timolol (Timoptic) which treat the condition have been linked to depression for many years. 
As early as 1967, the British Medical Journal reported that hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for cardiac arrhythmias experienced a rise in the incidence of depression. Still, it has not been known if patients’ depressions were caused by the actual actions of beta blockers (like blocking the effects of epinephrine/adrenaline and slowing heart rate) or mood conditions associated with the diseases for which beta blockers are prescribed such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
Now, the evidence is tipping toward the drugs. An October study in the journal Hypertension found that beta blockers “may have a role in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders” and increased hospital admissions for mood disorders. A “bidirectional relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease” exists, says the study , “because of the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie both conditions.” 
“There is a lot of data that depression and cardiovascular disease are related ... but current hypertensive practices do not consider depression,” said the study’s lead author Sandosh Padmanabhan. “There could be some people who are predisposed to depression who we should not be giving these drugs.”

The next step toward his inauguration is Monday’s vote by the Electoral College, a body created early in the country’s history as a compromise between those who wanted Congress to choose the president and those who favored a popular vote. It may not be the usual rubber stamp: At least one elector has said he will buck his party and not vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump trails in the popular vote by more than 2. 5 million votes, the   margin among winning candidates since 1824. _____ • The removal of residents in Aleppo and nearby villages proceeded tenuously after rebels set fire to several buses.

25766,Janet Yellen Speech Indicates Fed Will Rethink Interest-Rate Plans - The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA  —   The Federal Reserve, mindful of unexpectedly weak job growth last month, has abandoned hope of raising interest rates at its next meeting in June, but Fed officials say they are still thinking seriously about raising rates in July or September. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, said a few weeks ago that she expected the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate “in the coming months,” but she omitted those words from a Monday speech, indicating the reported weakness of job creation in May has caused the Fed to rethink its plans. Still, Ms. Yellen delivered a generally upbeat assessment of economic conditions. While describing the May jobs report as “concerning,” she also emphasized that it was just one piece of data and that other economic indicators, including wage growth, paint a considerably brighter picture. “I see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones,” she told the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia. Investors have all but written off the chances the Fed will increase rates at its next meeting on June 14 and 15, and Ms. Yellen did not try to change their minds. Her speech was the last public appearance by a Fed official before the meeting. But she added that she still expected economic growth  —   and she still expected rate increases. “If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate,” she said. Some Fed officials have delivered a similar message since the May report. Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, has sounded relatively confident in recent months, indicating that the economy was ready for a rate increase. In Stockholm on Saturday, she said that the May jobs report, while disappointing, had not changed her overall economic assessment. Others have emphasized that there is no reason to rush, suggesting that the Fed should wait for stronger data before moving to raise rates. “There would appear to be an advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence,” Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said in a speech on Friday. In her judgment, Ms. Brainard said, the risks of moving too soon significantly exceeded the dangers of waiting a little too long. Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor who shares Ms. Brainard’s caution, said on Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg that he was still looking for “an affirmative reason to move. ” The government estimated last week that the economy added 38, 000 jobs in May, well below market expectations and the pace of hiring so far this year. The Fed entered the year predicting quarterly rate increases, only to back away from a first increase in March when the economy showed unexpected signs of weakness. Fed officials in recent weeks insisted they were thinking about raising rates in June. Now it seems that too has passed. Ms. Yellen did not offer a new plan, and that was intentional. “I know market participants really want to know exactly what’s going to happen,” she said at one point. “There is, as I said about 18 times, no preset plan. ” She devoted much of her speech to the economic uncertainties confronting the Fed. Among them, she numbered the inconsistency of recent economic data and Britain’s coming referendum on whether to remain in the European Union. She said a breakup would be economically disruptive. “The uncertainties are sizable, and progress toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will depend on how these uncertainties evolve,” she said. But reasons for optimism were also on display Monday. After her speech, Ms. Yellen met with workers at a   program in West Philadelphia. During her first year as Fed chairwoman, round tables with workers in Chicago and Chelsea, Mass. brought together many attendees who were struggling to find jobs. The tone of Monday’s round table was notably more upbeat  —   the seven people who met with Ms. Yellen all had jobs or, if they were in training programs, were optimistic about finding steady work. Mark Gay spent nearly two years looking for   work before he found a job with a landscaping business run by the University City District, the nonprofit group that hosted the meeting. Asked whether life was improving for people in his West Philadelphia neighborhood, he paused before answering. “I would have to agree,” he said. “Yes, a lot of people in my community have gained employment since 2012. ” Sarah Davis, director of development for University City District, says its   program has about 110 graduates a year. She said the percentage of those finding jobs has climbed steadily over the last five years to about 95 percent, and demand from potential employers now exceeds the supply of workers the program can offer. “We’re getting daily calls from potential employer partners,” Ms. Davis said. Yet Ms. Yellen noted in her speech that unemployment remained widespread among minorities and   people. There were also signs the labor market is no longer healing as quickly. The economy has added 125, 000 jobs per month this year, compared with a monthly average of 229, 000 last year. The Fed’s   labor market conditions index, devised to summarize a wide range of labor market data, has declined each month since the Fed raised interest rates in December. “The Fed’s current course is driven not by the state of the economy, but by a desire to get interest rates and its balance sheet back to what is considered normal,” Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wrote in a Bloomberg opinion piece last week criticizing the Fed’s desire to raise rates. Ms. Yellen responded indirectly to that critique during a    session after her speech on Monday. She said the Fed was focused on its mandates of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation. Raising rates was not an end but a means, she said. She noted that the economy should benefit from a virtuous loop of increased employment and rising incomes. “If the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown resulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth should pick up and support further gains in income,” Ms. Yellen said. On the other hand, she noted, “the less favorable possibility” was that a slowdown in corporate investment had translated into a slowdown in job growth. How long will it take to tell the difference? On Monday, Ms. Yellen wasn’t offering any predictions. “My colleagues and I will be wrestling with these and other related questions going forward,” she said.",1
25769,Now Hillary Makes Conspiracy Theory Credible: 50% Believe,"Now Hillary Makes Conspiracy Theory Credible: 50% Believe   28, 2016 
Half Of Americans Believe 9/11 Conspiracy Theories … “The United States is a strongly conspiratorial society.” … A majority of Americans believe that the government is concealing information about the 9/11 attacks, one new survey suggests. And that’s not the only conspiracy theory believed by a wide swath of Americans: Around 40 percent believe the government is hiding information about aliens, the John F. Kennedy assassination and global warming. – The Huffington Post 
Before, those who believed in 9/11 conspiracy theories hovered around 20-30 percent according to the mainstream media. Now it’s up to 50 percent, according to this article. 
Hell, it’s probably more like 60-70 percent anyway. There is perhaps a hard core of 30 percent of people living in the US who will likely never acknowledge anything wrong with the system or people in power. 
But for most citizens, we’ve long suggested the current election is destroying the credibility of the ruling classes and their facilities. 
Whatever in government that was supposed to be credible, from the IRS, to the FBI, to the Justice Dept., Congress and the presidency itself, has been visibly damaged by Hillary’s election campaign. 
You’d have to be virtually blind – or a staunch partisan of a mythical “USA”– not to notice that the Democratic front-runner has committed actions for which anyone else would have been significantly punished. 
And not just Hillary of course but those surrounding her including Bill Clinton and the Foundation that allows them to trade political favors for cash. 
Then there’s the mainstream media. The media has investigated little or none of the malfeasance and worse (murders?) surrounding the Clintons, and thus newspapers, magazines and TV, already deprived of viewers and ad revenue, have been further damaged by an obvious, ongoing lack of credibility. 
More: 
Conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination abound, and scientists say these ideas have become embedded in the very culture surrounding his death, with heaps of TV shows, books and movies on them. 
“We found clear evidence that the United States is a strongly conspiratorial society,” study lead author Christopher Bader, a sociologist at Chapman University in California, said in a statement. 
In order to denigrate suspicion of the government, the study suggests that people’s views regarding conspiracies have to do with their own emotional makeup. In other words, “paranoid” people believe in “conspiracies.” 
This canard worked better when the number of those voicing conspiracy theories was in the single digits, according to surveys. When half or more than half of the public begins to believe in them, something else is going on. 
Neither the article nor the study (presumably) acknowledges that the CIA came up with the idea of calling people “conspiracy theorists” if they advance theories that the US government is corrupt and secretly tyrannical. 
The conduct of this past campaign and the Clinton’s evident criminality has reinforced all that is wrong with the US in the views of many and, additionally, has made it clear that even the deepest suspicions of how the US operates are justified. 
We can come away with two realizations from this. 
The first is that despite Hillary’s possible election, the US as a valid and valuable entity is shattered in the eyes of many. This is actually a good development in our view given that the US (and its British controllers) has not been positive for freedom or peace in the world at least since the end of the Civil War. 
The second conclusion, which is not a popular one but which we have voiced before, is that the disaffection of the American public was SUPPOSED to be heightened by the Hillary campaign. 
The idea here is that chaos and paranoia is supposed to be endlessly increased until the US, like other nation-states, virtually shatters and more aggressive globalism can be introduced in the wake of the disintegration. 
Western nation-states currently have strong cultures. These cultures need to be torn down if true globalization is to be introduced. 
The banking elites of this world, mostly located in the City of London, are determined to introduce this chaos, it seems. In Europe chaos is mounting thanks to the introduction of the artificial “immigration crisis.” 
In the US, Hillary has served in the place of immigration, cracking the US culture as thoroughly as millions of young Muslim males. Next on the agenda? Possible economic collapse and “world-war” style military activities. 
Conclusion: Yes, it sounds grim … and even conspiratorial. But there is much you can do to secure your safety and prosperity – and that of your family’s and even your community’s. You have to realize the civil society you believe in is vanishing (or never existed). And you have to act.",1
25771,North Carolina Restroom Law Becomes a Central Election Issue - The New York Times,"HIGH POINT, N. C.  —   Parrish Clodfelter, a    retiree who lives on a central North Carolina farm, professes opinions about transgender people that might get him fired if he worked for a multinational corporation, though for many here, they constitute simple country wisdom. “A man wants to change to a woman, he’s got a mental problem,” Mr. Clodfelter said on Wednesday over lunch at Spiro’s Family Restaurant, where posters by the door advertised classes on carrying concealed weapons and a “Hillbilly Sunday” Pentecostal church service. But Mr. Clodfelter has a different kind of problem. As a longtime Republican, he wants to support Pat McCrory, North Carolina’s Republican governor, in his   bid. At the same time, he is worried about the boycotts and lost jobs resulting from the law the governor signed in March that limits transgender bathroom access and eliminates antidiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people. If the backlash continues, Mr. Clodfelter said, he will consider voting for Mr. McCrory’s Democratic opponent, Roy Cooper, who supports the law’s repeal. “I’m afraid if they don’t change it,” he said, “it’ll hurt the state. ” Even before the law tapped into a national debate about transgender rights, privacy and political correctness, North Carolina, the rare Southern state that is evenly split between liberals and conservatives, was considered to be up for grabs in the November presidential race, particularly if Donald J. Trump tops the Republican ticket. Now the law, and the backlash against it, have introduced a different kind of volatile energy to state politics here, roiling a governor’s race that could be the nation’s most competitive. It is also affecting other crucial contests, including that of Senator Richard Burr, who hopes to fend off a vigorous Democratic challenge from Deborah K. Ross, a former State House member and former state director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Last week, Mr. Burr, who has defended the law, came under attack from Democrats who have leapt at the chance to transform a cultural issue into an economic one, as the state has suffered the retreat of protesting companies, including PayPal, which canceled a plan to bring more than 400 jobs to Charlotte. On Thursday, the N. B. A. commissioner, Adam Silver, said the league would move its 2017   Game from Charlotte if the law were not changed. Thus far, the uproar may be doing the most harm to Mr. McCrory, an affable former mayor of Charlotte who has struggled, since taking office in 2013, to maintain his reputation as a moderate in the face of a   legislature that is considerably more conservative than he is. An Elon University poll conducted from April 10 to 15 showed Mr. Cooper, the state’s longtime attorney general, leading Mr. McCrory 48 percent to 42 percent among registered voters. It was Mr. Cooper’s largest lead in the five polls that Elon has conducted in the last year. But November is a long way off, and social issues reverberate in complex ways in a state that has a reputation for moderation but also produced Jesse Helms, the   United States senator. Carter Wrenn, a longtime political strategist who worked with Mr. Helms, said Democrats had been winning arguments over the law of late. But he said Republicans would have time to make the case to voters that the law helps ensure privacy and security in public restrooms. “We’re not sure how this is all going to turn out,” Mr. Wrenn said. The issue is particularly troublesome for Mr. McCrory. Exit polls from 2012 show that he received the support of 49 percent of voters who described themselves as moderate and 19 percent of   liberals. Mr. McCrory, 59, last week could barely contain his irritation that the law had taken center stage in the election, siphoning attention from his central message: that he has been a wise steward of the economy who had engineered what he and his team have branded the “Carolina Comeback. ” This hornet’s nest, he argued, was first kicked not by him, but by the Democratic City Council in Charlotte, which passed a nondiscrimination ordinance in February allowing transgender people to use men’s or women’s bathrooms. Before it passed, he said, he emailed the Council to warn it that if it changed “basic restroom and locker room norms,” he would be forced to support a state law overriding them. On Thursday, he said he suspected that the entire matter had been orchestrated by Democrats and the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, to give Democrats an advantage in a tight governor’s race. The backlash, he said, has allowed for no dialogue on “a very complex issue. ” Dissenters to the   position, he said, were being intimidated. Mr. McCrory used the word “Orwellian” twice. “You’ve got to be politically naïve if you think this is not coordinated by a very effective  —   a very effective  —   group,” he said. Mr. McCrory preferred to talk about the improved state of the economy since he took over from Gov. Beverly Perdue, a Democrat. She had declined to seek   after a single term in which North Carolina struggled through the recession and in which she clashed over tax policy with a legislature that Republicans won full control of in 2010. The state’s comeback, Mr. McCrory argues, was bolstered by his ability to deliver $4. 4 billion in tax relief, including what his campaign literature describes as “one of the largest income tax cuts in state history. ” “I inherited a broken government and a broken economy,” he said. “So, we were the   unemployment rate in the country when I came into office: 9. 4 percent unemployment. And we’ve had one of the biggest rebounds in the United States of America. ” Unemployment in the state is now 5. 5 percent. At a cafe in Raleigh last week, Mr. Cooper, who has served as attorney general since 2001, argued that the Carolina Comeback was a myth, saying that there had been an “overall improvement in the economy across the country. ” “It’s not a Carolina Comeback for everyday working people,” he said. “Most people are working longer, and harder, and for less money than they did before the recession. ” Mr. Cooper, 58, said his favorite North Carolina governor was Jim Hunt, the Democrat who served two stints in office beginning in 1977 and represents, to many liberals here, a homegrown progressivism that struck a balance between corporate interests and investments in the public good, especially public education. Mr. Cooper has criticized Mr. McCrory for not expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. On Thursday, he criticized the   income tax Mr. McCrory instituted in 2013 as disproportionately favoring the rich. The law on gender and restrooms, Mr. Cooper said, “is a discrimination issue and an economic issue, and, particularly, you have Governor McCrory trying a political ploy that blew up, and is now hurting people and our economy. ”",1
25773,"Bob Dylan, the Musician: America’s Great One-Man Songbook - The New York Times","What took them so long? That’s the only question for the Nobel committee that finally chose Bob Dylan to receive the Nobel Prize in  Literature this year. It’s not as if some new work suddenly clinched the deal. Mr. Dylan has been recognized by anyone who cares about words  —   not to mention music  —   since the 1960s, when he almost immediately earned an adjective as his own literary and musical school: Dylanesque. His most recent album of his own songs was “Tempest,” back in 2012 since then he has been paying tribute to the   Great American Songbook of   pop, like “Shadows in the Night,” his 2015 album of songs Frank Sinatra had sung. [ Bob Dylan wins the Nobel Prize in Literature| Our book critic on Bob Dylan, the writer ] But there’s no question that Mr. Dylan has created a great American songbook of his own: an e pluribus unum of   and   narrative and imagistic, erudite and earthy, romantic and cutting, devout and iconoclastic,   and oracular, personal and universal, compassionate and pitiless. His example has taught writers of all sorts  —   not merely poets and novelists  —   about strategies of both pinpoint clarity and anyone’  free association, of telegraphic brevity and ambiguous, kaleidoscopic moods. A longtime stumbling block for Mr. Dylan’s literary recognition  —   which eventually didn’t matter to the Pulitzers (2008) or the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2013) and now to the Nobels  —   has been that he is a songwriter, so his words are best heard with his music. Another is that his voluminous output includes some clinkers and throwaways. Both are absolutely true, and so what? Mr. Dylan’s good stuff, in all its abundance, is the equal  —   and envy  —   of countless writers who work strictly on the page. He’s a grandmaster of verbal strategies. He can tell stories in a cascade of images, like “Tangled Up in Blue” he can come at an elusive emotion from all sides and then twist the knife, as he does in “Desolation Row” he can be the kindliest of confidants, as he is in “To Make You Feel My Love” and “Forever Young” or he can be the most savage of adversaries, as in “Positively 4th Street” or “Pay in Blood. ” As much as any literary figure to emerge in the 20th century, he has written words that resonate everywhere: quoted by revolutionaries and presidents, hurled by protesters, studied by scholars and taken to heart in countless private moments: thoughts like “When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. ” That line, like so much of Mr. Dylan’s work, speaks to the marginalized: to underdogs, outsiders, misfits. “To live outside the law,” he advises, “You must be honest. ” Like many an academically beloved poet  —   say, Ezra Pound or T. S. Eliot  —   Mr. Dylan has always placed himself on a literary continuum where allusions focus and amplify meaning. But half a century ago, when guardians of culture were diligently policing boundaries between the purportedly high and low, Mr. Dylan drew his allusions not only from Western literature but also from the blues and the news, gleefully knocking their heads together in “Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again,” he put Shakespeare in the alley. He pointed directly toward some of his sources: Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, Arthur Rimbaud, the Bible, the Beats and, above all, the anonymous writers and transmitters of folk songs who told the stories they had to tell. He gathered and implied countless others, making him a postmodern pioneer and, eventually, something like a   internet. Mr. Dylan soon emerged as a fountainhead of allusions and aphorisms himself  —   he’s got more   life lessons than Aesop. Behind his sunglasses, slinging his electric guitar, he became a writer other writers would build upon until, generations later, his wild innovations were just part of an American heritage. It’s a commonplace  —   but a true one  —   that there’s a Dylan line for every occasion, and another commonplace that a stray line of an old Dylan song can suddenly nail a situation decades after it was written: Through the years, his riddles have become prophecies. Meanwhile, the fact that Mr. Dylan’s words are written to be sung, that they are physical emanations of breath and pitch and articulation, often adds an additional discipline: the rigorous edit that is built into an oral tradition. There’s no place for parentheses, footnotes or explanations  —   but there are, of course, rhymes. Lines like these, from “Isis” (written with Jacques Levy) combine the    tone of film noir with the rigor of a mathematical proof: Mr. Dylan’s songs do get more mileage, and more shades of meaning, with every inflection he brings to them onstage on his   tour. He can sharpen their barbs, tease out their mixed emotions and infuse them with passion or irony, constantly rescuing them from their own familiarity  —   constantly recharging his reputation, as if he hadn’t already earned it all. But amid the vast repertoire that Mr. Dylan has written, any song has to be strong, almost monumental, to deserve a place in a set list at all. Mr. Dylan’s place in literature  —   the way he drew his very individual,   radicalism from folk music’s memory, its imaginative preservation of tradition  —   was clear long before the literary establishment deigned to recognize him. The Nobel doesn’t have to certify Mr. Dylan half a century of literature and songwriting have heard him and responded. Long before the prizes started rolling in, he had already rewired our minds. Still, better late than never.",1
25776,"Gaza Is Outwardly Rebuilding, but Inwardly Fearful - The New York Times","BEIT HANOUN, Gaza Strip  —   In her new home, finally finished after she lived two years in a trailer across a dirt road, Samaher   40, showed a video on her cellphone of a cute preschooler: her son Majdi. He was singing: “I am a son of Palestine, I have a right and a cause   …     Even if they shoot me and I die as a martyr, I will not forget the cause. ” Majdi, who was 6, lived through two Gazan wars, though his old family house was toppled by bulldozers in the 2014 fighting with Israel. But the day after he ended kindergarten last year, he caught his hula hoop in a metal door in the trailer. The door was heavy, the frame shoddy. It fell on him and crushed his skull, killing him. “Something is missing,” his mother said eight months later, in the living room of her house, built on the   plot of the old one. “You asked me if this is better. Yes, it’s better. But I’m missing him. His bedroom was waiting for him. ” So it is in Gaza, outwardly rebuilding and moving on from war, inwardly far from recovered. Gaza seems at a loss for what might be next. After so many years of isolation, residents of Gaza find themselves ever further from Palestinians in the West Bank, their future clouded by rising doubts that they could ever unite and work toward a lasting peace. Two million tons of rubble have been cleared  —   about a ton for each person who lives in this cramped coastal strip.   of the 160, 000 damaged homes have been rebuilt, as have half of the 11, 000 that were destroyed. Roads are better, travel faster. People gawk at their first real mall, with a food court and 12 escalators, both rarities in Gaza. But they are not buying much. Unemployment is high, especially among the many young people graduating from college. In all, 50, 000 people remain displaced. Electricity and water supplies are still near crisis levels. Hamas, which governs Gaza, elected a new   leader. Tunnel building goes on (and, presumably, so does the construction and smuggling of weapons). On the Israeli side, the political right talks of a new war in the spring over Hamas’s rearming and expresses a desire to inflict a decisive blow. As has been the case for a decade, the strip remains encircled. Israel tightly controls most going in and out: food, building supplies, people. Two children died recently for lack of drugs or medical access, one of cancer, the other of a heart problem. “The blockade of Gaza is something I can compare to the Middle Ages and the besieged castle that can fall at any moment,” said Dr. Fadel Ashour, a psychiatrist in Gaza since 1994. “People in Gaza are not satisfied with who governs this castle. They lack the tools to change it. They live with armed militias, and the institutions are not clear as they are in the West Bank. They know they are paying a price for something they don’t want. Or deserve. This increases their depression and hopelessness. ” It is unclear how the flickers of change elsewhere in the   conflict will ripple to Gaza, which is surrounded by Israel on two sides, by Egypt to the southwest and by the Mediterranean. With President Trump in office in the United States, Israel’s right seems to feel empowered and is likely to push more settlements in the West Bank, even to toy with annexation, despite Mr. Trump’s call to slow the pace. The Palestinian Authority, which has wide backing in the West, seems to be looking abroad for ways to push its immediate future, including persuading the world to recognize a state of Palestine, threatening action in the United Nations and encouraging Israeli boycotts. Leaders of Hamas, considered a terrorist group by the United States and by many other countries, do not have the same backing from the West. Interviews with political and business leaders, academics and ordinary people can divine only a basic strategy: improve the lives of frustrated residents as its leaders put off as long as possible what they see as the next inevitable war, then fight when it happens. (Life could be better, Hamas’s critics contend, if the group spent less on war preparations.) Mahmoud Zahar, a senior Hamas official, said that with years of failed talks, settlements expanding across the West Bank and Mr. Trump’s apparent ambivalence about a Palestinian state, “You have two options: either to cooperate with the occupation or the resistance. There is no option,” he said. “Where is the   solution?” Interviews make it clear that there is a growing distance between Gaza and the West Bank  —   a central reason cited by Israelis for the impossibility of negotiations. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and took control of Gaza in 2007. “Now, Gaza is something and the West Bank is something else,” said Ibrahim   a columnist for the   news outlet Al Risala. “It’s a fact. You can’t connect the two realities. You will get lost. Things have changed. ” Mr. Madhoun and several others raised a possibility, a very long shot, one that could conceivably be acceptable to Israel’s far right: Someday Gaza  —   with defined borders, no Israeli occupation and no settlers  —   could become the basis for a Palestinian state as settlements gnaw away at the West Bank. “If there is going to be a Palestinian state, it’s going to be Gaza,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of political science at   University in Gaza. “Politically speaking, it’s not right. But this is what’s coming. ” Otherwise, he said, “I don’t think there is a grand strategy where Gaza is in 10 years or 20 years. I know Hamas will never want to give up Gaza as long as it is capable of keeping control. ” Residents say they are focusing on getting by. Industrious and, for the most part, educated, they have cleared and rebuilt to the point that in places it is hard to tell there have been three wars in six years. One giveaway is that the concrete on the houses is fresh dark gray, rather than   and weathered. Qatar and Saudi Arabia have underwritten minicities, as caravans and tents slowly empty. The Islamic University has patched the two buildings bombed in two wars and, with great effort, installed an impressive array of 450 solar panels on the science building, even though there is a fear the panels and the building might make a big target in the next war. Capital Mall opened in January, with four floors of upscale shops. One woman lifted her niqab briefly for a photo in front of a Valentine’s Day flower display. Another posed for her husband, who is in an Israeli jail. “I feel happy here,” Sana Shanghan, 50, said, visiting with some of her 13 children. “Here, I feel I’m outside Gaza. I forget about Gaza’s problems. ” The feeling was similar inside the steamy domes of Hamam   Gaza’s only remaining bathhouse, heated with olive wood and, its owners say, predating Islam’s arrival over a millennium ago. “People are tired, kids and old people,” said Salim Abdullah   66, who runs the house for his family. “More and more come here for psychological support. ” He added: “There is no progress. It’s just survival. ” Mona Ghalayini is betting on more than just survival. One of Gaza’s few businesswomen, Ms. Ghalayini, 46, has built a small empire that began with a   shop in 2003. For most people in Gaza, the sea is simply a place where fishermen work waters constricted by Israeli patrol boats. But she sees potential in the current stability, recently buying two seaside hotels. “We have brains,” she said, inhaling from a shisha on the patio of one of her hotels. “We have smart people. We can survive, even with the blockade. But we need connection. We don’t want isolation. ” Tourism is the future, she said. Then she reconsidered. “Who visits Gaza?” she asked. “No one. ”",1
25777,What Can Be Gleaned From Trump’s Allegations of Wiretapping - The New York Times,"President Trump’s claim on Twitter early Saturday that he had “just found out” that “President Obama was tapping my phones in October,” an accusation for which he offered no evidence, has set off another spasm surrounding his young administration. On Sunday, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said the administration was asking Congress to investigate the president’s allegation. There is ample reason for caution because Mr. Trump has a history of making   and politically explosive claims that have no basis in fact. As things stand, a plausible explanation is that Mr. Trump was merely riffing off a March 3 article on the   website Breitbart. com. It laid out a theory circulating in some conservative circles that President Barack Obama sought to sabotage Mr. Trump through surveillance. The episode has heightened interest in several related surveillance issues. Can a president order the wiretapping of an American? Not legally. There are two lawful ways that allow government officials to target people in the United States for surveillance and to collect the contents of their phone calls and emails: criminal wiretaps, called “Title III” warrants, and national security wiretaps, called Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, orders. Both types of wiretapping are ordered by federal judges, after applications from the Justice Department. If there was a wiretap order targeting Mr. Trump or his associates, what would that mean? If it was a criminal wiretap, it would mean that the Justice Department had gathered sufficient evidence to convince a federal judge that someone using the phone number or email address probably committed a serious crime. If it was a national security wiretap, it would mean a federal judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had a basis to believe the target was probably an agent of a foreign power, like Russia. Could a judge have approved tapping something at Trump Tower for another reason? Yes. For example, FISA orders have two parts. After determining that there is probable cause to believe that the target is a foreign agent, a judge also has to approve directing surveillance at a particular “facility,” like a phone line or an email address, that the target is probably using to communicate. So in theory, if there was reason to believe that some other lawful target was communicating from Trump Tower, a judge could have authorized surveillance at a facility there for that reason. What about the computer server registered to Trump Tower? Several news media outlets have reported that investigators last year were puzzled by data transmissions between a computer server registered to Trump Tower and a computer server associated with a Russian bank. Although Mr. Trump on Twitter talked about his “phones,” in theory a judge might determine that the computer address of the server was a facility being used by a foreign power, Russia, to communicate, and authorize surveillance of it. Isn’t there a report about an October surveillance court order involving that server? Yes. The Breitbart story relied heavily on a Nov. 7 article by a British writer on the news and opinion website HeatStreet. It claimed that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had approved a “warrant” in October in connection with activity between Russian banks and the server, which it said  —   and Breitbart repeated  —   was in Trump Tower. It further stated that “it is thought in the intelligence community” that this purported warrant permitted the collection of emails and other communications of Americans connected to the server investigation, which “thus covers Donald Trump. ” As things stand, there are reasons to be skeptical. HeatStreet had vague sourcing  —   two “sources with links to the counterintelligence community”  —   and it does not regularly publish investigative stories about American intelligence or law enforcement operations. To date, reporters for The New York Times with demonstrated sources in that world have been unable to corroborate that the court issued any such order. (Computer specialists have also pointed out that the server in question does not appear to be located in Trump Tower.) On Sunday, James Clapper, who was the director of national intelligence until Jan. 20, denied to NBC News that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had approved monitoring at Trump Tower. What about wiretapping Michael Flynn’s calls with the Russian ambassador? In a related matter, some conservatives have raised alarms about why the government eavesdropped on the   phone calls about sanctions between the Russian ambassador and Michael Flynn, who resigned last month as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. But national security specialists say it is routine that counterintelligence officials would monitor the Russian ambassador, who is a clearly an agent of a foreign power, and so would “incidentally” pick up Mr. Flynn, too. The rules generally require officials to “minimize” the privacy intrusion by masking the names and data of incidentally intercepted Americans before sharing reports or transcripts of those calls more widely within the government. However, there is an exception if the conversation constituted foreign intelligence and the American’s identity is necessary to understand its significance, as would be the case with Mr. Flynn’s discussion of sanctions. Did Obama loosen rules for sharing surveillance? Yes. In January, the Obama administration changed the rules governing how the National Security Agency may share raw surveillance it intercepts abroad, where the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does not apply and the agency may vacuum up private communications in bulk. Previously, only analysts at the agency were permitted to search through the raw trove of this information, applying “minimization” rules to information about Americans before sharing anything more widely in the government. Now, analysts from the other 16 intelligence agencies  —   including the F. B. I.  —   can sift through certain streams of raw intercepts themselves, applying “minimization” rules afterward. Some conservative commentators, like Fox News’s Sean Hannity, have floated the theory that news media leaks about contacts between people affiliated with Mr. Trump and Russians may be attributable to this change, asking why Mr. Obama opened the door to many more officials across the government having access to raw National Security Agency intercepts. Several factors complicate that insinuation. The change did not affect collection on American soil under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which several agencies were already able to share in raw form. Moreover, the recent change had been in the works for years. President George W. Bush set it in motion in 2008, and the bureaucratic deliberations were well developed long before it became clear that Mr. Trump would become president.",1
25778,How ‘Toni Erdmann’ Became an Unexpected Comedy - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   The German director Maren Ade’s breakout film, “Toni Erdmann,” has won over audiences and racked up awards across Europe. An uncharacterizable   story that’s also about neoliberal economic reforms in Romania and the clash between the generation of 1968 and its capitalist children, the film is exceptional for another reason: It’s hilarious. Germany has generally not been known for exporting comedies  —   and, to outsiders, has a perhaps undeserved reputation for humorlessness  —   but “Toni Erdmann,” which has been sold around the world, upends that. “I said to my producer, ‘I’m sorry, this will not be a comedy, this will be a very long and sad film,’” Ms. Ade said in a recent interview. “But we were very happy that the comic aspect came out while editing. ” The film, which opened recently in New York, has been loved by critics since its debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May. It won no prizes there but recently made the shortlist for the   Academy Award, has been nominated for a Golden Globe, and won every top prize at the European Film Awards. (The New York Times’s chief film critics, A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, included it in their year’s best lists.) It tells the story of Ines (Sandra Hüller) a   workaholic German management consultant posted to Bucharest, who receives an unexpected visit from her father, Winfried (Peter Simonischek) a music teacher and practical joker who eventually assumes the persona of “Toni Erdmann,” a life coach, and deploys a wig, fake teeth and whoopee cushions in a complex subterfuge to bring Ines back to her old self. In Germany, where “Toni Erdmann” has been a   success for an   film, Ms. Ade (pronounced  ) 40, is seen as an outlier whose sui generis vision doesn’t fit into any established comic traditions. She herself has said that her inspirations include the American comic Andy Kaufman, as well as the Hollywood films of Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder, and the Berlin theater troupe Gob Squad. “In Germany, mainstream comedies are rather vulgar,” said Katja Nicodemus, the film critic at Die Zeit, a German weekly. “Maren Ade, for me, is closer to Wilder and Lubitsch than to contemporary German comedy because she’s closer to that deep humanism  —   the masquerades, the salaciousness, the wit, the social critique of those comedies, in a subconscious way. ” “For me, what makes the film so exceptional is that it’s a tragedy, where in this tragedy the father plays the comedy,” Ms. Nicodemus added. While most German comedies tend toward   slapstick humor, “Toni Erdmann,” which is 162 minutes long, makes use of repetition and time, drawing out awkward moments to the point of comic discomfort. The film’s kooky humor stands in contrast to Germany’s top box office hit of the year, “Welcome to the Hartmanns,” a mainstream comedy about a wealthy Bavarian family adopting a Nigerian refugee  —   touching on a   issue in Germany, where an influx of migrants has been testing society and the political establishment. Written and directed by Simon Verhoeven, that film has received mixed reviews (as well as criticism for posters that omitted Eric Kabongo, who plays the Nigerian) but it has also been praised for pulling off a complex feat. Mr. Verhoeven “undertakes something that is very rarely achieved in German cinema,” Wolfgang Höbel wrote in Der Spiegel. “He treats as uproarious entertainment a political and social conflict that has split the country into two somewhat irreconcilable camps: the   and those who are enemies of Angela Merkel’s ‘We can do this’ slogan,” Mr. Höbel added, referring to the statement by Ms. Merkel, the German chancellor, that Germany could handle the refugees. In an interview, Mr. Verhoeven agreed that his film was critical of Ms. Merkel. “It definitely is, because I am critical of her,” he said, “not so much because I’m critical of the basic direction that she led the country in, but I was in so many refugee homes, I saw how much people were struggling and how many people tried to help refugees, but there wasn’t a master plan. There wasn’t a vision of how it’s going to work. ” “Welcome to the Hartmanns” has not received distribution overseas yet, and it’s rare for a German comedy to find international success. Those that have include Tom Tykwer’s 1999 hit, “Run, Lola, Run,” which isn’t, strictly speaking, a comedy Sandra Nettelbeck’s 2002 romantic comedy, “Mostly Martha,” which was later remade by Hollywood with Catherine Zeta Jones and Wolfgang Becker’s 2004 “Good Bye, Lenin!” Ms. Ade is the first director in what has been called the Berlin School  —   a loose affiliation including Christian Petzold and other filmmakers who came of age in the 1990s and make closely observed dramas  —   to delve into comedy. One of the great comic moments in “Toni Erdmann” is a party scene in which Ines, on the spur of the moment, transforms a “team building” brunch into what she calls “a naked party”  —   stripping off her clothes and telling her guests, including her boss, to get naked, too. “Standing in a bright room naked is really the worst thing that can happen to you,” Ms. Ade said. “That was really courageous. I had a feeling the character is at a point where it’s almost physically not possible for her to put on her clothes and go into that role again. ” She added: “This nakedness doesn’t lower her status. She discovers while doing this that it raises her status it makes her independent again. ” While “Welcome to the Hartmanns” directly tackles a tough contemporary issue, “Toni Erdmann” is also slyly political, about the differences between those in Winfried’s generation, who came of age in the ’60s and rebelled against parents from the Nazi era, and those of Ines’s generation, who grew up in a   War capitalistic society. “They’re very political they raised their children with a lot of human values,” Ms. Ade said of Winfried’s generation. “He wanted her to be free,  . They believe in a world without borders. Then he’s confronted with things turned into the opposite. ” In using comedy, the film takes a new approach to German history. “The big myth in German cinema is that you have to wear a Nazi uniform to talk about the past, and it’s more complicated,” said Ms. Nicodemus, the Die Zeit film critic. “Toni” also represents a change from the German films that normally appear on the international festival circuit: works by directors from the 1968 generation, including Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders. “When the international film community thinks about German films, there are these old big ’68 moviemaker heroes, and they stand for a certain seriousness and dealing with historic issues in Germany,” said Tobias Kniebe, the chief film critic at Süddeutsche Zeitung, a daily in Munich. Ms. Ade’s film “kind of broke a mold,” Mr. Kniebe added. “To be able to make this kind of movie with that kind of complexity and accuracy and still get the big laughs and be the toast of Cannes, and sell it to more than 100 countries, that’s kind of like saying now, if you’re German, you can do anything. It’s up to you, there’s no prejudice anymore. ”",1

25781,Talks to Heal Catholic Rift in China Gain Momentum Under Francis - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   Pope Francis has spoken of his admiration for Chinese culture. He has greeted a delegation from China, accepting a silk imprint of an ancient inscription about Christianity. And he had his picture taken with a Chinese bishop in St. Peter’s Square last month. Now, he appears to be considering more significant action: a grand compromise with China’s Communist leaders to heal the bitter,   rift that has divided generations of Chinese Catholics and prevented the pope from openly exercising authority in the world’s most populous country. The Vatican says talks are continuing, and much work remains before a deal is done. But Francis’ apparent determination to see a rapprochement with Beijing has already caused unease among some who are worried that he might give too much away to the   Chinese president, Xi Jinping. “Most agree that the two sides must talk,” said a priest in Hebei, a northern province with many “underground” Catholics who reject state oversight. “But there is the risk that if the pope moves too quickly, the underground priests will feel the church will lose its autonomy,” he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “Some people have sacrificed a lot, and worry that their sacrifice will not be recognized. ” The Communist Party expelled Catholic missionaries after taking power in 1949, condemning them as tools of Western imperialists, and has required Catholics to worship in “patriotic” churches under state oversight. But a third or more of China’s estimated nine million to 12 million Catholics worship in “underground” congregations that are loyal to the pope and have resisted state control, sometimes enduring persecution and imprisonment. The Vatican has long dreamed of returning to China, bringing the underground church out of the shadows and healing divisions among Chinese Catholics. Under Francis, negotiations with Beijing over reconciliation have gained momentum. “We need patience, a lot of patience,” Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, who has overseen talks with China, told reporters this month in Bologna, Italy. Though expectations have been building, a breakthrough has been elusive given the Communist government’s deep suspicion of foreign and religious influences as subversive, and the fears of Chinese Catholics wary of state interference in their faith, said people closely following the talks. “There are still difficult issues that are not yet agreed upon,” said the Rev. Jeroom Heyndrickx, the acting director of the Ferdinand Verbiest Institute in Belgium, which studies Catholicism in China. The central dispute is over the power to name new bishops and the fate of existing bishops in China. For the Catholic Church, bishops are divine successors of the apostles, to be appointed by the pope. But China has long insisted on controlling ordinations, arguing that anything else amounts to interference in its internal affairs. Most Chinese bishops are recognized by both the Vatican and the Chinese authorities, but there are several in the   church who are excommunicated and working without papal approval, including some rumored to have broken their vows of chastity and fathered children. There are also more than two dozen underground bishops, many of whom are viewed with suspicion by the government and a few of whom are believed to be in prison. Any deal would have to decide what happens to both groups. “The Vatican can’t be seen as selling out people who have suffered and gone to jail for their faith,” said a Vatican official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the secretive talks. There is little doubt of Francis’ enthusiasm for China. In 2014, he sent a greeting to President Xi while flying through Chinese airspace on his way to South Korea. And his encounter with Joseph Xu Honggen, the bishop of Suzhou, in St. Peter’s Square last month was said to be the first public meeting between a pope and a bishop resident in mainland China since the Communist Revolution. “For me, China has always been a reference point of greatness,” the    pontiff told an Italian reporter in January. Mr. Xi has repeatedly warned against religion’s being used to undermine Communist rule, and his government has torn down crosses from Protestant churches in eastern China and instituted new controls on worship. But an environmental foundation run by an official with longstanding ties to Mr. Xi attended a Vatican conference in September and presented the pope with a gift heavy with symbolism: a silk drape bearing an inscription from an ancient tablet that records the presence of Christianity in China nearly 1, 400 years ago. One benefit of reconciliation for the Chinese government may be that the Vatican eventually decides to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing and cut formal ties with Taiwan, the   island that China considers part of its territory. Already, most bishops appointed by the   church quietly win the pope’s approval before ordination, or seek and receive papal forgiveness and acceptance afterward. But Beijing sometimes appoints bishops against the Vatican’s wishes, and the Vatican sometimes appoints bishops without Beijing’s approval. In August, Cardinal John Tong, the bishop of Hong Kong, disclosed in a pastoral letter that “the Chinese government is now willing to reach an understanding” on the issue. But he also acknowledged concerns among members of the underground church and their supporters. “They wonder if Vatican officials or the pope himself may go against the principles of the church,” he noted, before assuring parishioners that Francis “would not accept any agreement that would harm the integrity of faith of the universal church. ” Hundreds of underground Catholic clergy were jailed under Mao’s rule. But today, the term “underground” is often a misnomer, because many unregistered churches operate openly and are warily tolerated by local officials. Underground clergy still risk harassment and detention, though, especially if they resist demands to join the   Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Thaddeus Ma Deqin, an auxiliary bishop in Shanghai, disappeared in 2012, apparently into house arrest, after he denounced the association at his ordination. Later, a blog statement in his name recanted and praised the association as “irreplaceable. ” A year ago, Pedro Wei Heping, also known as Wei Heping, an underground priest in northwest China, was found dead in a river. The police said he had drowned himself, but supporters said suicide was unthinkable and suspected foul play. “China is negotiating with the Vatican, but the political environment is tightening,” said Sister Beatrice Leung, a professor in Taiwan who studies Chinese Catholicism. Supporters of Francis’ approach said the Chinese church was in danger of splintering further if there was not a compromise. Rival claims to lead some Chinese dioceses and the absence of bishops in others have left many priests and parishioners isolated or feuding, they said. There are as many as 70 dioceses in China without a bishop, said Anthony S. K. Lam, the executive secretary of the Holy Spirit Study Center in Hong Kong. “These days it’s widely accepted that bishops need the Holy Father’s approval to serve  —   maybe there are just a few older people who might disagree,” said the Rev. Francis Li Jianlin, a priest in the   church in Henan Province, in central China. “The acceptance of both sides will be needed, but the method is still being explored. ” In a sign of the divisiveness of the issue, Cardinal Joseph Zen   the outspoken retired bishop of Hong Kong, wrote in August that Francis was too eager for a deal with Beijing and argued that “the possibility of an unacceptable agreement now looks likely. ” There is a precedent for a papal compromise with a Communist government. In the 1990s, the Vatican reached a deal effectively giving the Vietnamese government a veto over the pope’s appointment of bishops. Cardinal Tong, the Hong Kong bishop, noted the Vietnam model in his pastoral letter, and appeared to suggest that Francis could make appointments based on the recommendations of a local bishops’ conference. But he noted that a legitimate conference would have to include China’s underground bishops and exclude   bishops found unacceptable by the pope. “Candidates would be chosen by the local church but not disliked by the authorities,” said Elisa Maria Giunipero, an expert on Catholics in China at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan. “The pope would have the final say. ” In an article in the party’s flagship People’s Daily newspaper in August, China’s top religious affairs official said the   church must continue to “itself select and ordain bishops” and “firmly exercise leadership over Chinese Catholicism. ” This month, a bishop was ordained in Changzhi, a city in northwest China, with the approval of both the Holy See and the Chinese authorities. Francis has said he will not be rushed. “We’re speaking about this slowly, but slow things always go well,” he told reporters last month when asked about the talks. “Fast things don’t go well. ”",1
25784,Jewish Centers Across U.S. Face New Wave of Bomb Threats - The New York Times,"On Wednesday, for the second time this month, someone called the Jewish community center outside Wilmington, Del. and said a bomb was on the property. For the second time this month, children were evacuated from schools, gym patrons had their workouts interrupted and police dogs searched the campus. And for the second time this month, it turned out to be part of a frightening nationwide hoax targeting Jewish facilities. “It’s concerning, it’s frustrating,” said Seth J. Katzen, the chief executive of the Jewish Federation of Delaware, whose staff trains several times a year for emergencies. “But as in any J. C. C. across the country, safety and security is our primary concern. ” There were as many as 27 bomb threats on Wednesday at Jewish centers in 17 states, according to the J. C. C. Association of North America. Last week, 16 Jewish facilities received bomb threats. No injuries were reported, but nerves were rattled and routines disrupted. As in other places, the police in Delaware said they were investigating and were in contact with the federal authorities. An F. B. I. official said the bureau and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division were investigating “possible civil rights violations in connection with threats” to Jewish community centers across the country, but declined to provide further details. Jewish leaders called the threats a sickening sign of the times, but said individual centers had trained to address them. Both Wednesday and last week, a national alert system for leaders of Jewish centers was activated as the menacing calls poured in. After the threats last week, Jewish leaders said they had held an online training session with law enforcement officials that included tips on how to respond to bomb threats. Jewish community centers “have prepared for situations like this,” said David Posner, a vice president with the J. C. C. Association who helps local centers refine their security protocols. “It’s unfortunate, but it’s necessary. ” In Birmingham, Ala. where a call about a bomb led to an evacuation on Wednesday, Betzy W. Lynch said the wave of threats “reinforces the importance of the work” of the centers across the country. “We are required to look at these things and take these threats very, very seriously, but at the same time, our goal is to improve the world and build relationships with people,” said Ms. Lynch, the executive director of the Levite Jewish Community Center in Birmingham. Lt. Sean Edwards, a spokesman for the Birmingham Police Department, said that the call on Wednesday appeared to be a robocall and that he believed federal officials were investigating. He said the Birmingham authorities had not increased patrols around the center. “We’re keeping our eye on it,” Lieutenant Edwards said, adding that new intelligence from the F. B. I. could lead to changes. The threats led to calls for heightened awareness at Jewish facilities. The   League issued a security advisory and urged Jewish institutions “to take these threats extremely seriously. ” Mr. Posner, of the J. C. C. Association, said local leaders were heartened by the law enforcement response but were still rattled by the experience. “They can do damage without actually even having to plant a bomb, which I believe is what they are looking to try to do,” he said. Leslie M. Sax, the executive director of the Gordon Jewish Community Center in Nashville, which, like the center in Delaware, has received two threats in two weeks, acknowledged that the calls had been unnerving. “If their goal is to incite fear and disrupt our business, they’ve done that,” she said. Ms. Sax, who declined to discuss specific security procedures in Nashville, said officials remained uncertain of whether the threats signaled troubles that might linger. “We’ve had two in two weeks, so we’re starting to question, ‘Is this the new norm?’ But we don’t know that,” she said. “We haven’t had enough time to even talk about it, but I think people are disheartened and a little frustrated. ”",1
25785,Nicolas Sarkozy Mounts What He Hopes Is a Comeback in France - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   He was beaten in the last presidential election, his presidential term was considered a failure, and he has been the subject of numerous judicial inquiries. In most other political systems, he would be a  . Yet in a France under terrorist threat, Nicolas Sarkozy may be the man of the moment in a presidential race picking up steam. By hammering on the idea that France’s “identity” is being challenged at a moment of deep unease over terrorism, the mercurial Mr. Sarkozy may be on to something with the electorate. This past week, his new book put “identity” front and center in his new campaign. It quickly climbed to the top of a popular   list, outpacing even the season’s novels. As is typical with such instant books, Mr. Sarkozy used his hastily written extended pamphlet to announce his candidacy. He will run in his    party’s November primary, he said. And he is consistently strong in polls. At a rally in a sweltering auditorium in France’s south late last month, his first of the campaign, Mr. Sarkozy got his loudest cheers when he conflated the fight against terrorism with the fight for France’s identity. “France is under threat,” he told the crowd. “France is a target. War is war. We’ve got to win. We’ve got to crush our enemies, render them harmless. ” As the crowd in Châteaurenard cheered, Mr. Sarkozy announced, “Our identity is under threat. ” By “our identity,” it is clear he means   France. Mr. Sarkozy is positioning himself as its No. 1 defender against weak Socialists and competitors on the right. With his exclamations, Mr. Sarkozy is all about ensuring that next year’s presidential campaign will be fought largely over the threat from Islam, real and perceived. Already, he has touched a nerve with voters. For months, the calm, cerebral and moderate mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé, with his soothing talk of a France at ease with what he calls its “happy identity,” has been considered the   easily pushing Mr. Sarkozy and the bedraggled Socialist president, François Hollande, way back in polls. Mr. Juppé is still the favorite, but he is losing ground in his own party. The new polling numbers suggest as much: Mr. Sarkozy gained four points last week in one widely watched measure and two points in another, nipping steadily at Mr. Juppé’s heels. In one of the polls, he was nearly 40 points ahead of Mr. Juppé among voters in their party, the Republicans. Mr. Sarkozy recently said he would introduce a law banning the burkini, the   swimsuit worn by some Muslim women, and it has not hurt him. Anything but. Even on the French left, the burkini has few defenders. The Socialist government’s female ministers have been quick to say they are against it, even when they do not support a total ban feminists have published diatribes against it in the French news media. Mr. Sarkozy characteristically pushes it a step further. “The burkini is a political, militant act, a provocation,” he told Le Figaro magazine. He calls for locking up,   Muslims who are potential security threats, with thousands of them in the government’s files. Mr. Juppé’s appeal, to preserve republican values and the rule of law, seems less in tune with the voters in France’s moment of sustained tension. With Marine Le Pen, the leader of the   National Front, oddly silent after its defeat in local elections in December and largely absent from public debate, Mr. Sarkozy seems intent on scooping up both the Front’s   xenophobic electorate and more centrist   voters who, like much of France, are still in a state of shock after a wave of terrorist attacks. So far, he appears to have the wind in his sails. How is it that Mr. Sarkozy  —   a politician who left France’s chronic economic problems intact after five years in office, embarrassed it with a messy personal life, and wound up being interrogated by investigators over party finances and other matters  —   appears to be coming back so strongly? Much of it has to do with France’s     political system, said Gérard Grunberg, a political scientist at the Institute of Political Studies. Such a system leaves little opening for outsiders and newcomers. Those who are strong in their parties can almost always be guaranteed a long political life. If you are already in the club, you stay in it. Even in defeat, Mr. Sarkozy maintained firm control of his Republicans, not stepping down from their leadership until he announced his candidacy on Aug. 22. And although the French president is directly elected, not chosen by Parliament, the office exists in the shadow of the country’s long parliamentary tradition, Mr. Grunberg said. In that tradition, “the fact of having been beaten did not mean the end,” he said, with prime ministers and other top leaders often recycling themselves after losing crucial votes. But perhaps more important, Mr. Sarkozy may be the politician most in tune with the country’s unease. He is certainly the loudest, pounding even more explicitly than Ms. Le Pen the themes of secularism and the need to oppose the influence of Islam. “The Republic has retreated too far,” Mr. Sarkozy says in his book. “Nobody should be allowed any external sign of religious affiliation. ” He adds that it is “not with religions that the Republic has problems, but with one of them. ” In the face of the terrorist attacks, Mr. Sarkozy projects aggression and pugnacity where Mr. Hollande merely looks stricken and concerned. Among the voters, “Sarkozy responds to a demand for authority” in a “very tense, dangerous situation,” Mr. Grunberg said. “He’s decided to go very far to the right. And Juppé hasn’t said anything, though now he is beginning to speak. ” Whether Mr. Juppé’s “tranquillity” in the face of the threat can sway voters  —   Mr. Grunberg believes it might  —   is an open question. Mr. Sarkozy, he pointed out, remains unpopular with a broad portion of the electorate.",1

Following is the full text; 
Question 1 : Mr. President, let’s start with Aleppo if you don’t mind. There are still thousands of civilians trapped, trying to survive in a sort of sub-human conditions in the middle of a deluge of bombs. Why do you think that they refused to get out? 
President Assad : The part that you mention in Aleppo, what they call it the eastern part, is occupied by the terrorists for the last three years, and they have been using the civilians as human shields. From our side, from our part as government, we have two missions: the first one is to fight those terrorists to liberate that area and the civilians from those terrorists, and at the same time to try to find a solution to evacuate that area from those terrorists if they accept, let’s say, what you call it reconciliation option, in which they either give up their armaments for amnesty, or they leave that area. The other thing we did as government is to open gates for the civilians to leave that area, and at the same time for the humanitarian convoys and help to go through those gates inside that part of Aleppo, but the terrorists publicly refused any solution, so they wanted to keep the situation as it is. 
Question 2 : But Mr. President, aren’t you using the jihadists to discredit all the oppositions at the eyes of the national and international public opinion, and in the end to try to wipe them all out? 
President Assad: No, we cannot do that for a very simple reason: because we’ve been dealing with this kind of terrorism since the fifties, since the Muslim Brotherhood came to Syria at that time, and we learned that lesson very well, especially in the eighties, that terrorists cannot be used as a political card, you cannot put it in your pocket, because it’s like a scorpion; it will bite you someday. So, we cannot use jihadists because it’s like shooting yourself in the foot. They’re going to be against you sooner or later. This is in a pragmatic way, but if you think as value, we wouldn’t do it. Using terrorism or jihadists or extremists for any political agenda is immoral. 
Question 3: But Mr. President, the people, the civilians inside Aleppo, couldn’t we assume that they probably don’t trust the government, they don’t trust the army, that they just want democracy, dignity, freedom? Can you give that to them? 
President Assad: Let’s talk about this point, regarding the reality; since the beginning of the crisis, since the terrorists started to control some areas within Syria, the majority of the Syrian civilians left that areas to join the government areas, not vice versa. If the majority of the Syrians don’t trust the government, they should go the other way. 
Let me tell you another example, which is a starker example. You were in Daraya, al-Muadamiya, a few days ago, when you came here, and the terrorists and militants who left that area to Idleb in the northern part of Syria to join their fellow terrorists, they left their families under the supervision of the government, and you can go and visit them now, if you want. 
Question 4: Mr. President, I’ve been here first four years ago, and now. Are you winning the war, this war in Syria? 
President Assad: We can say, you can win the war only when you restore stability in Syria. You cannot talk about winning the war as long as there’s killing and destruction on daily basis. That doesn’t mean we are losing the war; the army is making good advancement on daily basis against the terrorists. Of course, they still have the support of Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and some Western countries including the United States, but the only option that we have in that regard is to win. If you don’t win and the terrorists win, Syria wouldn’t exist anymore. 
Question 5: But would you have done that also without Hezbollah, Iran, and Russia? 
President Assad: They are here because they could offer very essential and important help, because the situation that we are facing now is not only about a few terrorists from within Syria; it’s like international war against Syria. Those terrorists have been supported by tens of foreign countries, so Syria alone wouldn’t be able to face this kind of war without the help of its friends. That’s why their existence and their support was very essential. 
Question 6: Isn’t Mr. Putin your most important ally? 
President Assad: Russia is very important, Iran is very important, Hezbollah is very important. All of them are important. Each one made important achievements against the terrorists in Syria, so it’s difficult to say who is more important than the other. 
Journalist : But what’s the role of Russia in Syria nowadays? 
President Assad : The most important part of their support is the aerial support, which is very essential, they have very strong firepower, and at the same time they are the main supply of our army for more than sixty years, so our army depends on the Russian support in different military domains. 
Question 7: But are you free to decide the future of Syria, or are you dependent on Vladimir Putin’s strategies? 
President Assad: No, first of all, we are fully free, not partially, fully free, in everything related to the future of Syria. Second, which is more important or as important as the first part or the first factor, that the Russians always base their policies on values, and these values are the sovereignty of other countries, the international law, respecting other people, other cultures, so they don’t interfere in whatever is related to the future of Syria or the Syrian people. 
Question 8 : But they have helped you quite a few times in the United Nations. They have vetoed a few resolutions condemning your government, and the Syrian Army. There are several reports regarding Syria for use of chemical weapons, human right abuses, war crimes. All of this in the framework of the United Nations. 
President Assad: And many ask “what for?” I mean, what’s in return, what did they ask in return, that’s the question, actually, that’s the content of your question, because we heard it many times, whether in the media or directly. Actually, first of all, for their values, because in these values that I’m talking about, the value of international law, and they have their interest as well. I mean, fighting the terrorists in Syria is not only in the interest of Syria or the Syrian people; in the interest of the Middle East, of Europe itself – something that many officials in the West don’t see or don’t realize or don’t acknowledge – and in the interest of the Russian people, because they have been facing terrorists for decades now. So, the Russians are fighting for us, for the world, and for their self. 
Question 9: But when you speak about values, democracy is a value. 
President Assad: Of course. 
Journalist : Freedom is a value. 
President Assad: Of course. 
Question 10: Can you say that Syria is a democracy, like the Western standards? 
President Assad: The only one who can fight for these values like democracy and freedoms are the people of any country or any society, not the foreigners. Foreigners cannot bring freedom, cannot bring democracy, because this is related to the culture, to the different factors that affect or influence that society. You cannot bring it, you cannot import it. You cannot import anything from outside your country regarding the future of your country. 
Question 11: But would you define Syria as a democracy? 
President Assad: No, we were on the way to democracy. We didn’t say that we are fully democratic, we were on the way, we were moving forward. Slowly or fast, that’s subjective, cannot be objective, that’s always subjective. But we’re moving forward in that regard, of course. But the criteria or the paradigm for us is not the West, not the Western paradigm, because the West has its own culture, we have our own culture, they have their own reality, we have our own reality. So, our democracy should reflect our culture and our habits and our customs and our reality at the same time. 
Question 12 : I’m sure that you know that there is a new Secretary-General of the United Nations. How do you look at him, Mr. Guterres, taking into the account his well-known humanitarian approach to the situation? 
President Assad : Of course, I agree about the headline of this approach. I say “headline” because you always – under the headline, you have many sub-headlines or different titles. When you talk about humanitarian, it doesn’t only mean to offer the people the help, the food, their necessary needs for their life. The first thing, if you ask the Syrian refugees, for example, the first thing they want is to go back to their country. The first thing they want is to be able to live within Syria. That means help, humanitarian help, the way we understand it, food, medical care, any other, let’s say, basics for the daily life. The second one is to have stability and to have security, which means humanitarian equals fighting terrorists. You cannot talk about humanitarian aid and supporting the terrorists at the same time. You cannot, you have to choose. And of course, I’m not talking about him; I’m talking about the countries that go to support his plan, because he needs the support of other countries, he cannot achieve that plan while many countries in the world are still supporting the terrorists in Syria. So, of course we support it, whether helping the people to live, to go back to their country, and to live in security without terrorists. 
Question 13: He said already that peace in Syria is a priority. Are you available to talk with him, to work with him, for that purpose? 
President Assad: Definitely, of course. It’s his priority, and of course it’s our priority, that’s self-evident. It’s not only our priority; it’s a Middle Eastern priority, and when the Middle East is stable, the rest of the world is stable, because the Middle East is the heart of the world geographically and geopolitically, and Syria is the heart of the Middle East geographically and geopolitically. We are the fault line; if you don’t deal with this fault line, you’re going to have an earthquake, that’s what we always said. That’s why this priority is a hundred percent correct from our point of view, and we are ready to cooperate in any way to achieve stability in Syria, of course taking into consideration the interest of the country, and the will of the Syrian people. 
Question 14: You said when we spoke that the United Nations are biased. You think with Mr. Guterres that can change a little bit? 
President Assad: Everybody knows that the United Nations is not the Secretary-General; he has an important position, but the United Nations is the states within this organization, and to be frank, most of the people say only the five permanent members; this is the United Nations because they have the veto, they can do whatever they want and they can refuse whatever they want, and if there’s a reform that is very much needed for this organization, they can make veto or they can move forward in that regard. But at the same time, the way he presented himself as Secretary-General is very important. If you ask me “what do you expect from such a new official in that important position,” I would say I need two things: the first one is to be objective in every statement he could make regarding any conflict around the world, including Syria. The second one, which is related and complimentary with the first one, is not to turn his office into a part or branch of the State Department of the United States. That’s what we expect now. Of course, when he’s objective, he can play an important role in dealing with different officials in the United Nations in order to bring the policies of the different states – mainly Russia and the United States – toward more cooperation and more stability regarding Syria. 
Question 15: But regarding Syria, there are a lot agendas: Qatar, Turkey, Russia, United States, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. How is it possible to try to find that peace process with so many agendas? 
President Assad: Without bringing all those countries and the different factors in one direction, of course it’s going to be difficult. That’s why I always say the Syrian problem as isolated case, as Syrian case, is not very complicated. What makes it complicated is the interference from the outside, especially the Western interference because it’s against the will of the Syrian government, while the intervention of the Russians, Iranians, and Hezbollah is because of the invitation of the Syrian government. So, his role as Secretary-General in bringing all these powers together is very essential` and we hope he can succeed, it’s not easy of course. 
Question 16: Let me pick out Turkey; their army is in your country, their President said last week that their interests lies beyond the natural borders; he referred to Mosul and Aleppo. Do you accept this? 
President Assad: Of course not. You’re talking about sick person; he’s megalomaniac President, he is not stable. He lives during the Ottoman era, he doesn’t live in the current time. He’s out of touch with the reality. 
Question 17: But how you are going to do with their army inside your country? 
President Assad: It’s our right to defend it; it’s invasion. It’s our right to defend our country against any kind of invasion. But let’s be realistic, every terrorist came to Syria, he came through Turkey with the support of Erdogan. So, fighting those terrorists is like fighting the army of Erdogan, not the Turkish army, the army of Erdogan. 
Question 18 : But it’s a NATO country, are you aware of that? 
President Assad: Yeah, of course. Whether it is a NATO country or not, it doesn’t have the right to invade any other country according to the international law or to any other moral value. 
Question 19: Mr. President, America’s new elected President, what do you expect of Donald J. Trump? 
President Assad : We don’t have a lot of expectations because the American administration is not only about the President; it’s about different powers within this administration, the different lobbies that they are going to influence any President. So, we have to wait and see when he embarks his new mission, let’s say, or position within this administration as President in two months’ time. But we always say we have wishful thinking that the Unites States would be unbiased, respect the international law, doesn’t interfere in other countries around the world, and of course to stop supporting terrorists in Syria. 
Question 20: But he said in an interview that he seems to be ready to work with you in the fight against the Islamic State or ISIL, are you ready for such a move? 
President Assad: Of course, I would say this is promising, but can he deliver? Can he go in that regard? What about the countervailing forces within the administration, the mainstream media that were against him? How can he deal with it? That’s why for us it’s still dubious whether he can do or live up to his promises or not. That’s why we are very cautious in judging him, especially as he wasn’t in a political position before. So, we cannot tell anything about what he’s going to do, but if, let’s say if he is going to fight the terrorists, of course we are going to be ally, natural ally in that regard with the Russian, with the Iranian, with many other countries who wanted to defeat the terrorists. 
Question 21: So, you will cooperate with the Americans in the fight against terrorists? 
President Assad: Of course, definitely, if they are genuine, if they have the will, and if they have the ability, of course we are the first ones to fight the terrorists because we suffered more than any other one in this world from terrorists. 
Question 22: So, cooperate with the Americans that are now supporting the Kurds, the YPG that are trying to get into Raqqa? 
President Assad: When you talk about cooperation, it means cooperation between two legal governments, not cooperation between foreign government and any faction within Syria. Any cooperation that doesn’t go through the Syrian government is not legal. If it’s not legal, we cannot cooperate with, and we don’t recognize and we don’t accept. 
Question 23 : Anyway, the Vice President, Mr. Pence, said that he has admitted the use of military force to prevent your military force from a humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, how do you look at it? 
President Assad: This is against the international law again, and that’s the problem with the American position; they think that they are the police of the world. They think they are the judge of the world; they’re not. They are sovereign country, they are an independent country, but this is their limit; they don’t have to interfere in any other country. Because of this interference for the last fifty years, that’s why they are very good only in creating problems, not in solving problems. That’s the problem with the American role. That’s why I said we don’t pin a lot of hopes of changing administrations because that context has been going on for more than fifty years now, and that’s expected. If they want to continue in the same position of the United States creating problems around the world, that’s what they have to do: only interfering in the matters of other nations. 
Question 24: But returning to what the President, the newly elected American President said about cooperating with your government in the fight against Islamic State, do you expect a change also within European countries? 
President Assad: Regarding fighting terrorism, we are ready to cooperate with anyone in this world with no conditions. That’s crux of our policy, not today, not yesterday; for years, even before the war on Syria, we always said that. In the eighties, we asked for international coalition against terrorism after the Muslim Brotherhood crisis in Syria when they started killing, of course they were defeated at that time. We asked for the same thing. So, this is a long-term policy that we base our policy on for years now. 
Question 25: One last question. Mr. President, I need really to ask you this, because after all these years, do you still reject any responsibility for what happened in your country? 
President Assad: No, I never rejected any responsibility, but that depends on the decision. When you talk about responsibility, you ask yourself what are the decisions that you take in order to deal with the crisis. Did the President order anyone to kill civilians, did he order the destruction, did he order supporting terrorism in his country? Of course not. My decision was, and the decision of the different institutions, and the decision of the different officials in Syria – I’m on top of them – was to have dialogue, to fight terrorists, and to reform as a response at the very beginning, response to the allegations, let’s say, at that time, that they needed reform in Syria, we responded. So, that’s the decision that I took. Would you say, or would anyone say that fighting terrorism is wrong? Making dialogue is wrong? Making reform is wrong? Protecting the civilians and liberating areas from terrorists is wrong? Of course not. So, there’s a difference between responsibility of the policy and responsibility of the practice. In any practice, you have malpractice, that’s another issue. When you talk about state and President, you always talk about the decisions and the policy. 
Journalist: Thank you for being with RTP Mr. President. 
President Assad : Thanks for you.

25791,Alleged US airstrikes to support ground op in Afghanistan kill scores of Kunduz villagers (GRAPHIC) - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
sott.net/news 
© Bashir Khan Safi / Agence France Presse An Afghan man carries the dead body of a child following a NATO coalition airstrike on the outskirts of Kunduz on November 3, 2016. 
Scores of civilians, including children, have reportedly been killed in US airstrikes supporting a ground operation in Kunduz, Afghanistan, officials and media report. NATO forces in Afghanistan said the airstrikes were “to defend friendly forces under fire.” 
Earlier on Thursday, United States Forces Afghanistan released a statement, saying that two US servicemen had died “as a result of wounds sustained during operations” in Kunduz. 
“The service members came under fire during a train, advise and assist mission with our Afghan partners to clear a Taliban position and disrupt the group’s operations in Kunduz district,” the statement said. 
Resolute Support, a NATO-led training mission in Afghanistan, tweeted that the airstrikes in Kunduz had been carried out to defend “friendly forces under fire.” 
Brigadier General Charles Cleveland, a spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan, said that he couldn’t say whether the civilian deaths near Kunduz and the attack on US soldiers were related, but noted that the deceased American servicemen had been as advisers to an Afghan military operation. 
“We have no evidence at this point of any civilian casualties, but we take all allegations very seriously,” he said, as cited by the New York Times . “Although this was an Afghan operation advised by US forces, US aircraft were used to defend all of the friendly forces.” 
Afghan officials told Reuters that there had been heavy fighting between Taliban fighters and the US military about five kilometers from the city center. The US then reportedly called in airstrikes that resulted in numerous casualties. 
Local activists shared photos of what they say are dead bodies of the airstrike victims with RT. RT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the images. 
General Qasim Jangalbagh from the Kunduz police said the air raid had resulted in the deaths of about 26 people, AP reported. 
Kunduz’s provincial spokesman, Mahmood Danish, told AFP that the airstrikes had killed 30 civilians, including women and children. 
“Afghan forces and coalition troops conducted a joint operation against the Taliban insurgents. In the bombardment 30 Afghan civilians were martyred and 25 others were wounded,” he said. 
Police spokesman Mahmoodullah Akbari gave similar toll to AFP, saying that infants as young as three months old were among the dead. 
Local activists shared photos of what they say are dead bodies of the airstrike victims with RT. RT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the images. 
“They were asleep when their house came under attack by coalition troops,” Akbari said. 
Safiullah Amiri, a member of the Kunduz Provincial Council, said at least 30 civilians had been killed in a series of airstrikes on the village, the NYT reported. The paper also cited Islamuddin Timoori, a representative of the protesters from Kunduz, who said that the bombing had been carried out by the US, killing 27 people and wounding 70. 
According to Pajhwok, “the airstrikes and ground offensive” were conducted by “Afghan and foreign forces” in the Pul Achin and Poz Kandahari areas on the outskirts of Kunduz. 
Pajhwok reported that the airstrikes had prompted the citizens of Kunduz to take to the streets in protest. The protesters reportedly were carrying the bodies of people killed in the attack, including those of the children. Photos of the corpses of the alleged victims have been circulating on social media. 
“I was working on the farm when suddenly the bombardment started in our area. When I came to my house seven members of my family, including women and children, were killed,” Kunduz resident Taza Gul told Pajhwok Afghan News. 
Bilal Sarwary, a local journalist citing sources in the Afghan government, reported that at least 31 civilians had been killed during an Afghan-NATO special forces operation on Thursday night. 
Citing Afghan government sources, he tweeted that “Afghan and US Special forces were surrounded and were taking heavy fire when the airstrike was called.” Related ",1
25793,Comment on 6 Places Voter Fraud Has Already Happened… But Don’t Worry by lenore.lee,"Remember the last debate when the internet blew up because Donald Trump said he wouldn’t necessarily accept the results of the election ? People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged . The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . 
As it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today’s Drudge Report . But don’t worry. These are just “glitches” or “too few to make a difference.” 1) Chicago 
In the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they’ve reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn’t the worst of it – not only are these people on the rolls – they’ve repeatedly voted since their deaths. 
Don’t worry, though. It’s just a few hundred dead voters that they’ve been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia 
Chicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed “active voters” for many years since their deaths. 
Don’t worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply “human error” and that there aren’t enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland 
A woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of “vote flipping.” She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. 
Don’t worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would “undo” the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I’m sure it’s fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida 
Two women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. 
Don’t worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle, a Democrat, “Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.” ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia 
A guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. 
But don’t worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, “Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.” ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas 
Much like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence . Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. 
But don’t worry. Election officials in the state say it’s not a problem with the equipment . It’s just those silly voters who don’t know how to use it. ““Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment. Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” ( source ) If you’re worried about election fraud… 
You can add a smartphone app by True the Vote called VoteStand to report incidents of fraud. Don’t let anything slide. If you are voting, make sure your choice is accurately recorded.

25794,Alan Dershowtiz: Report He Will Help Defense in Female Genital Mutilation Case ’Fake News by New York Times’,"Famed attorney and retired Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz told Breitbart News a New York Times story published on Saturday that he has been hired “to help the defense” in the Michigan female genital mutilation case is “misleading” and “another example of fake news by The New York Times. ”[On Saturday, the Times reported, “Recently, the    an organization overseeing smaller Shiite Muslim sects, hired two   lawyers, Alan Dershowitz and Mayer Morganroth, to help the defense, The Associated Press reported. ”  “Misleading,” Dershowitz said of the Times report. “I’ve written a letter to The Times correcting its story,” Dershowitz told Breitbart News. “Another example of fake news by The New York Times. I hope they’ll print my letter, but you never know,” Dershowitz told Breitbart News in a phone interview from Vienna, Austria on Monday morning. “So here’s the story. This group rejects female genital mutilation. I agreed to consult with them and to work toward an acceptance of merely a symbolic pin prick, not even of the clitoris, but just of the clitoral hood, which is the equivalent of the foreskin,” Dershowitz said of his consulting agreement with the    the governing body that oversees members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Islam. He went on to say: The idea really is the functional equivalent of what Jews do. If a   kid were circumcised at birth, as many are, but didn’t have a bris, didn’t have a religious circumcision, and he wants to convert to Judaism, or his parents want to convert him to Judaism, he has a little symbolic pin prick,  it draws one tiny bit of blood, and that takes the place of a circumcision, and that’s what I’ve proposed&gt, World wide, there are about one million members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect, which is based in Mumbai, India. Muffaddal Saifuddin is the current spiritual leader. The sect has at least six mosques in the United States, located in Michigan, Houston, Chicago, New Jersey, Washington, D. C. and Fremont, California. While it is not known exactly how many adherents of the sect currently reside in the United States, at least three of them have run afoul of the law recently in Michigan. “Dr. Fakhruddin Attar was arrested in the Detroit suburb of Livonia, Michigan Friday, accused, along with his wife Farida Attar, of involvement in the same female genital mutilation conspiracy that led to the landmark arrest last week of Dr. Jumana Nagarwala,” Breitbart News reported in April. “All three defendants are part of a small   community known as the Dawoodi Bohra, which was at the center of an Australian   prosecution that sent three people to prison in 2015,” the Detroit Free Press reported: In the wake of the case, an organization that oversees the Dawoodi Bohra community in Detroit has defended the group, stating: “The Dawoodi Bohras do not support the violation of any U. S. law, local, state or federal. We offer our assistance to the investigating authorities. Any violation of U. S. law is counter to instructions to our community members. It does not reflect the everyday lives of the Dawoodi Bohras in America.   …     We take our religion seriously but our culture is modern and  . ” Dershowitz again stated that The New York Times got the story wrong and that he is not helping the defense of the individuals charged with committing the federal crime of female genital mutilation in Michigan: I’m consulting —  The Times mischaracterized my role —  I’m not representing any of the people who are charged. I’m just consulting with the group in an effort to try to create a world wide alternative to female genital mutilation. If we can get everybody in the world who today practices female genital mutilation, this group does not, every group in the world who practices it, if we can get them all to substitute the symbolic pin prick, which is the equivalent, for example of a 15 year old kid having your ear pierced, which is legal, it causes just about the same amount of harm to have your ears piereced as to have  a tiny prick on the labial hood, that to me would be a great accomplishment. It would also help resolve the conflict between religious freedom and the interests of the state in preventing child harm. So that’s my role in the case, as a consultant to try and move the world away from female genital mutilation toward a much more benign sterilized pin prick. “They don’t practice FGM, lets be clear about that,” Dershowitz said of the group    adding: My goal is to help create a model all over the world for groups that do practice, to be able to comply with the law. What I want to do is get the U. S. government to agree that a sterilized benign symbolic pin prick would not violate the law. I think that if we can do that we would have accomplished a great deal. Breitbart News asked Professor Dershowitz if this is just a false flag to create the impression there is widespread use of the symbolic pin prick as an alternative to female genital mutilation when in fact the traditional barbaric practice of female genital mutilation will continue as before. “I’m not concerned about this group,” Dershowtiz said. He went on: This group wants to obey the law, and has been trying to obey the law. They will do everything in their power to obey. This group never practiced clitoral cutting  or anything of the kind, so I am very comfortable representing this group and trying to get the law to change, or really to get the law to recognize our position, which is the law doesn’t apply to the pin pricking. If we can get the U. S. government to accept that, we think we’re going to improve both the situation facing young girls today and the freedom of the religion of the group. So for me this presents the possibility of a   a win for the first amendment and a win for young girls who would no longer be exposed to anything beyond the symbolic pin prick. I want to emphasize the pin prick is literally no different than ear piercing and in virtually every state in the union today, parents have the right to have their 10 year old, 8 year old, 6 year old have their ears pierced. There’s no medical good that comes from that, but there’s also no medical harm. If you can do it for cosmetic purposes you can certainly be able to do it for religious purposes. Dershowitz told Breitbart News he first became interested in the issue of female genital mutilation when he got a call from this group. “I had read a few things about it. I had read works by Richard Schwader, who is a liberal anthropologist, and who has been pushing very hard for this pin prick approach. I was influenced by his advocacy as well. I met with him and met with the group and came away believing this would be the best overall solution,” he said. Dershowitz also said he has no idea how prevalent the pin prick procedure he advocates as an alternative to female genital mutilation is in those countries where female genital mutilation is a documented health problem for women. “I would never ever ever under any circumstances defend the practice of female genital mutilation and I want to state that on the record. I would never ever ever under any circumstances defend or support the practice of female genital mutilation. I’m not doing that here,” he added.

It’s the perfect time to be an affluent white and politically correct North Side Lakefront – or other kind of – Liberal and sports fan in the Chicago area. Think about it. Your beloved Chicago Cubs are finally going to their first World Series since 1945 and they will be doing a battle against a team with the worst racist Native American logo in major U.S. professional sports: the Cleveland Indians – yes, the “Indians.” The Indians’ Chief Wahoo – a wild grinning caricature – is the single most offensive, politically incorrect image in sports today. 
It’s enough to make folks forget that the Cubs are owned by a politically active right-wing Republican family, the Ricketts, one of whom recently contributed $1 million to the racist and sexist bigot Donald Trump. And that the Cubs’ storied ballpark Wrigley Field will be jammed with rich white people who can swallow up secondary market World Series tickets selling for as high as $18,000 . And that the Cubs owe no small part their ability to overcome their “ Billy Goat curse ” (proclaiming that they’d never go again to the final championship series) largely to massive infusions of big Ricketts money required to purchase free-agent veterans to go along with their younger stars. 
Meanwhile, the liberals’ party has a presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who is about to become the national government’s first female chief executive after trouncing the aforementioned bigot Trump in the November 8 th election. The insane, politically incorrect spectacle of Trump has helped people forget that Mrs. Clinton is herself a “right-wing fanatic” and a “lying neoliberal warmonger” – and here I am quoting two left intellectuals who counsel folks to vote for her. Hillary’s Wall Street-friendly arch-corporatism and hawkish militarism are well understood in very predominantly white establishment business and imperial circles, where she is by far and away the preferred candidate. This is true even among many normally Republican members of the economic, political, policy, and – in a word – power elite. 
Identity politics provides cover for, and diversion from, class rule and from the deeper structures of class, race, gender, empire, and eco-cide that haunt American and global life today – structures that place children of liberal white North Side Chicago professionals in posh 40 th -story apartments overlooking scenic Lake Michigan while consigning children of felony-branded Black custodians and fast food workers to cramped apartments in crime-ridden South Side neighborhoods where nearly half the kids are growing up at less than half the federal government’s notoriously inadequate poverty level. Most of the Black kids in deeply impoverished and hyper-segregated neighborhoods like Woodlawn and Englewood (South Side) or North Lawndale and Garfield Park (West Side) can forget not only about going to a World Series game but even about watching one on television. Their parents don’t have cable and the Fox Sports 1 channel. There’s few if any local restaurants and taverns with big-screen televisions in safe walking distance from their homes. Major League Baseball ticket prices being what they are, few of the South Side kids have even seen the White Sox – Chicago’s South Side American League team, whose ballpark lacks the affluent white and gentrified surroundings of Wrigley Field. (Thanks in no small part to the urban social geography of race and class in Chicago, the White Sox winning the World Series in 2005 – their first championship since 1917, marking an overcoming of the Black Sox Curse – was a smaller deal in the city than the Cubs going to the World Series this year.) 
The World Series might be playing out before a national and even global audience just miles away in hyper-Caucasian Wrigley Ville, but for tens of thousands of Black and Latino kids on the city’s South, West, and (in fact) North Sides (there are significant stretches of minority poverty west and north of the Cubs’ storied ballpark), the games are being played in another universe. 
Hillary, a Cubs fan from the affluent northern white Chicago area suburb of Park Ridge (though also a self-declared Yankee fan during her years “representing Wall Street as a Senator from New York” [her own words]) isn’t going to remotely change any of that. She has a long record as a vanguard neoliberal Democrat (a de facto “moderate” Republican) going back to the Clintons’ days in Arkansas, where and when she played a key role in helping move the Democratic Party ever further away from its last lingering commitments to social, racial, and environmental justice and decency. 
I may be a “far left radical” stamped as a White Sox fan by family upbringing and a childhood on the South Side. Still, I am going to make the most both of the Cubs going to the World Series and of Hillary trouncing Trump. Much as I wish the Sox were headed for their second championship in eleven year (they held first place in the American League Central Division for a few weeks last spring), I have to admit that nothing can beat the heartwarming story of the “lovable losers” the Cubs going to the October Classic when it comes to boosting the profile of baseball relative to that of the sadistically violent, brain-mashing blood sport called U.S. football. It is a telling tragedy that the beautiful pastoral game of baseball has been trounced by the vicious, fascist-lite spectacle that is U.S. football as the nation’s favorite sport in the neoliberal era. 
Plus, I have nice memories of my father taking me up to enemy territory to watch National League baseball in Wrigley Field in the late 1960s, before it became a Yuppie playground and a tourist attraction. You could sit in Wrigley’s bleachers for $1.50. 
Like all good leftists, I hate the Clintons, including the ones with two x chromosomes – and that includes young Chelsea, with her noxious $10 million condo complex in Manhattan Still, I do not await a Hillary Clinton administration with undiluted trepidation. The presence of a Democrat in the nominal top U.S. job can be usefully instructive for young workers and citizens. It helps demonstrate the richly bipartisan nature of the American plutocracy and Empire. The people need to see and experience how the intolerable misery and oppression imposed by capitalism and its evil twin imperialism live on when Democrats hold the White House. At the same time, the presence of a Republican in the White House tends to fuel the illusion among progressives and others that the main problem in the country is that the wrong party holds executive power and that all energy and activism must be directed at fixing that. It just feeds the electoral and candidate obsessions that do so much to divert us from building and expanding the kinds of rank and file social movements required to bringing about an actually progressive transformation. 
There is, yes, I know, the problem of Democrats in the White House functioning to stifle social movements and especially peace activism (the antiwar movement has still yet to recover from the Obama experience). But there’s more good news here about a Hillary presidency. Not all Democratic presidents are equally good at shutting progressive activism down. As the likely Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein (for whom I took five minutes to early vote in a “contested state” three weeks ago) noted in an interview with me last April (when the White Sox still held first place in their division), Hillary Clinton will have considerably less capacity to deceive and bamboozle progressive and young workers and citizens than Barack Obama enjoyed in 2007-08 . “Obama,” Stein noted, was fairly new on the scene. Hillary,” by contrast, “has been a warmonger who never found a war she didn’t love forever!” Hillary’s corporatist track record – ably documented in Doug Henwood’s book My Turn: Hillary Clinton Targets the Presidency (her imperial track record receives equally impressive treatment in Diana Johnstone’s volume Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton ) – is also long and transparently bad. All that and Mrs. Clinton’s remarkable lacks of charisma and trustworthiness could be useful for left activism and politics in coming years. 
For what it’s worth, the first and most urgent place to restore such activism and politics is in the area where Barack Obama has been most deadening: foreign policy, also known (when conducted by the U.S.) as imperialism. When it comes to prospects for World War III, it is by no means clear that the saber-rattling, regime-changing, NATO-expanding, and Russia-baiting Hillary Clinton is the “lesser evil” compared to the preposterous Trump. That’s no small matter. During a friend’s birthday party the night the Cubs clinched the National League pennant, I asked fellow celebrants and inebriates if they were prepared for the fundamental realignment of the space-time continuum that was coming when the North Siders won the league championship. That was a joke, of course, but there’s nothing funny about the heightened chances of a real downward existential adjustment resulting from war between nuclear superpowers when the “lying neoliberal warmonger” Hillary Clinton gets into office and insists on recklessly imposing a so-called no-fly zone over Russia-allied Syria. 
Postscript : Meanwhile, could we save some love for the poor and mostly working class sports fans of Cleveland? They didn’t vote for their one and only Major League Baseball team to be named the Indians and bear a noxious racist logo. Until LeBron James delivered on his basketball promise last spring they hadn’t won a major sports professional championship in fifty-two years. In the years since 1948, the last time the Indians won the World Series, Cleveland has had two such champions: the football Browns in 1964 and the basketball Cavaliers earlier this year. Over the same period, Chicago has accumulated four National Hockey League (NHL)/Stanley Cup championships (1961, 2010, 2013, 2015), six NBA (basketball) championship (the 1990s Michael Jordan Bulls), two NFL (football) championships (the Bears in 1963 and 1985-86), and one World Series (the officially unlovable White Sox in 2005). That’s Chicago 13, Cleveland 2 (9 to 2 if you subtract hockey since Cleveland has never had an NHL team). That said, I’m still rooting for the Cubs for three reasons: (1) I may be from the South Side but I’m also from Chicago and have lived on the North Side at different times; (2) the Cubs becoming a dynasty (a distinct possibility given the talent and youth of their team the money behind it) will be good for baseball versus football (3) the truly disgusting atrocity that is Chief Wahu.

Deutsche Bank chief John Cryan has shocked the financial sector by posting a quarterly profit after expectations sent economists running for the hills Wednesday. Deutsche Bank posted an unexpected quarterly profit, likely due to staff and bonus cuts. Deutsche announced an unexpected net profit of 278 million euros ($303 million) in the third quarter. Profit attributed to a modest rebound in bond trading that boosted all Wall Street banks. Cryan: The quarter had been overshadowed by talks over the DOJs settlement proposal relating to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Uncertainty had also taken its toll on ""financial planning and strategy execution”. Cryan’s letter to Deutsche staffers: The situation ""will stay difficult for a while,” and I am working to finalize the settlement ""as soon as possible”. Deutsche will also intensify major restructuring to counter a deteriorating environment for EU banking. Top ten shareholder: ""Fixed income is still oversized in terms of cost and on group level there are still 10,000 staff too many."" Deutsche Bank's CFO Marcus Schenck: Expect the fourth quarter trading business overall to exceed last year's performance. Cryan: Spending at least an hour a day explaining the bank's position to clients. ""To dispel any myths, I don't just sit poring over spreadsheets"". In Deutsche Banks retail and wealth management: Had assets of almost 440 billion euros, clients withdrew 9 billion euros in the third quarter. Deutsche has liquidity reserves of 200 billion euros, down from the 215 billion outlined on Sept. 30, and 223 billion euros in June. Deutsche increased their litigation reserves to 5.9 billion from 5.5 billion at the end of June. Deutsche revenue grew slightly at 7.5 billion euros, with bond trading earnings up 14 percent. Morgan Stanley analysts: ""Top down, revenues were stronger and the bank is delivering on costs with this quarter being a fourth consecutive one of declining operating expenses.” In contrast: Barclays on Thursday reported a 40 percent spike in its business. 
(FRANKFURT, GERMANY) Deutsche Bank chief John Cryan pledged to redouble restructuring efforts on Thursday, warning that it faces tough times finalizing talks with U.S. justice authorities over a multi billion dollar fine. 
Germany's biggest lender earlier posted an unexpected quarterly profit, benefiting from a modest rebound in bond trading, but failed to dispel the cloud of uncertainty that drove clients to withdraw billions of euros. 
Cryan said on a conference call that the quarter had been overshadowed by talks over the U.S. Department of Justice’s settlement proposal relating to sales of RMBS (residential mortgage-backed securities) which had caused uncertainty. 
As well as having an impact on investor and client views of the bank, this uncertainty had also taken its toll on ""financial planning and strategy execution"", Cryan added. 
Cryan warned Deutsche Bank employees in a letter that the situation ""will stay difficult for a while"" and said he was working to finalize the settlement ""as soon as possible"". 
Deutsche Bank would also intensify a major restructuring to counter a deteriorating environment for banking in Europe and elsewhere, Cryan said. 
However, a top ten shareholder called on the bank's management to make deeper cuts in its trading activities. ""Fixed income is still oversized in terms of cost and on group level there are still 10,000 staff too many."" 
Despite weeks of negative headlines, Deutsche was able to announce an unexpected net profit of 278 million euros ($303 million) in the third quarter, lifted by a surge in bond trading that boosted all Wall Street banks. 
This sent its shares to a more than one-month high, but they retreated in line with the market to be down 0.3 percent. 
Deutsche Bank's Chief Financial Officer Marcus Schenck also struck a positive note, saying he expects the fourth quarter trading business overall to exceed last year's performance. 
SPREADSHEET MYTH 

Cryan said he was spending at least an hour a day explaining the bank's position to clients, adding: ""To dispel any myths, I don't just sit poring over spreadsheets"". 
Negotiations over a $14 billion demand from the U.S. DoJ for misselling toxic mortgage-backed securities before the 2007-2009 financial crisis have set a bleak backdrop for Cryan. 
Thursday's results gave some insight into how this demand has rocked confidence in Deutsche Bank, which plays a critical role in financing some of Germany's biggest companies. 
In retail and wealth management, which had assets of almost 440 billion euros, clients withdrew 9 billion euros in the third quarter, Deutsche Bank revealed. Outflows had since abated, it said, although its global markets trading business was also hit. 
Cryan said the bank had liquidity reserves of 200 billion euros, a fall from the more than 215 billion he had outlined on Sept. 30. In June, the bank had 223 billion euros. 
Deutsche Bank set aside more money for its legal bill for numerous past missteps. Litigation reserves rose to 5.9 billion from 5.5 billion at the end of June. 
However, Deutsche Bank has so far not made a specific proposal for what it would be willing to pay to settle the RMBS case and has therefore not upped its provisions for it. It had hoped to settle the case for about $3 billion. 
Revenue grew slightly at 7.5 billion euros, ahead of analysts' expectations, mainly driven by Deutsche's trading, while business declined in other operating areas. 
""Top down, revenues were stronger and the bank is delivering on costs with this quarter being a fourth consecutive one of declining operating expenses,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley noted. 
Its bond trading, which has volatile earnings and tough capital requirements to meet, revenues were up 14 percent. But the rebound was less pronounced than at peers because of cuts Deutsche has made to the division. Barclays on Thursday reported a 40 percent spike in its business. 
In equities trading, Deutsche saw revenue fall as low stock market volatility gave investors less reason to trade, while revenue from corporate and investment banking fell by 1 percent.

25801,"‘South Park’: After Two Decades, It’s Still by the Seat of Their Pants - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   Every day at South Park Studios is different, but Trey Parker said this particular afternoon, Monday, Sept. 12, was especially memorable. “There are times where we go, ‘How do we tell Comedy Central we don’t have a show? ’” he said with sardonic delight. “This is one of those. ” Mr. Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of “South Park,” exuded an appearance of calm as they brainstormed in their airy offices, in a gray building on a stretch of highway at the edge of this city. But they were under considerable pressure to finish the first episode for the 20th season of this satirical animated series, which was due in less than 48 hours and would air that Wednesday. At this stage  —   on the ninth draft of a script called “Member Berries”  —   they would like to have 16 minutes of a   episode Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker said they had 12 and a half. (“That doesn’t mean that’s what we have done,” Mr. Parker cautioned. “That means that’s all we have figured out. ”) A   board in the room showed a nearly nonexistent third act, all empty ovals stacked like pancakes, as the collaborators kicked around the episode’s story elements: a new American national anthem rebooted by J. J. Abrams a comically inept xenophobe running for president and an addictive talking fruit that induces nostalgia for the   of one’s youth. How these pieces fit together wasn’t clear yet. But after two decades of making their show in this stressful,       way, Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker were reasonably certain they would figure out something. “I can’t believe I’m surprised by it,” Mr. Stone said. “How do we get to this point and have no story? But we just go through it again. For the eight millionth time. ” Since its debut in 1997, “South Park” has spun more than 250 tales about   fourth graders in a Colorado town that invariably gets swept up in whatever social crisis the nation is facing that week. What began with a show about aliens installing a satellite in a child’s butt has evolved  —   sort of  —   into a series that, in its unapologetically crude way, can address debates over transgender bathrooms, racial discrimination or gratuitous sex and violence in “Game of Thrones. ” Even as animation technology has improved and the “South Park” staff has grown exponentially, the show is still fundamentally the work of Mr. Parker, 46, and Mr. Stone, 45, who agonize over every installment. (Mr. Parker has had sole writing and directing credit on all but a few episodes since 2001.) The mechanics of making the show haven’t changed much, but Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have. The   punks who were on LSD at the 2000 Academy Awards have grown up: Mr. Stone telecommutes half the week to be with his wife and children in New York, while Mr. Parker’s office is strewn with the   toys of his    daughter. In its 20th year, “South Park” offers a pointed and, surprisingly,   platform for commentary on current events. New episodes typically draw around two million viewers, many of them the   to    that advertisers covet, a showing that Comedy Central decidedly needs while its   lineup is in flux and other signature franchises like “Inside Amy Schumer” are on hiatus. “For a network that no longer has Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart, having ‘South Park’ is extremely important to us,” said Doug Herzog, the president of Viacom’s Music and Entertainment Group, which includes Comedy Central. “With all due respect to Jon and ‘The Daily Show,’ ‘South Park’ is the foundation on which Comedy Central is built. ” If the earliest “South Park” episodes reflected a juvenile desire to see what they could get away with on television, their later work suggests Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone have honed their ability to channel their growing exasperation with a polarized world into comedy. Vernon Chatman, a comedy writer who has worked on “South Park” for more than 15 years, said that Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have thrived by embracing their roles in “their     relationship. ” “Matt has this sharp, analytical mind that’s focused and relentless,” he said. “Trey has the dreamy, emotional storyteller thing. ” Mr. Chatman added, “To be in such a heightened, intense relationship, with so much stakes and pressure on it  —   the fact that they haven’t killed each other is incredible. ” Already, Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone had spent this Monday in a multihour meeting with Mr. Chatman and Anne Garefino, an executive producer, talking through plot points for “Member Berries” and shooting them down. “If we only have three scenes left to write, that’s a win,” Ms. Garefino said. “It’s when you still have that whole last act  —   ” Her voice trailed off. In the afternoon, Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker caromed from office to office in a building decorated with their trophies  —   “South Park” toys and memorabilia framed posters from their Tony   Broadway musical, “The Book of Mormon”  —   while trying to bring “Member Berries” into focus. For a few minutes, Mr. Parker stepped into a recording booth to perform the voices of two football announcers introducing the new national anthem, while Mr. Stone directed him to be more excitable. Then it was off to an editing suite, where Mr. Parker reviewed a vividly vulgar montage featuring Mr. Garrison, the “South Park” character who has turned into a buffoonish populist demagogue, describing exactly how he’d bring death to America’s enemies. Mr. Parker writes in private, emerging occasionally to pull Mr. Stone from wherever he might be and ask his help. In the writers’ room, the two creators were trying to pin down the motivations of Randy Marsh, the show’s ambivalent adult moral compass, as he grapples with a presidential race between two candidates he dislikes and decides whether he should try the narcotic member berries. Where should Randy be introduced to the enticing fruit  —   at a bar or in a friend’s house? Do the berries come in boxes or grow in bunches? Mr. Parker was in constant motion as he considered each question, walking many agitated laps around a long conference table. Together, he and Mr. Stone improvised a scene in which the exhortations of the talking berries grow more sinister: Remember “Star Wars”? Remember being a kid? Remember feeling safe? Remember no immigrants? As Mr. Parker stepped away to resume his solitary work, Mr. Stone explained that his role in these moments was to be a sounding board for Mr. Parker but also to remind him that he’s just got to write something down. “There’s no other way to do it,” Mr. Stone said. “If you don’t have that one perfect line, you can fix that later. ” In a phone interview a few days earlier, Mr. Parker explained how he and Mr. Stone had abandoned their preseason ritual of holding a writers’ retreat to drink, carouse and think up ideas. “As soon as we’re like, ‘We could do this, this could be funny,’ we’re like, ‘Stop talking about it,’” Mr. Parker said. “Because in two months, when we’re doing the show, it won’t be funny to us anymore. ” Being more extemporaneous, he said, led to unexpected discoveries like their 19th season in 2015, presented as 10 interconnected episodes that told a broader story about gentrification, identity politics and a perceived resurgence of political correctness. The renewed debate about sensitivity in speech and the policing of language was one that “South Park” could not avoid, for its own sake. “This might finally be the year that we get run out of town,” Mr. Parker recalled thinking at the time. “If we’re going to, let’s make fun of the fact that we’re the old guys at the table. All those shows were an honest part of us going, ‘Should we go away? ’” Instead, the 19th season was a critical hit in a review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that “South Park” had “gone and revitalized itself,” in part “by asserting that it takes an outrageous comedy to capture an era of outrage. ” Mr. Herzog, who has worked with Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone since the debut of “South Park,” said they have Comedy Central’s “absolute, 1, 000 percent eternal trust. ” As long as the show satisfies the network’s Standards and Practices department, he said, “we’re cool with the show. ” Yet that success created more angst for Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker as they approached Season 20. Were they obligated to tell a serialized narrative again? Did they have to dwell on the 2016 campaign, when their indifference to presidential politics is a   subject? All they can do, the “South Park” creators said, is continue to apply a principle that has guided them from the beginning. No matter how serious an issue seems, Mr. Parker said, “Looking at it with a sense of humor is not only healthier for you, it actually makes you think more clearly about things  —   being able to make fun of either side of an issue, rather than just, ‘Trump is evil and Clinton is good. ’” “There’s always room to equally rip on both of them,” he said. Comedy Central has signed Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone to keep making “South Park” through 2019. Ms. Garefino, who has worked on the show for 19 of its 20 years, suggested they could stick around longer still. “They said they didn’t still want to be making ‘South Park’ when they were 40,” she said. “I think they’ll be doing it when they’re 50. ” She tried to make herself sound as confident that the current episode would be completed under deadline. “There’s always a moment where Trey will fall in love with the show, and the pages start flowing,” she said. “Something will happen. ” “Member Berries” was broadcast at 10 p. m. on Sept. 14, but hardly without   incident. That morning, South Park Studios suffered a system crash, and the episode’s audio went missing for an hour and a half. When the episode was transmitted to Comedy Central, it had a mystery   sync problem that was finally fixed and delivered one hour before airtime. The following day, Ms. Garefino said, “Trey’s like, ‘I think from now, we should think about getting the show in earlier. ’” Even “South Park” would have to bleep out Ms. Garefino’s response.",1
25804,Trump Weighs Infrastructure Bill but Keeps New York Up in the Air - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump said he was considering “accelerating” the introduction of his $1 trillion infrastructure bill  —   but he pointedly refused to say whether he planned to include two major New York City transportation projects that his budget for next year would defund. Mr. Trump, speaking in a   interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, described the infrastructure package as a   legislative sweetener that he could attach to a revived Affordable Care Act repeal bill or tax code overhaul to attract bipartisan support that thus far he had neither sought nor received. “Infrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill,” said Mr. Trump, who is in need of a legislative win after the humbling defeat of his health care bill last month. “Infrastructure is so popular with the Democrats and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too. ” The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on   and   real estate development, has proposed eliminating an   infrastructure program that would have funded   proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem. State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattan’s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012. As Mr. Trump discussed his plan, hundreds of thousands of commuters endured a third day of upheaval prompted by a minor derailment at Pennsylvania Station, another reminder of the decrepit, tenuous state of much of the region’s infrastructure and transit systems. Mr. Trump said he planned to examine both New York projects and submit them to an   unformed “commission” headed by Richard LeFrak, a fellow scion of a prominent Queens real estate family, and Steven Roth, the chairman of the New   Vornado Realty Trust. “Well, I may support them,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m going to look at them. ” “I did great in real estate in New York,” he added. “I know all the developers. I know all of the folks. I know the good ones and the bad ones. And I’m setting up a commission of very smart people that know how to spend money properly. That know how to build on time, on budget. And ideally, under time and under budget. ” New York leaders were not impressed. “Welcome to the party,” said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. “The governor has been saying that we need to rebuild our airports for years, but unlike Washington, we aren’t just talking about needed improvements we are already in the process of rebuilding them. This is exactly why the federal government needs to follow through on its promise to fund infrastructure projects. ” Mitchell Moss, the director of New York University’s Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management, predicted that Mr. Trump, spurred on by his daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner, would eventually come through for the city. “   is a nice place to golf, but New York is where Donald Trump grew up, and it’s where he will return,” Mr. Moss said, referring to Mr. Trump’s Florida resort. “At the end of the day, Donald, Ivanka and Jared are going to come back here, and they know the city needs a   infrastructure. ” It is not that the president thinks the city is not in need. “I think it’s in poor shape,” he said of New York’s infrastructure. “The highways are in poor shape. ” “I think the airports are a horror show,” he added. “I’ve traveled the world, I know the world. ” Mr. Trump, whose knowledge of complex policy issues can sometimes be lacking, then offered a scathing critique of the bent and battered metal median guards on the Van Wyck Expressway not far from his childhood home in Queens. “Whoever the person is that owns that company is a genius salesman,” he said, as his aides  —   who wanted to talk about their bigger plans  —   grew restless in their carved armchairs. “That is the worst garbage. I think it bends by the heat, because not that many cars could possibly hit it. It’s the worst garbage. And I also think it’s dangerous because it’s a spear. And if you hit those things, they come flying apart. And if you’re driving, you’ve got yourself a problem. ” Mr. Trump confessed that he had not personally driven in a while, and that it had been years since he had ridden the subway. “It’s been a long time. It’s been a long time,” he said. “I know the subway system very well. I used to take it to   School, in Forest Hills, when I lived in Queens. And I’d take the subway to school. Seems a long time ago. I’d take it from Jamaica, 179th Street. Jamaica, right? To Forest Hills. I understand the subway very well. I used to ride between the cars. ” Referring to his parents, he added, “They weren’t thrilled when they heard that. ” Mr. Trump, at the advice of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence, had intended to tackle health care first  —   gaining hundreds of billions of dollars in cost savings  —   that would then be rolled into an ambitious tax cut package. Infrastructure, according to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other top administration officials, was something the administration would handle when the other two bills were passed. But the health care debacle has scuttled the president’s plans, and he is considering merging one or all of the proposals in the hopes of cobbling together a coalition. The idea of merging a big infrastructure plan with a tax proposal is not new: Shortly after taking office in 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a similar idea  —   and his stimulus package included more than $300 billion in tax breaks intended to spur infrastructure and capital investments to stimulate growth. Mr. Trump is confident he will attract Democratic support  —   even though he has not spoken with the minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, for weeks. He said Democrats were “desperate for infrastructure  —   that’s the thing that they want. ” Mr. Schumer said he was eager to start negotiations but not especially hopeful. “He hasn’t put out anything specific yet,” the senator said. The president, surrounded by staff members including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Reed Cordish, an assistant to Mr. Trump  —   refused to say how much direct public funding would be included in his proposal. A senior administration official directly involved in drafting the plan said that number would be in the $200 billion to $300 billion range over the next decade, with the balance of the package paid for by tax credits. Mr. Schumer and many congressional Democrats say they will never agree to such large tax breaks for developers and builders, despite the president’s claim that they will fold. And even as Mr. Trump trumpeted the curative political tonic of the infrastructure bill, his aides were on hand to remind him that they had their own priorities, too. “He’s spending an enormous amount of time on trade and taxes,” Mr. Cohn said, interrupting the talk of trains, planes and automobiles. “Those are two big areas. ” A few minutes later, Mr. Cohn  —   who is ascendant in Mr. Trump’s circle  —   let out a colossal sneeze. Perhaps that is why the president paid such close attention to Mr. Cohn’s physical  . “God bless you. You O. K. Gary?” the president said. “That was a pretty tough one. I’ve got to make sure my man is all right. ”",1
25810,The Birth Bump – Do You Feel Like Were Born Into The Wrong Family?,"By Cameron Day
Have you ever felt like you ended up in the wrong family? Did you grow up feeling that you were so incredibly different from your parents and siblings, that there must have been some sort of mistake for you to end up with those people? I’m not talking about feeling out of place in the insanity of the current era of human society, I’m talking about something much deeper — a sense that your very parents are not who you were meant to be born to.
If you have felt this way, please keep reading, as this may be very important information for you. 
I have written at length about the ongoing battle to free humanity from the enslavement of the forces of darkness in articles like “ Never Call Them Archons ”, “ First Contact Is Not Happening Soon ”, “ Shifting into 2013 ” and many others. The central theme of these articles is to illustrate that humanity is mired in multiple layers of illusion, deception, energy-draining/harvesting, trauma, manipulation, subjugation and much more. While this is an incredibly beautiful planet, the true beauty of humanity is being actively suppressed by forces that want to keep humans enslaved. At the same time, positively oriented guardians of free will have been working to free humanity from its energetic bonds of slavery, while being careful to avoid creating further trauma within the enslaved populace.
How Do You Free Slaves Who Believe They Are Already Free? One of the many challenges to this undertaking is that people are repeatedly told that they are free, that their government cares for them, and that those ugly things like pollution and war are inevitable aspects of “the human condition.” More accurate would be to say that the conditioning and programming imposed on humans produces the horrors of abuse, environmental destruction and war. In order to show people how they have been enslaved, and present them with alternative ways of living, positively oriented beings from higher densities of creation chose to incarnate into human form.
In doing so, the free will of humanity is not subjected to a new outside authority arriving and dispensing belief-shattering truth upon the fragile minds of enslaved and abused humans. Instead, positive social change begins to happen from within the race as awakening individuals point out the insanity of the “human condition” and show others how to live in alignment with Earth and natural laws. This is an effective tactic, although it is slow to produce change, and is filled with risks.
Due to the overpowered “veil of forgetfulness” that is in operation on the planet, the incarnating helper-soul completely forgets their true identity, takes on a human ego identity, and risks the possibility that they may not awaken to the truth of their mission. Another risk is that the incarnating helper-soul will experience severe traumas that prevent their awakening, or worse, that these traumas will orient their ego towards serving the darkness that they are fighting against. Despite all the risks, many millions of brave souls have incarnated on this planet because we are soldiers who fight for the Infinite Source of all creation, and because humanity is worth fighting for.
Parachuting Into a War Zone Many people don’t fully realize it, but this planet is a war zone, and the battle is being fought mostly in the more subtle densities of the planet instead of in 3d with guns and bombs. That’s a good thing for the most part. However, for a helper-soul from a higher density to “parachute” into this war zone, there is a major risk of “landing” in the wrong incarnational vehicle (body) due to dark-side interference.
When a being chooses the family they want to incarnate into, they attach a filament of energy into the developing fetus. This attachment allows them to stake their claim on the fetus so that they can enter the body more fully once it is close to being born, or shortly after birth. In a perfect world, this process would proceed smoothly without interference. On a war-zone like Earth, this process can be disrupted.
The forces of darkness, which I call ankle-biters, would prefer to never allow a helper-soul to incarnate on their heavily controlled planet. However, they cannot stop us from entering, so they use different tactics to attack the incoming helper-soul. One of their favorite methods is what I call the “Birth Bump.”
The birth bump is usually done on the day the baby is being delivered, because this is normally when the incarnating being comes much more strongly into the infant body. During this time, there is a window of opportunity for the dark forces to rip the original filament attachment from the intended body and attach it to a baby being born elsewhere on the same day. The incarnating being’s incoming energy follows their filament, and ends up settling into a body and a birth family that they did not choose.
Because this is a dark-side attack, the family that the incoming helper-soul gets bumped into is selected based on their propensity for abuse, neglect, mistreatment, lack of empathy, and so on. This allows the dark forces to effectively neutralize an incoming soldier for the true light, without having to expend nearly as much time and energy on attacking that person as would be necessary if the helper-soul had been born into a loving, supportive home. Sometimes the gender of the body the being ends up in is different from what they had chosen, creating even more confusion and difficulty for the incarnating being.
The bad parenting of the “pseudo-parents” serves as a source of constant torment for the infant helper-soul, and they grow up taking on the negative programming of their dysfunctional pseudo-parents. Physical, emotional, mental and even sexual abuse all take their toll on the helper-soul, making their job of waking up, getting clear and fighting against the forces of darkness vastly more difficult.
Sometimes the pseudo-parents aren’t overtly abusive, but are still a complete energetic mismatch to the helper-soul. As the child displays budding psychic abilities, the parents will ridicule their perceptions. Or if the child is repelled by certain actions of the family, they will be forced to conform to the family’s normalcy biases. Essentially, the pseudo-parents continually attempt to coerce conformity from the helper-soul child, who they don’t understand at all.
When the bumped helper-soul grows up and begins the process of self-clearing, releasing their past, gaining clarity and balance, all it takes is a visit or phone call from their manipulative, aggressive, judgmental, blaming pseudo-parents to put them into a downward spiral of negativity.
From the dark forces perspective, this is their most efficient strategy to combat the influx of helper-souls onto planet earth. It requires almost no energy output to impulse a darkness-riddled pseudo-parent to call their grown offspring and project a load of judgmental, guilt-ridden energy upon them. Conversely, for the dark forces to psychically attack an individual requires much more time, planning, energy and resources.
Eject! Eject! The newly bumped helper-soul, upon realizing what has happened, has a choice to make: Either “eject” from this body and try to find a new one, or stick it out with the hopes of overcoming the traumatizing childhood later on. The ones who choose to “eject” simply evacuate the body and it dies, manifesting as “crib death” or “Sudden Infant Death Syndrome” where the otherwise healthy baby suddenly dies. Not all cases of crib death are from this unusual scenario, but some of them are.
For the helper-souls who are brave (or over-confident) enough that they choose to stay, life becomes a daily grind of feeling unloved, alone, unsupported, abused, and alienated. Their earthly home feels like a war-zone where they can be attacked at any time for no reason, where every action can be criticized and result in being berated or spanked (which is just a nice word for hitting a defenseless child).
Boys in this type of situation usually leave home as early as possible, often before 18 years of age. Depending on the culture, girls often try to get out by marrying as soon as possible, or by going to study at a school far from home. Regardless of the gender or culture, the drive to get away from the family is usually extremely strong. This is often fodder for more guilt-projection from the pseudo-parents lamenting that their offspring “doesn’t love them” when in reality, they are just trying to protect themselves from the toxic projections of their pseudo-parents.
Finding a Safe Distance Along with healing and clearing the stored emotional pains of the past, bumped helper-souls need to energetically disconnect from their parents. The more abusive and painful the childhood, the more distance that is necessary. This starts with living in a different town, not calling too often, and not allowing the parents to project their stuff onto you. If you find yourself in a phone call where a wave of negativity is being projected onto you, just say “I’m not going to listen to this” and hang up!
Energetically disconnecting from one’s “bumped family” can be tricky, as they will often call after a major energetic disconnection event. On some level they feel the disconnection, and will attempt to pull you back into their dramas and energetic baggage. This is where standing strong and refusing to engage their particular brand of craziness is essential.
Please understand that I am only advocating that bumped helper-souls create this distance from their dysfunctional and abusive families. I do not advocate this for anyone who had normal, non-abusive families, even if they don’t really understand what you do as a helper-soul. What it actually means to establish a safe distance for those who were bumped into abusive families will differ from person to person.
Creating Your Comfort Zone For bumped helper-souls, how much distance from your pseudo-parents you create is up to you and your Higher Self. I would recommend a few things in this regard. First, don’t waste too much of your time and energy trying to get your pseudo-parents to admit what a bad job they did in raising you. Even if they do admit to some of their mistakes and apologize, it won’t alter their fundamental behavior, and they will still push your same buttons when you talk to them.
Second, stop arguing with them about your own life choices on the phone or in person. You have probably already tried that for years, and gotten nowhere. It is impossible to have real communication with a human being in a state of denial and guilt-projection. If a conversation starts to turn into an argument, just end it and hang up, or leave.
Third, do not let them come to your home. Make your home a sanctuary from the ills of the world, especially your pseudo-parents. Do or say whatever you need to keep them out of your home, so that you can end any downward-spiraling conversations by leaving the situation. It is much easier for you to leave a place than to make someone leave your home.
Fourth, consider writing them a letter detailing their mistreatment of you and explaining why you are disconnecting from them. A person can’t interrupt a letter, they just have to read it and attempt to deny things after the fact. Writing a letter like this can be a difficult experience that brings up old, painful memories, so make sure that you have done a lot of self-clearing and healing before you go this route. I usually only recommend this if you are going to also consider the next step as well.
Fifth, end all contact. This is an extreme measure for extreme circumstances. If the abuse you experienced as a child is still being perpetuated in various, more subtle ways by the pseudo-parents, your best option to maintain your equilibrium is to end all contact with them. This works best if you are living in a different town, and have already begun creating distance.
Be prepared for an onslaught of projected guilt and other forms of drama as they try to hang on, and be firm in your convictions that you are not going to be dragged back into their dysfunctional world. Writing the letter to detail their past and present dysfunctional behavior will make it clear to them exactly why they are being cut off, which will preempt any attempt for them to act like victims or project guilt and blame onto you. They will be unable to utter anything like “After all we’ve done for you” if your letter is thorough and detailed. The letter will make clear to them that “After all you’ve done to me, this is the end.”
The Art of Forgiveness Once you have established your safe boundaries and worked diligently on healing yourself, there will come a point in your process where forgiveness is needed. This forgiveness is for you and your own peace of mind. It does not require that you call the pseudo-parents and tell them that you are forgiving them, or to reestablish contact with them if you have broken it off. Forgiveness occurs within your heart and mind, and does not need to be spoken about in order to be effective for your own inner peace.
While your outward actions towards your pseudo-parents will not change, your inner perception will gradually shift as you incorporate forgiveness into your self-clearing and healing efforts. When you reach a “sticking point” in your clearing process, visualize them and say to them through your Higher Self, “I forgive you for (that particular dysfunctional behavior).” Repeat it as many times as needed, and allow your Higher Self to multiply the energy of your forgiveness so that it can clear out the frozen emotions and traumas within your subconscious mind more and more deeply.
The deeper purpose of this forgiveness is so that you can think about the pseudo-parents, or the events of your childhood, without dropping into a low-frequency state of depression, despair, victimization or hatred. Over time, your inner perspective on the pseudo-parents will shift, and you will be able to understand how they came to be so dysfunctional, which is usually from their own parents being abusive or neglectful. When you can think of them simply as damaged human beings who deserve pity more than hate, you will know that you are well on your way.
Dropping the False Ego-Identity It is vitally important that bumped helper-souls release every aspect of the false sense of self that they were imprinted with during their traumatic childhood. This is true for all light-workers as well, even those who had good parents. A central part of the 3d incarnation mission is to transcend the ego identity formed in this lifetime and remember our real reason for being here, then take action on that mission. We didn’t come here to support the matrix of illusions and lies, to accrue fame or wealth of fiat currency.
We came here to render that entire paradigm obsolete by revealing the truth of the human being, that humanity is a divine species that has been corrupted by darkness and evil, and this must be acknowledged in order to heal our species-wide trauma. We came here to transform and rebuild the fragmented DNA of our bodies, to help others to do the same, so that we can live in 3D vessels that reflect the Divine Inner Self that is our true identity. We came here to help the entire human race heal, which means healing ourselves.
This is a monumental task to be sure, and those of you who were bumped have even more work to do, but you can do it. You were strong enough to choose to ride out the roller coaster of a “bumped life” and still fulfill your mission, and you maintained that strength throughout the trials and tribulations of your childhood. Tap into that strength of will, heal yourself, clear the baggage out of your subconscious mind, and begin working on your mission.
If you haven’t already done so, I urge you to work with the Self-Clearing System Level 1 and Level 2 and make those clearing techniques part of your tool box. The Energy Refund and Reclaiming Energy processes should be done daily to ensure that you are not energetically wrestling with your pseudo-parents. For childhood traumas, use the “backpack of pain” process in Level 2 on a daily basis until you feel a significant, lasting shift in your consciousness. Also, use the “three galaxies” process at the end of Level 2 daily (with or without the recording) to keep your personal energy flowing smoothly.
You can transcend the traumas of your past if you are determined, persistent, patient and gentle with yourself. Always remember that who you really are is far more than this one single lifetime, and that you can access the vast consciousness that is your True / Higher / Divine Inner Self to help you heal from the past. Most of all, focus on loving yourself exactly as you are right now, traumas and baggage included. Cultivate that love with your focus on the goal of being fully healed, clear and filled with the light of your true, Divine Inner Self.
Much Love,

25811,Comey Accused of Interfering in US Presidential Election,"Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN H ad Comey recommended Hillary be held criminally responsible for mishandling classified State Department documents last July, along with perjury for lying to the FBI and Congress, a firestorm of criticism wouldn’t have followed his Friday announcement. 
1. THE COMEY IMBROGLIO 
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D. NV) accused him of “tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo,” saying his action “appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another” – claiming he “may have broken the law,” citing the 1939 Hatch Act (An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities). It prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity – exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. Proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. .. According to the Wall Street Journal , within the FBI, there was “ sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign.” .. In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said “(w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power.” .. Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying “Comey’s critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim.” .. A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comey’s October surprise. .. The Washington Post said the Justice Department’s public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate “evidence to move forward.” The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation – a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming “no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body” took place. .. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comey’s “vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest” – claiming he “violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.” .. Holder disgraced the office he held. Law Professor Francis Boyle called him “a total disaster for the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Human Rights and the Rule of Law.” Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Hillary changed the subject, saying “ there’s a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We won’t be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us.” .. Clearly, Comey’s bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid we’ll know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop – estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. .. 
It could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and January’s inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. 
2. INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS & SELF-INFLICTED POLITICAL IDIOCY 
Harvard Undergrads for Hillary 
OVERWHELMING SYSTEMIC PROPAGANDA ALLIED WITH A PERVASIVE INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS CONSPIRE TO KEEP MINDS THAT SHOULD KNOW BETTER FROM SEEING THE MOST ELEMENTARY TRUTHS. BEING OFFICIALLY “SMART” IS NO VACCINE AGAINST THE BRAINWASH. A ccording to the student newspaper Harvard Crimson’s October survey , 87% of undergrads support Hillary. A scant 6% back Trump, 5.8% for Libertarian Gary (“what’s Aleppo”) Johnson, and less than 1% for Harvard College and Medical School graduate Jill Stein – the only people’s candidate running. .. Around one-third of undergrads responded (2,128 out of a total 6,645 student body) – so the views of nonrespondents aren’t known. About 91% are eligible to vote in November. Eligibility begins at age 18. A surprising 96% of respondents intend voting, they said. .. The national average is far lower. Whether this year’s contentious election encourages a larger than usual turnout remains to be seen. The Crimson poll was conducted from October 10 – 20 – before FBI Director Comey’s October surprise. Whether it would have changed the results is unknown. Two-thirds of respondents said they support Democrat party candidates, 12% calling themselves Republicans, 19% saying they’re independents. .. Trump and Hillary are the most widely reviled presidential aspirants in US history. Yet 70% of Crimson respondents view her favorably – showing little knowledge of her deplorable public record since the 1990s unless they support her war crimes, racketeering and perjury. What to make of it? Undergrads enter Harvard (and other colleges) as teenagers, young and naive as I was when entering the college long ago. .. After graduation, I discovered the meaning of the term “commencement.” Institutions like Harvard teach students to be good citizens, omitting the ugly stuff about US imperialism, officials advancing it, waging endless wars of aggression. .. The so-called Korean War was ongoing when I was there, an incentive to maintain good grades, stay in school, avoid being drafted and sent to North Korea’s frozen Chosin, an expression used by members of my class. .. The Paper Chase Hollywood film (1973) featured John Houseman as stern Harvard Law School Professor Charles Kingsfield. His most memorable line on day one for first year students was saying “(y)ou teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds. You come here with a skull full of mush. You leave thinking like a lawyer.” .. I began my freshman year “with a skull full of mush,” gradually extracting it. College and graduate school taught me to think. Learning and comprehension mostly came later. The older I get, the greater my understanding of world and national issues. .. I’m long removed from campus life. Back then, students had none of the advantages available today – no computers, no Internet. Daily writing I dearly love now was a dreaded chore back then – requiring research by rolodex cards and library stacks, a time-consuming process. Except for the type primary research I did for my master’s thesis, most everything needed today for compositions or articles like mine is available on our desktops. .. It’s understandable why young minds haven’t achieved the wisdom of the ages. Still it’s disturbing to find Harvard undergrads uninformed and out-of-touch on Hillary’s deplorable public record – when it’s so easy to research it and know what she and husband Bill are all about. .. Why hasn’t the Harvard student body done its homework for perhaps the most important election in our lifetime. The stakes are huge – possible war on Russia with Hillary empowered or improved bilateral relations under Trump. Nothing matters more than saving humanity from the scourge of catastrophic thermonuclear war able to kill us all.

25816,Cubans Planning to Leave for U.S. Face a Bleak New Reality - The New York Times,"HAVANA  —   Andrés Iván and his girlfriend grew up in Cuba but had long planned their future in the United States. She left four months ago to find work and made it to Miami, where she was legally welcomed. He stayed in Havana, knowing the United States’ special treatment of Cubans gave him the freedom to rejoin her and marry when the moment was right. Those dreams were dashed on Thursday, when President Obama announced the immediate end of the longstanding policy under which any Cuban who made it to American soil was admitted and placed on a glide path to citizenship. “Our relationship has been built on two things: love, and the idea that we will create a life together in the U. S.  —   whether that’s in one year or five,” Mr. Iván said here on Friday. “Now I have to realign my entire life plan. ” He is among an untold numbers of Cubans doing so, including what could be thousands stranded midjourney, whether by boat or by land, often through Mexico. Those who arrived at border stations in Arizona, California and Texas on Thursday were let in. Those still on the Mexican side were left to consider whether to try to sneak across or hire smugglers to take them into a country that as of Friday would treat them as illegal entrants, just like those from other countries. Alexander Iglesias Rodríguez, 41, a veterinarian who reared cows in Cienfuegos on Cuba’s southern coast, left the country on Wednesday, six weeks after his wife and his son, Gabriel, 16. They flew to Mexico and then crossed the border in Matamoros. He delayed his departure so as not to draw attention from immigration authorities in Cuba and Mexico. He sold his 1956 Pontiac, his   head of cattle and his   house, pulling together about $12, 000. He was in Mexico about to cross into the United States when the order came down. “So many years dreaming about this,” Mr. Iglesias said. Now he is in limbo, unsure if he should wait or make a stab at seeking asylum in the United States, a request the government does not always grant. “What do I have in Cuba? Nothing. My wife is in the United States. My son is in the United States. I sold everything I had. I can’t go back. ” Also eliminated on Thursday was a program that allowed Cuban doctors posted to other countries to more easily migrate to America, leaving Ayme Monges, 25, stuck in Bogotá, Colombia, on Friday with all her paperwork in order but nowhere to go. “I got to the embassy this morning and they said, ‘You are Cuban? You can’t pass. That program is frozen,’” Dr. Monges, who had been working in Venezuela, said in a phone interview. “I am stranded here in this country. ” The number of Cubans leaving for America has surged since the two governments resumed relations in late 2014, in expectation that the policy  —   known as “wet foot, dry foot” because those caught at sea were sent back but those who made it to dry land were allowed to stay  —   might end. A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with agency policy, said the administration decided to end the program immediately to prevent a mass exodus that would risk lives at land and sea. In Cuba, the abrupt change seemed to further divide people along generational lines. Many older Cubans said the decision was a just one that would halt the steady drain of the nation’s citizens  —   especially educated ones like doctors  —   to America. One man, selling copies of the   newspaper Granma on the street, said the measure was necessary to stop “undermining the Cuban government” by enticing people to “throw their fates to the sea. ” But younger Cubans, for whom the prospect of a life in America offers a glimmer of hope amid economic hardship, were crushed, forced to envision a future with fewer options. Cuban identity, and pride, is in no small part forged by its relationship with the United States, both in the tiny country’s defiance of its bigger neighbor and then in the unique privileges afforded to those who fled and made it to America. To be suddenly placed on equal footing with the millions of others around the world hoping to do the same was an especially hard fall. In Havana, where until recently the internet has been out of reach for most ordinary Cubans, the city’s relatively new   parks have become stations of despair following the announcement. For a nation robbed of connectivity for more than a decade, the sudden surge of digital news  —   through email, messaging and social media  —   seemed like a particularly cruel way to find out their special treatment had ended. A few blocks from the American Embassy, in the neighborhood of Vedado, the casual atmosphere changed suddenly as the news began to spread. Visitors checking their phones shared the news with those within shouting distance. One youth yelled to the gathered crowds: “Have you heard? This screws up all your lives. ” Miguel Alberto Escalona, 24, sat with his wife in a park in Vedado, bewildered. He sent a text to his family in Miami decrying the change. The news also brought to the surface frustrations for young Cubans, especially concerning the new dynamic that an increase in tourism is bringing to the nation. Food prices have surged to meet the demand, while what scant resources the country are redirected to the   outsiders now flooding Cuba, especially Americans. “I’m totally against the change in the law,” Mr. Escalona wrote to his family. “Here in Cuba, we have nothing to live for. Our country is for foreigners, not for our people, no wonder people want to leave. ” For years, most Cubans have been willing to overlook that the policy was unfair to other nationalities, especially to Central Americans, many of whom were fleeing violence at home. But for many on Friday, having had the policy and suddenly losing it was somehow worse, especially if you were in the midst of planning an escape. One young man, who was building his own boat to take to America, sat in the Vedado park, stunned. He said he was nearly finished with the boat, and his departure had been imminent. Those plans now dashed, he began browsing the web for a prospective bride, suggesting he would pay up to $3, 000 to any woman willing to marry him and bring him to the United States. “My plan A was to leave in a boat,” he said with a rueful smile. “So I guess my plan B is to marry an American woman. ” While Mr. Obama’s announcement was met with chagrin among some groups in Cuba, the government applauded the change in American policy, which they have long complained about, especially the program allowing Cuban doctors to immigrate to the United States. Since the program began 10 years ago, nearly 10, 000 Cuban medical professionals have been approved for residency in the United States. Many of them were Cuban doctors sent on medical missions to friendly countries like Venezuela, a program that critics of the Cuban government likened to human trafficking, since the government took in billions of dollars a year in fees from the doctors’ host countries. For those without a career path, the loss of an American escape hatch left them with even fewer employment options. It struck especially hard on those, like Mr. Iván, with deep ties to family and loved ones in the United States. (He declined to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal by the Cuban government.) His brother made the trek four years ago, through Mexico, and is now living the American dream: a mortgage, a car and a job that pays him a living wage. Now, Mr. Iván is left with a   remorse for having not acted sooner. And he wonders if he will ever be reunited with his girlfriend. On Friday morning, he was even having trouble reaching her, given the   communication in Cuba. He checked his phone incessantly, hoping for a text from her. “With each blow like this, I feel farther and farther away from you,” he typed to her, frustrated about the shaky   connection. Accepting the reality of the new situation, and without a plan, he sent another message: “I want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always love you. ”",1
25819,Car bomb kills over 80 people south of Iraqi capital,"Iraq Iraqi firefighters work to extinguish the fire caused by a car bomb explosion at a gas station near the city of Hilla, November 24, 2016. 
A car bomb has reportedly exploded south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, killing around 100 people, mostly Shia pilgrims. 
According to security sources, a truck loaded with explosives went off on Thursday at a gas station in the Shomali village in the suburbs of the city of al-Hilla, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of the capital Baghdad and around 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Karbala. 
Reports say most of the victims were Iranian nationals. The photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near Hilla, south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, November 24, 2016. 
The incident occurred at a time when buses packed with Shia pilgrims were parked at the gas station. The people were returning from Arba’een mourning rituals in the holy city of Karbala. 
“At least seven buses with pilgrims were inside the petrol station at the time,” an unnamed police lieutenant colonel told AFP. People carry away the bodies of victims from the site of a bomb attack near Hilla, Iraq, November 24, 2016. 
AFP also quoted an unnamed police intelligence source as saying that “those buses were loaded with Iranians, Bahrainis and Iraqis. Ambulances and civil defense are on their way to the site.” 
The Takfiri Daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing. 
In recent weeks, Daesh has resorted to similar acts of violence in areas outside its control in a desperate attempt to undermine a large Iraqi battle aimed at liberating the northern city of Mosul, the terror group’s last remaining foothold in the country. 
‘Iran won’t waver in backing Iraq’ 
Hours after the incident, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly condemned the fatal terrorist blast, expressing sympathy with the Iraqi government and nation as well as all the families of the victims. 
Touching on reports that Iranian citizens were among the victims, Bahram Qassemi said, “The Foreign Ministry and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s Embassy in Baghdad are investigating the issue with seriousness” and will take necessary measures in that regard. 
The Iranian official also stressed that such pre-planned and savage assaults emanate from the desperation of the terrorists, who are taking successive blows on the battlefield. 
“These brutal and inhumane acts will not affect the Iraqi government and nation’s determination and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s support for the oppressed Iraqi people in the unrelenting fight against terrorism,” Qassemi said.

‘Terrorists killing pilgrims will be brought to justice’ 
In another development, Iraq’s President Fuad Masum strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Hilla, emphasizing that such terrorist crimes would not go unpunished. 
Issuing an official statement hours after the terrorist attack, which was claimed by the Daesh Takfiri group, Masum emphasized that terrorists, who target the lives of innocent pilgrims traveling to Iraq from Islamic countries, will be brought to justice. 
He also called on Iraq’s security forces to double their efforts and take necessary measures to uproot terrorist groups that endanger the life and safety of the pilgrims visiting Iraq’s holy shrines.

‘Takfiris spilling blood in the name of religion’ 
Meanwhile, Lebanon’s resistance movement, Hezbollah, condemned the explosion as a crime committed by the terrorists, who have no conscience and spill the blood of innocents in the name of the religion. 
In a statement released on Thursday, Hezbollah extended its condolences to the Iraqi nation over the tragedy, calling for more efforts to root out terror outfits in Iraq and restore security to the country.

25821,"Russia Stirs Friction in Balkans, as NATO Keeps an Uneasy Peace - The New York Times","ZVECAN, Kosovo  —   In the densely forested mountains along the contested frontier between Serbia and Kosovo, a patrol of American soldiers under NATO command trudged through snow and mud, keeping an eye out for smugglers or anyone else trying to cross the border. Given the bloody legacy of this area, the situation is quiet now, at least up here. It is down below, in Serbia and Kosovo, where old angers are resurfacing as the Balkan region that spawned so much suffering over the last century is again becoming dangerously restive. And once again, Russia is stoking tensions, as it seeks to exploit political fissures in an area that was once viewed as a triumph of muscular American diplomacy  —   but that now underscores the growing challenges facing NATO and the European Union. “Russia sees the West meddling in its backyard, and President Vladimir V. Putin wants to show he can reciprocate,” said Dimitar Bechev, an expert on Russia and the Balkans and head of the European Policy Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria. “They see the Balkans as the West’s underbelly, and they use it to throw their weight around and project power on the cheap. ” Nearly 18 years after a United   intervention ended Serb domination of Kosovo, the border patrols are part of the   mission in NATO history. Even as the European Union has made limited progress in brokering a political settlement between Kosovo and Serbia, the presence of NATO forces has maintained an uneasy peace, with animosity between the minority Serbs and majority Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo still palpable. Yet NATO is now confronting its own challenges, whether it is the seeming ambivalence of President Trump toward the alliance or an increasingly provocative Russia. The alliance has sent reinforcements to Poland and the Baltic States to counter Russian actions, but Russian involvement in the Balkans has gotten less attention. Russia has deep historical ties with Serbia and vehemently opposed NATO’s war over Kosovo in 1999. After an   bombing campaign, Serbia lost control over the region but continues to support Serbs there, vowing never to recognize the sovereignty of Kosovo, which it considers the cradle of the Serbian nation and of its Christian Orthodox faith. Mr. Putin has continued to back Serbia, as well as Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina  —   and continued to dabble in the complex swirl of Balkan politics. For starters, Moscow supported Bosnian Serbs when they held a controversial referendum in November that could lead to more  —   or even full  —   independence from Sarajevo. A month later, Russia backed fringe opposition parties in delicate national elections in Macedonia, another former Yugoslav republic. The European Union had organized the election to help bring the country back from the brink of collapse. In Montenegro, Serbia’s tiny neighbor and a former Russian ally now set to join NATO, the authorities said they had foiled an October coup attempt that had been orchestrated by the Russians. Then in January, Moscow moved to help Serbia undermine Kosovo’s independence by supporting a series of provocations that have damaged diplomatic normalization efforts, known as the Brussels dialogue, that are sponsored by the European Union. That process had recently produced a small breakthrough, as Kosovo was about to get its own +383 calling code. Since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, however, the ethnic   government in the capital, Pristina, has failed to bring the predominantly Serb parts of the country north of the Ibar River under its control, including Mitrovica. But as Kosovars were celebrating this breakthrough, the Serbs erected a concrete wall separating the northern, predominantly Serb part of Mitrovica from the ethnic Albanians in the southern part. It was built on the Serbian side of the bridge that crosses the Ibar, a project that the European Union funded in hopes of linking the divided communities. European Union officials furiously demanded that the wall come down, but the Serbs remained defiant, forcing the official inauguration of the bridge to be postponed. This month, concrete blocks of the wall were bulldozed, but a metal barrier is still standing, blocking traffic and pedestrians. Most inflammatory, the Serbian government sent a   train from Belgrade to Mitrovica, adorning its coaches with signs declaring that “Kosovo is Serbia” in more than 20 languages. Kosovo stopped the train at the border, accusing Serbia of wanting to stage an invasion of northern Kosovo, modeled on Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Serbia, in turn, accused ethnic Albanians of laying mines along the railway tracks and planning a bombing campaign of Serbs and their holy sites. Serbia’s president, Tomislav Nikolic, who is thought to be backed by Russia as he seeks a second   term in the April election, threatened to send his troops back to Kosovo to protect the Serbs, if necessary. “If Serbs are killed, we’ll send the army to Kosovo,” Mr. Nikolic said after the train episode, which was ostensibly intended to restore a line that had been disconnected since the 1999 NATO bombing of the area. He warned officials in Pristina against attempting to provoke a conflict, saying it would “end badly. ” Russia’s ambassador to Serbia, Aleksandr Chepurin, wrote in a recent editorial in Serbia’s daily Politika that Moscow would support “Serbia in preventing attempts to create an artificial   of Kosovo. ” Milan Nic, a Balkan analyst at the GlobSec Policy Institute, a think tank in Bratislava, Slovakia, said that tough statements on Kosovo were common during Serbian elections but that Serbia could never improve relations with the European Union, let alone join it, by clinging to its former southern province. “If they truly want to improve lives of Serbs in Serbia,” Mr. Nic said, “they do need to give up on this illusion. ” Col. Corwin Lusk, the American commander of NATO’s multinational battle group in eastern Kosovo, agreed that the Serbian elections were fueling the angrier statements and that Russia was playing games, though he was skeptical that Moscow wanted a direct confrontation in the Balkans. “It would be very irrational behavior because it’s a fight they could not win,” he said. “It’s a fight nobody would walk away from without scars and bruises. ” Many ethnic Albanians and Serbs living in Kosovo fear another round of war. Roughly 120, 000 Serbs live in northern Kosovo, near the Serbian border, and mostly embrace the nationalistic fervor of Belgrade. But there are 70, 000 other Serbs scattered in southern Kosovo who feel more exposed to retaliation. In the town of Decani, in southwest Kosovo, 20 Serbian monks are holed up a   Serbian Orthodox monastery, which is recognized as a Unesco world heritage site and is being protected by NATO troops to prevent assaults from  . The abbot of the monastery, Father Sava Janjic, said the nationalistic talk from Serbia “often comes back to us like a boomerang. ” “Every time they call me from Serbia, they ask: ‘Is there war? Are they trying to kill you? ’’’ said Father Janjic, 52. “I tell them, ‘No, they are not.’ There is no war. I can’t lie. But the situation is far from rosy. ” NATO’s task in the region is deeply complex. Troop levels have dropped to about 5, 000 over the past decade, including 650 American soldiers, and their job includes border patrols as well as navigating the sensitivities of an ethnically divided region. In the absence of an army of their own, most ethnic Albanians see NATO troops as protectors of their state in Kosovo. “They are here to defend us from the Serbs when they want to storm back,” said Belkiza Sahatqiu, 46, a mother of three, who works in a shoe store in the   of Mitrovica. Many Serbs living in Kosovo, however, describe the alliance’s forces as occupiers more than protectors, said Lilijana Milic, who owns a farm along the highway between Mitrovica and Pristina. “They are not protecting anybody, certainly not us,” she said. “They came to occupy this land, and now they sit in their bases. Where were they when people were chased out of their homes in broad daylight?” At the same time, Ms. Milic blamed Serbian politicians in Belgrade for the misfortune of Kosovo’s Serbs. “They just talk, talk, talk, talk about defending us,” she said, “but all they ever do is take care of their own interests. ”",1

Форум организован Общероссийским народным фронтом, в мероприятии принимают участие более 350 человек — это активисты ОНФ, федеральные и региональные эксперты Народного фронта, представители исполнительной власти и журналисты. 
Президент напомнил, что Общероссийский народный фронт был первым общественным объединением , которое начало работу в Крыму после проведения референдума о статусе полуострова. И хотя с того времени была проведена большая работа, однако это недостаточно, подчеркнул он. 
Глава государства отметил, что в первую очередь следует сосредоточиться на чувствительных для граждан вопросах — модернизации социальной инфраструктуры, обновлении транспортной сферы, создании новых рабочих мест. И при этом грамотно распределять финансы на реализацию всех проектов. 
""Крайне важно слышать мнение людей, понимать, какие вопросы их больше всего волнуют. Без этого меры по развитию региона не будут в полной мере эффективны"", — подчеркнул глава государства, отметив востребованность механизмов Общероссийского народного фронта. 
""Я надеюсь, что активисты ОНФ продолжат свою работу по мониторингу и анализу наиболее острых проблем, волнующих крымчан, по выработке конкретных предложений по решению проблем"", — сказал Путин. 
По словам главы государства, предыдущие форумы ОНФ (""Форумы действий"" в этом году прошли в Ставрополе и Йошкар-Оле — прим.) показали, что такие мероприятия дают возможность не только обменяться мнениями, но и найти способы решения проблем. 
Отдельно Владимир Путин остановился на преодолении попыток блокады полуострова . 
По его словам, ""в сжатые сроки сняты вопросы энергетической, водной блокады полуострова, хорошими темпами идет строительство транспортного перехода через Керченский пролив"". 
""Рассчитываю, что и подходы к мосту и вся необходимая сопутствующая инфраструктура также будут сданы качественно и в срок"", — добавил он. 
По словам главы государства, в будущем Крымский мост позволит перевозить до 14 миллионов туристов и 13 миллионов транспортных средств в год. 
Инициаторов же блокады российский лидер назвал ""удивительными идиотами"". 
""Думали, что все встанут на колени и будут просить подачку? Удивительные идиоты"", - сказал Путин. 
""Что касается прекращения подачи воды, либо акции, связанной с блэкаутом, прекращением подачи электроэнергии, все это на грани преступления против человека: взять достаточно крупный регион с многомиллионным населением — 2,6 млн человек проживает (в Крыму) — и отключить от электроснабжения зимой"", — сказал глава государства . 
""У нас правозащитные организации что-то воды в рот набрали и язык проглотили и молчат, а на самом деле это серьезное преступление"", — подчеркнул Путин. 
Отдельно президент остановился на проблемах в сфере здравоохранения полуострова. В частности, вопросах информатизации. 
Накануне на одной из тематических площадок форума речь шла о том, что большая часть компьютерного оборудования, закупленного за последние два года для медицинских организаций Крыма и Севастополя, не функционирует, а сотрудники медучреждений не имеют им пользоваться. К тому из-за плохого качества интернета в Крыму не создана единая сеть медучреждений. 
""Если вы считаете, что один из таких вопросов, текущих, но важных — информатизация, мы обязательно над этим не просто подумаем, а мы его в самое ближайшее время начнем более эффективно решать, чем это было до сих пор. Министр (здравоохранения Вероника Скворцова) здесь находится. Я вас прошу мне доложить, какие дополнительные шаги, чтобы эту проблему начать прямо сейчас закрывать"", — сказал президент, отметив также важность строительства новых медицинских центров в Крыму и Севастополе. 
Владимир Путин, общаясь с участниками форума, подчеркнул важность процесса реабилитации коренных народов Крыма. На эти цели в Федеральной программе развития полуострова выделяет десять миллиардов рублей. 
""Прежде всего, речь идет о социально-экономической поддержке, потому что политические вопросы уже решены — это касается языка, культуры, возможности обучения на родном языке, периодических изданий"", — сказал Путин. 
Глава государства отметил, что многие поселки крымских татар находятся в печальном состоянии — там и дороги нужны, и социальные объекты, нет электричества и элементарных удобств. Но этот ресурс, как сказал президент, ограничен и пока что его хватит только на тех представителей коренных народов, которые проживают на полуострове в настоящий момент. Путин обратился к активистам ОНФ следить за тем, насколько ритмично и рационально распределяются эти ресурсы. 
""Любые средства, которые выделяются федерацией или республикой, или Севастополем, должны находится под общественным контролем"", — сказал президент. 
Один из участников форума пригласил главу государства посетить праздник крымских татар в мае. 
""У нас есть такой праздник — Хедерлез. Это наш национальный праздник, он есть только у крымских татар. Я знаю, что вы в 2000 году были в городе Казани на сабантуе. И, пользуясь случаем, хочу вас пригласить на Хедерлез в следующем году в мае месяце. Все крымские татары будут рады вас видеть"", — сказал участник форума. 
""Если в России абсолютно в любом месте скажете, что сегодня сабантуй, все поймут, что праздник. Хедерлез пока так широко не известен, но надеюсь, что это тоже будет достоянием культуры жителей всех народов России. За приглашение спасибо большое"", — ответил на это Владимир Путин.",1
25823,Sharp Fall in U.S. Hiring Saps Chance of Fed Rate Increase in June - The New York Times,"The government reported on Friday that employers added just 38, 000 workers to their payrolls in May, a sharp slowdown in hiring that is expected to push back a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The latest snapshot suggested that the economic recovery might have stalled this spring, at least temporarily. Despite the anemic job gains, the official unemployment rate, (which is based on a separate survey of households) fell to 4. 7 percent, its lowest point in nearly a decade. But the decline was primarily a result of Americans dropping out of the labor force rather than finding new jobs. “Boy, this is ugly,” said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. “The losses were deeper and more   than we expected, and with the downward revision to previous months, it puts the Fed back on pause. ” “The only good news is that wages held,” Ms. Swonk said. Average hourly earnings rose again, 0. 2 percent for the month, for a gain of 2. 5 percent for the last 12 months, an encouraging sign that many more working Americans are finally beginning to enjoy some benefits from a tighter labor market. In close presidential races, the economy’s direction in the months leading to the November election has often played an important role in influencing voters, with credit or blame going to the party that occupies the White House. This is hardly a typical presidential race, though, and Friday’s report is only one indicator of the economy. Still, after revving up over the last two years, the nation’s job engine appears to have sputtered, with the Labor Department shrinking its initial estimates of March and April’s employment totals by 59, 000. The average monthly gain for the last three months was 116, 000 jobs. While subject to further revision as well, May’s figures were the lowest monthly growth since September 2010. The weakness in last month’s job totals was somewhat exaggerated because the estimate reflected the Labor Department classification of more than 35, 000 striking Verizon workers as unemployed. With those people now back on the job, the missing strikers should be added back in the June report. Even apart from that distortion, the average monthly job gains so far in 2016 have fallen far shy of the nearly 240, 000 average of the last two years, a pace that has helped buoy the economy and cut the jobless figure in half since the depths of the recession. Given the uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve is now likely to put off any decision to raise interest rates at its next meeting in   and probably avoid lifting rates at its July meeting as well. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor and an ally of the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, described the May report as “sobering” in a speech on Friday afternoon. Ms. Brainard said the weak job growth was a reminder that the strength of the recovery should not be taken for granted, and she said she did not see clear evidence the economy had rebounded from a weak winter. “Recent economic developments have been mixed, and important downside risks remain,” Ms. Brainard, who has pushed for the Fed to move slowly in raising interest rates, said at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “In this environment, prudent risk management implies there is a benefit to waiting for additional data. ” After the Friday report, investors wrote off the chances of a June rate increase. The probability, as suggested by asset prices, fell to 6 percent from 21 percent in early trading, according to the CME Group. The probability of a rate rise by September fell from about   but it remained about   either way. With the summer stretching ahead, the sentiment on Wall Street could perhaps be best summed up by the Tempos’ 1959 hit, “See You in September. ” Unless there are further signs of fresh economic weakness, however, most economists expect at least one rate increase before the end of the year. The unemployment rate, which the Fed regards as an important indicator, has finally dropped to where it was before the recession began in late 2007. And   claims for unemployment insurance have remained at low levels not seen since the 1970s. On the other side of the ledger, the labor force participation rate declined for the second consecutive month, to 62. 6 percent, and the number of people working part time for economic reasons rose sharply. Apart from the jobs figures, there are several encouraging economic signs, including a surge in home construction and hardy consumer spending. Most analysts expect the pace of economic growth to pick up to about 2. 5 percent over the next three months from the first quarter’s 0. 8 percent. “To be clear, there is no evidence the economy is slowing into recession,” said Steve Blitz, chief economist of M Science, a research firm. Voters’ perceptions of the economy are often a driving force in presidential elections. “It’s always good to be the party in power when the economic cycle is turning up in an election,” said Mark J. Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University. “It’s never advantageous when there is a downturn close to the election. ” This time around, though, history may not be the best guide, Thomas E. Mann, a resident scholar at Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, warned: “We should beware normalizing an abnormal election. ” “Under these circumstances,” he said, “there’s a good chance that the degree of a candidate’s personal unfavorability could be more important than the economy. ” As for the economy’s impact, Mr. Mann said changes in personal income, which are on the rise, tend to sway voters at the margins more than the jobless rate or the pace of job creation. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has closely aligned herself with President Obama’s economic policies and   streak of job gains. Worries about the economy are a more common refrain among supporters of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, as well as among those who are backing Senator Bernie Sanders’s   bid to lead the Democratic ticket. Mr. Trump was quick to react on Twitter, writing “Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38, 000 jobs added. Bombshell!” Thomas Perez, the labor secretary, acknowledged that the jobs report was disappointing. But he said: “The closer you get to the summit of full employment, the more   there will be between somewhat slower job growth and rising wages, and that’s what we’re beginning to see here in this recovery. ” He, too, continues to be disturbed by the persistently low labor participation rate. Retiring baby boomers would be expected to bring down the proportion of the population in the labor market. But Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, pointed to the significant decline among those in their prime working ages as well. Because so many discouraged job seekers have dropped out of the work force, he said, the relatively low official jobless rate is not capturing the true magnitude of the economy’s underlying weakness. “In policy making, the Fed continues to focus on a measure that is maladjusted,” Mr. O’Keefe said. A broader measure of unemployment that includes people too discouraged to search for work or who are making do with a   job because they cannot find a   one stayed steady at 9. 7 percent. The heaviest job losses in May were in the construction, manufacturing and mining industries. Not everyone has seen a softening. Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago recruiter, said: “In a weak economy, what usually gets cut first and usually gets put on hold first are jobs at the manager to director level  —   those earning between $75, 000 and $125, 000  —   and I haven’t seen that yet. ” At the lower end of the pay scale, workers have been hungry for an increase in wages that is finally starting to materialize as employers find it harder to fill jobs.   increases that have already taken effect in some places may be partly responsible for the uptick in average hourly earnings. Payroll growth was disappointing, said Jeremy Schwartz, an associate in global strategy and economics at Credit Suisse, but it was also consistent with a tightening labor market. As he advised in an alert: “Don’t panic. ”",1

25828,"’Political Hospice’ Is ’Way Forward’ For White Working Class, Says WashPo Editor - Breitbart","A   advocate says the   mostly white   communities in the United States must be wheeled into “political hospice care,” and a Washington Post columnist commended his solution “as a way forward. ”[“Economic dislocation and demographic changes are fueling discomfort and desperation among white   voters,” wrote WashPo columnist and editorial board member Jonathan Capehart, continuing:  While [university professor and author] Justin Gest says that both Republicans and Democrats have exploited these voters, he sees a way forward. “The only way of addressing their plight is a form of political hospice care,” [Gest] said. “These are communities that are on the paths to death. And the question is: How can we make that as comfortable as possible?” Capehart declined to answer questions from Breitbart about his statement that “hospice care” for mostly white   communities is “a way forward” for the nation. He declined to suggest alternative policies or to suggest which of the progressives’ political goals could be traded to win support for white   voters in 2020. The offer of political elimination to   communities has prompted anger even from some   writers, such as Martin Longman at The Washington Monthly. I’m not saying the whole Democratic Party feels this way, but the default position among a lot of progressives since the election has been that to even talk about these folks is to pander to their racism and dilute the party’s commitment to civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights, and the environment. If we want to draw up our battle lines like that, then they sure as s*** are going to take the hint  …     I don’t recognize a [political] left that has no better solution for struggling people than to make their inevitable deaths more comfortable. That’s not just a political loser. It’s an indefensible position to take as human beings. Every single community needs a left that will represent them and that doesn’t mean it will tolerate them or give them just enough to ease the worst of their pain. Gest responded to Breitbart’s questions by doubling down, saying immigrants can replace American consumers, workers, and children, and also that expert advice will soothe American communities during their   exit: Declining towns need immigrants to reinvigorate their markets, take on unwanted labor positions, and add youth to aging demographies. Once these communities understood the benefits immigrants bring and were consulted about the terms of their integration, they would feel more comfortable with their arrival. Breitbart asked if Americans’ communities can be strengthened by   curbs on immigration or trade, but Gest, a strong advocate for globalism, offered only a series of additional government programs to offset the current   policies of cheap labor and cheap imports. Public policy can help ease the pressure on ‘outmoded’   communities and facilitate their integration into the modern economy  …     States can incentivize apprenticeships and job training by the private sector like they do in Montana. They can provide universal health care like they do in Vermont. Other ideas have yet to be pursued: What if welfare benefits increased when recipients were enrolled in university programs or trade schools, so that we subsidize   and innovation? What if the quality of school districts weren’t correlated with the income of their neighborhoods, entrenching people into intergenerational poverty? What if minimum wage laws, workplace protections, and family leave policies allowed people to live on the jobs that already exist in the United States today? These ideas don’t require a revolution they require courage and political will  …     Higher wages can be mandated by policy, and so can more accessible, high quality education. Policy can therefore reduce wage competition at the bottom and help level the playing field for poorer Americans. Gest, an assistant professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, sharply opposed cuts to current high level of immigration, which now imports one immigrant for every four Americans who turn 18. Gest also argued that immigrants are more inventive and hardworking than Americans and are also more useful to the prosperous   saying: Immigration is one of the principal engines of [economic] growth in the United States because immigrants disproportionately start new businesses (which hire people) and innovate (by filing patents). They also often take unwanted jobs in meatpacking, cleaning, and agriculture. Would it have been better if Albert Einstein stayed in Germany? What if Jerry Yang’s family stayed in Taiwan?   …     [also] reducing immigration would actually hurt the middle class. Gest made his hospice comments when Capehart invited him to talk via his podcast about his book on white   communities, titled “The New Minority: White Working Class Politics in an Age of Immigration and Inequality. ” Their conversation was revealing because Gest repeatedly admitted that the fight over   communities is also a political fight over who gets higher social status. Democrats, he argued, want to grant higher status to their diverse coalition of progressives and various minorities, and are willing to reduce the social status of the white  . Many   whites supported former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but pulled the lever for Donald Trump in 2016 because Trump’s support for   communities was a huge contrast to the disdain from Democrats. “It has become okay [among Democrats] to become classist against poor white people and the [white voters] see it,” said Gest. The party’s coalition includes environmentalists, lawyers, Latinos, hippies, and   drivers, Gest said, adding “there are many people in there who like the privileged status that the Democratic Party gives to certain ethnic groups. ” For the party to welcome the white working class, he added, it would be “cheapening” the privileges given to others.  Capehart did not disagree and did not counter Gest’s comments during the podcast interview.  Capehart did push the claim that white   support for Trump is based on mere nostalgia for prior decades, not on a rational hope that Trump’s   policies are better than the Democrats’   immigration policies, and might even revive struggling American communities in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states.  Gest did not suggest any political fixes for   immigration or global trade, saying: For many white working class people, and this is going to be controversial, for many white working class people, not all of them but many, you have a community of people who are advanced in age, whose skill set is for a different economy, who are living in communities that are losing population, losing resources, and so in many ways, the only way of addressing their plight is a form of political hospice care. These are communities that are on the paths to death, and the question is how can we make that as comfortable as possible   …     Gest inadvertently admitted that the targets of his pity, white   communities, actually have a broader,   view of their economic circumstances, saying: How can we truly ‘level the playing field’? And what is so remarkable Jonathan, is that that is the language many of my white working class respondents used. It is the language that we’ve heard the civil rights movement use  —   ‘Leveling the playing field,’ ‘Finding equality.’ That is where Gest defaulted to the palliative policy of giving more taxpayer funds to his peers in the   education industry: How can we make an America that has greater mobility   …     independent of your race, independent of your ethnicity. How can we create avenues for people who start off in these communities in hospice care to live vibrant and dynamic lives of possibility, and I think that so much actually returns to education   …     education is that avenue to mobility, intergenerational mobility. It allows a steel town to raise children who are not necessarily predestined for manufacturing   …     our system of education is not allowing us to create a break, an intervention, where we actually prevent these communities destined for death, to be revived. Education can’t be the only answer for Americans if the U. S. labor market is also being flooded with cheap foreign workers, said a highly skilled worker contacted by Breitbart. “I know you don’t know me from a can of paint, but I had to throw in my 2 cents in your article about the WashPo editor,” said the woman, who tunes and operates   machine tools in Cincinnati, Ohio. She continued: I work in manufacturing. I have a high school diploma and a   associate degree from Wyotech that currently has as much worth to me as toilet paper (and it’s just as disposable). I am a [Computer Numeric Control] Machinist. I set up, tool, program, and operate CNC mills and lathes to make precision parts out of Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene, that nonstick stuff on your frying pan) and can hold tolerances to +   0. 0002″. So I’m wondering, since I am working in a field of a bygone economic era, how dumb do they think I really am that I need “more” education? What is more education going to do for me? So I can sit around and be a great   thinker as a white (non) working class individual? What is the threshold of intellectual satiation? How many degrees do we need to be indebted to the federal government before they deem the white working middle class smart enough to associate with people like THAT? I have a hard time understanding how someone like Gest or Capehart can look down their noses at someone like me because I don’t share their desire for overpriced toilet paper. Could either of them program a machine to cut an arc into a piece of material? No, but I can. Could either of them change their oil, replace their brakes, or change their front differential fluid? (I’d be surprised if they knew where the dipstick is to even check it.) No, but I can. I’m a    white working class woman that could outsmart them on a common sense basis and on a highly technical basis, and somehow I am the one that needs more education? People like that think that “working class white voters” is a descriptor of who we are as a socioeconomic group, with a dash of race and political functionality. “Working class (white) voters” are machinists, assemblers, machine operators, mechanics, nurse’s aides, waitresses, small retail store managers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, truck drivers, and all the jobs that they wouldn’t dare do themselves, being so much smarter than the rest of us (doubtful they know which end of a wrench to use). Being a “working class white voter” does not make us inferior or intellectually stunted so much that we need to be (re) educated in liberally biased schools of doublespeak and thoughtlessness. All we want to do is work a good job that does present a modest challenge, that does feel rewarding, keeps the lights on and our bellies full and after all of that, we just want to come home, drink some beers, pet the dog and enjoy the sunset in our small suburban slice of heaven. For us, that is what life is all about. We don’t care about revolutions, microaggressions, or how many physical and economic descriptors we can apply to a sub group of a sub group of a sub group. People like Gest and Capehart are more important to themselves, like Narcissus was to his reflection eventually, they will drown in their obsession. And when they do, they’re still gonna be at the counter of a Mom and Pop shop asking some “white working class voter” with grease on his or her face “What’s wrong with my Prius?”   Follow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart. com,  ",1
25831,The Left Says I Hate Myself For Voting Trump While Female. I Don't. I Just Hate You. | Daily Wire,"The Left Says I Hate Myself For Voting Trump While Female. I Don't. I Just Hate You. By: Amanda Prestigiacomo November 17, 2016 
As a woman who rejects third-wave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis, I've had my fair share of feminists tell me that I only reject them and their ideas because I suffer from ""internalized misogyny,"" or, in other words, I'm a self-loathing sexist. 
Here's exactly how Everyday Feminism defines ""internalized misogyny,"" if you're unfamiliar with bats*** crazy: 
Internalized misogyny, by definition, is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women. 
It becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate, overtly and covertly, that women are less than men – less worthy, less strong, less dependable, less able, less of a leader, less logical – while also more than men: more emotional, more irrational, more complex, more to manage. 
Of course, this is ridiculous, and I gave such an assertion about as much time as a I would a male feminist hitting on me: zero seconds. 
But on Wednesday, I learned that Team Hillary, the political left, likewise thought me a self-loathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for Queen Pantsuit because I couldn't stomach the thought of a powerful woman, since I apparently believe women are lessers. In fact, I—a woman with a chronic case of ""internalized misogyny”—cost Hillary the election; not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity, nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag. It was my fault.

Yeah, no. I didn't pull the lever for Trump because I hate myself. I don't. Not even a little actually. I just hate you. 
Let me define ""you."" 
""You"" are the feminists who contend my uterus must dictate all my choices; those who make it their mission to drag down any woman who has the audacity to veer from your ideology one iota. 
""You"" are the feminists who tell me that there's a special place in hell for me if I don't cast my ballot for Crooked Hillary. (Like all of a sudden feminists believe in God and an afterlife. LOL.) 
""You"" are the feminists who tell me I'm super mean and *shame* women when I point out that bragging about murdering unborn babies is gross and despicable. By the way, it is gross and despicable . 
""You"" are the feminists who demonize men with think-pieces on how and why we should banish so-called "" toxic masculinity "" from this world. 
""You"" are the feminists who shut men up because of their gender while simultaneously telling me gender is a social construct. And no, I will not cater to your preferred pronouns, you entitled brat. (Pro-tip: Once the number of genders you've made-up passes the number of flavors at Baskin Robbins, it's time to admit you have a problem.) 
""You"" are the social justice warriors who tell me I'm a hateful, selfish, capitalistic pig from your iPhone at your local safe space, equipped with coloring books, bubbles and puppies, across from the Starbucks you work weekends at. 
""You"" are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you don't get your way, meanwhile you're not even registered to vote . 
""You"" are the social justice warriors shouting-down any free speech which doesn't perfectly align with your ideology, ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness. 
""You"" are the virtue-signaling celebrities who think I give a hoot about your political stance. Please, go ahead and move to Canada, no one will miss you. I certainly won't. 
""You"" are the mainstream media so desperate for your leftist narrative that you'll lie to the American people to advance it; so hell-bent on painting middle-America and Republicans as racist you'll frame actual policy discussions into a segment of ""Who's The Biggest Xenophobe: Republican Edition."" 
""You"" are the leftist telling me I'm a racist for not supporting the divisive hate group Black Lives Matter. First of all, it's mostly comprised of a bunch of loser white kids. Second of all, call me crazy, but once you start calling for and actually assassinating police officers , I'm out. I know, how *racist* of me. 
""You"" are leftists calling me an Islamophobe because I use the term ""radical Islam"" and resist an influx of refugees whom the FBI said we cannot properly vet pouring into our country. 
You see, this election had virtually nothing to do with Donald Trump—I could take him or leave him—and almost everything to do with you, the left. Trump was indeed a protest vote; he was a direct repudiation of everything you stand for and everything you tell me I should stand for by virtue of my uterus. 
So, no, I'm not a self-loathing victim of ""the patriarchy"" who passed on a vote for Hillary because she's a woman. I just hate you.

25832,"Workers Pay More for Health Care as Companies Shift Burden, Survey Finds - The New York Times","State health insurance exchanges created under the new health care law are in turmoil. By contrast, the employer market  —   where the majority of Americans still get their coverage  —   seems like a bastion of stability. An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation released on Wednesday shows that the share of employers offering coverage remained steady this year, and that the cost of premiums for health plans remained largely unchanged. “We see historic moderation in premiums and health spending and costs,” said Drew Altman, the chief executive of the Kaiser foundation, a nonprofit in Menlo Park, Calif. that closely tracks the health insurance markets. But underneath some of those figures, some important changes are underway. The biggest shift is that workers continue to pay an   share of their medical bills, a trend for several years now. That is why Mr. Altman said that despite the overall moderation in costs, “it doesn’t feel that way to average people. ” Kaiser’s annual survey of employer health benefits represents a yearly snapshot of the coverage companies offer their workers, and highlights from the survey are being published online in Health Affairs, an academic journal. About 150 million people are covered by an employer, a much larger group than the 11 million or so who buy coverage on the exchanges created under the federal health care law. On Tuesday, the Census Bureau reported that the percentage of uninsured Americans fell last year, to 9. 1 percent, in part because of the strength of the employer market. The latest survey helps shed some light on the quickly evolving insurance industry. Here are a few highlights. Annual family premiums rose an average of 3 percent, about in line with the average increase in workers’ wages, to $18, 142 a year, according to Kaiser, which surveyed more than 1, 900 employers. This continued a significant slowdown in price increases. In the period since 2011, the premiums for plans covering a family rose 20 percent, compared with 31 percent from 2006 to 2011, and a 63 percent increase from 2001 to 2006. How long will this last? Mr. Altman says he is doubtful that the reprieve from sharply rising costs is permanent and that he thinks rates will go up again, especially if the economy heats up. “I don’t think we’re living in a new world,” he said. Exactly why the increases have been so modest in recent years is up for debate. The Obama administration argues that some measures in the federal health care law have helped slow the rise in health care costs. Some other experts tend to point to the lingering effects of a sluggish economy as well as the push by employers to shift more costs onto workers. While   plans typically have much lower deductibles than the most popular plans found on the exchanges, more employees have deductibles, and those deductibles are increasing. Over all, employees have deductibles that are about 50 percent higher than they were five years ago. Four out of five covered employees pay a deductible, which averages about $1, 500 each, Kaiser found. Employees who get insurance through a smaller company have deductibles that now average $2, 100. Workers are also paying a greater share of the premiums, contributing $5, 277 annually toward a family plan, nearly a third of the total cost. The move by employers and insurers to push more health costs onto workers is significant, said Mr. Altman, who describes it as a stealth move to “skimpier insurance. ” Proponents of higher cost sharing say that asking people to pay more of their medical bills causes them to be more discriminating about what health care they use. Remember the days of being able to go to any doctor or hospital of your choice? Many employers still choose plans that let workers visit a doctor out of network, although employees are paying increasingly more for the privilege. But more companies are opting for less choice for their employees. This year, slightly fewer than half of workers are enrolled in   preferred provider organization plans, or P. P. O. s, compared with 58 percent in 2014. While you pay more when you go outside the plan’s network, you are still covered if you go to a doctor or hospital that does not belong. Employers started turning to these plans in the 1990s, when resistance to health maintenance organizations, or H. M. O. s, grew. Employers and insurers tend to favor more restrictive plans because they usually contain costs better. The tide may be reversing somewhat. The H. M. O. has been rethought in new forms that are without some of the drawbacks of the   health maintenance organizations, like requiring people to get permission to go to a specialist. As a result, some employers are dropping P. P. O.s in favor of the more restrictive plans, Mr. Altman said. “We’re beginning to see that reverse,” he said. The trend toward narrower networks is also seen in plans offered on the exchanges, where the McKinsey Center for U. S. Health System Reform recently estimated that   were H. M. O.s offering a sharply limited choice of doctors and hospitals this year. The recent Kaiser survey also emphasizes the endurance of the employer market, despite earlier predictions that the health care law would usher in its demise. Most companies are still offering health benefits to their employees, with the percentage virtually unchanged from last year at 56 percent.  “We’re just not seeing a big impact on employers,” Mr. Altman said. There is also little proof that companies are cutting workers’ hours to avoid the law’s requirement that they offer   workers health insurance. Employers with at least 50   workers are required to offer benefits or pay a penalty. More than 90 percent of companies with at least 50 workers are offering coverage.",1
25833,Jerry Brown’s AB 109 ’Reform’ Put L.A.’s Most Wanted Back on Streets - Breitbart,"On Monday, an accused cop killer, gang member Michael C. Mejia, reportedly laughed as he was arraigned in court, according to the local ABC News affiliate. [Mejia was once released under AB 109, Gov. Jerry Brown’s signature prison reform, and now stands accused of committing two murders, including the murder of a Whittier police officer in February.  The explosion of violent and serious crimes across Southern California in the past several months  —   some committed by offenders that Brown released from state supervision, promising they were “  “ ” and “ ” —   has sparked a heated discussion about whether or not the controversial “prison reforms” known as AB 109 and Propositions 47 and 57 are responsible for recent deadly assaults on law enforcement officers. Three days after the February 20 murder of Keith Boyer, a   old Whittier Police Officer, the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board wrote a scathing editorial attacking Officer Boyer’s grieving boss, Whittier PD Chief Jeff Piper, for putting the blame on “criminal justice reforms” championed by Gov. Brown and the Times. The board severely chastised Piper for “mischaracterizing” the AB 109, Prop 47 and 57 prison and sentencing reforms in his moment of grief, claiming he “need[s] to be held accountable for false or misleading statements that are calculated to sway opinion on important policy matters, even if those comments come during times of great duress   …     [Chief] Piper misused the occasion of Boyer’s traumatic death to lash out at recent criminal justice reforms. ” No one likes to be wrong  —   and when someone is caught in a lie, they often double down  —   but it’s unfortunate to see a major Los Angeles newspaper engage in a campaign of deliberate distortion. Take Mejia, Boyer’s alleged murderer, whom the Orange County Register reported had been serving time for grand theft auto before he was released from Pelican Bay State Prison in April 2016. According to the Times, Mejia was not the beneficiary of “early release” or “otherwise at large because of some supposed defect in AB 109, the 2011 ‘realignment’ law that assigned more criminal justice responsibilities to counties. ” Michele Hanisee, President of the Association of Los Angeles Deputy District Attorneys, destroyed the Times‘ claim in a single comment. “Under the old system, [Mejia] would not have been out there to kill Officer Boyer.  Simple as that,” she said in a telephone interview Tuesday with Breitbart News. “Under custody of the state parole system,” Hanisee explained, “Mejia would have been thrown back into state prison for a full year for any one of the five  —   yes, count ‘em  —   five violations he committed after being released. ” Tragically, Mejia’s final probation violation occurred on February 2nd, 2017  —   only 18 days before Officer Boyer’s murder. If only AB 109 had not restricted law enforcement from sending Mejia back behind bars for a longer period of time than 10 days for his repeated violations, Officer Boyer might be alive today. Instead, thanks to Jerry Brown’s AB 109 “reform,” Mejia was only required to report to Los Angeles County Probation, under the   program known as “Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS)” —  and under AB 109, probation violations are limited to a   maximum “flash incarceration. ” Hanisee recently condemned AB 109 in the harshest possible terms on 790 KABC’s McIntyre in the Morning Show, according to a local affiliate of ABC in Los Angeles (KABC 7). “‘If you open these profiles and read them, every time it says, ‘this individual was qualified to be released to the supervision of parole under AB 109 because their current commitment offense is defined as    . ’” She says AB 109, like Propositions 47 and 57, was sold to the public by the politicians. “And they also give them really catchy names like ‘Public Safety Realignment Act’ rather than ‘Transfer Dangerous Felons to Your Jurisdiction Supervision Act. ’” Hanisee says AB 109 continues to threaten public safety, citing the descriptions of the 120 persons currently on the “L. A.’s Most Wanted. ” “It’s horrifying, absolutely horrifying. ” And the result for L. A. and the state? “This is a great place to commit crime. You’re going to get off easy and you’re going to get out early if you go in. ” Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and author who is doing a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.

25834,Marco Rubio and John McCain Win Primaries in Florida and Arizona - The New York Times,"MIAMI  —   Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain of Arizona brushed off primary challenges on Tuesday from Republican contenders. Mr. Rubio will face a   race against Representative Patrick Murphy, a   Democrat, in a crucial contest for control of the Senate. Mr. McCain, seeking a sixth term, could also face a serious challenge, from Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, who has made it a point of her campaign to court Latinos and American Indians in an increasingly diverse and competitive state. The contest between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Murphy is likely to be among the most expensive Senate contests in the country. With his onetime rival Donald J. Trump at the top of the Republican presidential ticket, Mr. Rubio, 45, will seek to fend off Mr. Murphy, 33, who has faced recent accusations of résumé padding. They were not the only recognizable names to win races on Tuesday and move on to the Nov. 8 general election. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the embattled former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, won her South Florida battle against a   law professor who was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The primary results appeared to point to a preference among voters in Florida, a pivotal swing state, to eschew more extreme candidates on the right and the left in favor of establishment lawmakers favored by national party leaders. Mr. McCain, 80, of Arizona faced a challenge from his right from Kelli Ward, a family doctor and a former state senator. In Florida, Mr. Rubio, who was asked by Republican leaders to enter the Senate race after saying he would not seek   defeated Carlos Beruff, a wealthy   gulf coast homebuilder. Mr. Beruff, who spent $8 million of his money on his bid, is an avid supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio’s Democratic opponent, Mr. Murphy, bested Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal provocateur who was favored by many progressives but faced ethics inquiries in the House and accusations that he had abused his former wife. “I commit to you that I will serve my full term,” Mr. Murphy told supporters Tuesday night, suggesting that Mr. Rubio would run for president again instead. Earlier Tuesday, in an interview on CNN, Mr. Rubio had been reluctant to commit to a full term, saying, “No one can make that commitment because you don’t know what the future’s going to hold in your life personally or politically. ” In a victory speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Rubio pointed out that Mr. Murphy, whose father is a millionaire, grew up wealthy, a sharp contrast to Mr. Rubio’s humble upbringing. Mr. Rubio added that he had no intention to deliver a “rubber stamp,” no matter who was elected president in November. Florida voters were asked to cast ballots for an unusually high number of contested congressional primaries, the result of a   redistricting map that changed 24 of the state’s 27 districts. One tough fight on Tuesday was the Democratic primary in Miami’s 26th Congressional District, where former Representative Joe Garcia defeated Annette Taddeo, who was selected by former Gov. Charlie Crist to be his running mate in his failed 2014 bid to recapture the governor’s office. Mr. Garcia had faced criticism over fraudulent absentee ballots in 2012, but was never charged with wrongdoing. One of his former staff members pleaded guilty and served jail time. Mr. Garcia will face a   incumbent, Representative Carlos Curbelo, whose seat is threatened by the new redistricting map, which made the district less hospitable to Republicans. Mr. Curbelo won the seat from Mr. Garcia in 2014. Farther north in Florida, Representative Corrine Brown, a House stalwart who more than 20 years ago became one of the first   elected to Congress from Florida, lost her seat to Al Lawson, a former state senator. Ms. Brown and her chief of staff were indicted in July on federal charges of conspiracy and fraud. But Ms. Brown’s   troubles predated her indictment. Her district was changed significantly, making it harder for a Democrat to win.",1
25836,"Hope, Change, Lies and Greatness","One of the themes of this election cycle in America is clarity. 
God is showing us what we’ve become. 
Clearly. 
With each passing political curveball and October surprise, painful and embarrassing clarity abounds. 
We’ve learned and are continuing to learn a lot about our “Christian leaders”. 
Same goes for our concepts of freedom, liberty, justice, peace, and security… none of which do we dare understand, much less pursue, in an explicitly biblical manner anymore. 
We have quite thoroughly rejected Christ as King. 
We claim him often as Savior, but have no intent on serving Him as King in practice…political practice, legal practice, educational practice, economic practice, or pretty much any other kind of practices. He’s our favorite trinket, and little more. 
That’s the brutally ugly bottom line being emphasized and highlighted and pointed out again and again by God right now in America. 
The grace God is showing in the provision of this clarity is something that’s easy to miss, and easy to want to miss , since said clarity serves as just the sort of detailed, inescapable, and unassailable indictment that we’d prefer didn’t exist. 
But it does exist. 
And He’s waving it in front of our eyes. 
He’s giving us detail upon pathetic detail and revelation after ugly revelation. He’s stacking them high and giving us chance after chance after undeserved chance to acknowledge and repent of that which is being made excruciatingly and redundantly plain. 
All we need do is take off our blinders and look at the whole picture plainly presented before us in its crystal clear, wide-open totality as it actually exists, rather than focusing on distractions and little snippets out of context while ignoring the building mountains of truths that deep down we know are fatal to the narratives we prefer over reality. 
If we simply look at the whole picture through the lens of a basic biblical worldview, we’ll have no trouble at all seeing why we’re circling the drain as a culture (and why we deserve to do so). 
Just look at what we’re into: “Hope and change”…apart from submission to Christ as King. . “Making America great again”…apart from submission to Christ as King. . Supporting public schools…even though State-run children’s education is inherently anti-Christ, is literally designed to promote an increasingly anti-Christ population, and is based upon an approach to the pursuit of knowledge (aka “education”) lifted directly from the serpent’s tongue in Genesis 3. . Preserving Social Security…even though the flagrantly socialist/Marxist construct encourages the State to claim yet another role assigned to family and church, thus growing the power of the State and making the masses more dependent upon the State. . Maintaining/expanding a gigantic, globe-spanning military…even though we are supposedly broke and are open, proud champions of socialism, Marxism, Satanism, homosexuality, and any number of fundamentally anti-Christ concepts. . Maintaining our imagined “freedom” and “liberty” to produce, market, and consume porn…even though the God who defines and sustains all true liberty and freedom despises these things and promises to crush those who defend them. . Maintaining our imagined “right” to murder our own children for convenience (or for no reason at all)…even though the God who authored and sustains human life despises child sacrifice and has promised to crush civilizations that embrace it. . Maintaining our imagined “right” to marry someone of the same gender…even though the God who sustains all true rights and defines marriage calls such relationships abominations and routinely destroys cultures that promote them. . Being ever ready to pledge on cue our personal allegiance to the indivisible political power ruling over us, all in the name of a love for America (which has been made into our ruling idol)…even though no such pledge would even be considered by an actual American Founding Father. (The mere fact of their Founding Father status confirms that they did not believe in the indivisible political power of the state, and the fact that we now pledge our allegiance to such power on command by reciting an oath written by a Socialist in the 1800s for the purpose of selling American flags to public schools says a whole lot about how profoundly confused and easily manipulated we’ve become since the time of the Founding Fathers.) . Believing that “We the People” must submit to the systems placed above us…no matter how wildly anti-Christian they become. This has been promoted through a Hitlerian approach to Romans 13 (and other passages from Scripture) as embraced by the vast majority of even the most “conservative, Bible believing” church leaders in the land. . We must support the “lesser” of two evils offered to us by the system under which we are told we must live as good Americans…no matter how vile, sinister, vulgar, corrupt, and overtly anti-Christ those options may be. (See: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.) 
Obviously this is a list that could go on for a while, but we’ll pause it here and assume that you get the picture. 
We bring these items to focus again in light of an article recently published entitled Once the hope candidate, Obama in his final days faces a hopeless electorate , wherein The Washington Post noted how we live in an age of hopelessness on many levels as we roll from the Obama era on into the Trump or Clinton follow-up. 
The hopelessness that has been inspired by our approach to law, liberty, truth, justice, economics, politics and everything else has been building for hundreds of years. Contrary to what pagan political prognosticators of the day would have us believe, the current cultural wreckage is not something that can be understood, much less corrected, by pagan, unbelieving means. 
There is and will never be hope for law apart from submission to Christ as King in practice. 
There is and will never be hope for education apart from submission to Christ as King in practice. 
There is and will never be hope for economics apart from submission to Christ as King in practice. 
There is and will never be hope for culture and civilization apart from submission to Christ as King in practice. 
That’s how things work in God’s creation, America included. 
Until we understand this and repent accordingly, our hopelessness will only deepen and our implosion will only continue. 
May God grace His people with the clarity to see, repent, live, and thrive accordingly in this remarkable time…even as an unrepentant American empire crumbles around them.

25837,ESPN Layoffs at Leading Edge of the Coming ’Sports Bubble’ - Breitbart,"As the sports media industry stews over ESPN’s mass layoffs, some believe its the leading edge of the coming “sports bubble. ”[After news broke this week that cable sports network ESPN was firing 100 writers, reporters, and some   staffers, nearly everyone in sports media had a take on why it happened. But, could ESPN’s firings be just the start of a growing problem for the entire industry as the “sports bubble” begins to burst across the world of sports broadcasting?  The whole idea of a coming sports bubble was raised by TV answer man Phillip Swann, who writes on current trends in TV. Swann insists that ESPN may not be the only network to experience significant restructuring due to financial losses. In his analysis, Swann notes that much of the trouble at ESPN is the “cord cutting” indulged by former customers, because subscribing to sports channels has become prohibitively expensive for the average person. About five years ago, Swann noted, cable carriers began to cut their   habit of including multiple sports channels in cable packages. It started because “the channels began raising their fees to unprecedented levels to offset the huge contracts they signed for the rights to broadcast the games,” he said. “Pay TV operators concluded that the escalating fees would soon dent their profit lines and they began to say no,” Swann wrote. “Compounding the pressure on the pay TV ops was the need to raise subscriber fees to make up for the higher carriage costs. Customers started to howl over the annual bill hikes, and that led to talk that they would drop their pay TV service, a practice known as  . ” Swann went on to give more examples of cable providers backing away from the   costs of sports packages on cable, and added that this bubble could eventually affect every sports channel. “Pay TV operators can’t afford to keep raising their monthly subscriber fees, and the only way they can stop doing it is stop paying excessive carriage fees,” he wrote. “And eventually,” Swann concluded, “as sports channels are forced to reduce their internal spending, they will also be forced to reduce their spending on the rights to air games and that will eventually force the leagues and teams to tighten their belts. ” But, if this trend in sports TV broadcasting continues, the financial strain won’t just be relegated to sports broadcasters. This bubble could very well spread and burst across cities that spend  —   and some contend waste  —   tax dollars on stadiums. These costs could even cascade to the unseemly amount of money teams already charge at ballpark gates. Once cable sports networks start folding because no one wants to pay their higher rates, the huge dollars they pay for broadcast rights will cease rolling into league pockets. This will cause the leagues to scramble to replace that lost revenue, and it will mean that prices will be raised for tickets that are already out of reach for the average fan. Worse, leagues will also likely begin ramping up their demands that local taxpayers pick up more and more of their expenses. This will likely cause a downward spiral in professional sports. Eventually, the increasing ticket prices will keep fans at home, and with fewer people attending games local politicians will find it harder to excuse handing tax dollars to billionaire team owners. After all, claims of the   benefits of increased visitors to the areas where stadiums sit will become increasingly erroneous when fewer people are seen attending games. So, politicians will have no excuse to so readily hand out tax dollars like they do today. It is quite possible that in the years to come players will see their   dollar salaries falling, teams will find fewer fans in the stands, cable TV will see fewer sports channels in existence, and the billions of dollars that currently flow throughout professional sports will dwindle. It is quite conceivable that the gravy train is just about ready to come to an end. Make no mistake, this will also eventually impact college sports, too. Ultimately it may cause a renaissance in sports. And maybe, just maybe, we will finally get back to playing sports for the love of the game instead of for the money.

25838,"As Warriors Prepare for Game 7 Pressure, LeBron James Says He Doesn’t Feel Any - The New York Times","OAKLAND, Calif.  —   Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, told his players that they ought to feel pressure. How could they not ahead of Game 7 of the N. B. A. finals on Sunday night at Oracle Arena, with a chance to cement their place as one of the league’s forever teams against a fearsome opponent like the Cleveland Cavaliers? “Of course they’re going to feel pressure,” Kerr said. “Of course there’s going to be some anxiety. But how lucky are we to feel that pressure? You could play on a lottery team your whole career and just make a bunch of money and go watch the playoffs every year. ” Instead, the Warriors and the Cavaliers will put it all out there for the final time this season. As the Cavaliers’ LeBron James has said more than once as the series has unfolded, Game 7 has meant something special and rarely attained. The spotlight can be searing  —   for some people. Not everyone. Not James. “Listen,” James said, “at the end of the day, I go out every single night and give everything I’ve got to the game. The game has always given back to me. So I’m O. K. with whatever. ” James has been an indomitable force in the series. He leads all players in points (181) assists (51) steals (16) and blocked shots (13) and he is tied with his teammate Tristan Thompson for the most rebounds (68). James is shooting 51. 4 percent from the field and 40 percent from   range. He has scored 41 points in each of the last two games, both wins for Cleveland. In the process, James has twice coaxed the Cavaliers away from the ledge of elimination  —   a remarkable feat given the stakes and Golden State’s dominance up to this point. The Warriors went the entire regular season without losing consecutive games, and they have never lost three straight games under Kerr in his two seasons as coach. That is what is required of the Cavaliers now: three straight to close out the finals and claim their first championship in franchise history. No team has ever come back to win the title after trailing in the finals by three games to one. The Cavaliers would be the first. James has already done a lot of fancy stuff in his career  —   he won two championships with the Miami Heat. But this, he said, would be the pinnacle. “I came back for a reason,” James said, “and that is to bring a championship to the city of Cleveland, to northeast Ohio and all of Ohio and all Cavaliers fans in the world. ” It has, to some extent, become a series of attrition. The Warriors lost Andrew Bogut, their starting center, for the remainder of the series when he injured his knee in Game 5. There was more carnage in the Cavaliers’ Game 6 win. The Warriors’ Andre Iguodala tweaked his back in the first half, and the Cavaliers’ Kyrie Irving injured his left foot in the second half. Each player is important to his team’s title hopes  —   Iguodala defends James, and Irving pushes the pace. Both assured reporters that they would be fine for Game 7. “I’m breathing,” said Iguodala, who sat out Saturday’s practice to receive medical treatment. “Everybody’s banged up a little bit. ” James, who is making his seventh appearance in the finals, performed well in his only previous finals Game 7. In that game, on June 20, 2013, he scored a   37 points and shot 12 of 23 from the field as the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs,  . “I remember pretty much everything about the game,” James said. The Warriors are no strangers to adversity, either. In the Western Conference finals, they rebounded from a   series deficit against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Cavaliers have presented another set of challenges. The Warriors’ Stephen Curry, who lost his composure when he fouled out of Game 6, said he dreamed of Game 7s as a child. “I need to play my best game of the year, if not my career, because of what the stakes are,” he said. “That doesn’t mean scoring 50 points, though. That means controlling the tempo of the game. When I need to be aggressive  —   well, I need to be aggressive. But when I need to push the envelope, do it, but do it under control. ” There have been 18 Game 7s in the history of the N. B. A. finals, and the home team has won 15 of them. The last time a visiting team clinched a title in a Game 7 was in 1978, when the Washington Bullets defeated the Seattle SuperSonics,  . The home team has won six straight Game 7s. “The word everyone likes to use in sports is ‘pressure,’” James said. “I don’t really get involved in it. But I guess in layman’s terms, it’s pressure. I think it’s an opportunity to do something special. ”",1
25839,"State Dept. Dissent Cable on Trump’s Ban Draws 1,000 Signatures - The New York Times","NAIROBI, Kenya  —   It started out in Washington. Then it went to Jakarta. Then across Africa. One version even showed up on Facebook. Within hours, a State Department dissent cable, asserting that President Trump’s executive order to temporarily bar citizens from seven   countries would not make the nation safer, traveled like a chain letter  —   or a viral video. The cable wended its way through dozens of American embassies around the world, quickly emerging as one of the broadest protests by American officials against their president’s policies. And it is not over yet. By 4 p. m. on Tuesday, the letter had attracted around 1, 000 signatures, State Department officials said, far more than any dissent cable in recent years. It was being delivered to management, and department officials said more diplomats wanted to add their names to it. The State Department has 7, 600 Foreign Service officers and 11, 000 civil servants. The letter had been evolving since this weekend, when the first draft emerged. It was edited as it moved along, with some diplomats adding words and others striking out passages. For example, one diplomat suggested this sentence should simply end on “lasting shame”: “The decision to restrict the freedom of   in the United States and foreign nationals who wanted to travel to or settle in the United States during the 1940s has been a source of lasting shame for many in our country. ” Some officials who were trying to sign the document on Tuesday said it was not clear who was in charge or who was collecting signatures. The letter was passed through official State Department email accounts and on government time  —   several diplomats said union rules allowed them to work on dissent memos on the clock. “Policy dissent is in our culture,” said one diplomat in Africa, who did not want to speak publicly before the letter was released. “We even have awards for it. ” The letter, which harshly took apart the executive order, said the visa ban would “alienate allies” and “hurt America economically. ” Foreign travelers inject nearly $250 billion into the American economy, the letter said, supporting more than one million jobs. Some diplomats said they joined the dissent by sending an email saying “I’m in” or “Please add my name as a signer” along with their full name, title, position and post. The letter was apparently circulated through informal networks of diplomats and not through any State   email list. One diplomat on vacation in the United States said he received the letter from a colleague in another part of the world who was not connected to the drafters and was simply passing it along. The diplomat predicted that hundreds of other diplomats would be eager to sign it if they could, but because of the complications of figuring out where the dissent memo originally came from, he was not sure how many would actually sign it. Most people in the State Department have never seen anything like this, the diplomat said. He said dissent memos were reserved for major policy issues, not for little grumbles like bad food in the embassy cafeteria. That diplomat also requested anonymity, saying that Foreign Service officers were not supposed to criticize American policy publicly and that he did not want to open himself up to accusations that he had violated the rules. That could threaten his job, he said, especially in such a polarized environment. This is exactly what the dissent channel, as it is called, was intended for. Starting in 1971 during the Vietnam War, the channel encourages department officials to voice their criticisms internally through a process of sending a memo or a cable to the secretary of state expressing their concerns and suggesting solutions. The final part of the visa ban memo lays out detailed alternatives, including increased vetting for specific nationalities. State Department rules are supposed to protect dissenters from being retaliated against, and last year several dozen diplomats signed a dissent memo criticizing American policy on Syria. But however officially tolerated, several veteran diplomats said dissent was still risky. When it comes to ambassadorships, the selection process is highly competitive  —   and highly subjective  —   and the diplomats said it would be impossible to prove why someone had been blocked from a coveted post. Previous dissent could easily be used against the person. Some State Department officials said on Tuesday that they would not sign the letter because of those risks. While one said he disagreed with the visa ban, he considered it his job to enforce American government policies whether or not he agreed with them. Other diplomats said the letter did not mean that dissenters would disobey the visa ban. The intent was to try to change the policy so the ban would be lifted, they said. The diplomat who said he would not use a dissent memo to complain about cafeteria food said that he had been torn when the United States invaded Iraq because he was strongly against the war, but that he did not know how to express his concern. He said he was just starting out at the time. The visa ban, he said, “was such obviously bad policy” that he was trying to find a way to sign the dissent letter. He also said that many diplomats were using the letter as a vehicle to express broader concerns about the way the Trump administration has appeared to sideline the State Department. The diplomat spoke in defense of refugees, saying that the tiny percentage from, say, Somalia who had been approved for resettlement in the United States had been scrutinized by several agencies and were among the most vulnerable of very vulnerable people. Now, many are stuck in limbo in transit centers. The diplomat also criticized Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who said on Monday that State Department officials who did not agree with Mr. Trump’s agenda “should either get with the program or they can go. ” He called that “bullying at the highest levels. ”",1
25841,Packers. Patriots. Steelers. Falcons. Who Has the Edge? - The New York Times,"Road teams finally found the success they were missing in this season’s playoffs, with Green Bay and Pittsburgh advancing to the conference championships. Both will have to repeat that road success if either team wants to make it to Super Bowl LI in Houston, as the Packers will travel to Atlanta and the Steelers will be on their way to New England. Here’s a quick preview of the conference championships: No. 4 Green Bay Packers ( ) at No. 2 Atlanta Falcons ( ) Time: 3:05 p. m. Eastern, Fox Spread: Falcons are favored by 4. They say “defense wins championships,” but the N. F. C. will almost assuredly be decided by which team’s superstar quarterbacks is able to do more damage. Aaron Rodgers has led the Green Bay Packers to eight consecutive wins, repeatedly delivering under intense   pressure, and Matt Ryan looks like a completely different player than the one who struggled in recent seasons. Green Bay will be trying to win a a second consecutive playoff game on the road, and Atlanta, after an easy win over Seattle in the divisional round, will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1998 season. No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers ( ) at No. 1 New England Patriots ( ) Time: 6:40 p. m. Eastern, CBS Spread: Patriots are favored by 6. At one point during the season the Patriots seemed nearly unbeatable, but they have had to work far harder in recent weeks to keep things going. The Steelers, meanwhile, have hit their stride defensively, with an offense led by the usual suspects of Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown. It will be New England’s 11th appearance in the A. F. C. championship game in the 16 seasons of the Tom Brady Era, and the team will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the seventh time in that span. The Steelers, who have won two Super Bowls with Roethlisberger, are hoping to make an appearance in the game for the fourth time in 12 seasons. Here’s how all four teams got here: It may not have been the type of game the Pittsburgh Steelers prefer to play, with all of the team’s scoring coming from their kicker’s foot, but in the playoffs a win is a win. And the Steelers’ ugly   victory over the Kansas City Chiefs was just enough to earn the team a trip to New England to face the Patriots in the A. F. C. championship game. It was a game largely defined by Pittsburgh’s inability to punch the ball into the end zone after moving the ball well between the   lines. The game’s biggest moment came near the end when Sean Davis, the Steelers’ defensive back whose    hit helped set up a late touchdown for Kansas City, was able to help break up the Chiefs’   conversion attempt that would have tied the game. The Steelers wasted a tremendous effort by running back Le’Veon Bell, who broke his own franchise postseason record by gaining 170 yards on 30 carries. Despite Bell’s success, Pittsburgh was forced to turn to Chris Boswell, the team’s kicker, for a postseason record six field goals, breaking the previous record of five that been accomplished eight times. In an   interview after the game, Boswell rejected the notion that he was the team’s newest “Killer B” along with Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Bell. “It was just about doing my job,” Boswell said. “Come out here and put it through the yellow pipes and don’t really think too much, don’t think ‘I’m the guy’ or anything. ” The Chiefs had started the game well, becoming the first team this season to score against Pittsburgh on an opening drive, but the offense went quiet after that, managing one field goal and one late touchdown which was too little, too late. Pittsburgh’s defense largely eliminated Tyreek Hill, the Chiefs’ versatile offensive weapon. He was limited to 18 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards, serving as a decoy on many of Kansas City’s plays. The Steelers will now go on the road against New England trying to earn its fourth trip to the Super Bowl in the Ben Roethlisberger era. “I think it’s going to be a showdown,” Bell said in a televised interview. “Obviously, two great quarterbacks going    two of the best teams in the A. F. C. so it’s time to settle it next week. ” The Green Bay Packers could not hold on to a huge early lead, but in the game’s final seconds Aaron Rodgers was given one more chance to score, and his long completion to Jared Cook set up Mason Crosby’s     field goal in a   victory over the Dallas Cowboys that earned the Packers a trip to the N. F. C. championship game next week against Atlanta. After a string of boring playoff blowouts this season, all won by home teams, Green Bay bucked the trend in a thrilling game in which the Packers raced to a   lead only to slowly let Dallas back into the game. The Cowboys tied it up at   before the teams traded long field goals, with Crosby’s   and   makes beating out the   from Dan Bailey that nearly resulted in overtime. There were offensive fireworks on both sides, as Rodgers threw for 356 yards and 2 touchdowns while Dak Prescott, the Cowboys’ Cinderella story at quarterback, threw for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns. While Rodgers walked away with the win, Prescott showed exactly why the team confidently kept him as the team’s starter even after longtime starter Tony Romo was declared healthy. In the end, however, Rodgers had just enough to overcome Dallas’ furious comeback. He rattled the Cowboys’ defense all game, catching them moving too slowly on substitutions, taking advantage of penalties, and deftly avoiding the rush to set up passing plays. And on the final drive, when his team needed him most, he found Cook downfield for a shocking   gain that set up Crosby’s  . Cook just barely got his feet down before going out of bounds, with the play requiring a review after officials disagreed about whether or not he made the catch. Rodgers was all smiles in an   interview after the game, saying the game was fun. But when asked about what he was thinking as his long pass to Cook was reeled in, he gave all the credit to Cook. “It was a great catch by Jared,” Rodgers said, adding “It’s just kind of schoolyard at times late in the game like that. ” Rodgers was forced to play the entire game without his top wide receiver, Jordy Nelson, but he was able to succeed thanks to strong games from Cook, Davante Adams and Randall Cobb. Ty Montgomery, the wide    back, chipped in with 11 carries for 47 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also catching 6 passes for 34 yards. That the game was left to Crosby’s strong right leg may have worried some Packers fans, but the veteran kicker had an incredible final four minutes of the game. His   make set a franchise playoff record, and he had to make the   attempt twice as Dallas used a timeout to erase his first attempt. While the   was a fairly low kick, it easily made it over the crossbar, completing the Green Bay victory. Green Bay has now won eight consecutive games after Rodgers vowed to “run the table” following the team’s loss to Washington in Week 11. While the quarterback’s long streak without an interception finally ended in the second half, he continued to show off the M. V. P. form that had eluded him in the first half of the season. The loss ended what had been a remarkable season for Dallas, a team that captured the No. 1 seed in the N. F. C. despite losing Romo during the preseason and being forced to hand over the offense to Prescott, a   draft pick who few expected to play, let alone start. But Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott, along with some tremendous play by the team’s offensive line, formed an offense that few could keep up with. As the No. 4 seed in the conference, Green Bay will travel to face the No.   Falcons in Atlanta next Sunday. ■ Matt Ryan led the Atlanta Falcons to a   win over the Seattle Seahawks and heard choruses of “M. V. P.! M. V. P. !” which seemed justified by his     performance. That his return to the playoffs was a huge success against Seattle’s Legion of Boom secondary was quite an accomplishment, though it comes with the asterisk of Earl Thomas having missed the game. Thomas, the   safety, was sorely missed, especially on a      by running back Devonta Freeman, who executed a fake that left Thomas’s replacement, Steven Terrell, grasping at air as he fell to the turf. ■ The Houston Texans’ defense was the only thing keeping the team together all season, and the unit did its best in a lopsided loss to the New England Patriots in which the team intercepted Tom Brady twice but also saw Dion Lewis become the first player in the Super Bowl era to score touchdowns on a run, a pass and a kickoff return in a playoff game. The   Houston defense got little help from Brock Osweiler, the team’s quarterback who seemed to change a few minds last week, then reminded everyone of his flaws with three interceptions on Saturday. Even with a   victory for the Patriots, the game showed a great number of flaws for New England going forward. Pretty or not, the Patriots are headed to the team’s 11th conference championship game in the last 16 seasons.",1
25842,"Fake Company, Facebook, to Battle Fake News?","Fake Company, Facebook, to Battle Fake News? By Daily Bell Staff - November 19, 2016 
Zuckerberg: Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news … Fake news sites designed to trick you … Mark Zuckerberg has outlined a series of measures that should help prevent fake news from being shared on Facebook. The planned controls, which were announced in a late night Facebook post, follow accusations that a flood of fake news stories influenced the U.S. presidential election. -CNN 
Facebook is taking steps to counteract “fake news” but in many ways Facebook is a fake company. 
We wrote about it here, quoting an article entitled, “Behind Facebook—A New World Order Agenda?” 
Facebook’s first round of venture capital funding ($US500,000) came from former Paypal CEO Peter Thiel. Author of anti-multicultural tome ‘The Diversity Myth’, he is also on the board of radical conservative group VanguardPAC. 
The second round of funding into Facebook ($US12.7 million) came from venture capital firm Accel Partners. Its manager James Breyer was formerly chairman of the National Venture Capital Association, and served on the board with Gilman Louie, CEO of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm established by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1999. One of the company’s key areas of expertise are in “data mining technologies”. 
Breyer also served on the board of R&D firm BBN Technologies, which was one of those companies responsible for the rise of the internet. Dr Anita Jones joined the firm, which included Gilman Louie. She had also served on the In-Q-Tel’s board, and had been director of Defence Research and Engineering for the US Department of Defence. 
She was also an adviser to the Secretary of Defence and overseeing the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is responsible for high-tech, high-end development. 
We can see that Facebook’s initial funding came from individuals affiliated with US government/intel facilities: the CIA and DARPA. There is no doubt the US government has promoted Facebook around the world. It is an affiliate of the Deep State far more than it is a “private company.” 
And what about CNN, excerpted above? 
CNN is in a sense a fake news organization just as Facebook is a fake social media facility. CNN reportedly receives payments to promote stories that governments want publicized. 
For instance, former CNN reporter Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winner exposed CNN in 2015 for receiving payments from the US government and foreign governments to pick and choose news items, see here . 
More from CNN: 
“The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,” wrote Zuckerberg. “We take this responsibility seriously. We’ve made significant progress, but there is more work to be done.” 
The CEO said that Facebook (FB, Tech30) is working to develop stronger fake news detection, a warning system, easier reporting and technical ways to classify misinformation. 
… Zuckerberg did not say how quickly the measures would be in place. But they should make it much easier for users to flag misleading content — similar to the way cyberbullying can be reported with a single click on some social media. 
The idea that users can flag “fake” news content would be more credible if the US government along with other governments had not already created squads of Internet monitors, see this article entitled, “US Government Using Trolls To Attack Conspiracy Theorists, here. 
These monitors will surely be able to click articles that are in some sense inimical to various vested globalist interests. 
The entire fake news controversy is suspect, starting with the idea that fake news “helped” Donald Trump get elected president of the US. As we recall, there was a good deal of fake news, but most of it seemed to emanate from the mainstream media. 
This mainstream resolutely would not investigate or report on the worst of the Clintons’ apparent criminality – including potential rape, mishandling of classified data and “pay-to-play” donations to the Clinton Foundation. 
Additionally, the mainstream reported a steady stream of polls favorable to Hillary by using tactics that exaggerated her voter endorsements. 
We arrive at the justifiable conclusion that the “fake news” controversy is itself a fake one, that outfits such as CNN that are reporting on it are fake and that Internet facilities charged with identifying fake news items like Facebook are also fake. 
Those behind this gambit obviously intend to use it to attack the alternative media, which has been very effective in puncturing the propaganda of the Deep State. The very largest irony is that this fake news meme is aimed at truth-telling in the alternative media. 
Conclusion: Whether or not this will work is a separate question, as we wrote here . But the idea is to create such a large lie that people will believe it. This has happened before.",1
25846,Times When the “Mainstream Media Created Fake News”… And People Died As a Result,"
This article was written by Claire Bernish and originally published at The Free Thought Project . 
Editor’s Comment: While the powers that be are determining the fate of alternative media voices that are now branded under the dubious label “fake news” and blacked out from online search results , it is worth keeping in mind all the disinformation and downright lies that have been perpetrated by the corporate news media – typically hand in hand with a political agenda. 
Whether it is lies that took us to war, or the perception that a deadly attack was carried out by a certain group, the impressions they create play a significant role in determining world events. Often times, that role is one of deception, ensnaring people into supporting deadly and costly actions – in spite of the true facts. 
These misleaders are the fake news, and the fake news problem has helped to ruin this country. 
5 Times Corporate Media Got Caught Publishing Fake News Causing the Death & Suffering of Millions by Claire Bernish
A now-notorious list of ostensibly “fake” news sites — created by a liberal professor, seemingly out of thin air — spread like wildfire online in the past two days and was eagerly reprinted by corporate media presstitutes hoping to vindicate their own failed reporting on the 2016 election.
But branding perfectly legitimate outlets with the same scarlet letter as those devoid of integrity deemed the professor’s list a spurious attempt to defame alternative and independent media — anyone dissenting from the left’s mainstream narrative — as a whole.
This is, in no uncertain terms, a hit list — or, at least, a laughable attempt — and it fits conveniently into the establishment’s burgeoning war on independent media disguised as a battle against fake news .
When corporate media outlets from the Independent and Business Insider , to the Los Angeles Times and NYMag scrambled over one another to reprint this irresponsibly contrived hit list, they proved yet again a lack of journalistic integrity — the same issue that originally caused regular subscribers to abandon them in the first place.
Indeed, in this otherwise unknown professor’s foray into the world of journalism, a glaring mistake was made — the only mainstream outlets making the list were those who had heralded Bernie Sanders as the best candidate for the White House.
Such an obvious attempt to control thought could only be conjured in a totalitarian regime.
In fact, failing to place the exact corporate media organizations on the list, who for nearly a year praised fealty only to Hillary Clinton — and for decades have foisted on the public countless mendacious whoppers — constitutes a comedic lack of honesty. So, to bring that irony front and center, it’s imperative to examine some mainstream lies — most of which had appalling consequences — including the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the United States and around the world.
1. George W. Bush’s Weapons of Mass Destruction 
President George W. Bush decided to unleash the full force of the U.S. military upon the world in a new policy of war writ large disguised as a war on terrorism following the attacks of September 11, 2001. First arbitrarily designating Afghanistan as its primary victim due to the supposed identities of the attackers, Bush then chose Iraq to feel the wrath, and set out to invade the country following dubious claims Saddam Hussein harbored destructive chemical and biological weapons and was actively seeking far stronger munitions.
“Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised,” the president asserted in a public address on March 17, 2003. “This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq’s neighbors and against Iraq’s people.” 
Bush’s assertions were questioned by not only human rights experts, but by U.N. weapons inspectors and countless others — so shortly after the U.S. invaded the sovereign nation, the New York Times took up the slack to fill in the appropriate casus belli .
Judith Miller notoriously reported on a source she described only as an Iraqi scientist who had seen several extensive caches of such weapons stored somewhere in the country. American weapons experts, she claimed, “said the scientist told them that President Saddam Hussein’s government had destroyed some stockpiles of deadly agents as early as the mid-1990’s, transferred others to Syria, and had recently focused its efforts instead on research and development projects that are virtually impervious to detection by international inspectors, and even American forces on the ground combing through Iraq’s giant weapons plants.” 
In hindsight, Miller’s problematic report turned out to be horrendously flawed , and the Times spent months attempting to backtrack , but the damage — fomenting widescale public support for a war no one wanted the military to undertake — had been done. Years later in 2014, the Times — after much internal strife — again took up Miller’s case, in a series reporting catastrophic injuries U.S. military personnel suffered in handling chemical weapons in Iraq. But that report, and the parroting of it by multiple other mainstream mainstays, failed to fully disclose Hussein had been oblivious to the stockpiles presence — something the CIA had clearly stated in a report .
2. Gulf of Tonkin Incident 
Often, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.
On August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post , echoed this claim.
But it wasn’t true. At all. In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.
In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House. But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.
Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’” 
If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.
3. Suppression of brutality perpetrated in Bahrain during the Arab Spring 
CNN sent reporter Amber Lyon and a crew to U.S. ally Bahrain for a documentary about technology’s role in the 2011 people’s uprising known as the Arab Spring, ultimately titled “ iRevolution: Online Warriors of the Arab Spring ” — but what they encountered instead bore the hallmarks of a repressive and violent regime, and its attempt to filter and censor the truth. Lyon and the other CNN reporters went to great lengths to speak with sources participating in the massive uprising — one the Bahraini government wished to quash at all costs.
“By the time the CNN crew arrived,” the Guardian reported , “many of the sources who had agreed to speak to them were either in hiding or had disappeared. Regime opponents whom they interviewed suffered recriminations, as did ordinary citizens who worked with them as fixers. Leading human rights activist Nabeel Rajab was charged with crimes shortly after speaking to the CNN team. A doctor who gave the crew a tour of his village and arranged meetings with government opponents, Saeed Ayyad, had his house burned to the ground shortly after. Their local fixer was fired ten days after working with them.” 
Even the CNN crew experienced the wrath of the regime, upon showing up to interview one source, the Guardian continued, “‘20 heavily-armed men’, whose faces were ‘covered with black ski masks’, ‘jumped from military vehicles’, and then ‘pointed machine guns at’ the journalists, forcing them to the ground. The regime’s security forces seized their cameras and deleted their photos and video footage, and then detained and interrogated them for the next six hours.” 
After returning to the U.S., Lyon felt it her duty to expose the abuse being perpetrated by the government of an ally nation — but CNN International didn’t agree. CNN U.S. eventually aired the one-hour documentary. Once. CNN International never did — worse, the organization gave Lyon the cold shoulder, ignoring her repeated requests to return to Bahrain, which would have put CNN ahead of the game in reporting government brutality. Its failure to air the documentary and refusal to provide justification for doing so angered seasoned CNN and other mainstream established journalists across the board.
Lyon met with CNN International president Tony Maddox twice — he first promised to investigate why the documentary wasn’t aired, and then turned against her, warning the journalist not to discuss the matter publicly. Bahraini officials contacted CNN International repeatedly complaining about Lyon’s continued reporting on what she’d witnessed. Intimidation continued until she was eventually laid off, putatively for an unrelated matter.
Attempting to save face, CNN International rebuffed the Guardian ’s account and interview with Lyon — but the effort was an impotent justification for the obvious failure of integrity.
But threats for Lyon to remain silent followed her off the job, and when she persisted in exposing the Bahraini regime, as well as the suppression by CNN , the outlet sent a stern warning to halt. Lyon, however, said she had never signed a non-disclosure agreement and would not be pressured into their lies — ultimately walking away reputation in hand — something that could not be said for CNN .
4. That time Fox News hired a CIA operative who wasn’t a CIA operative 
Wayne Shelby Simmons made guest appearances on Fox News as a security expert with insider expertise from his work as a CIA operative — for over a decade. However, Simmons had never been employed by the agency — in fact, the imposter’s lies eventually caught up with him and he was arrested and sentenced to 33 months in prison .
“Instead of verifying whether Simmons had actually worked for the CIA, Fox News and the Agency allowed him to make fools out of Bill O’Reilly , Sean Hannity , Andrew Napolitano , Neil Cavuto , and everyone at Fox & Friends for over the last twelve years. After building a false reputation as a CIA agent on Fox News, Simmons obtained an interim security clearance when an unnamed government contractor hired him in 2008. Simmons also falsely claimed on national security forms that his prior arrests and criminal convictions were directly related to his supposed intelligence work for the CIA , and that he had previously held a top secret security clearance from 1973 to 2000,” The Free Thought Project ’s Andrew Emett explained .
In other words, mainstream Fox News didn’t bother with journalism at all — proffering fake expertise as the real deal — because the outlet failed the most basic of tasks any hourly wage employer would perform.
Simmons’ commentaries weren’t harmless stabs in the dark, either — relentlessly parroting baseless Islamophobic rhetoric to drum up support for the government’s insidious war on terror likely poisoned the minds of thousands of viewers, furthering the already divisive atmosphere in the U.S.
5. Vapid anti-marijuana propaganda and the furtherance of the war on drugs 
According to the Drug Policy Alliance, over $51 billion is spent fighting the war on drugs in the United States — each year. In 2015, a striking 38.6 percent of all arrests for drug possession were for cannabis — 643,121 people were arrested for marijuana-related offenses.
What those figures don’t show are the millions of lives ruined by criminal conviction for the government’s unjustifiable quest to eradicate, demonize, and vilify this beneficial plant. It would be an impossible task to tally the number of families whose homes have been destroyed by SWAT teams searching for marijuana — whether or not police bothered to verify an address . An untold number of others have been slain by police for the same reason.
But worst of all, the mainstream media propagates nonsensical, false propaganda about cannabis to convince the gullible and ignorant among us to equate it with heroin, cocaine, and other ‘illicit’ substances. And while a majority of the populace has seen through such lies, some outlets have obstinately continued the drug war — seemingly of their own volition.
One stunning example occurred in March last year, when Dr. David Samadi made a guest appearance on Fox News to fearmonger the horrors of marijuana and scare the bejeezus out of the viewing audience.
“It actually causes heart attacks. It increases your heart rate. And on and on,” Samadi claimed , fecklessly distorting statistics. “We’re seeing in Colorado that we had 13 kids that came to the emergency [room] and ended up in the ICU as a result of overdose from marijuana. Now we have crack babies coming in because pregnant women are smoking this whole marijuana business.” 
Fortunately, the Internet has provided the public with alternatives to these corporate media lies — and as of two years ago, despite these and other claims about pot being a dangerous substance, Pew Research Center found fully 69 percent of the population felt alcohol was more harmful than cannabis.
* * * 
While this list presents only a few of the bigger lies of the corporate press, there are innumerable examples of its proud history of actual fake news. Keep these in mind when the mainstream presstitutes rush to reprint a hit list targeting journalists and outlets whose narratives counter the establishment. Indeed, it would be the corporate media — with its vast captive audience — who most deserves to be listed as propagators of lies.

25847,Fact-Checking Apple’s Claims on E.U. Tax Ruling - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, issued a defiant letter to his European customers on Tuesday after the region’s antitrust enforcer ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros, or about $14. 5 billion, in back taxes from the company. By turns outraged and scolding, Mr. Cook pushed back on the findings by Europe’s competition commission, which said that Apple had made inappropriate   deals with the Irish government that let the technology company pay almost nothing on its European business in some years. Instead, Mr. Cook framed Apple’s operations in Ireland as an investment in the people there, declared that Apple has a history as a good corporate tax citizen, and added that the European Commission’s decision will hurt investment and business growth in Europe. We examined some of the points Mr. Cook made in the letter, consulting with five tax experts to   the chief executive’s statements. While Mr. Cook was technically truthful, he omitted some context and shifted the spotlight from the thrust of the European Commission’s case: whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax laws. MR. COOK’S LETTER “As our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the United States, and the largest taxpayer in the world. ” FACT CHECK While it’s not a bad guess that Apple is the largest taxpayer on the planet because of the company’s immense size, even Mr. Cook said in testimony before Congress in 2013 that this was just an estimate. United States corporate tax information is private, so there is no way for Apple to say for sure that it is the biggest taxpayer in the country, much less the world. The issue of how much money Apple pays in taxes is also a bit of a red herring. “This fight with the European Union is not about what the company has paid in taxes overall, but about how much it should pay,” said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the   Tax Policy Center. “Tax systems are not a     system. ” _________  MR. COOK’S LETTER “In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe. ” FACT CHECK Apple, along with many multinational companies, takes advantage of differences in national tax laws by moving money around the globe in ways that shrink their overall tax burdens. While a company like Apple may pay all of the taxes that it owes, it also tries to find legal ways to owe as little as possible. The European Union wants to crack down on the ways that companies minimize their tax bills in Europe, especially in Ireland. In the 1980s, Ireland began modeling itself after Bermuda, a   corporate tax haven, said Khadija Sharife, a forensic financial researcher and an editor at the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting. Ireland’s corporate tax rate is 12. 5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the United States. While Ireland is phasing out some   rules, “companies will continue to come up with ways to pay less taxes in other countries until all countries across the world can agree on corporate tax rules,” said Lisa De Simone, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford University. __________ MR. COOK’S LETTER “The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. ” FACT CHECK The European Commission makes clear, and tax experts agree, that Ireland let Apple determine how much of the income that it generated in the country would be recognized and taxed there. The rest of Apple’s income that was not recognized and taxed in Ireland could be put in other corporate structures that were effectively stateless. That meant the money in those structures was not taxable anywhere  —   not even in Ireland  —   and thus not subject to Ireland’s 12. 5 percent tax rate. While other companies have also had the right to negotiate with Ireland, the commission considers these sorts of loopholes a  . “In the U. S. states can fall all over themselves to offer subsidies and loopholes, but that is exactly what is illegal in Europe,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. __________ MR. COOK’S LETTER “The Commission’s move is unprecedented and it has serious,   implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. ” FACT CHECK Mr. Kleinbard said the commission is not replacing Ireland’s tax law with a view of what the commission thinks should happen. It is simply asking Ireland to enforce the tax rate that it has and close loopholes that allow companies like Apple not to recognize large portions of the income they generate in Ireland and pay even less. __________ MR. COOK’S LETTER “This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of E. U. member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. ” FACT CHECK Stanford’s Ms. De Simone agrees with Apple that the E. U. ruling hurts the sovereignty of its member countries. If Ireland wants to create rules that allow for stateless entities not to pay taxes anywhere, up until now that has been Ireland’s decision to make. While the E. U. has been trying to create harmony across the region when it comes to how to treat corporate taxes, for now taxes are “an issue for each individual member state in Europe,” said Dr. Liza Lovdahl Gormsen with the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. She said this case creates uncertainty for many multinational companies across Europe. __________ MR. COOK’S LETTER “In Apple’s case, nearly all of our research and development takes place in California, so the vast majority of our profits are taxed in the United States. ” FACT CHECK It’s true the majority of Apple’s profits are taxed in the United States. But Ms. De Simone said Apple has also kept more than $200 billion in accumulated profits offshore. That money could someday be brought home and taxed, but Apple is in control of whether or not that actually happens. __________ MR. COOK’S LETTER “Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. ” FACT CHECK There is support among tax experts for this statement. Mr. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center said so many countries are motivated to use low tax rates to generate business that Europe could lose multinational business if companies are discouraged by the commission’s ruling on Irish tax treatment of Apple. But Mr. Rosenthal said the issue is ultimately broader than Europe. People would do well to also remember the total amount of government revenue being lost to   tax deals, he said. “If we allow companies like Apple to pick its tax haven  —   to place a few thousand employees in a place for a lower tax rate  —   we do add a few jobs,” he said. “But more widely, the taxes given up globally could be used for public service, worker training and infrastructure repair. ”",1
25850,"Thieves’ Picnic at Trust Bank: Russia’s Biggest Bank Heist Gets Worse, and Worsley","by Lambert Strether 
Lambert here: John LeCarré, contemporary historian. 
By John Helmer , the longest continuously serving foreign correspondent in Russia, and the only western journalist to direct his own bureau independent of single national or commercial ties. Helmer has also been a professor of political science, and an advisor to government heads in Greece, the United States, and Asia. He is the first and only member of a US presidential administration (Jimmy Carter) to establish himself in Russia. Originally published at Dances with Bears 
In the first tale of the thieves’ picnic, published by Leslie Charteris in 1937,a gang of robbers, kidnappers, and smugglers starts to fall apart over a $2 million lottery ticket one of the thieves stole from the gang’s pot. The detective who recovers the ticket, and rescues a diamond-cutter who’d been abducted for the gang’s diamond-smuggling operation, rolls up the crimes by pretending to be a gangster himself, and encouraging the others to betray each other. 
By the standards of Ilya Yurov and Benedict Worsley, the original thieves’ picnic was a fight over peanuts. Yurov, the control shareholder of Trust Bank, managed the disappearance of $3.3 billion in Trust Bank funds until December 2014, when the Central Bank stopped his operations, and financed Otkritie Bank to take over in his place. Within weeks, Russian government investigators found the gap between Trust’s assets and liabilities had jumped from Rb67.8 billion to Rb114 billion; in pre-devaluation terms, that’s from $2 billion to $3.3 billion — bigger larcenies than the previous records set by Sergei Pugachev at Mezhprombank and Andrei Borodin at Bank of Moscow . 
Worsley had helped Yurov by operating hundreds of offshore companies and bank accounts through which the money was moved, mostly as sham loans. Yurov is now living in Kent as a guest of the British government. Worsley, who divides his time between Cyprus and Dubai, is now employed by Otkritie Bank, Trust’s new owner. Worsley is being paid $32,500 per month as an informer, with a promise of a bounty of up to 4% of the recovery value of the assets Yurov and he allegedly stole and laundered, plus an indemnity from prosecution. The Worsley arrangement was kept secret by Otkritie Bank until revealed recently in the High Court in London. 
The informer reward deal is unprecedented in the history of Russian bank fraud, according to London bankers and lawyers. “In a multi-billion fraud of this size,” said one international bank source, “a deal like this can be justified if the recovery is large enough – that is, if Otkritie Bank and the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency couldn’t follow the money trail without the informer, and if they manage to recover significantly more than they pay out to the informer. But why has Otkritie tried to keep the deal secret? The court papers show that $3.3 billion is missing from Trust Bank; Yurov’s bank accounts and assets add up to $830 million. How much is Worsley holding back? Does he stand to get richer with the Otkritie deal than he got with Yurov?”Ben Worsley, according to London sources, is about 50 years of age, with a round head, bald pate, dark-rimmed glasses, an uncanny resemblance to the actor Alex Guinness (right) — and a severe allergy to being photographed. In 2014 a videotape of him surfaced on the internet, filmed secretly by a disgruntled employee at a palatial estate near Montpellier, in the south of France. Worsley claimed the house belonged to “a Russian banker”, but he lived in it as if it were his own. All traces of the videotape, and of photographs of Worsley, have disappeared. 
Once employed in Moscow by Mikhail Fridman’s Alfa banking group, Worsley became acquainted with one of Alfa’s inter-bank clients, Trust Bank. This had been taken over by Yurov and his associates from Mikhail Khodorkovsky, after the latter took what Yurov has subsequently claimed to have been $300 million out of the bank’s capital. High Court papers presented by Otkritie Bank, as well as a recent interview Yurov has given to a Moscow newspaper, document the role Yurov hired Worsley to play for him and for Trust Bank in Cyprus. 
Ruling this past July 28 to uphold a freeze order over $830 million in Yurov’s Swiss and other bank accounts and his UK home, Justice Sir Stephen Males (right) said Worsley “had first-hand, contemporaneous interaction with [the Trust shareholders] and was involved in setting up their network of secret companies. The claims are based in large part on documentary evidence of the terms and (non-) performance of the loans, and the connections between the borrowers and [the shareholders] exposed by Mr Worsley (and supported at least in part by the documents he has provided, including the various trustees and shareholding documents.” The evidence, according to Males, was that in May 2015 Worsley had still been working with Yurov, when the two of them were negotiating with Otkritie for the return of the bank’s money. 
Six months later, Worsley had changed sides. On November 17, 2015 — Males confirmed the court was subsequently told by Otkritie Bank – an agreement was signed with Worsley to trace money through the offshore companies he had managed and controlled. “In return, Trust Bank [Otkritie Bank] has agreed to pay a monthly retainer to Mr Worsley of US $32,500 and to indemnify him against any claims that may be made against him by third parties (including [the shareholders]) in relation to any new instructions (but not for acts that happened in the past). Mr Worsley also agreed to provide a witness statement setting out truthfully his dealings with [the shareholders] and Trust Bank.” 
The judge said he is not sure whether a commission of between 1.5% and 4% of the “net value of certain assets recovered” was part of the Worsley deal. Otkritie has sought no freeze over Worsley’s bank accounts or property; there are no criminal charges against Worsley in the Russian, Swiss, British or Cypriot courts. How much Worsley may have concealed from Yurov in order to benefit himself the judge didn’t venture to guess. 
Males has written that he is sure Worsley has received from the bank a pledge not to prosecute him for what he had done, and to pay his legal fees if someone else prosecutes. “The agreement also includes (i) a release of any claims by the bank, (ii) a promise by the bank to provide support and assistance in any proceedings against Mr Worsley relating to his past conduct and to consider providing an indemnity, and (iii) a promise to tell any prosecutor or other authority that any claims which the bank may have against Mr Worsley have been amicably resolved and that the bank does not wish to pursue any prosecution or complaint against him.” 
Yurov (right) has responded that Worsley is a turmcoat who is being paid to testify falsely against him. Yurov has defended himself in court and in the Moscow press by suggesting Otkritie had kept its deal with Worsley secret to protect Worsley’s share of the assets, along with other beneficiaries. Yurov says he had instructed Worsley to trace the funds owed to the bank; and that Worsley is now lying to save himself. How much money was lost through companies Yurov didn’t know, and through transactions Worsley decided in his stead, is yet to be tested in court. That’s when the thieves’ picnic will be clearer to all. 
The High Court record reveals that Otkritie and the judge agree with Yurov that not all of the Trust Bank losses went to benefit Yurov or his associates. There had been, according to Males, “transactions of immense complexity which give rise to what appears to be a strong inference of money laundering and the siphoning off of at least some funds to the shareholders’ personal accounts. Nevertheless, the bank did make clear when applying for the freezing order that its case was that although some substantial sums had been misappropriated to the shareholders’ personal use, this did not apply to all or even most of the funds which were the subject of improper loans.” 
The judge continued by quoting from testimony given by Dmitry Popkov (right) , currently deputy chief executive of Otkritie Bank and a director on the new Trust Bank board. “Thus Mr Popkov said that: ‘It is not Trust Bank’s case that the entire US $830 million lost by Trust Bank was stolen by [the shareholders] or their personal benefit. The losses were caused by a combination of [the shareholders] misappropriating money by channelling into their own projects; their paying off other bad loans, including to their companies; and misconduct by [the shareholders] over many years. It is also likely that the losses have been exacerbated by the deterioration of the Russian real estate market and the contraction of the Russian economy due to international sanctions and the drop in oil prices, coupled with the dramatic devaluation of the rouble.’” 
The judge ruled “the decision [by Otkritie] not to disclose the Settlement Agreement [with Worsley] was clearly deliberate.” But Males decided to dismiss Yurov’s appeal to lift the freeze on his cash and property because “although Mr Worsley’s evidence (and therefore his credibility) may prove to be important, I doubt whether it will be critical…. Mr Worsley’s primary importance to the bank is likely to be as a source of documents, including documents signed by the shareholders themselves which appear to confirm their ultimate beneficial ownership of the offshore companies which the defendant now says were in fact beneficially owned by the bank.” 
For details of the offshore company scheme which Worsley ran for Yurov, read this . At the time of that report, on November 5, 2015 — ten days before Worsley finalized his deal with Otkritie — the bank’s spokesmen Alexander Dmitriev and Maria Gurevich were asked what they knew of Worsley’s role. “Do most or all the offshore companies on record as having received loans from Trust have a common management address in Cyprus? Can you confirm that most or all the offshore companies with loan and brokerage accounts at Trust were signed by a single person, Ben Worsley, or by authorized subordinates employed by Ledra Management or Teos Management?” 
Otkritie’s spokesmen refused to say. “We are not disclosing details that may influence the judicial proceedings.” 
The reference to Ledra is to an offshore entity operating group in Cyprus called Ledra Management. This is owned and run by Christodoulos Vassiliades, a Cypriot lawyer, whose law firm has its headquarters at Ledra House in Nicosia. In the proceedings so far, Vassiliades is not identified nor accused of any wrongdoing. He has declined the invitation to clarify the role his law firm or Ledra Management played in Trust Bank’s operations under Yurov. 
Teos Management is one of the companies Worsley created in Cyprus. Cyprus company records show he has been managing director of the firm since it was set up in August of 2013. Last November Worsley was contacted at the Teos office in Nicosia and asked to clarify his relationship with Yurov and Trust Bank. Worsley was travelling, according to his secretary. He did not respond to telephone calls and emails. 
On October 3, 2016, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySec) issued a notice revealing that in September it had reviewed a case against Teos for failing to “appoint… a compliance officer with the prior approval of the CySEC from September 2015 to 22.03.2016”. This was a serious offence, the regulator claimed . But there were mitigating factors – there had been no prior offence by Teos; and the company had already notifed CySec it was going out of business. A fine of €5.000 was imposed. 
The telephone number at Teos is now disconnected. Emails have been directed to Worsley at Teos, asking him for his comment on the terms of the Otkritie agreement and Yurov’s counter-allegations. The emails are returned with a notice that they have been blocked by the Teos server. 
Worsley is playing “a masterful game”, observers in London and Nicosia say. “While Yurov & Co. came up with the scheme to do what they claim they had to do,” claims one of the sources, “I suspect the mastermind of the offshore schemes was Ben Worsley. Yurov may have stolen a few tens of millions, but a lot more has gone missing. Yurov claims he is notthe beneficiary of many of these companies. He probably is not. Beneficial ownership was also in hands of Worsley. He claims now that in all those beneficial ownerships he was a nominee or trustee of Yurov. I suspect that is not quite the case.” 
Asked this week to clarify why the bank tried to keep the Worsley deal secret from the London court, Otkritie has not replied by press time. 0 0 0 0 1 0",1
25851,Killing Twice for ISIS and Saying So Live on Facebook - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   He stabbed an   police officer and left him bleeding to death on his own doorstep. He forced his way inside the home and stabbed and killed the officer’s female companion. He then sat down and videotaped himself live on Facebook declaring allegiance to the Islamic State, according to the French law enforcement authorities. Sitting just behind him was the couple’s son, a terrified    boy, of whom Larossi Abballa, the killer, said dismissively, “I have not decided what to do with him,” according to David Thomson, a French journalist for Radio France Internationale and the author of a book on jihadists who saw Mr. Abballa’s online posts before they were taken down. The events that unfolded between about 8 p. m. and midnight on Monday  —   when elite police forces broke into the house in the small town of Magnanville, fatally shot Mr. Abballa, 25, and rescued the boy  —   were the second time within 48 hours in which a person appearing to act alone claimed to kill in the name of the Islamic State. In the attacks in both Magnanville and Orlando, Fla. the killers had more than just brushed up against the authorities before, in what has become a distressingly familiar pattern  —   from the set of attacks in Paris in November, to those in Brussels in March and beyond. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, had been interviewed twice by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for his possible links to terrorism, and Mr. Abballa had been convicted for having links to a terrorist network and served about two years in jail before being released. Further complicating the job of protecting Western nations are governments’ dual goal of preserving civil liberties while trying to make people feel secure. The attack in France was shocking not only to neighbors in Magnanville, about 35 miles from Paris, but across the country because it underscored that extremist attacks can happen in the most ordinary places, above all in those where people believe they are safe. Mr. Abballa’s Facebook post from Monday night made clear that he wanted to terrify and destroy those he deemed “unbelievers,” people he had come to hate. He also wanted to encourage other lone wolves to do the same. “It’s super simple,” he said, looking into the camera. “It’s enough to wait for them in front of their offices don’t give them any respite. Know this, whether you are a policeman or a journalist, you will never feel calm again. One will wait for you in front of your homes. This is what you have earned. ” Boasting that he had “just killed a policeman and I just killed his wife,” he called on fellow believers to give priority to killing “police, prison guards, journalists. ” He specifically named several writers and journalists, adding rappers to the list because, he said, they “are the allies of Satan. ” Even more chillingly, he warned that jihadists had “reserved some other surprises for the Euro I am not going to say more. ’’ “The Euro will be a cemetery,” he said, referring to the Euro 2016 soccer tournament being played over the next several weeks in 10 French cities. It was unclear whether Mr. Abballa had specific knowledge of a potential attack on the matches or the crowds gathered for them. The version of the video released by the Islamic State’s Amaq news agency was trimmed by a couple of minutes to omit images of the boy and Mr. Abballa’s references to him. On Twitter, opinion was divided between those who thought the images of a defenseless child were tasteless even by the standards of the Islamic State’s hardened propagandists and those who speculated that the extremist news agency did not want to show Mr. Abballa as unwilling to kill a child. As the special police forces surrounded the murdered officer’s house, where Mr. Abballa was holed up, cordoning off the modest neighborhood that is home to both   and Muslims, Mr. Abballa asked his “brothers” to pray to Allah that he might become a martyr. The video was posted a little before 9 p. m. on Monday as the police began to try to negotiate with him. By the time the security forces reached the couple’s son three hours later, he was in a “stunned” state as people are after a profound shock, said Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister. Many questions remain about Mr. Abballa’s path from his birth and early life in nearby Meulan, France, as the child of parents of Moroccan origin, to his death at the hands of a police SWAT team. Along the way, he spent time in prison and proselytized to other inmates about Islam, said François Molins, the Paris prosecutor. When he was released, he started a small   business, which he named Dr. Food. It delivered sandwiches, according to a Facebook clip he posted. He was one of eight men convicted in Paris in 2013 of aiding a group that had been intending to commit terrorist acts and had planned to go to Pakistan for training. He received a   sentence on Sept. 30, 2013, including a   suspended sentence. He was allowed to go free after his conviction because he had spent two years and two months in jail awaiting trial. However, he was under surveillance for another two years and two months, until Nov. 30, 2015, said Mr. Molins, the prosecutor. “At the trial, Abballa seemed like someone who was not dangerous but was rather stupid,” said Hervé Denis, a lawyer who represented Zohab Ifzar, one of the other defendants. The officer killed on Monday had nothing to do with the investigation that resulted in Mr. Abballa’s imprisonment, Mr. Denis said. “He appeared to be the perfect soldier,” Mr. Denis said  —   someone who would do whatever was needed to help the effort  —   and was “very determined. ” More recently, Mr. Abballa came to the attention of the French law enforcement authorities when he was among several people questioned in a counterterrorism inquiry that Mr. Molins’s office began on Feb. 11 into a group believed to be planning to go to Syria. As part of that inquiry, investigators gathered intelligence from telephone intercepts and various geocoding technologies, but none of the findings indicated that Mr. Abballa was on the verge of violence, Mr. Molins said. Three men in Mr. Abballa’s circle  —   ages 27, 29 and 44  —   were detained for questioning after the killings on Monday. The attack in Magnanville has already prompted calls in France for more stringent handling of those convicted of   activities. On early morning broadcasts on Tuesday, some members of Parliament called for all people suspected of potential terrorist leanings to be placed in detention. But France is already stretched to the limit, both in prison capacity and in the numbers of suspects it can monitor. The police and intelligence agencies are described as working constantly to track   jihadists. The antiterrorism directorate of the judicial police and of the internal security department of the Interior Ministry have detained 100 people this year over their suspected ties to terrorism, Mr. Cazeneuve, the interior minister, said Tuesday. He added that the terrorism threat in France was “very high. ” In testimony before members of the French Parliament on May 10, Patrick Calvar, head of domestic intelligence, said about 2, 000 French citizens or residents were of concern to the security forces. He testified that at least 645 French citizens or residents of France were in Syria and that about 400 of those were fighting with militant groups. In addition, Mr. Calvar said, 244 French citizens have returned to France from Syria or Iraq, and the French intelligence services say they have identified an additional 818 people who they believe want to join extremists. The French authorities have repeatedly said it is impossible to monitor all of them at all times.",1
25852,DNI: Homegrown Jihadists Remain ‘Most Frequent and Unpredictable’ Terror Threat to U.S.,"WASHINGTON, DC  —   The American homeland is facing “the most frequent and unpredictable” Islamic terrorist threat from Sunni “U. S.  homegrown violent extremists (HVEs),” warns the most recent Worldwide Threat Assessment issued by the United States intelligence community (IC). [“We assess that ISIS [Islamic State} maintains the intent and capability to direct, enable, assist, and inspire transnational attacks. The number of foreign fighters traveling to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria will probably continue to decline as potential recruits face increasing difficulties attempting to travel there,” states the assessment presented Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats during a hearing Thursday held by the Senate Intelligence Committee. “The number of ISIS foreign fighters leaving Iraq and Syria might increase, increasing departures would very likely prompt additional   fighters to look for new battlefields or return to their home countries to conduct or support external operations. ”  The IC’s Worldwide Threat Assessment is consistent with a 2017 terrorism forecast by the House Homeland Security Committee showing that the rate at which Americans are being radicalized at home is “alarming. ” “There have been nearly 200 total homegrown jihadist cases in the United States since   (the figure currently stands at 193) a majority having taken place in just the past few years,” notes the report. Many countries, including the United States, are concerned about the return of Americans who traveled to Iraq and Syria to engage in jihad on behalf of the Islamic State ( )   (AQ) and other terrorist groups. Last month, U. S. Department of Homeland Security John Kelly sounded the alarm on   “holy warriors” who traveled to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria potentially returning to “wreak murderous havoc” in the United States and other countries once they return home. In the past 12 months alone, the number of homegrown terrorism cases reached 36 in 18 U. S. states, revealed Kelly, noting, “Over the past few years, we’ve seen an unprecedented spike in homegrown terrorism. ” Echoing Secretary Kelly, the World Wide Threat Assessment, pointed out:   homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) will remain the most frequent and unpredictable Sunni violent extremist threat to the US homeland. They will be spurred on by terrorist groups’ public calls to carry out attacks in the West. The threat of HVE attacks will persist, and some attacks will probably occur with little or no warning. In 2016, 16 HVEs were arrested, and three died in attacks against civilian soft targets. Those detained were arrested for a variety of reasons, including attempting travel overseas for jihad and plotting attacks in the United States, in addition to the HVE threat, a small number of   based Sunni violent extremist groups will also pose a threat to the US homeland and continue publishing multilingual propaganda that calls for attacks against US and Western interests in the US homeland and abroad. In recent years, the Sunni Islamic State ( ) group has inspired many attacks inside and outside the United Sates, both successful and foiled. The threat assessment explains: The Islamic State of Iraq and   (ISIS) continues to pose an active terrorist threat to the United States and its allies because of its ideological appeal, media presence, control of territory in Iraq and Syria, its branches and networks in other countries, and its proven ability to direct and inspire attacks against a wide range of targets around the world. However, territorial losses in Iraq and Syria and persistent counterterrorism operations against parts of its global network are degrading its strength and ability to exploit instability and societal discontent. ISIS is unlikely to announce that it is ending its self declared caliphate even if it loses overt control of its de facto capitals in Mosul, Iraq and Al Raqqa, Syria and the majority of the populated areas it once controlled in Iraq and Syria. Former FBI Director James Comey warned in July 2016 that the United States should remain vigilant against an unprecedented “terrorist diaspora” sparked by ISIS losing territory, particularly in the group’s   caliphate in Iraq and Syria. ISIS is not the only terrorist group that poses a threat to the United States.   has capitalized on the U. S.  coalition primarily focusing on decimating ISIS. DNI Coats notes: During the past 16 years, US and global counterterrorism (CT) partners have significantly reduced   Qa’ida’s ability to carry out   mass casualty attacks, particularly against the US homeland. However,  ’ida and its affiliates remain a significant CT threat overseas as they remain focused on exploiting local and regional conflicts, in 2016,   Front and  ’Ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) faced CT pressure in Syria and Yemen, respectively, but have preserved the resources, manpower, safe haven, local influence, and operational capabilities to continue to pose a threat. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, where U. S and NATO troops have been combating   since October 2001 in response to   the group still “maintain the intent to conduct attacks against the United States and the West. ”",1
25854,"In Michael Chabon’s ‘Moonglow,’ Deathbed Stories Illuminate an Era - The New York Times","Storytelling matters desperately to Michael Chabon’s characters. It’s a way to remake an unhappy reality and exert control (“Werewolves in Their Youth”) a means of grappling with personal or historical disaster (“The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  Clay”) or, in the case of his elegiac and deeply poignant new novel, “Moonglow,” a tool for connecting the dots of a family’s life and making sense of the past. “Moonglow” takes the form of a faux memoir by the narrator, Mike, a writer who bears more than a passing resemblance to the author himself. The story centers on tales told by his maternal grandfather as he lies dying of cancer, high on painkillers that have cracked his habit of silence and made him eager to spill “a record of his misadventures, his ambiguous luck, his feats and failures of timing and nerve. ” His grandfather’s disjointed accounts of being a soldier in World War II and his fascination with rocketry and space travel have a hallucinatory,   sheen, and they are tangled up with his wife’s enigmatic and contradictory retellings of her experiences in occupied France. Mr. Chabon weaves these   tales together into a tapestry that’s as complicated, beautiful and flawed as an antique carpet. The novel would have benefited from some rigorous editing  —   there are digressions about business travails,   rockets and “Gravity’s Rainbow” that are tedious and superfluous. But the fraying story lines seem to be a deliberate narrative strategy meant to convey the chaos of life and distortions of memory, and the bright threads of meaning that can be extracted, with imagination and will, from the mess. Mr. Chabon is one of contemporary literature’s most gifted prose stylists, and in novels like “Telegraph Avenue” and “The Yiddish Policemen’s Union,” he’s demonstrated his   mastery, his ability to move effortlessly between the serious and the comic, the existential and merely personal. In “Moonglow,” he writes with both lovely lyricism and highly caffeinated fervor. He conjures Mike’s childhood with Proustian ardor, capturing his fond memories of his mother (who smelled of Prell shampoo, making him think of those old TV commercials showing a pearl languidly drifting through the mentholated green) and his worst boyhood fears (convinced that a gaggle of   puppets were lying in wait, plotting to kill him). He makes Oakland, Calif. in the 1970s come alive  —   and does the same for Baltimore in the 1950s and Florida in the late 1980s. There are sharp, funny portraits of the many eccentric characters who wander through the lives of the narrator’s family, but it’s Mike’s grandfather who bestrides the novel  —   an Augie   hero who careens through life like a wildly thrown bowling ball, knocking over those who stray into his path while nearly crashing his own dreams. He goes at things freestyle, and often seems like the very embodiment, in Mr. Chabon’s mind, of America itself  —   proud, romantic, naïve, impulsive. He’s a roughneck and a dreamer, a pool hustler and a soldier, a jailbird and an engineer enraptured by the space race and the moon shot. “One glance at you and I know the whole story,” William J. Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services, who recruits him during World War II, says. “You’ve been looking for trouble all your life. ” His grandfather’s romance with the woman who becomes his wife  —   a French refugee who already has a young daughter (who will grow up to become Mike’s mother)  —   is a love story about two people who build new lives together after the war but who can never really manage to swim free from the undertow of the horror they witnessed in   Europe. His grandfather suffers from a form of   stress disorder, while his grandmother slips into bouts of madness that seem to be part mental illness, part guilt or shame over something that happened to her during the war. The novel’s title and some of its most moving passages come from his grandfather’s fascination with spaceflight. During the war, he becomes obsessed with rocketry and Wernher von Braun  —   the brains behind Nazi Germany’s   rocket, who would later oversee development of the rockets that propelled Americans to the moon. His grandfather drives to Cape Canaveral, Fla. for every space shuttle launch and gets a job with NASA building scale models of aircraft and vehicles as part of the educational and research and development process. He once promised his wife that he would fly her “to find refuge on the moon,” and after her death, he pictures the two of them in spacesuits like the ones worn by the astronauts in “2001: A Space Odyssey”  —   “an orange one for him, a blue one for her”  —   out for a spin in a lunar rover. He imagines her “cutting flowers in her hydroponic garden as the world hid its nightside and peace descended on their refuge in space. ” Although “Moonglow” grows overly discursive at times, it is never less than compelling when it sticks to the tale of Mike’s grandparents  —   these damaged survivors of World War II who bequeath to their family a legacy of endurance, and an understanding of the magic powers of storytelling to provide both solace and transcendence.",1
25855,Celebrating Food and Wine in Bordeaux - The New York Times,"This week, we roam France, sampling three regional cuisines: the richness of Gascony, the earthy pleasures of Médoc, and the new vibrancy of Bordeaux (below). Also check out the Food section’s guide to French cooking and our survey of five classic specialties, from bouillabaisse to galettes.  On a Sunday afternoon, people streamed across the Place de la Comédie, a grand Haussmannian square in central Bordeaux. The crowd was diverse in age, social class and ethnicity, but, this being France, the majority wore artfully draped scarves. They rode by on public share bikes and sipped espresso at the terrace cafes on the square’s southern edge, in the shadow of an elongated sculpture of a head by the contemporary Catalan artist Jaume Plensa. They clustered in pools of sunlight on the limestone steps of the Grand Théâtre and trickled contentedly out of Gordon Ramsay’s Le Pressoir d’Argent and Philippe Etchebest’s Le Quatrième Mur, part of a recent wave of   restaurant openings in this comely port city in southwestern France. As I took in the scene, it was hard to believe that not so long ago Bordeaux was considered somewhat of a backwater. Despite being one of the world’s major wine industry capitals, the city was known for years as La Belle Endormie, or Sleeping Beauty, as much for the   walls of its center as for its sleepy, overlooked reputation. But in the last two decades, Bordeaux has come awake. An ambitious revitalization campaign begun in the   by Alain Juppé, the longstanding   mayor and a former prime minister, cleaned up the city center, making it more welcoming to pedestrians. The project also established a   tram system and transformed over 7, 500, 000 square feet of former docklands into an agreeable terrain of walkways, bike paths, landscaped gardens and public waterside attractions. In 2007, half of the restored   city received Unesco recognition, making it the largest urban World Heritage site. In 2013, Bordeaux was ranked as France’s   city, after Paris. Last June, the city added to its offerings La Cité du Vin, an ambitious new museum on the banks of the river Garonne dedicated to the history of French viticulture, and as of December, a new   train line, set to begin service this summer, will run from Gare Montparnasse in Paris to Bordeaux in just over two hours. Yet it’s the food scene that has taken center stage, and today, the   heart of Bordeaux’s left bank is cluttered with interesting new offerings like experimental modern bistros, elaborate sanctums of haute cuisine and cozy   gastrobars. “It’s a totally new city,” said   Le Bras, a chef who moved to Bordeaux last year to reopen the restaurant La Grande Maison, in a   luxury hotel, with the    French chef Pierre Gagnaire. Mr. Le Bras last spent time in the city 25 years ago, back when it was “dark and dodgy,” he said. Now, he added, “It’s very dynamic   …     there’s so much to do. ” Owned by the French multimillionaire wine magnate Bernard Magrez, La Grande Maison opened in late 2014 in a stately   white stone mansion set back from the street by tall   gates that enclose a   circle drive and a    Andalusian olive tree. The Napoleon   interiors feature   chandeliers, opulent stone and embroidered silk. Mr. Magrez initially worked with Joël Robuchon, among the world’s most decorated chefs, but replaced him over the summer with Mr. Gagnaire, who has redone the menu with dishes like creamed hen pheasant consommé with   brut Champagne, served with crispy white cabbage, prune and aloe vera, all part of a   (about $63) “hunting” trio off the à la carte menu. A   and   degustation costs €135 and €185. Then there’s the wine list, as elaborate as one might expect from Mr. Magrez, with more than 160 chateaus and every cru classé (a term denoting recognized,   vineyards) from the Bordeaux region. But the city’s abundant food scene includes more casual offerings as well. My first stop was Garopapilles, a   restaurant and wine cellar that opened two and a half years ago on a quiet leafy street in Bordeaux’s center. The chef, Tanguy Laviale, 35, presides over a small open kitchen at the end of the   dining room, which looks on a glassed inner courtyard planted with aromatic herbs. Mr. Laviale was designated a Great Chef of Tomorrow in the 2016 Gault Millau guide for his rotating, seasonally driven prix fixe “market menu,’’ available Tuesday to Friday for lunch and Thursday and Friday for dinner. Lunch, including starter, main and dessert, costs €32, with optional wine pairing by the house sommelier (the   tasting dinner menu is €59). Ours began with a selection of  : bell pepper cream with feta cheese over a bed of black caviar, a clam served in the shell topped with a smoked lard emulsion foam. Then came a marbled, luscious foie gras terrine served with a bright quince purée, pickled porcinis and a mushroom shizu sauce, followed by veal in mushroom sauce served with tomato, oyster and wakame seaweed, a swirl of earthy complexity, finished with a dessert of delicate white cheese ice cream with mango crème and pumpkin espumante purée. Around us,   men in unbuttoned blazers and   glasses swirled glass after glass selected from the carefully curated,   wine list, knowledgeable waiters expounded on the ingredients and several young couples seemed to be Instagramming the better part of their meal. The vibe was urbane but convivial everyone appeared to be having a good time. Garopapilles is one of several modern French restaurants recently opened in Bordeaux by impressive young chefs, including locavore Belle Campagne, inside a townhouse in the city center Le Chien de Pavlov, a bistrot that has earned raves for dishes like crab and Kaffir lime ravioli and Côté Rue, which, since opening in July 2015 near the Musée d’Aquitaine, has become one of the hottest seats in town. Côté Rue’s   dining room, featuring   crown molding and bold abstract oil paintings, is regularly booked by stylish locals who come for the innovative dishes like beechwood smoked beef with cinnamon leaf and foie gras with citron and Jerusalem artichoke. “So many young chefs are here in Bordeaux right now,” said Rudy Ballin, 25, Côté Rue’s head chef. “The same thing happened in Lyon 15 years ago,” he added. “Everyone wants to move to Bordeaux because so much is happening, so there’s all this young energy, and people move here, start their own businesses, try new things. ” A sizable segment of Bordeaux’s new wave has turned east, bringing Asian influences to play on native culinary styles at relaxed neo bistros like the   restaurant Dan as well as Miles, which has attracted a cult following since opening three years ago in the center near the Place de la Bourse. Miles’s experimental melding of geographical influences is inspired by the provenance of its three   from France and French Polynesia, Israel and Japan. At Miles, as at so many of Bordeaux’s neo bistros, a rotating multicourse tasting menu is served from a small open kitchen: pleasingly   concoctions like hazelnut oil confit egg yolk with smoked chestnut purée and raw mushrooms, or sous vide monkfish with   eggplant, mussel foam and a gremolata of coconut, coriander and lime. A year ago, the team behind Miles opened a more informal restaurant nearby: Mampuku (Japanese for “full belly”). Shared plates focus on the street food of the chefs’ places of origin, like steamed Vietnamese bao buns stuffed with braised beef cheek and cilantro grilled and smoked eggplant with honey,   labane sauce, pomegranate and fresh herbs and “Saba Tastutaage,” crispy mackerel and broccoli tempura served with umeboshi, daikon radishes and a   dip. On a recent Saturday afternoon, lunch guests filled the cavernous dining room, sampling the diverse offerings over what seemed like a great many bottles of wine. You have to go farther upriver, though, to visit the city’s most newsworthy gastronomical attraction: La Cité du Vin, a museum of wine and viticulture that opened in June. Designed by XTU Architects to mimic wine swirling in a glass, the shimmering      facade towers over the partially redeveloped docklands of the Bassins à Flot district. Some seven years and $90 million in the making, La Cité du Vin at times seems more like a theme park than a museum. There are copious   projections, holograms, interactive elements and even a ship simulator that reimagines the maritime journeys of wine merchants throughout history. Thanks to video mapping technologies, an Armenian feast magically appears on a white table, then transforms into a traditional Jewish festive spread, as a virtual guide explains various culinary and viticultural traditions. In the “gallery of civilizations,” light boxes feature 3D animations tracing wine culture from ancient Greece and Egypt up to the present and a “buffet of the five senses,” where visitors can test different smells by releasing them from glass cloches. There are video installations devoted to wine’s role in religion, mythology, eroticism and the arts, with special attention paid to the history of viticulture in Bordeaux and the surrounding region of Aquitaine, where some of the world’s best wine has been harvested for two millenniums. La Cité du Vin also features a wine shop with more than 800 varieties, a   auditorium and Le 7, a    fine dining restaurant. Yet Bordeaux’s most enticing gastronomic attraction still may be one of its oldest: the Marché des Capucins, a huge covered food market in the heart of the multicultural St.  district that dates to the  . Known colloquially as the “belly of Bordeaux,” the Marché des Capucins is a pandemonium of scents, flavors and ungentrified French charm. Under the domed roofs of adjoining market halls, locals visit the seafood stands to consume oysters and sauvignon blanc, and to inspect crates of   heirloom tomatoes and cabbages that evoke Émile Zola’s account of “exquisite flowery masses the color of wine, crimson and deep purple. ” Cheese sellers offer brusque expertise while slicing off luxurious chunks of Chaubier and Roquefort, and men drink espresso and roll cigarettes at   counters, as they have for centuries. There’s nothing innovative or trendy about it, and yet here, perhaps more than anywhere in the city, you can feel that behind Bordeaux’s recent culinary success is a   and enduring passion for food deep in the heart (and belly) of its inhabitants.",1
25856,"Lacking E.M.T.s, an Aging Maine Turns to Immigrants - The New York Times","SOUTH PORTLAND, Me.  —   Jolly Ntirumenyerwa ran her fingers over the stethoscope that she had slung around her neck. It was a comforting connection to her career as a physician in her home country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, where she worked in emergency medicine. Her credentials did not transfer when she moved to the United States in 2012, and she could not work as a doctor. So, she took jobs as a health aide in an assisted living facility. Now, thanks to an unusual program that is training immigrants to become emergency medical technicians, she is preparing to make better use of her medical background and, she hopes, work her way up to becoming a physician assistant if not, someday, a doctor. “I want to do what I was trained to do,” Ms. Ntirumenyerwa, 37, said the other day as she took a break from her E. M. T. class, being conducted in a cavernous ambulance bay at Southern Maine Community College. “I put in a lot of years training to be a physician, and I don’t want to throw them away. ” But the program goes beyond helping Ms. Ntirumenyerwa (pronounced     ) achieve her personal career goals. It is also helping to address some serious problems in Maine. One is a shortage of E. M. T. s. Another is a shortage of a work force in general, particularly of young people who can help sustain the state economically as its population ages. Maine is the nation’s oldest state, with the highest median age and the highest concentration of baby boomers, and its birthrate is dropping in 2016, just two of its 16 counties had more births than deaths. Economists regard Maine’s rapidly aging population as a demographic tsunami that has severe implications for the state’s labor pool, health care system and overall socioeconomic  . But the state can grow, they say, with more international immigration  —   though that may become more difficult under the Trump administration. Thanks mainly to a small influx of immigrants, the state’s population inched up last year by about 2, 000 people over 2015, despite the   sentiments expressed by Gov. Paul R. LePage. But the state recorded 1, 300 more deaths than births, a downward trend in which Maine and West Virginia lead the nation. Like other graying states in New England, Maine is struggling to keep its young people living and working here. This is where the E. M. T. program comes in. “This program is a  ” said David Zahn, chairman of the global languages department at the community college, which started the program. He said he basically put two and two together. Surveys showed that employers, especially municipal and private ambulance services, needed more E. M. T.s other surveys showed that many immigrants in the Portland area are underemployed and have medical backgrounds. When the E. M. T. course for immigrants was announced, three times as many people applied as could be accommodated. The first class is small, with 13 participants. But to Dana Connors, the president of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, the program is a big step in the right direction. “It may be a small number, but it looms large in message and significance,” Mr. Connors said. The program, he said, illustrates what opportunities exist “when we recognize immigrants as part of our solution. ” Many of those opportunities are in health care. As residents live longer, the need for health care workers  —   and E. M. T.s  —   is only increasing. The E. M. T. shortage stems in part from the low pay  —   $10. 50 an hour for an   job, a result of low federal reimbursement rates, said Robert Russell, the chief executive of North East Mobile Health Services, a private medical transport company in nearby Scarborough. In addition, he said, training involves a major commitment of time. This course requires eight hours a week for 16 weeks. Mr. Russell said his company would interview the immigrants who successfully completed the course. He said he was grateful to have an expanded pool of applicants, especially people who are multilingual (Ms. Ntirumenyerwa, for example, speaks French, Lingala and Swahili, in addition to English) and who can bridge cultural divides. “It’s a huge added benefit,” he said, when employees reflect the customers they are serving. Paul Froman, the course instructor, said that he did not vary the program for the immigrants, and that they must pass the same tests and meet the same requirements for licensing as   participants. But because of their medical backgrounds, he said, the immigrants “are informed, and you can get a lot deeper. ” David Ngandu, 33, who was also a doctor in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is taking the E. M. T. course, said that in some ways, it was easier to treat patients here than in Africa because of the availability of equipment and supplies. “For example,” he said, “oxygen is very expensive in the Congo. I knew what needed to be done, but I didn’t always have the equipment. ” The course is financed by a work force development grant of $29, 000 through the Maine Community College System and additional support from the John T. Gorman Foundation, which helps disadvantaged people in Maine. Most of the immigrants cannot pay for the course on their own. While many work force development programs help immigrants learn English, Mr. Zahn said, this is the first of which he is aware that teaches English in the context of E. M. T. training, with participants learning   terminology and a higher level of English than those in, say, the food services industry. “Because of their extensive medical backgrounds, we’ll have people on ambulances who have a higher level of skill” than some other newly minted E. M. T. s, Mr. Zahn said. And, he added, the program might help restore an underemployed immigrant’s sense of dignity. “They are doctors,” he said. “And they’re cleaning toilets? We’re taking advantage of their skills and getting them back into their own arena. ”",1
25859,"Rap Trio Migos Cracks the Code to a No. 1 Hit, One Drop at a Time - The New York Times","By the time Donald Glover puzzled Hollywood’s finest by thanking Migos, the trendsetting Atlanta rap trio, during his Golden Globes acceptance speech this month, the group had already locked up its first No. 1 hit on the Billboard chart. Not that you would have known it by the behavior of the music industry’s mainstream gatekeepers. While “Bad and Boujee,” which Mr. Glover, the star and creator of “Atlanta” on FX, unexpectedly called “the best song   …     ever” onstage, had been building in clubs and online since its August release, it had only recently reached radio and was far from the   of other more anodyne (and, notably, whiter) streaming smashes. For weeks, as the song turned into a sensation through a torrent of internet memes and listens on YouTube and Spotify (with now more than 250 million combined streams) representatives for Migos had been trying to book the roguish group  —   made up of the rappers Quavo, Offset and Takeoff  —   a performance on   television, a rite of passage for rising acts. They were repeatedly brushed off. “They gave all kinds of excuses  —   not the right time, it’s not this, it’s not that,” recalled Pierre Thomas, better known as Pee, the chief executive of Quality Control Music, Migos’s label. “But as soon as Donald Glover did that, the next day, all the people who had just denied us wanted them on their show. ” The very next week, Migos took “Bad and Boujee” to “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Battling fickle tastes has been a constant for Migos since the trio stormed the   firmament in 2013, bringing a Gucci bag full of flashy new tricks, including their trademark stuttering,   triplet flow and an endless series of sticky catchphrases,   and vocal tics (“Grrr,” “That way! ”). But those who start trends don’t always reap the rewards. “Versace,” the group’s breakout song, was lifted, but then eclipsed, by Drake’s faithful remix, while “dabbing,” once Migos lingo, morphed into a   dance craze. As repeated arrests sidelined Migos’s members at crucial moments, like the   to their debut album, “Yung Rich Nation”  —   a commercial flop in 2015, selling just 15, 000 copies its first week  —   the group risked becoming another casualty of rap’s      culture, where younger viral artists are always bubbling, especially in Atlanta. With a refined strategy for harnessing the rise of streaming, where young listeners flock to rap, Migos is now zooming at an even higher level. With the release of its second album, “Culture,” out digitally on Friday, the trio focused its exuberant songwriting. It is choosing more airy, ornate trap beats and taming its staccato verbal onslaught to make better use of empty space, while tending to both its online and      boosters. In New York this week, Takeoff, 22, the group’s most reserved member, compared the album   to Christmas Eve, his sleepy eyes lighting up. “You just know that everything you asked for is going to be there up under that Christmas tree,” he said. “It’s our time now. ” Migos’s de facto leader, Quavo, 25, is its most alluring presence and a melodic songwriter. He was defiant about the group’s sometimes samey or excessive output, which has included more than a dozen free online mixtapes since 2011. “We’re doing the same thing we’ve been doing, making the same music,” he said “I feel like the world just caught up. ” The group’s business team is more realistic  —   and, by necessity, more strategic. “Truth be told, we did have a minor setback for a major comeback,” Kevin Lee, the Quality Control executive known as Coach K, said. After a rocky 2015, which, amid legal issues, still included the release of five   Migos projects with middling effect, 2016 was about slowing down and spreading out. Though Migos released just one official mixtape last year, its members appeared as guests on an unfathomable number of tracks by other artists, pop and street, expanding their sonic palette and fans’ understanding of their individual attributes. “I applaud them in stretching their tentacles and bringing it back to the nucleus,” said Kevin Liles, the veteran   executive whose label, 300 Entertainment, distributes Migos’s music in partnership with Quality Control. “That only made the nucleus stronger. ” Coach K said that Quavo’s blistering solo run, especially  —   honored in the hourlong D. J. mix “Featuring Quavo”  —   motivated Offset and Takeoff, adding, “Once it all came back together, it was an explosion. ” It’s fitting, then, that the group’s crowning achievement thus far was started by Offset  —   who spent two monthslong stints in jail on weapons charges and probation violations during Migos’s rise  —   one night while he was home alone. After creating the “  top” hook for “Bad and Boujee” that would go on to fuel endless Twitter chatter,  he sent it to the team for completion, certain it could be a hit. The Platonic ideal of a Migos song, the track mixes sensational    talk with an overriding sense of personal uplift. “Some opportunities were probably lost because of my situation, but I was fortunate to have brothers that could keep the train moving,” Offset, 25, said. “This song is like a rebirth. ” Migos’s labels put “Bad and Boujee” in the best position to succeed with a few deliberate distribution tweaks, giving it its premiere only on SoundCloud  —   “where the kids live,” Coach K said  —   to build buzz, and timing its wider release to Labor Day weekend, when rap radio relies on D. J. mix shows instead of more fixed playlists, leaving the door open for emerging sounds. (The next single, “” was released with similar precision, first with a majestic, arctic video, and then the official audio ahead of Martin Luther King’s Birthday.) Quality Control also sent Migos back to basics  —   working the Atlanta strip club scene  —   to build momentum and “get the vibe of the people,” Pee said. “When you see girls on that stage singing the words, you know you got a hit on your hands. ” Migos’s zealous army of online supporters (see the earlier “better than the Beatles” meme) also did its part, disseminating everything from an impromptu jingle for potato chips to a clip of the group performing “Bad and Boujee” live in Nigeria. Crucially, there has never been a dearth of Migos content to spread, even during seemingly fallow periods, thanks to the group’s commitment to creating constantly. In Manhattan on Tuesday, the trio had about three hours of downtime in between promotional obligations, but as the members pulled up to their Times Square hotel, they noted that the famed   recording space Quad Studios was just across the street. There was little discussion before a decision was reached. (When the group’s handlers called me to find out where the rappers were, a member of Migos’s inner circle grabbed the phone to hang up.) “Wake up,” Quavo said. “Time to work. ” Once inside, after some finagling, the group rolled weed and ate pepperoni pizzas as its recording engineer, who travels with the trio, set up. Alone in front of the microwave, Takeoff counted comically large stacks of money as Quavo changed into a fuzzy pair of “lucky studio socks. ” “What’s the point of going to sit at the hotel?” he said before entering the vocal booth. Four hours later, a   new song was done, but then Migos was late to a listening party for its own album. The rappers had been too busy making more music, refusing to leave the studio until all three had finished their verses.",1

He worked at the same consulting firm as Edward Snowden, but investigators suspect that he began taking material  —   some of it was code used to hack into the networks of foreign governments  —   before Mr. Snowden’s actions became public. ____ 3. Donald Trump says he should be elected because of his business acumen. But a close look at about 60 ventures started or promoted by him showed that   flopped or had problems. Mike Pence, Mr. Trump’s running mate, declared that Mr. Trump no longer wants to impose a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants  —   a significant reversal. And the places Hillary Clinton’s campaign views as most critical can be identified through the presence of a particularly powerful advocate: Michelle Obama. ____ 4. Your surgeon is probably a Republican and your psychiatrist is probably a Democrat. That’s according to our new data analysis, which found that physicians’ political leanings tend to vary according to their specialty. Urologists and anesthesiologists also tended to be registered Republicans, while   of doctors in infectious disease, psychiatry and pediatrics are Democrats. ____ 5. The Syrian war is often cast as a contest between competing rebel groups and the government of President Bashar  . The truth is messier. A tangled array of allies is fighting on the government’s behalf, including Iraqi militias, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Afghan refugees and Hezbollah. They’re backed by Russia, but not fully controlled by it, adding to the chaos on the ground. ____ 6. West Bank settlers are preparing for a clash with the Israeli government. One flagship settlement, Amona, was the site of a bloody 2006 confrontation between settlers and thousands of police officers sent to raze nine homes. Now the Supreme Court has ordered that the entire outpost be dismantled by Dec. 25. Israel plans to move residents to a nearby settlement. The Obama administration has condemned that plan. ____ 7. Governments from more than 190 countries adopted a measure to reduce the climate impact of international jet travel. Rather than reduce emissions, the plan calls for carriers to buy credits  —   things like forest conservation programs  —   to offset them. The measure takes effect in 2021. But it will be voluntary for the first six years, and countries can opt out. ____ 8. A surge in deaths from drug overdoses across the U. S. has become a lifeline for people waiting for organ transplants. “It’s an unexpected silver lining to what is otherwise a pretty horrendous situation,” said Alexandra Glazier, chief executive of the New England Organ Bank. ____ 9. “From now on, this is it. Humans will never get older than 115. ” That’s according to an expert on aging who, with two graduate students, published evidence that we might have hit our ceiling on longevity. Not everyone agrees. And for the sake of Yisrael Kristal, who celebrated his bar mitzvah last weekend at the youthful age of 113, let’s remember that there are always outliers. Mr. Kristal, who was imprisoned at Auschwitz during the Holocaust, is the world’s oldest man. ____ 10. “The Birth of a Nation,” the debut film from the director Nate Parker, above, hits theaters Friday. The film dramatizes the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner, played by Mr. Parker, in Virginia in 1831. It was billed as the   movie of the year. But details that emerged about a 1999 sexual assault case involving Mr. Parker made it simultaneously the “won’ ” movie of the year, our critic writes. ____ 11. Finally, New Yorkers can now remain close to their pets even after death. A new law allows pets to be buried alongside their owners in cemeteries meant for people.

“ I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. ” 
– Hillary Clinton 
The first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News’ Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate) was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
Those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing “dog whistle politics,” rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clinton’s response to Wallace’s question (where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted) however, was representative of this tactic. 
While women’s rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court (since objectively, women wouldn’t appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population), Clinton’s answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
“Women’s rights” is of course “dog whistle” for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. “LGBT rights” is “dog whistle” for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. (at least not at present); however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
Let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clinton’s overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clinton’s stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
Clinton’s reference to “powerful corporations and the wealthy” and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for “dark, unaccountable money,” the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood, with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros, the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. 
One need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clinton’s debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date – and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office – should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press (mainstream media), there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obama’s rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
In recent days, we’ve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality that’s been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clinton’s popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. 
The bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans – not just voters, and not just Republicans – need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
The burning question is this: In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?

25862,Facebook’s Loss in Court Doesn’t Dim Excitement Over Huge Growth - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   From the spread of fake news to a nasty court fight in Texas, it has been a rough few months for Facebook. But company executives can take heart in two things: Despite an audience nudging toward two billion users, more and more people are still flocking to the service, and more and more advertisers are spending money on it. Facebook’s   sales, announced Wednesday, handily beat Wall Street estimates. And even a $500 million jury verdict that went against the company earlier in the day did little to diminish enthusiasm about its finances. Facebook said sales had totaled $8. 8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, up 51 percent compared with a year ago, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $8. 5 billion. Not surprisingly, user growth is at a peak. The announcement of the blockbuster quarter comes as Facebook grapples with complaints that it has not done enough to stem the rise of false news stories and misinformation across the social network. Since those complaints began to mount, Facebook has started to address the problem. “In the past we’ve taken steps to reduce spam and clickbait, and now we’re approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said during a conference call with investors. He pointed to the company’s closer ties to publishers and   organizations and the high priority it had placed on making changes to its news feed and ad network. The controversy over fake news seemed to have little effect on users’ appetite for the website. Total profit for the quarter was $3. 6 billion, annual ad revenue was up roughly $10 billion compared with 2015, and more than half of the site’s 1. 86 billion regular visitors used it daily. Against that backdrop, a jury verdict on Wednesday in a   legal fight in federal court in Texas over virtual reality technology made by Facebook’s Oculus division did not appear to faze company executives. “The verdict is nonmaterial to our business,” Sheryl K. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in an interview. “We had a really strong quarter, capping off a really great year. ” Facebook paid $2 billion to acquire Oculus, which makes a headset, the Rift, that immerses users in   games and videos. Mr. Zuckerberg has predicted that virtual reality could be the next big computing platform, like the smartphones of today or the personal computers of a decade ago. The financial damages were far lower than the up to $6 billion that the plaintiff, the games publisher ZeniMax Media, had sought, in part because the jury was unmoved by its argument that Oculus employees stole ZeniMax trade secrets. In a statement, Tera Randall, a spokeswoman for Oculus, said the company planned to appeal the verdict. “The heart of this case was about whether Oculus stole ZeniMax’s trade secrets, and the jury found decisively in our favor,” she said. “We’re obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today’s verdict, but we are undeterred. ” The damages were nonetheless meaningful to ZeniMax, which publishes the Elder Scrolls series, the Fallout series and other   video games. The jury based the damages award on finding a series of copyright and trademark violations involving ZeniMax software by one or more of the defendants, a group that included Oculus and several of its employees. The biggest portion of the award stemmed from the finding that Palmer Luckey, an Oculus founder, had violated a confidentiality agreement he signed with ZeniMax as he was forming Oculus. ZeniMax said it was exploring options for preventing Oculus from its continued use of computer code that infringes on ZeniMax copyrights, including seeking a court order. “Technology is the foundation of our business, and we consider the theft of our intellectual property to be a serious matter,” said Robert Altman, ZeniMax’s chairman and chief executive. “We appreciate the jury’s finding against the defendants and the award of half a billion dollars in damages for those serious violations. ” That figure may decrease as litigation between the companies continues. But Facebook may not be too worried about it. As the results announced Wednesday showed, Facebook’s dominance in internet advertising is surpassed only by Google’s. And Ms. Sandberg’s latest efforts to woo small businesses are paying off: Tens of millions of businesses market their products across Facebook and Instagram, the   app it owns. Shares of Facebook rose 2. 5 percent, to $136. 69, in   trading. Wall Street is looking for Facebook to show revenue growth outside its news feed, the social network’s moneymaking ad machine. The company has cautioned analysts that it is nearing the limit of its ad load  —   the amount of ads it chooses to place between   content like news stories and status updates  —   inside the feed. That means increased pressure on properties like Instagram, which recently announced that it had more than 600 million users. Although Facebook does not disclose revenue figures for Instagram, it said on Wednesday that five million businesses were now on the app and that its latest feature  —   a messaging service similar to Snapchat  —   was already being used by a quarter of Instagram’s user base.",1
25863,Customizing Truth,"License DMCA Part I -- Liars For those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. Back in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. His public reason for doing so was the belief that the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for ""regime change"" in the Middle East. For our purposes we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? The short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 11 September 2001 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. However, the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis, kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. What we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof. Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war-fever. - Advertisement - So the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program. That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. On 19 March 2003 Bush launched the invasion of Iraq. The expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, they would surely find those nukes. They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. Part II -- Social and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? The various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out -- specifically, how to tell when they are getting ""true"" intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need ""help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen."" To that end the CIA et al., are in the market for academic assistance. A ""partnership"" is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the 16 independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The result of this collaboration will be a ""permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board"" to coordinate programs in ""social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security."" Despite this effort, it is almost certain that the ""social and behavioral sciences"" cannot give the spy agencies what they want -- a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. - Advertisement - Part III -- Believers It is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth -- that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Therefore, if someone feeds them ""snake oil"" they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors -- those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview -- have different criterion for what is ""true"" than do the analysts. 
Listen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council -- yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Mr. Gaukel has declared, ""We're looking for truth. But we're particularly looking for truth that works."" Now what might that mean? I can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, ""truth"" must match up, fit with, their worldview -- their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not ""work."" So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by group-think, ideological blinkers, and a ""we know better"" attitude.",1
25864,Wider Racial Gap Found in Cervical Cancer Deaths - The New York Times,"The death rate from cervical cancer in the United States is considerably higher than previously estimated and the disparity in death rates between black women and white women is significantly wider, according to a study published Monday in the journal Cancer. The rate at which black American women are dying from the disease is comparable to that of women in many poor developing nations, researchers reported. What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and   monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable. “This shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,” said Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler, an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. “We have screenings that are great, but many women in America are not getting them. And now I have even more concerns going forward, with the”  —   expected  —   “repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which covers screening, and the closing of family planning clinics, which do much of that screening. ” The racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies, but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining. But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed. In the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10. 1 per 100, 000. For white women, it is 4. 7 per 100, 000. Previous studies had put those figures at 5. 7 and 3. 2. The new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4, 000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a   of existing numbers, in an adjusted context. Typically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had hysterectomies from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer. “We don’t include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldn’t include women who don’t have a cervix,” said Anne F. Rositch, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “If we want to look at how well our programs are doing, we have to look at the women we’re targeting. ” Although the study did not explore reasons for the racial disparity, some doctors said it could reflect unequal access to screening, ability to pursue   test results, and insurance coverage. A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15, 194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor. According to the analysis published Monday, the   mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in   Africa. Certainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white. In years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers. In recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years. The guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade. The current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older. But experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many   stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a    woman who had met guidelines’ requirements would subsequently develop the disease. But given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides? Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment. “When we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,” he said. “The quality of assessment and   treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?” Although this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer were considerably higher than national figures. Studies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. Kemeny’s patients have often never had Pap smears. She recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. “One was 39,” Dr. Kemeny said, “and the other was 25. ”",1
25868,Fox News Sexual Harassment Inquiry Is Said to Look at What Others Knew - The New York Times,"Investigators looking into sexual harassment accusations against the former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes are also examining whether other executives knew of alleged improper behavior by Mr. Ailes and failed to act on it, people briefed on the inquiry said on Wednesday. The investigation, focused on accusations against Mr. Ailes, has not broadened into a comprehensive look at the workplace culture at Fox News, these people said. But investigators will pursue information presented in interviews about others at the company who might have effectively enabled Mr. Ailes’s reported behavior. The inquiry is continuing, these people said, with more current and former Fox News employees scheduled for interviews. As of last week, nearly 20 women had reported inappropriate behavior by Mr. Ailes, according to one of the people. The accounts, though unverified, led the leadership of 21st Century Fox, Fox News’s parent, to determine that Mr. Ailes could not stay on, this person said. The investigation by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison began on July 6, the day that Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox News anchor, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Mr. Ailes. Mr. Ailes, who denied the allegations, stepped down 14 days ago. A 21st Century Fox spokeswoman declined to comment, but on Tuesday said in a statement that the law firm “remains counsel to us and is dealing with any and all issues as they arise. ” Scrutiny of Mr. Ailes’s behavior and Fox’s operations increased on Friday with an article in New York magazine about the experiences of a former booker, Laurie Luhn, who said that Mr. Ailes had harassed her and subjected her to “psychological torture. ” In the article, she tells of Mr. Ailes using company resources and staff members, including Bill Shine, Mr. Ailes’s deputy, to facilitate the relationship. Mr. Shine, who is now part of the interim management team at Fox News, has told associates that he did not know Mr. Ailes was having a relationship with Ms. Luhn. The New York Times spoke to more than a dozen women for an article published last month, who told of being harassed by Mr. Ailes or other managers and suggested there was a broader culture of harassment and intimidation in the workplace. Later on Wednesday, 21st Century Fox reported its quarterly earnings, and Lachlan Murdoch, the executive chairman, began a conference call with analysts by addressing the situation at Fox News. “Throughout this process we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, to protect its employees and to protect the unique and important voice Fox News broadcasts,” he said. Noting that his father, Rupert Murdoch, had taken over the daily management of Fox News, he added, “There is no one more dedicated or more able to transition Fox News to new leadership. ” Lachlan Murdoch called the team left behind by Mr. Ailes “extraordinarily strong and equally devoted to its success. ” From there, 21st Century Fox executives, including James Murdoch, the chief executive and Lachlan Murdoch’s brother, focused attention on the company’s broader operations, including the Hulu streaming service and coming movie releases. Only one analyst asked for greater “color” about the situation at Fox News, which contributes roughly 20 percent of the company’s total annual profit. Lachlan Murdoch replied that he expected Fox News to remain strong. For its fiscal fourth quarter, 21st Century Fox had a profit of $567 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $87 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusting for   items in both quarters, including a recent tax benefit, the company had earnings of 45 cents in the most recent quarter, compared with 39 cents a year ago. Revenue totaled $6. 65 billion, a 7 percent increase from a year earlier. Analysts had expected 37 cents in   earnings and $6. 68 billion in revenue. Domestic advertising was a bright spot in the quarter. Ad revenue increased 13 percent at the company’s domestic cable networks, reflecting higher ratings and pricing at channels like Fox News and Fox Sports 1. Revenue from domestic affiliate fees increased 6 percent, with FX and Fox News leading the way. But a 15 percent rise in total programming costs essentially washed away those increases. For the fourth quarter, 21st Century Fox’s cable television division had an operating income of $1. 2 billion, flat from a year earlier. Fox News had higher expenses related to the presidential campaign the company also had to pay more for sports rights. The company’s movie studio also struggled with costs. During the quarter, 20th Century Fox spent heavily to market movies like “ : Apocalypse,” “Independence Day: Resurgence” and “Ice Age: Collision Course. ” Only one, “ : Apocalypse,” was fully released in the quarter, and worldwide   results were poor, falling 29 percent behind the grosses generated by the previous “ ” effort. Lachlan Murdoch noted that a studio regime change was put into motion in the quarter. “Ultimately, it’s about having a higher standard for storytelling and making better movies,” he said.",1
25870,"Bill Cunningham, Legendary Times Fashion Photographer, Dies at 87 - The New York Times","Bill Cunningham, who turned fashion photography into his own branch of cultural anthropology on the streets of New York, chronicling an era’s   social scene for The New York Times by training his busily observant lens on what people wore  —   stylishly, flamboyantly or just plain sensibly  —   died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 87. His death was confirmed by The Times. He had been hospitalized recently after having a stroke. Mr. Cunningham was such a singular presence in the city that, in 2009, he was designated a living landmark. And he was an easy one to spot, riding his bicycle through Midtown, where he did most of his field work: his   frame draped in his utilitarian blue French worker’s jacket, khaki pants and black sneakers (he himself was no one’s idea of a fashion plate) with his   camera slung around his neck, ever at the ready for the next fashion statement to come around the corner. Nothing escaped his notice: not the fanny packs, not the Birkin bags, not the gingham shirts, not the fluorescent biker shorts. In his nearly 40 years working for The Times, Mr. Cunningham snapped away at changing dress habits to chart the broader shift away from formality and toward something more diffuse and individualistic. At the Pierre hotel on the East Side of Manhattan, he pointed his camera at     New Yorkers with names like Rockefeller and Vanderbilt. Downtown, by the piers, he clicked away at    Voguers. Up in Harlem, he jumped off his bicycle  —   he rode more than 30 over the years, replacing one after another as they were wrecked or stolen  —   for   in   jeans. In the process, he turned into something of a celebrity himself. In 2008, Mr. Cunningham went to Paris, where the French government bestowed the Legion of Honor on him. In New York, he was celebrated at Bergdorf Goodman, where a   mannequin of him was installed in the window. It was the New York Landmarks Conservancy that made him a living landmark in 2009, the same year The New Yorker, in a profile, described his On the Street and Evening Hours columns as the city’s unofficial yearbook: “an exuberant, sometimes retroactively embarrassing chronicle of the way we looked. ” In 2010, a documentary, “Bill Cunningham New York,” premiered at the Museum of Modern Art to glowing reviews. Yet Mr. Cunningham told nearly anyone who asked about it that the attendant publicity was a total hassle, a reason for strangers to approach and bother him. He wanted to find subjects, not be the subject. He wanted to observe, rather than be observed. Asceticism was a hallmark of his brand. He didn’t go to the movies. He didn’t own a television. He ate breakfast nearly every day at the Stage Star Deli on West 55th Street, where a cup of coffee and a sausage, egg and cheese could be had, until very recently, for under $3. He lived until 2010 in a studio above Carnegie Hall amid rows and rows of file cabinets, where he kept all of his negatives. He slept on a   cot, showered in a shared bathroom and, when he was asked why he spent years ripping up checks from magazines like Details (which he helped Annie Flanders launch in 1982) he said: “Money’s the cheapest thing. Liberty and freedom is the most expensive. ” Although he sometimes photographed upward of 20 gala events a week, he never sat down for dinner at any of them and would wave away people who walked up to him to inquire whether he would at least like a glass of water. Instead, he stood off to the side photographing women like Annette de la Renta and Mercedes Bass in their beaded gowns and tweed suits. As Anna Wintour put it in the documentary about Mr. Cunningham, “I’ve said many times, ‘We all get dressed for Bill. ’” Mr. Cunningham’s position as a perennial outsider among a set of consummate insiders was part of what made him uniquely well suited to The Times. “His company was sought after by the fashion world’s rich and powerful, yet he remained one of the kindest, most gentle and humble people I have ever met,” said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. The Times’s publisher and chairman. “We have lost a legend, and I am personally heartbroken to have lost a friend. ” Dean Baquet, The Times’s executive editor, said: “He was a hugely ethical journalist. And he was incredibly   about fashion. To see a Bill Cunningham street spread was to see all of New York. Young people. Brown people. People who spent fortunes on fashion and people who just had a strut and knew how to put an outfit together out of what they had and what they found. ” Michele McNally, The Times’s director of photography, said: “Bill was an extraordinary man, his commitment and passion unparalleled, his gentleness and humility inspirational. Even though his talents were very well known, he preferred to be anonymous, something unachievable for such a superstar. I will miss him every day. ” Mr. Cunningham particularly loved eccentrics, whom he collected like precious seashells. One was Shail Upadhya, whose work as a Nepalese diplomat is perhaps less memorable than his penchant for polka dots, Pucci prints and other assorted peculiarities, like a     coat made from his retired sofa. Another was Iris Apfel, a Palm Beach socialite who became the subject of Albert Maysles’s last documentary film only after Mr. Cunningham took pictures of her on the street in her shiny black saucerlike glasses and chunky costume jewelry. “Bill photographed me before anyone knew who I was,” Ms. Apfel said. “At 94, I’ve become a cover girl, and he was very largely responsible for my ultimate success. ” Mr. Cunningham’s most frequent observation spot during the day was Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, where he became as much a part of the scenery as Tiffany  Company. His camera clicked constantly as he spotted fashions and moved with   speed to record his subjects at just the right angle. “Everyone knew to leave him alone when he saw a sneaker he liked or a dress that caught his eye,” said Harold Koda, the former curator in charge at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. “Because if you were in the way of someone he wanted to photograph,” said Kim Hastreiter, the editor of Paper magazine and a friend of Mr. Cunningham’s, “he would climb over you to get it. He was like a war photographer that way, except that what he was photographing were clothes. ” Mr. Cunningham himself once said: “When I’m photographing, I look for the personal style with which something is worn  —   sometimes even how an umbrella is carried or how a coat is held closed. At parties, it’s important to be almost invisible, to catch people when they’re oblivious to the camera  —   to get the intensity of their speech, the gestures of their hands. I’m interested in capturing a moment with animation and spirit. ” His survivors include several nieces and nephews. William John Cunningham Jr. was born on March 13, 1929, in Boston, the second of four children in an Irish Catholic family. In middle school, he used bits of material he got from a dime store to put together hats, one of which he gave to his mother to wear to the New York World’s Fair in 1939. “She never wore it,” Mr. Cunningham once said. “My family all thought I was a little nuts. ” As a teenager, he got a   job at the department store Bonwit Teller, then received a scholarship to Harvard, only to drop out after two months. “They thought I was an illiterate,” he said. “I was hopeless, but I was a visual person. ” With nothing to do in Boston and his parents pressuring him to find some direction, he moved to New York, where he took a room with an uncle, Tom Harrington, who had an ownership stake in an advertising agency. “My family thought they could indoctrinate me in that business, that living with my uncle it would brush off,” Mr. Cunningham said. “But it didn’t work. I had always been interested in fashion. ” So when Mr. Harrington issued his nephew an ultimatum  —   “Quit making hats or get out of my apartment”  —   Mr. Cunningham chose the latter, relocating to a   apartment on East 52nd Street that doubled as a showroom for his   fedoras and   toques. To make extra money, Mr. Cunningham began freelancing for Women’s Wear Daily, then quit sometime in the early 1960s after getting into a feud with its publisher, John Fairchild, over who was a better designer: André Courrèges or Yves Saint Laurent. “John killed my story,” Mr. Cunningham later recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, Saint Laurent is the one.’ And that was it for me. When they wouldn’t publish the Courrèges article the way I saw it, I left. ” By then, feminism was on the ascent, and   paired with flouncy tops were replacing pink suits and pillbox hats. To Mr. Cunningham, it was becoming clear that his days as a milliner were numbered. Around 1967, he got his first camera and used it to take pictures of the “Summer of Love,” when he realized the action was out on the street. He started taking assignments for The Daily News and The Chicago Tribune, and he became a regular contributor to The Times in the late 1970s. Over the next two decades, he declined repeated efforts by his editors to get him to take a staff position. “Once people own you,” he would say, “they can tell you what to do. So don’t let ’em. ” That changed in 1994, after Mr. Cunningham was hit by a truck while riding his bicycle. Explaining why he had finally accepted The Times’s offer, he said, “It was a matter of health insurance. ” Occasionally, Mr. Cunningham allowed people to celebrate him in one way or another. For example, in 1993, he was honored by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and biked onto the stage to accept his award. But that was largely out of character. Later on, Mr. Koda approached him to see if he would be interested in curating a retrospective of his pictures at the Met. Mr. Cunningham turned him down. “He said to me, ‘I have a job I love,’” Mr. Koda recalled. “He thought it would be a diversion. He did what he loved, and what he loved is documenting this very ephemeral world. ” Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Cunningham was a reluctant participant in his own documentary. According to its director, Richard Press, Mr. Cunningham would agree to be interviewed, then spend months canceling or postponing shoots. Mr. Cunningham said until his death that he had not seen the film. “We tried to get him to go to the opening,” Mr. Press said. “He just said: ‘Oh, kids, you made a movie. I’m too busy.’ He came to our   party and he photographed it. He put the directors from the festival in his column, but he didn’t even say why they were there or what they were celebrating. ” Mr. Cunningham also resisted the trends of celebrity dressing. He had seen actresses in their fishtail dresses preening and posing before the phalanxes of photographers at ceremonies like the Golden Globes and the Oscars. They were poised. They looked pretty. Yet he could not muster enthusiasm for them. It wasn’t simply that he was nostalgic for another time, back when famous women like Lauren Bacall and Brooke Astor actually dressed themselves. That era may have held a certain appeal for him, but even when he was in his 70s and 80s, he still had plenty of subjects he loved to shoot. One was Louise Doktor, an administrative assistant at a New York holding company who had a coat with four sleeves and a handbag made from a soccer ball. Another was Andre J. a bearded man with a taste for    ’  dresses. “He had people who recurred in his columns,” Mr. Koda said. “Most of them were not famous. They were working people he was interested in. His thing was personal style. ” Mr. Cunningham put it this way in an essay he wrote for The Times in 2002: “Fashion is as vital and as interesting today as ever. I know what people with a more formal attitude mean when they say they’re horrified by what they see on the street. But fashion is doing its job. It’s mirroring exactly our times. ”",1
25871,Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence,"  Michael Snyder 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let’s hope that it doesn’t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton . And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned “about the possibility of violence” on election day… 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are “very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are “very confident” about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump’s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate’s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump’s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump’s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, s omeone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina . On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, “Why can’t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. “The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‘some thugs’ that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let’s certainly hope that we don’t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is “grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … 
“Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I’ve been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan’s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to “declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. Don't forget to follow the D.C. Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter. PLEASE help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks. Share this:",1
25872,Full Text: James Comey’s Prepared Remarks for His Congressional Testimony - Breitbart,"Former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Thursday regarding his firing by President Donald Trump and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [The committee has released the full text of Comey’s prepared remarks. Read them below:  Chairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with   and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee. January 6 Briefing, I first met    Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment. The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the   and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing. The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI’s   responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the  . Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBI’s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a   investigation of his personal conduct. It is important to understand that FBI   investigations are different than the   known criminal investigative work. The Bureau’s goal in a   investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves “turning” the recruited person into a   or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of   intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities. Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will “open an investigation” on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted. In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure   Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true we did not have an open   case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our    meeting at Trump Tower, based on   Trump’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance. I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the   in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after    conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone)  —   once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine    conversations with President Trump in four months  —   three in person and six on the phone. January 27 Dinner, The President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others. It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks. The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away. My instincts told me that the    setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI’s traditionally independent status in the executive branch. I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my   term as Director. And then, because the   made me uneasy, I added that I was not “reliable” in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody’s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President. A few moments later, the President said, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. ” I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner. At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because “problems” come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work. Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, “I need loyalty. ” I replied, “You will always get honesty from me. ” He paused and then said, “That’s what I want, honest loyalty. ” I paused, and then said, “You will get that from me. ” As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase “honest loyalty” differently, but I decided it wouldn’t be productive to push it further. The term  —   honest loyalty  —   had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect. During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it. As was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI. February 14 Oval Office Meeting, On February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a   of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the   of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs. The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me. When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, “I want to talk about Mike Flynn. ” Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify. The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information  —   a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed. The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, “He is a good guy and has been through a lot. ” He repeated that Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. ” I replied only that “he is a good guy. ” (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would “let this go. ” The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President. I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn’s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency. The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the President’s request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a    conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in   investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney General’s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role. After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members  —   or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them  —   aware of the President’s request. Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the President’s concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened  —   him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind  —   was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBI’s potential investigation of General Flynn. March 30 Phone Call, On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to “lift the cloud. ” I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then   the problems this was causing him. Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week  —   at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, “We need to get that fact out. ” (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.) The President went on to say that if there were some “satellite” associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn’t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren’t investigating him. In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn’t brought up “the McCabe thing” because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe’s wife) campaign money. Although I didn’t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person. He finished by stressing “the cloud” that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn’t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could. Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all   matters) to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later. April 11 Phone Call, On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I “get out” that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that “the cloud” was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel. He said he would do that and added, “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal we had that thing you know. ” I did not reply or ask him what he meant by “that thing. ” I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended. That was the last time I spoke with President Trump.",1
25873,Happy Halloween: Here’s How Witches Could Save the Planet,"Alternet 
There are all kinds of bad words for “woman.” They are designed to degrade, frighten and dehumanize us. Among the most ancient is the word “witch.” “Witch” is the first rallying cry, used to kill and diabolize outspoken women ever since the witch trials of Salem, and the widespread witch hunts of Europe before them. Beginning with “witch,” society has attached a stigma to any woman who dares break with a social mold that would have her lower her eyes and smile politely in the face of injustice. Note the recent “nasty woman” comment presidential candidate Donald Trump directed recently at his opponent, Hillary Clinton, because he didn’t like the way she spoke. Look no further than the trolls of the internet and their daily insults and death threats against any woman who dares call herself feminist or in any way ruffles the feathers of patriarchy. It’s inarguable that, still today, if a woman is anything but small and pleasing, there are men out there who will dub her a villain and hunt her down. And it’s easy to trace much of that mentality back to the witch hunts. Now, a backlash is brewing. Women across the world, are “coming out of the broom closet” en masse to take back the term witch. The idea behind the re-witching movement is that the feminine components innate to humanity—things like compassion, self-love, feeling our emotions, tuning into the planet’s cycles, protecting nature—have been trampled in favor of patriarchy. The overly masculine way of thinking, witches will tell you, is based on conquering and exploiting, and has led humanity down its current destructive path. It is a path of blind progress and hunger for power, which uses the planet and its resources for capital gains with little regard for life. Without the input of the feminine (which promotes nurturing, healing, sustaining), shit has gotten way out of whack. Suddenly, witchy is trendy. Walk into an Urban Outfitters anywhere and you’ll find tarot card-printed sheets; candle holders (and 50 other trinkets) that pay homage to the lunar cycles; cauldrons and black cats plastered everywhichwhere; and coffeetable books like The Modern Guide to Witchcraft (which is frequently sold-out in the online store). While these plastic trinkets and commercialization might lead one to see the witch reemergence as a superficial passing fad, it’s more like a reaction to something authentic. Maybe the mass-production of “witchy” is a clever marketing response to the growing popularity of witchiness online, or a patriarcial backlash attempt to cheapen a genuine uprising of women. Either way, a very real cultural shift appears to be underway. One brilliant example of this was Alexandra Petri’s satirical response to Trump’s “nasty woman” comment in the Washington Post on October 20. She used witch imagery to spotlight the long-entrenched tradition of demonizing strong women in society. Modern-day witches aren’t woo-woo cult groupies oblivious to how out-there it might sound to call oneself a witch. They are normal women with careers, children, families and social lives who are fed up with the way things are going and want to do something radical about it. As we find ourselves at this moment in history in which every reputable scientist in the world says we’re on the brink of all-out climate disaster, it’s time for women to step into the sacred role of the healer (witch) and reverse the toxic masculinity overload before it’s too late. So say the witches. In groups across social media, women hold meetings about how hard it is to come out as a witch for fear of judgment and ridicule, because the term “witch” is so deeply rooted in the modern psyche as a wart-nosed, green-skinned, cackling, spell-casting devil worshipper. This imagery was no accident. The same powerful male architects of the witch hunts crafted demonic, unappealing propaganda to scare women out of summoning their power, explains modern-day witch culture icon and activist Sarah Durham Wilson. “A ‘witch’ in the witch hunts in Salem, or the witch hunts all over Europe, which were massive femicide, was basically just any strong woman,” Wilson explains, noting that women who were healers, and midwives in particular, were labeled witches and killed because the men who wanted to control the medical/bodily world saw them as a threat. Women who were outspoken, who stood up against injustices, who reflected unpleasant truths back to men in power by being “too pretty” or “too ugly” or “too smart” were all deemed witches and murdered. “If you read some of the transcripts of the judges sentencing witches to the gallows, it was because of the way these women made them feel, you know, like too lustful, or facing parts of themselves they didn’t want to face,” Wilson says. The modern rehashing of ancient ceremonies and witchcraft is nothing new. It has been gaining speed since the neo-paganism revival of the 1970s, and Wilson and her ilk are following in a line of women who stuck their necks out in the name of the feminine at a time when doing so was much more dangerous than it is today. One example Wilson, who is in her 30s, notes as a predecessor of, and inspiration behind, the current movement is Z. Budapest. She calls Budapest “a bad ass, great feminist witch from the ’70s.” She says Budapest “really paved the way for a lot of us.” When Budapest started calling herself a witch, Wilson says, “she had to have cops escort her and things like that because people were still so terrified of witches as devil worshipers, when she was doing exactly what we’re all doing now, which is honoring the Earth, and coming together with women.” Wilson is perhaps the biggest modern pioneer of the new witch movement. She doesn’t identify with any specific group, i.e. paganism, Wicca, and so on. She sees a witch as someone who works to refeminize our culture and refocus our social priorities toward healing. When she publicly claimed the title of witch six years ago, she defined it to mean any woman who is a healer, and is strong in herself and her connection to the Earth, moon and nature’s cycles. (Read her 2014 article “ 13 Signs You’re a Witch ” in Rebelle Society.) It was a radical move that ostracized her from certain parts of her life. But it gained her a large, devoted following on social media and a sense of deep empowerment. Wilson has inspired thousands of women to “come out of the broom closet,” as she puts it. While feminist-witch figures like Wilson aren’t new, there’s a new urgency bolstering the cause today: climate change. Among many bigger organizers of witchy/divine feminine retreats, secret online covens and feminine empowerment gatherings—which have been cropping up across the internet and beyond—there is a common rallying cry: The Earth is suffering and needs healing. Earth connection is a major theme in just about every witchy circle, and Facebook is splattered with groups both secret and open that are dedicated to reclaiming the word “witch,” relearning herbal remedies and reconnecting with the planet via ancient pagan ceremonies. Ceremonies like the Celtic holiday Samhain, which celebrates death and ancestors, and was the basis for Halloween. As far as Sarah Durham Wilson is concerned, healing the planet is the ultimate work of witches—and, really, everyone. Following her career as a celebrity journalist for outlets like Rolling Stone, VH1 and Vanity Fair, she fell deep into the rock ‘n’ roll party lifestyle and a bout of self-disconnect. One night she “hit rock bottom” and “drank a ton of wine, swallowed a bunch of pills and hoped never to wake up.” When she did wake up, she had a profound experience of what she calls an awakening of “feminine goddess energy.” She rededicated her life to writing about the “divine feminine,” and helping other women answer the call of the healer/goddess/witch. For the last six years she has led paid retreats and group phone calls like her series of “Coven Conversations,” via her organization Do It Girl, which has almost 50,000 followers on Facebook. Following a recent experience in ceremony with the traditional indigenous psychedelic plant ayahuasca in Peru, Wilson has decided to refocus her platform on the Earth’s plight. Wilson recently spoke with AlterNet about reclaiming “witch,” making activism sexy, ayahuasca, and how strong women (witches) can save the planet. The following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity. Image via Shutterstock.com / Hannamariah April M. Short: The word ‘witch,’ the word ‘goddess’ and the phrase ‘divine feminine’—all these different sorts of spiritual-feminism terms are so hot with women on social media right now. I think it’s important to clarify what they mean, what is their purpose. We’ll start with, why reclaim the word witch? Why reclaim something so demonized rather than just come up with a new term? Sarah Durham Wilson: In the book In the House of the Moon: Reclaiming the Feminine Spirit Healing by Jason Elias and Katherine Ketcham there’s a chapter called “The Goddess and the Witch” that links the two. The beauty of the goddess and the healing of the witch, and it goes through the witch hunts to explain that witches were healers, and they did have power. It is the power of love and the power of the Earth. The Earth is incredibly powerful. I mean, we’ve done a good job of killing her, but her cycles of life, and rebirth, and all her healing properties—the plants and the ocean and the beautiful creatures that she birthed. It’s an incredibly magical place, and we knew that as children, but we’ve forgotten it and we’ve all stayed inside behind our technology and really cut ourselves off from the Earth. That’s partially why she’s dying, her children have turned their backs on her. So, witch. To take back that word is to take back our power. Do your own research on the witch hunts. Open one book on the witch hunts, and you’ll be like “What the f*ck?” But instead you let history, instead of herstory, tell you the story. They can say that, you know: We worked with the devil, we hexed people and cast evil spells. Then you do a little bit of research yourself, you open one goddamn book and you see they were just women. And then your rage just wakes you up, and you take the word back. When I took the word back, I wanted to, like, stand in grocery store checkout lines and scream out. Coming out of the broom closet is a huge thing. To reclaim your power as a witch is to reclaim your power as a woman. End of story. As a self-healer, as someone with deep intuition, as someone linked to the Earth. It is a beautiful gift, a gift of true femininity, intuition and oneness. A higher goddess moving you through life, and so many faces of the goddess represent so many faces of woman. We’re not just one thing you can put in a box. We are ugly and terrifying, and beautiful and nurturing, and deathly. We are all the things nature is. She is unending, and we are that. So take back witch. Take back being a woman. AMS: What is feminine about the Earth, nature and healing the Earth? SDW: Women’s bodies are directly linked to the Earth. When I say my body and the Earth are one, it’s like, I have the power to create life the way the Earth has the power to create life, and to wax and wane like the Earth and the moon do through seasons and phases. I have a 28-day cycle, and my body is like the moon. I have the power to create life in my womb, just like the Earth itself. And then, as women, the way the Earth rebirths herself in spring and goes through a full moon in the summer, we’re on fire, and then in the fall we notice our energy starts to wane, and then in winter we die only to be reborn again. When you really start to link up to the cycles of the Earth, you realize you and the Earth are one and it’s the most natural thing to do is to align with these cycles. In a linear, patriarchal society we’re told to go, go, go everyday, and everyday should be 70 degrees and sunny, right? We should always be fine, always shine like the sun, when really we’re much more like the Earth and moon where we wax and wane and glow and then offer birth, and then kind of die again. We’re changing constantly. We’re not supposed to be the same forever. We’re supposed to constantly be growing, changing, dying in that life, death, rebirth cycle the Earth itself is in. That is what I attune women to, that more feminine rebirth cycle. The way a snake sheds its skin or the Earth dies in the winter to be reborn again. That cyclical nature of life is the cyclical nature of women, of the feminine. AMS: I want to talk about the less appealing sides of the feminine that have been repressed, and maybe labeled “witch.” SDW: Well, a witch in the witch hunts in Salem, or the witch hunts all over Europe, which were massive femicide, was basically just any strong woman. There was one town in Scotland that left one woman standing. Everyone else was burned at the stake or hung or drowned. They were, it was basically just “woman” who they were after. The witch hunt manifesto is called the Malleus Maleficarum [Editor’s note: usually translated as Hammer of Witches ] written in 1486. That was how the whole witchcraft-devil thing came about. That lie that women were like the devil. They even, when they wrote the Maleficarum they described the devil as the shape of basically our reproductive system, right, the uterus and the ovaries, that horned head. If you read some of the transcripts of the judges sentencing witches to the gallows, it was because of the way these women made them feel, you know, like too lustful, or facing parts of themselves they didn’t want to face. A woman could be too beautiful, or too ugly, or too smart or a lesbian or own land that the government wanted or was owed, or if she was, god help her, a midwife or a healer. Midwives “stole” from the doctors of the time, so the men. And of course, now we’re having midwives and doulas come back, but giving birth is still not just women. And of course women knew more about birth than male doctors, and always have. Witches were the healers, women who honored the goddess or honored the Earth. And covens were dismembered and became illegal because women coming together with the same intention proved far too powerful. That’s why witches wear black, because they had to move through the night in all black, in cloaks, and try to blend into the night. I mean, too lovely, too pretty, too smart, too stupid… If a woman sneezed around someone and the next day that person got a cold, she was a witch. If she was a widow, she was a witch. Basically if you were a woman you could die. If you didn’t fit in completely to the standards of the society you could be killed, which, even though we can’t be sent to the gallows now for being different, we can in our own way these days. We’re too powerful. Definitely too powerful. It’s a crime in society. AMS: We should talk about that a little. Modern-day witch hunts. SDW: Yeah, look what happens to Hillary Clinton, you know? Look what happened to Yoko Ono. Women who are too emotional, or too smart, or too powerful are called crazy. Look at Trump calling Hillary a “nasty woman” because she wasn’t behaving the way he wanted her to behave, which is polite and pleasing, right? And small. How dare a woman beat him, in public. AMS: Yes, and I love the way women have been reclaiming that, by the way, speaking of reclaiming. The “nasty woman” trending memes and things are hilarious. SDW: I know! I when I saw him say that I was like, You’re gonna wish you hadn’t said that. I was so happy he did, you know? Because “no one respects women more” than he does. [Laughter] AMS: I also wanted to ask you about darkness—the darker side of the feminine, and if it fits, how the darkness of femininity and darkness of being human in general, relates to the season, as we have this traditional “death season” upon us, Halloween. And we can also talk about Halloween, and how everything’s become so sensationalized around death and darkness. SDW: And commercialized. AMS: Yes, commercialized, that’s maybe even more important. SDW: Yeah. The wheel is turning dark. It’s Samhain, and it’s a really beautiful time as we’re entering the feminine, we’re entering the underworld. You might have noticed yourself feeling more, as Western medicine would say, depressed, as the wheel turns towards fall. And not to say if you’re depressed to not to go get help, but just not to fear so much the underside of your life, and the underside of your feelings, the down parts and low parts. Spend some time with those, and really investigate what they’re trying to tell you. It’s the beginning of the death season, so what hasn’t served you in your life? What hasn’t served you this year? What do you need to let go of? What patterns are making you sick or unhealthy or small or tired or weak? Why I think my voice resonates is that I’m able to talk about the more feminine maladies—alcoholism, depression, anxiety. I have been looking at some stuff I’ve done and ways I’ve been that, if I could just keep going like a sunny summer day I might be able to avoid. But fall asks of us to slow down and winter asks of us to stop and die, and if you notice how these leaves are falling, to let go. And how beautiful these trees look letting go, right? They’re at their most beautiful in their surrender. The season asks us to give up that masculine fight. Summer is full of masculine energy. It’s all masculine energy. It’s go, go, go, do, do, do. All masculine. Then fall is, I surrender, I move down, I move towards my public identity of death. As the trees are stripped down to nothing, who am I with nothing? Who am I without my identity?” And that’s what winter asks of us. The beauty of that is every year— until this beautiful planet might not make it—but every year in spring, life comes back. We come back. But every year the alignment with Earth teaches us slow down, and then in winter die to what you’ve been, so that you can compost the old, let go of what didn’t work, and enrich what has worked in the dreamtime of winter, and then become new again, reborn and new. And that’s the beauty of life cycles, and the beauty of aligning with the feminine. Samhain is so beautiful because the veils are so thin, and especially around October 31st, the veil is thinnest [between life and death]. We can really feel our ancestors if we bow to them. I love doing retreats and workshops [in this season]. One year at Joshua Tree we did an altar to our ancestors for Samhain and it was so beautiful, moving everyone in circles, drawing pictures of memories, and placing candles. We bowed to our ancestors and asked for their healing and asked for their guidance, and really felt moved by them and protected by them, and loved by them. The commercialization—especially the parody of witches with their ugly noses, and warted noses, and green skin—that’s all propaganda that was used for years to try to encourage people to fear the witch, because the witch was the powerful woman. And if we feared ourselves, we would never unlock our own power, and therefore always bow to a power external. We stay pretty, small, safe, and contained, if we think the power is outside of us and not inside of us to change our lives and to heal ourselves. AMS: And now Halloween season is about this commercialization and making light of darkness and death. We throw candy at it and laugh it off as a children’s holiday rather than what you were describing about Samhain, slowing down, embracing the cycle of the year, the reality of death and remembering those who’ve passed, connecting. SDW: Yeah. It’s a really beautiful time and unfortunately we live in a culture that doesn’t really know how to honor death. What the feminine teaches us is to honor our own death. I think Joseph Campbell says, if you’re blessed you’ll live many lives in one lifetime. But that involves going through many deaths, right? Change is death, of what you know and who you’ve been. And when we learn to honor our own deaths, we really put to rest what hasn’t served—relationships, ways of being, ways of identifying, ways of showing up in the world—and allow that winter space for something new to be born. That’s a really beautiful way to live. Honoring those who’ve passed is so important, and the slowdown time of Samhain takes time to stop and honor those who’ve come before us. That for me is how the holiday should be honored, is by honoring the dead and death itself as something that brings rebirth. AMS: Let’s talk about ayahuasca and your travels to Peru. What was your experience like and how did it impact you? SDW: I’ve been [to Peru] five times. The most seminal part of the most recent trip, other than meeting the man who will now be the father of my child, was meeting Pachamama, the spirit of great Gaia, the great mother goddess of the Earth. I went into the ayahuasca experience intending to deal with my own depression, and it really helped my mind to get calm. It also slapped me out of the pretty, pleasing priestess stuff, and because she is the voice of the Earth, showed me how sick the Earth is. She infused me with Pachamama and showed me how I need to be devoted to my planet. I’m a proponent of ayahuasca, but not a proponent of using it to escape yourself. I’m a proponent of using it to enter yourself, and then never, ever abuse it the way some people really do. I know that sounds crazy, but a lot of people do use it to leave the planet, leave their bodies instead of enter. I highly suggest a pilgrimage to Peru and three doses, then go home and embody and use the wisdom she’s offered you to change your life and be an activist for the planet. It’s not a magic pill or anything. It will bring your demons to the surface. It’s nothing to be taken lightly. It’s the voice of a dying planet. It can be a very scary experience if you’re not in the right headspace. Make sure you’re with the right shaman. It’s the voice of the Earth, and everyone should hear the voice of the Earth in some way. If not through ayahuasca, through spending more time outside, through getting off social media, and through taking true action for her. What she will tell you is, “I’m dying, do something.” AMS: Earlier you said, ‘This beautiful planet might not make it.’ Could you talk more about climate change, and the state of the planet as it relates to women, witches and the work you’re doing? SDW: The work that I’m doing now is really focused, completely, on the state of the planet. I think that mass-spirituality has gotten pretty watered down to “love and light” and “lightworkers” and “meditate on it,” and not really focused on the darkness. Which is insane, to try to pretend there isn’t darkness now. Z. Budapest is a bad-ass, great feminist witch from the ’70s, and really paved the way for a lot of us. She had to have cops escort her and things like that because people were still so terrified of witches as devil worshipers, when she was doing exactly what we’re all doing now, which is honoring the Earth, and coming together with women. A few years ago she got online and started looking at women who were out, calling themselves witches. She said she was really disappointed in this movement. She said all of you are trying to be so pretty and pleasing. Basically, she was saying we were still conforming to patriarchy and she said, where is the anger? Why aren’t you mad? Look at what has been done to this Earth, and get mad. I felt like it was a real slap in the face that I definitely needed, because I’m a motherless daughter, which is why I do a lot of self-mothering work. But I didn’t really have that good wakeup call from my mom. So I look to the elders in this movement to remind us that this isn’t a popularity contest. “Witch” has become such a hot word, but witches and priestesses made a sacred vow to protect the Earth, to protect the innocent, to protect creatures. When we make it about our photoshoots and our likes on social media we’re really off course. So, rage to me equals change—justifiable, healthy rage for what’s been done to the planet. I mean look at how, in these three presidential debates they never talked about climate change, they never talked about the dying planet. How is that possible? So, it’s good to get really mad, to speak up for the Earth. And that goes back to Pachamama, goddess Gaia, who, having worked with ayahuasca, she has shown me again and again, she’s on her deathbed. She’s hooked up to life support. There isn’t much time left. That should make us all weep, and then that should make us all fight. As witches, we’re all women that grew up being told, “That’s just a dog, stop treating it like a human, you like animals better than humans.” Or, “Stop talking to that tree.” Or whatever. But it wasn’t that we liked animals better than humans, or that we’re crazy for talking to trees. We knew that animals and the Earth were sacred and to be loved and protected. But we were told on the mass scale to stop talking about it and to stop devoting ourselves to innocent creatures and innocent plants. But now, as we wake up and reclaim our voices, we were right as innocent children about the Earth and about animals. Every single day a new animal goes up on the extinction list or the endangered species list, and every single day we lose more and more of the oceans, and more and more of the forests, more of the Earth itself. This should be the number-one topic of politicians and journalists and everyone, everywhere. The Earth should be way bigger than the Kardashians. But it’s not, and that’s a huge problem. AMS: You have tens of thousands of followers on social media; you’ve inspired thousands of women to ‘come out of the broom closet’ and publically reclaim the term ‘witch.’ Do you think the state of the Earth today, the climate crisis and where we are in history has to do with that? Why do you think so many women are responding to your message? SDW: Actually I’ve really taken a break from social media, one because I’m pregnant and all my energy is going in and not out, but two because I’ve found a real pushback against me trying to talk about the planet. People wanted the safe and happy memes. They wanted safe and easy messages instead of the take-action messages. That was really driving me crazy. But I know there’s a better way—I’m kind of starting over and changing everything about my brand so that nobody’s confused when they come to my page that I’m there to be spiritually correct or pretty and pleasing and small for them. I started off being a really radical rebel in all of this, and I sort of miss that voice because, you know, you get an audience, and then you get self-conscious. It watered down my message, and I, for my child, I really want to embody Pachamama, which is not a silent bystander in the Earth’s demise. So, yeah, there is a mass awakening to the Earth, and it is mostly, amongst women. (I keep saying I wish Donald Trump could get pregnant because there’s nothing that brings you more into your body and into this sort of awakening.) What happened with me in my awakening is I ascended out of my body and out of my pain, and it was a way to sort of abandon my human mask, and now I’m in my body and on the Earth in a way I’ve never been, and it’s such a literally sobering time, to be pregnant, and to look at the state of the Earth right now. To look at ways that I sort of spiritually glossed over my life, my mistakes, my pain, my regrets. So, when I come back online it’s gonna be far more about the human awakening than the spiritual awakening, and a return to the Earth in a very unapologetic way. About what’s going on with the planet, in a way to hopefully wake women up further to the pain of the planet. That to me is the work of the priestess. It’s not to over-spiritualize things, because again, that’s a way of waxing everything sort of pretty and light. And I just don’t think that really serves. I think what serves is rooting people into their bodies and back to the Earth. I think that’s the only chance the Earth has, is if we all reconnect to her and back to ourselves, and back to our pain. To really hear her cries, and answer those to the best of our ability. Image via Shutterstock.com/ Simon Hofer . AMS: It is surprising to me that people have reacted that way to your speaking up more about the planet. I guess it shouldn’t be, because I know that many people do not like to hear about the state of the Earth. In the online news world, the stories about climate change and serious realities about the planet tend to get less attention. SDW: We’re all guilty. I remember, I used I really look up to Anne Lamott, and I still do, she’s such an amazing writer. But I remember in one of the times I was trying to get sober like five years ago, I was like, Well how does she get her rocks off? You know? It was like, OK, if I’m not gonna drink wine and smoke a joint, what am I gonna do? And she was like, “Honestly, I read ad tabloids and pile all the dogs onto my bed at once.” And I was like “Anne Lamott reads tabloids?” Something about that Anne Lamott, a heroine of mine, gave me permission. The first trimester can be really tough, and you go through what’s called prenatal depression: Who am I to raise this child? You have to go through a huge death before a birth, to become a mother. Sometimes I literally can’t take the pain of the Earth and I find myself on like crappy Daily Mail and things like that. We all do it, we all want to distract ourselves, because it is so sad, and it is so scary. The real work is turning and facing not just our pain but the Earth’s pain, which is all one. AMS: It’s interesting that people resonated with you coming out and being this strong woman reclaiming witch as that feminist/feminine connection to self and the Earth, but when you took that a step further and connected it with the reality of things, they turned away. Why do you think women who resonate with the message of “witch as healer” and “women are close with the Earth” aren’t ready to connect to the hard truth? SDW: Because it’s Debby Downer. To get people acting, that’s the healthy balance of the masculine and the feminine. The feminine side of us dreams, and the masculine side of us does. And if we put that action into our dreams, that’s how we become whole and make a change in our lives and the world. We can’t just talk and dream about changing the world. We really have to take action. When I saw that actress Shailene Woodley get arrested at Standing Rock, and the way other people are taking action with protests and things like that, I was lying in my bed sick from the baby in my belly, and I had this, really—we need a better word for it, but it’s like this good jealousy of “you go, girl, and I wish I was doing that.” It’s not jealousy and it’s not envy, but it’s healthy visceral inspiration, I guess. Now it’s about figuring out a way to take action. I’m one of those people who shares a million petitions on Facebook and gets like two likes, you know? I still don’t know a way to make activism sexy, and until I do I’m not really gonna put myself out there, because while my voice has been a pretty cool agent for change, for me it’s not doing enough anymore. It’s tough to make the state of the planet sexy. Having been a journalist I know everything needs a hook, it needs to be sexy. It frustrates me when I see people with big platforms using it to hawk makeup or something, which is going to the landfills, instead of using it to hawk change. That’s why I love people like Leonardo DeCaprio (even though he’s a total horndog). At least he’s using his platform for the ecological crisis. AMS: Yeah. I love to see people using their voices that way. SDW: There’s nothing hotter than activism. There’s this woman, she’s kind of famous, she’s on Chicago Med and One Tree Hill, Torey DeVitto … she really uses her voice for animals. She once regrammed something I did about Donald Trump, and she got all this hate and like half the likes, because—how dare she not just post a sexy selfie? How dare a celebrity talk about the biggest choice in the world coming up right now? It’s hard to stick your neck out and risk alienating or losing some audience, but she doesn’t seem to care, and I really respect people who do that in the limelight. AMS: Me too. And I do see how it’s hard to do that. SDW: Yeah, but it gets to the point where you think about all of the innocent people who could be saved by you using your voice for activism. You gotta stick your neck out there, you gotta stir the pot. How are you going to make a change if not? Pretty and pleasing won’t save the world. What will save the world is people standing up and using their voice, and when you do that, you’re gonna get stuff thrown at you. My problem was, and I do use a lot of goddess images, so I was standing on this throne and people were throwing tomatoes at me, and when I was really in my maiden stage I would pick up the tomato, throw it back, and cry. Now, as the queen, you just sit in the throne. You’re not gonna get down and get yourself dirty and get into the fight. That’s just what they want, they want negative attention. Ignoring the tomato throwers takes being so rooted. And again, that’s Pachamama, and root chakra, and Mother Earth. You have to be so rooted in yourself and on your throne and know who you are to use your voice. You can’t just speak the speak, you have to really be sure that you’re being ignited and inspired by soul, and not ego. Then, when they throw tomatoes, it won’t hurt as bad. If you say something you’re not quite sure of, when they throw tomatoes it’ll hurt. That’s why, speaking for the Earth, you can’t lose. I’m not making my life about me anymore. I’m now the mother. And if you think about the word “mother” it holds this sacred word “other.” And the beauty of becoming the mother to yourself and the world is in caring for the other and giving to the other, you receive. The maiden is trapped in this cage of herself, and it’s a very lonely, isolating place. But the mother is the giver and the nurturer, and the mother has a cause, which is the other. The child, the planet. Which is why you see all those beautiful images on Pinterest of a woman holding her womb, but it’s the Earth. Really, to hold the Earth, to calm its cries, to rise. Really, if you look at the world, everyone, everywhere is crying out for mother. The comparison, and the feminine and the healing of the wounds is missing on the planet. That’s what we rise into, and then we care for the Earth like the sacred other, and then we receive from that work. AMS: When you were talking about the tomatoes it really flashed for me that that’s where the spirituality side of things, the self-work can come in. And this is kind of what past activists and leaders have said, too: When you find that strength in yourself, that light and that deep goodness, you use that to root yourself down and then no one can shake you when you do the real work. SDW: Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about in creating the fear around the witch—it creates the fear around yourself. The witch as a woman who might not be so pretty and pleasing and fit the norm. If you’re so scared not to be pretty and pleasing and fit the norm, you never enter these darker chambers of yourself and start to really discover yourself. That treasure is always buried. If you never enter the buried parts of yourself, you never find the treasure within you. And then, you never unlock your power. That was the whole point of patriarchal propaganda, was to fear the witch. We fear these wild, unknown places in us, so we stay away from them, but that’s where our power lies. In our dreams and our fears and the idea that we might not be our true selves yet. There might be so much more to us, and that could scare us too, because then what would happen to our life as we knew it? It would probably dissolve, and fall apart. Finding ourselves, once we leave normal society—which, you have to sort of break up with that to really go on these heroine quests—then we find the power to stay rooted in ourselves to do this work and to go public with this work. You need a lot of inner grace, a lot of inner power to put yourself out there. AMS: So what can men do? What’s the role of men in all of this as you see it? AMS: My dad’s a really great example, Bernie’s a really great example of the sacred masculine. You know, the men that are awakened to the feminine. Deep compassion for the Earth and animals, that’s a feminine side that all men have, but fear that it makes them weak to feel emotion or care too much. Because patriarchy has made them think they have to be so tough, and abandon their feminine side, which would save their lives: self-love and self-compassion and intuition and oneness with all. Men can wake their feminine. Men can start to open books and explore what the feminine means in men. There are men’s groups. You can go into men’s circles where men are safe to cry together. That’s step number one: Feel your feelings. And know that that is safe. Know that your anger is probably masking your pain, and look at your pain. The “heal yourself to heal the world” message almost more applies to men. If men like Trump could look at his anger and realize it was all his pain and fear of not being loved, he wouldn’t be on this intense, destructive warpath. He would sob at his knees and ask for love instead of power. Men feeling their feelings and feeling safe to do that, and connecting back to the Earth—and Andrew Harvey’s great about talking about this: Everybody, men included, ask themselves once they’ve gone into their pain, “What breaks your heart the most on this planet?” And the cool thing about human individuals is everyone is programmed, or geared to have a special cause. For me, everything breaks my heart, but animal cruelty or the pipelines [the most]. Whatever it is that you can’t even look at online, make that your cause. Andrew Harvey says, “Find what breaks your heart the most and move towards that.” So, figure out what specific thing that’s killing the planet is killing you, and move towards that. Or, you know, if it’s alcoholism or homelessness or not just something environmental. Get involved in a cause that connects you to others and makes you of service. Men getting not in military services, but volunteering service, activism services and connecting in and becoming the sacred masculine that serves to protect the feminine and protect the Earth and innocents. That’s a really good way for men to get involved. Stand up as our warriors and our heroes, not as our villains or our bystanders.

25874,MUFON International tracking multiple triangle UFO reports,"Four triangle UFO cases were reported to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) international desk in recent months from Switzerland, New Zealand, Canada and Iran. A Switzerland witness at Neuchatel recalled an incident from March 2011 when he and his wife were sitting in the living room of their apartment at Rue de la Cote.
“My wife sat under a side window of the room from where you can see the Rue Auguste Bachelin,” the witness stated.“It was already dark outside and there were nearly no cars in that road anymore. There is anyway not much traffic in that road. It was very silent outside and inside we had no light switched on as we were watching TV. It is impossible that this is any reflection from the inside. Then I turned around to talk to my wife and I saw a huge triangle with three lights under each corner.”
The witness described the object.
“It was approximately 15-20 meters wide and maybe 1.5 meters high. The edges were rounded and there were no windows or anything to see. Maybe there was something on the top, but that was not visible from that angle. The object was flying/hovering maybe 10 meters or lower from west to east, following the street.”
The witness was able to watch the object for between 10 and 20 seconds.
“The speed was very low, but I cannot tell how fast it was. It seemed to me like it was searching something like a police helicopter, but it was sure no helicopter. I am a FPV drone pilot myself and I know how a helicopter flies and that it has to make a lot of sound when flying so low. Surface was black matte without any symbols or markings as far as I have seen it.”
The witness submitted one illustration with the report.
“The next week I have searched in Google for a triangle UFO and it looks nearly exactly like the one described in the ‘Belgium UFO Wave’ from 1989 but without the red light in the middle. My wife asked me what was wrong, but before I could answer the object was gone. She was making jokes of me so I didn’t talk to anybody about that until now. But I am nearly sure that someone else must have seen it. Please let me know if there are other reports so I know I am not crazy.”
MUFON International CAG team member Wolfgang Stelzig closed this case as an Unknown.
A New Zealand witness at Christchurch recalled a UFO event from 1990 when a V-shaped UFO about 120 feet long moved overhead on November 12.
“I could see the struts quite clearly,” the witness stated.“It was the shape of electrical pylons on its side. As it passed over there was no noise. I could see part of blue light /disc upfront and two light blue lights at the rear.”
A New Zealand witness said the triangle UFO had blue lights. Pictured: Christchurch, New Zealand. (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)
The witness explained his position.
“We lived on Cashmere Hills quite high up. After viewing this object for about 20 minutes, I asked my wife to get the video camera. I filmed it for 10 minutes. It somehow turned into a circular light jumping all over the place.”
The object the moved toward the witness.
“When the craft passed over, it was a huge triangle shape with light blue discs on the rear and front. There was no noise.”
The witness stated that he was later visited by “three men in suits” and questioned about the events.No images or videos were included with the MUFON report.

A Canadian witness at Estevan reported being overcome with fear after watching two, triangle-shaped UFOs move to the ground level at 8:15 p.m. on August 20, 2016. The witness was at his kitchen table when the lights on the objects caught his eye.

“They formed a triangle,” the witness stated.“There was a bright, orange-red light at the corner of each of them forming a triangle. These triangles that were formed were big. The size, location, and what had appeared they were doing scared me. They were floating, came down to the ground and appeared to be doing something. They were there for some time.”
The witness watched for about 20 minutes.
“I stopped watching them and closed the curtains. I felt that if I continued to watch them, that they would sense my presence there, even perhaps pick up on what I was thinking. At first I thought that a couple of semi-trucks took a wrong turn and had to turn around on our property. As I kept watching I soon realized I was wrong. I was stricken with fear and panic as I had watched what they were doing. I tried to calm myself. I was so worried that they would sense my presence being so close.”
Canadian MUFON Field Investigator Peter Derrick is investigating.

“I was awake studying for my post PhD exam,” the witness stated.“I did what I used to do every night. I went out in front of the house and stood right beside the dry river that is just in front of the house. That is when it happened. I saw a red light in distance. It came closer and closer. OMG, I still get goosebumps when I think about it. I couldn’t move at all. I mean I was just like a statue staring at that thing. I am usually very brave compared to my friends and family, but that was the most frightening event of my life.”
The witness said the object was emitting light.
“It then started scattering a red light over the area. I mean everywhere was red. After a minute, it came up and just disappeared in a second. I mean, the way it disappeared was even scary, like blinking. I have never said this to anyone because I think it will probably sound crazy. I didn’t know what to do, who to tell. I just found this site and reported what happened. I also never went back to that spot for smoking. Anyway, just writing about it here made me feel better already. Thank you.”

25877,New York Times Reinstates Managing Editor Role and Appoints Joseph Kahn - The New York Times,"The New York Times announced on Friday that it was reviving the title of managing editor and naming Joseph Kahn, an assistant editor for International, to the position. The elevation of Mr. Kahn, 52, to the   newsroom position establishes him as a leading candidate to succeed Dean Baquet as executive editor, as The Times continues its shift to the next generation of leaders. As part of the announcement, the company also said that Susan Chira, 58, one of three deputy executive editors, was leaving that role to write about gender issues for The Times. The move comes as The Times’s newsroom undergoes significant changes aimed at making it better positioned for its digital future. When Mr. Baquet retired the managing editor title in 2014, he said the changes to the leadership structure were intended to make titles more fluid and the newsroom more nimble and responsive. But in an interview on Friday, he said he came to realize that his job as the top editor “had become really large” because he also had to consider the newsroom’s overall strategy. Mr. Baquet said he decided to appoint a managing editor about three weeks ago, and told Mr. Kahn soon after. “It’s one thing to have great ideas about how to change a newsroom and create a modern newsroom, it’s another thing to actually do it,” Mr. Baquet said. “I thought that I really needed a partner in it, if we were really going to pull it off. ” Succession plans at The Times have been a frequent topic of debate for decades, and Mr. Kahn’s promotion will most likely set off a fresh round of guesswork and forecasting. When James Bennet, 50, rejoined The Times this year as editorial page editor, his appointment also spurred speculation inside the newsroom and out that he would eventually succeed Mr. Baquet, who turns 60 next week. “I very much think that Joe should be a candidate to succeed me,” Mr. Baquet said. But he added, “He’s not the only candidate  —   I’m not setting him up in any way more than anybody else. ” Mr. Baquet was managing editor before he was named executive editor in May 2014, replacing Jill Abramson. Executive editors at The Times traditionally serve until they are 65, though some leave earlier. Also looming over The Times is the question of who will take over as publisher when Arthur Sulzberger Jr. steps aside. At the company’s annual meeting in May, Mr. Sulzberger said succession planning had begun and that by next May the company will have named a deputy publisher, a position that traditionally precedes an appointment to publisher. Mr. Baquet said a decision on the deputy publisher would come “soon. ” In the newsroom, Mr. Kahn’s promotion was less of a surprise than Ms. Chira’s decision to leave her role as the main masthead editor overseeing daily news coverage. Ms. Chira said the move was her decision and that this was her next chapter at The Times. “Dean would have loved for me to stay on the masthead, but I decided that this change was an opportunity for me,” Ms. Chira said in an interview. She said she had loved working with Mr. Baquet and the other deputy executive editors, “but as the situation changed, I thought, you know I have been basically on the treadmill of breaking news for 13 years” and she wanted to focus more on gender issues and writing. In her new role, Ms. Chira, who was previously the foreign editor for The Times for eight years and has helped oversee coverage that has won multiple Pulitzer Prizes, will cover gender for both the Opinion section and the newsroom. She will also help the editor of a new unit focused on gender issues that The Times plans to create. Ms. Chira has long been a champion of women in the newsroom. The other two deputy executive editors, Matthew Purdy and Janet Elder, will become deputy managing editors. Mr. Purdy, 60, will continue to oversee investigations and enterprise, while taking on additional responsibilities involving daily news coverage. Ms. Elder, 60, will continue her role running newsroom operations and personnel. In a note to the staff on Friday, Mr. Baquet said Mr. Kahn’s primary responsibility in the next year would be “to lead our efforts to build The Times of the future, and to grapple with questions of what we cover going forward, and what our desks should look like. ” In his new role, Mr. Kahn will be in charge of putting into effect changes proposed by a group that is working to prepare and transform the newsroom for a digital future. Mr. Kahn said in an interview that while he will be more focused on strategy in his role, he will also have a hand in the daily newsroom report. He expects to attend news meetings, he said, and will be involved with big stories. ” I don’t think it’s going to be 80 percent of my time,” Mr. Kahn said about his    coverage responsibilities. “But it’s going to be a lot bigger than zero. ” The Times plans to name Michael Slackman, the international managing editor, as its new international editor on Monday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the company’s plans who spoke on condition of anonymity. The appointment of Mr. Kahn is a reaffirmation of The Times’s commitment to its international expansion, an initiative that Mr. Kahn, a   winner of the Pulitzer Prize, has helped lead and that has been viewed as a pillar of the company’s future growth. In April, The Times said it would invest $50 million over the next three years to expand its international digital audience and increase its revenue outside of the United States. Mr. Kahn joined The Times in 1998 from The Wall Street Journal. He covered Wall Street and international economics and served as The Times’s Beijing bureau chief before returning to New York to work as deputy foreign editor and then international editor. In his note to the newsroom, Mr. Baquet praised Mr. Kahn’s leadership on “the transformation of our international presence,” saying he had helped bring the newsroom together “with our consumer, advertising, technology, product and data teams to help the company think and act globally. ”",1
25878,Want to Find Fulfillment at Last? Think Like a Designer - The New York Times,"STANFORD, CALIF.  —   Take out your flow journals. We’re going to talk about flow moments. You’re going to learn how to find a fulfilling career. You’re going to learn how to better navigate life’s   decisions and kill your “wicked problems” dead. How? By training yourself to think like a designer. That, anyway, is the premise of “Designing Your Life,” a class taught at Stanford University (the school’s “most popular class,” according to Fast Company magazine) as well as the   book that grew out of it, “Designing Your Life: How to Build a   Joyful Life” (Knopf). The two men who created the class and wrote the book are Silicon Valley veterans, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They believe they have hit upon a system to help you deal with almost any challenge. “How do you find the one to love  —   we don’t do that,” Mr. Burnett said. “We also don’t give advice on weight loss. ” But everything else? The two professors claim that you can design an amazing life in the same way that Jonathan Ive designed the iPhone. They say the practices taught in the class and the book can help you (in    ) “reframe” dysfunctional beliefs that surround life and career decisions and help you “wayfind” in a chaotic world through the adoption of such design tenets as    prototyping and  . After nine years of teaching their secrets to future Google product managers and   wunderkinds, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans are opening up the curriculum to everyone. “What do I want to be when I grow up?” and “Am I living a meaningful life?” aren’t only subjects for     dorm hangouts, the men said. “The question of ‘What do I do with the rest of my one wild and wonderful life?’ is on everyone’s mind,” Mr. Evans said. Mr. Burnett recalled a conversation with Stanford’s dean of the engineering department, who was about to retire. “He said: ‘Can I take your class? Because I don’t know what I’m going to be now that I’m not the dean anymore. ’” Mr. Burnett added: “One of the   out there is that you should figure it out by 25, or maybe it’s 27 now. Then there’s the other thing of failure to launch, that millennials are slackers. Part of the permission we give people is: Reframe this. You’re not supposed to have it figured out. ” Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans looked on as the roughly 50 Stanford students in their charge took out and read from their flow journals. Then they broke the class into discussion groups of six or seven. It was early May, and the students were in the final weeks of “Designing Your Life. ” Standing in the front of the room, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans began to make their way through a PowerPoint presentation. “When did you seem the most animated, the most present?” Mr. Burnett said, by way of guiding the discussion groups. Silviana Ilcus, an art history major who had completed more than 230 units at Stanford without having arrived at a firm idea of what she wanted to with her life, addressed the other members of her group. “I don’t have flow when I’m doing art history,” Ms. Ilcus said. “I hate writing. ” The others listened patiently. “My flow was doing math,” she said, seeming to have a   moment in real time. “I’m wondering why it didn’t guide my choice of major. ” Sitting at an outdoor campus food court after class, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans nodded in recognition after hearing of the exchange. “The course surfaces stuff that people haven’t worked through yet, almost universally,” Mr. Evans said. Mr. Burnett said, “It’s a place to have this conversation, because nobody is asking them these questions, and they’re not asking themselves. ” College students are promising empty vessels, as yet unburdened by the   and compromises that keep the rest of us up at night  —   say, hating your corporate job but loving the house it pays for, or wanting to fulfill your dream of backpacking across Europe with two young children in school. To make “Designing Your Life” workable for people in midcareer, the professors had to do their own reframe of the curriculum. The book includes things that are not in the class, like what Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans call “anchor problems”  —   overcommitted life choices that keep people stuck and unhappy. A common mistake that people make, they said, is to assume that there’s only one right solution or optimal version of your life, and that if you choose wrong, you’ve blown it. That’s completely absurd, Mr. Evans said: “There are lots of you. There are lots of right answers. ” As   messengers, the two men are an odd couple. Mr. Burnett, 59, is a   acerbic, existential atheist with an earring, while Mr. Evans, 63, is an outgoing, verbose, practicing Christian with the gray beard of a philosopher. Both are Stanford grads, and while they have accomplished résumés (Mr. Burnett helped to design the original “Star Wars” toys and worked at Apple before becoming executive director of Stanford’s design program Mr. Evans also worked at Apple and   Electronic Arts, the game company) each said his younger self would have been well served by the course. For his part, Mr. Evans struggled as a biology student, a major he chose because he had watched a Jacques Cousteau television special as a boy, and one he clung to because, he said, “I don’t think I had conscious permission to not know what I was doing. ” He switched to mechanical engineering and graduated with a master’s degree in the  ’70s. But when an Apple recruiter called, he initially hung up, because he was bored by computers. In doing so, Mr. Evans said ruefully, he violated several principles of “Designing Your Life,” among them staying open to “latent wonderfulness. ” “If you’re wrong, you go: ‘Oh, computers are boring. O. K. I’m going home now,’” Mr. Evans explained. “ ‘Yes’ is easy. ‘No’ is hard to come back from. ” Mr. Burnett had an easier time on the surface, finding his way to the design program at Stanford and a lifelong vocation. Through a professor mentor, he landed a job as a toy designer and went on to greater success. But, he said: “My method was a blind walk. I didn’t have any strategies. I trusted my intuition, but I worried that I didn’t know what I was doing. ” Before joining forces, they hashed out the concepts they had been developing over a   lunch at a Portola Valley beer garden then known as Zott’s (short for Rissotti’s it is now called the Alpine Inn) using their life experiences as grist for the curriculum. In a place like Stanford, where yearly tuition is about $50, 000, they thought it was worthwhile to send students into the world with practical knowledge about how to find a fulfilling job and excel at it. They began holding workshops for adults a few years ago, including for the employees of Google. The workshop and the book are an effort to take their approach beyond its cloistered campus setting. As Mr. Evans put it, “We’re trying to give this thing away. ” If you can get past the   language and Silicon Valley preciousness, many of the principles of “Designing Your Life” are, in fact, helpful. Design thinking, as rendered in the book, is about treating life in a more improvisational way. It’s a welcome counterbalance to the   engineering   gripping the culture. Follow Mr. Burnett’s and Mr. Evans’s teachings, and the   process of decision making suddenly seems more playful. Their method is experiential and accepts that failure is part of the process. Central to the philosophy is prototyping, a concept borrowed from how product designers work. Let’s say you’re thinking of changing careers. Interview someone who does the job you’re considering. Better yet, ask to shadow them for a day, or work in the field on weekends. If it feels right, take it a step further if it doesn’t, move on. “It’s a classic form of design,” Mr. Burnett said. “You build a lot of stuff, you try a lot of stuff. But it’s always less than the whole product. ” Prototyping big decisions like a career change or a move, meanwhile, guards against blowing up your life to rush headlong into the alluring unknown, or worse, taking no action for years, unhappily. Emma Wood, a    Stanford graduate and a consultant at McKinsey  Company who took “Designing Your Life” as an undergraduate, said the class released the pressure she felt about the life she would face after graduation. “Your whole future and happiness aren’t tied to this one plan working out,” she said. “You can make mistakes. Failure is good. ” The capstone of the Stanford class, and a key part of the book, is an assignment to come up with three “Odyssey Plans” that map out the next five years of your life in radically different ways. The activity is designed to reinforce the sense of multiple viable options, unlock the imagination and eliminate the attractive power of the unknown alternative. Lingtong Sun, who graduated from Stanford last year, said he continues to use the “Odyssey Plan” and other concepts from the class to decide his   career. “On the grand level, I haven’t figured out what I want to do yet,” said Mr. Sun, who works as a software engineer for a tech   in the Bay Area. “But I’m more open to trying something and seeing how it goes. It’s that bias toward action. You can’t think your way into your future. ” Breaking down the system to its basic parts, as a designer would, Mr. Evans said, “There are only two things we offer in the class: ideas and tools. ” He added, “If you think with these ideas rather than the ones you had before, and you use these tools, we believe your chance of building and getting what you want will go up. ”",1
25880,"After Escape From Syria, Another Dangerous Foe: Diabetes - The New York Times","MAFRAQ, Jordan  —   Nisreen   thought the worst was behind her family when it fled to Jordan from   Homs in Syria. Then, two years later, though safe from the shelling and the Syrian civil war, her son Hisham, who was 5, began to rapidly lose weight. When Ms. Najjar and her husband, Haitham   took him to a clinic, a doctor prescribed cold medicine and dismissed him. But a few days later, Hisham got worse and complained of chest pain and aches in his sides. When his parents rushed him to the emergency room, doctors determined that his blood sugar was dangerously elevated. Doctors said Hisham had Type 1 diabetes that had gone untreated for years. He was quickly placed in intensive care, and doctors told his mother that the situation was dire. The next 24 hours will determine whether Hisham lives or dies, she recalled them saying. As she reflected on the harrowing episode in an interview this month, Ms. Najjar began to cry, trying to hide her tears from Hisham. He sat behind her with his two siblings, Yousef, 6, and Mais, 3, who was born in Jordan, in their small, cold apartment here, 40 miles north of Amman, the capital. “I’m sorry,” said Ms. Najjar, 26, wiping her eyes. Hisham, who is shy and has large dark brown eyes, left the room to play with balloons. “It’s just that I almost lost him, not to violence or to war, but to diabetes. ” A few birds singing in their cages brighten the grim space where Hisham’s family lives. But they also remind the family of what it left behind and how the lives of the couple and their children have been upended. About a year after the civil war started in Syria in 2011, the family packed up a few of its belongings, leaving behind almost everything, and left its apartment in Homs for the nearby home of Mr. Abrash’s parents. Ms. Najjar and Mr. Abrash thought they would be gone for 10 days, waiting for the fighting to dissipate. Most of the family’s neighbors in western Syria were also leaving. The temporary departure soon became permanent. After tank fire and shelling erupted one day near the home where the family had sought refuge, it drove to Damascus to get passports, then south to enter Jordan legally at the Jaber border crossing. Back in Homs, the   city in Syria, hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed. Many structures remain skeletons of their former selves, the walls and windows blasted out. The city was once a foothold for rebels fighting the regime of Syria’s president, Bashar   but many fighters started to leave at the end of 2015 under a   deal with the government. The city is now back under the president’s control. Ms. Najjar knows that if Hisham had fallen sick while in Syria, he probably would have died. Power disruptions, common in Syria, essentially shut down hospitals, cutting off electricity to refrigerators storing insulin. And he and his family would have risked their lives just trying to travel to the hospital. They have no plans to return. “Of course I was sad when I realized I wasn’t going to return home after a few months,” Ms. Najjar said. “There is nothing really to return to anymore. ” More than 650, 000 Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan, many of them settling in urban areas. They mostly live in cramped apartments where the rent consumes any humanitarian aid they may receive. The rest of the refugees, about 8 percent, according to some estimates, live in three refugee camps that offer basic services and are free, but also limit freedom of movement. Many of the Syrians arrived in Jordan six years ago, near the start of the civil war. The flood of refugees has put a strain on the country’s limited resources, and public clinics in Jordan no longer provide free health care to Syrians. The protracted crisis is increasing pressure on aid organizations to take on additional roles and provide refugees with more than emergency care, such as treatment for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory ailments and diabetes. Nearly a year ago, Amnesty International  warned that Syrian refugees in Jordan were unable to get access to health care and other vital services, citing “the combination of grossly inadequate support from the international community and barriers imposed by the government of Jordan. ” The report also found that even if Syrian refugees could get access to health care, many could not afford it without forgoing basic needs. The United Nations refugee agency provides Hisham’s family with $137 a month in cash assistance the money goes directly toward the $193 rent and the electricity bill, which is $28. In addition, the family receives $70 in food coupons. The International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provides Hisham with free regular checkups and insulin, worth nearly $30 a month. The organization also paid for a glucose meter, but lacks the funding to pay for glucose test strips. The family must pay for them  —   $27 a month. Ms. Najjar takes her son to a diabetes clinic every three months in the northern town of Irbid, about 30 miles from here. Each checkup, including the cost of travel, is $35. Across northern Jordan, the International Rescue Committee provides nearly 9, 000 refugees and vulnerable locals with free primary health care. The group uses mobile health clinics, each with two doctors, two nurses, a midwife, a counselor and a mobile pharmacy. Patients with diabetes require more frequent care, and wait times for consultations at the group’s clinics are increasing. When the family first arrived, some Jordanians and informal charities helped it cover the rent. But with no immediate prospects of returning to Syria and Jordanian poverty levels rising, it is becoming harder for this family of five to pay the bills. When Mr. Abrash, 37, first arrived in Jordan in 2012, he spent five months searching for work. The unemployment rate among Jordanians exceeds 14 percent, and is almost double that among youth. Syrians, until recently, were not allowed to work. In Syria, Mr. Abrash was a tailor, mainly sewing women’s jeans. Five months after he arrived in Jordan, he began working as a tailor, sewing pillows and mattresses for customers who were referred to him. More recently, he also began selling birds. A bulging disk in his neck is preventing him from working full time at garment factories. After Hisham was found to have Type 1 diabetes, his mother attended awareness sessions about the disease and started to change the way the family eats. Today, it mainly eats vegetables and rice. In the morning before school, Hisham eats wheat bread with eggplant and has a cup of tea. He walks to school with his friends. His mother makes sure he takes an insulin shot before he leaves in the morning, after lunch and before he sleeps at night. “The insulin shots let me lead a normal life, like my friends,” Hisham, 7, said as he watched cartoons. “Sometimes I cheat and I eat something I’m not supposed to at school, but my mom makes sure I eat well at home. ” His mother also checks his blood glucose levels regularly. Hisham does not remember his home in Syria. All his memories are in Jordan. “Nothing,” he said. “I don’t remember anything. ” His home here has two small plastic toy cars and a few plush animals donated by a charity nearby. “When I’m not at school, I mostly jump on the sofas, play soccer with the inflatable balls we have,” he said, as his younger sister followed him around from one room to another.",1

Paul revealed he has been in constant contact with President Donald Trump about the issue, including a phone call Thursday night, and said the president is “very open to negotiation. ”[Kassam asked if House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) was correct to argue that repealing Obamacare without an immediate comprehensive replacement plan is impossible, and the plan his caucus has put on the table is the closest to repeal they can get.  “I’ve always been for repeal and replace at the same time, but not necessarily in the same bill,” Senator Paul replied. “The reason why I think you need ‘replace’ is we need to offer hope, and we need to offer an insurance product that is inexpensive, and something that will fix the marketplace so everybody can get access to health insurance. ” “The problem with putting replace and repeal in one bill is that we all tend to agree on the repeal aspect, Republicans, but we tend to disagree on the replacement aspect,” he said. “My idea of replacement is trying to let the marketplace work, encouraging people to join   and healthcare associations so they can drive prices down, and   the sale of all kinds of insurance. ” “Some of those things we actually agree with Paul Ryan on. The problem is Paul Ryan has a lot of Obamacare Lite stuff that he wants to keep in there,” Paul said. “He wants to keep the Obamacare subsidies. He calls them tax credits, refundable tax credits. He wants to keep the Obamacare taxes, all of the taxes, for a year  —   and then he wants to keep the Cadillac tax, the tax on good insurance, forever. ” “He also has an individual mandate in there, which is curious, because if you’ve listened to the debate for the last six, seven years, one of the things Republicans have hated the worst is the individual mandate,” Paul added. “He keeps the individual mandate. You just don’t pay the government you have to pay the insurance company. I think if you talk to customers and patients across the country and talk to doctors, there’s not a great deal of difference in dislike between the government and the insurance companies. You’re not going to make a lot of us happy if we have to pay the insurance company a penalty instead of the government. ”  “But there’s also insurance company bailouts in there. This gets to the fundamental heart of the problem. The problem with Obamacare is they tell people, ‘You know what? You can wait to buy insurance until after you’re sick.’ When they do that, nobody buys insurance until they’re sick, and the price of the insurance goes up. Ryancare doesn’t fix that. If you do not fix that, the premiums will continue to skyrocket, but we’re going to be blamed for it,” the senator warned his fellow Republicans.  “After repeal is voted on, and even if it’s an incomplete repeal or Obamacare Lite, Republicans will own this. So we’ve got to get it right before we do this. We have to understand fundamentally that if you wait to let people buy insurance until after they’re sick, they will,” he said. “The interesting thing about the individual mandate in the Ryan plan is that let’s say you do lose your job, or let’s say you can’t buy insurance for a while. Now you know that when you buy it again, you have a 30 percent penalty. You don’t get the penalty until you buy it. So why would you buy it? You’re going to wait to buy it until you get sick. So once again, as the adverse selection gets worse, the death spiral of Obamacare continues after Ryancare,” Paul argued. Kassam noted that the White House is making a push for the House bill on Paul’s home turf in Kentucky and asked if the situation had devolved into “  war” between Senator Paul and the executive branch. “Actually, I think the president is very open to negotiation,” Paul replied. “I talked to him again last night by phone. I’ve talked to him twice a week, which is quite a bit for anybody to talk to the president that’s not in the administration. ” “I talked to him again last night. He said he’s open to negotiation, but I reiterated to him that Paul Ryan went on TV for 45 minutes yesterday with a press conference, and he said, ‘The response to this, the choices are binary.’ Well, binary means there are two choices: either we take it or leave it. Either we take Obamacare Lite or we get nothing. That isn’t sitting well with conservatives, and I promise you, the more we hear Paul Ryan say, ‘Take it or leave it,’ the less we’re willing to take it,” he said. “Also, we are concerned that if we vote for Obamacare Lite, and insurance premiums still continue to go through the roof, and a year from now, insurance companies are going bankrupt the same way they’re going bankrupt now, people will say, ‘What did you guys do? You had six years to figure this out, and you couldn’t get it right,’” Paul said. When Kassam asked if opponents of the Ryan bill had the votes to keep it from passing, Paul replied, “The proof’s in the pudding. ” “There are 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus. They will make their decision. So far, their leadership and their voting has been that they’re for clean repeal. I believe they voted 80 percent to take a position of clean repeal. And that’s my position: separate repeal from replace,” he said.  “You do replace. I do replace it on the same day. We’re not completely unable to vote on more than one thing in a day,” he pointed out.  “We should put the repeal forward that we voted on a year ago, and that passed unanimously. Put it on, and the same day, let’s put up replacement,” Paul recommended. “Now, what House leadership will tell you is, you probably won’t get to 60 votes. I can’t guarantee 60 votes. All I can guarantee is what we’re for. We should put it forward, and if Democrats block replacement, they still own the whole thing. ” Paul agreed with Kassam that many Republicans do not seem to understand they hold the high ground on Obamacare repeal and could make Democrats pay a political price for interfering with vitally needed measures to deal with the failing program. “I don’t think they understand that yet. I’m still trying to get that through to them,” said Paul. “I am for replacement. I do want to pass replacement  —   but if they don’t, instead of Republicans fighting with each other, why don’t we make sure that the Democrats still are responsible? If they choose to block replacement, they’re still responsible. ” “I think we could pass replacement, though. I think there actually are some Democrats who will come around,” he predicted. “Some of these ideas are really reasonable. For example, what if we put up the individual idea that every patient in America should be allowed to join a healthcare association? We expand healthcare associations in one vote. That’s a tough vote for Democrats to say they’re against the consumer to join a buying group to get a lower price and to get guaranteed issue. ” “This is the other thing nobody understands,” he elaborated. “They think you have to mandate guaranteed issue  —   you know, that you can buy insurance after you’re sick by law. The other way you do it is you let people get group insurance. You join a   you join the health buying group, and when you buy it, you have group insurance. Group insurance is protected, and if you get group insurance, you will not be let go. Your prices will not go up. ”  Paul predicted such a reform would “completely transform” the    company relationship. “Let’s say you’re part of a   buying group. Now you have enormous leverage, so instead of us kissing the boots of the insurance executives, it’ll be the opposite. The insurance executives will be begging to talk to our person, whoever’s in charge of this,” he said. “And I promise you, whether you make $30, 000 or you make $100, 000 in our country, people don’t like the way they’re being treated by the health insurance companies. ” He said that under Ryancare, insurance companies would “continue to lose money, but Ryan’s going to give them a backstop, a bailout. ”  “The chronic insurance company bailout that was in Obamacare is still in this new Obamacare Lite bill,” Paul said. He also expressed strong support for tort reform as part of a plan to bring medical costs down. “I’m a physician,” he reminded the audience. “We’ve got to try to stop the frivolous lawsuits, not only for the expense of them, but everybody orders about a million too many test, because they’re afraid of being sued. We need to fix that. ”  “Unfortunately  —   or fortunately, depending on how you look at it  —   that probably has to be done at the state capitols, because people get sued at the state courts, and the state courts are under the purview of state law,” he added. “Some states have fixed this, frankly, or made it a lot better. They have review panels. They have caps on damages. I don’t know if any have   but I like the   aspect also. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

25882,"China Lending Inflates Real Estate, Stocks, Even Egg Futures - The New York Times","HONG KONG  —   China is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into its economy in a new effort to support growth. Some of it is going into roads and bridges and other big projects that will keep the economy humming. And some of it is going into eggs. China’s latest lending deluge has sent money sloshing into unexpected parts of the economy. That includes a financial market in Dalian where investors can place bets on the future productivity of the country’s hens. Egg futures have surged by as much as   since March, the sort of move that would be justified if investors believed China’s chicken flocks were headed for an unfortunate fate. But the market’s usual participants say the flocks are fine. In fact, the actual price of eggs in the country’s markets has fallen from a year ago, according to government statistics. The reason for the unusual jump in egg futures, they say, is China’s tendency to experience investment bubbles when the government steps up spending and lending. China’s previous efforts to bolster growth unexpectedly sent money into real estate and the stock market  —   markets that had unexplained rises followed by striking drops. “Many commodities prices have gone up crazily,” said Du Shaoxing, a futures trader in Guangzhou, in southern China. “We surely hope for a more stabilized trend where futures can reflect economic fundamentals. The way in which recent commodity prices went up is worrisome. ” China’s latest bubble illustrates the potential risks of its newest effort to spur growth. The Chinese economy is already burdened with too much debt, economists say. And sometimes, stopgap measures to help the economy create   problems. China is the world’s biggest producer of eggs, but it is not clear whether the investment surge in eggs will have an impact on   prices. Jumps in the futures prices on commodities markets can take months to trickle down to the real world, and if the commodities surge subsides, then the price of eggs in local markets may not budge. Eggs are not the only commodity suddenly out of kilter. Domestic prices and trading volumes on steel, garlic, cotton, iron ore and other items have all soared. This despite the fact that China’s economic slowdown has hurt demand for many items. Officials at Chinese commodities markets are now taking steps to cool speculative fervor to avoid crashes, and prices have begun to ease. By   the frenzy made Shanghai futures contracts in steel rebar, the rods used in construction to reinforce concrete, the most actively traded in the world  —   overtaking trading volumes of two major oil futures contracts, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, that have helped set oil prices for decades, analysts at Citigroup said in a report last week. “There is very little rational or fundamental basis for why prices have gotten as out of hand as they have, or why volumes are so high, other than just irrational exuberance,” said Alex Wolf, an emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, who previously worked as an American diplomat based in Beijing and Taipei. Economists blame Beijing’s new efforts to shore up its economy. Government officials increased lending by   banks and offered other support measures in the first few months of the year as economic growth slowed and longtime drivers like manufacturing and exports showed continued weakness. Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, one of the world’s biggest traders of metals and oil, calculates that China added about $1 trillion in new liquidity in the first quarter of the year  —   an amount that would be roughly equal to the entire quarterly economic output of Germany during the same period. “This kind of scale is unprecedented and some of it will leak into speculative investments,” Mr. Rahim said. In the short term, the new lending may be good news for global growth, if it works. China’s   growth came in at 6. 7 percent, about where economists had expected, despite some indications that growth had weakened further. But in turning to its old playbook, China risks adding to its already   pile of debt, which by some estimates is nearly 300 percent of gross domestic product. The problems are most acute when it comes to China’s corporate borrowers, which have gorged on cheap credit in the years since the global financial crisis. In a report released in April, the International Monetary Fund found that nearly 600 companies had almost $400 billion of debt that was considered at risk, accounting for 14 percent of total corporate borrowing in China. But the renewed push for   growth shows that policy makers’ concerns about China’s debt burden appear to have been set aside for now. By delaying efforts to wean itself off cheap credit, China may be setting itself up for some problems related to debt and industrial overcapacity. There are few places for China’s money to go. The country has tightened already stringent limits on how much money its people can send or invest abroad. Its stock market is still recovering from a crash last year. And its property market remains saddled with a glut of apartments in many cities. A property market bubble arose from the huge stimulus that Beijing deployed after the 2008 financial crisis, which set off a building boom. Stocks overtook property in investor interest last year. A raging bull market that was cheered on by official news outlets like People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s newspaper, skidded to a halt in June. As for eggs, Chen Jie, who works in the futures department at Hubei Shendan Healthy Food, the biggest egg company in China, said in a phone interview that “there is definitely speculative capital in the market. ” Her company supplies eggs to KFC and McDonald’s restaurants, and sells them at more than 10, 000 supermarkets across China, including those of chains like Walmart, Carrefour and Metro. Hubei Shendan uses the futures market to hedge its bets against swings in actual egg prices. An abnormally volatile futures market makes that job more difficult. “The reason we are in the egg futures market is because the big swings in egg prices will affect our profitability, and a good futures market will help us in that regard,” Ms. Chen said.",1
25883,What You Should Watch: ‘Mustang’ and Good Background Shows - The New York Times,"Welcome to Watching, The New York Times’s    guide. We comb through releases big and small to email readers twice a week with our timely recommendations. You can browse previous guides here, and to receive recommendations straight to your inbox, sign up here. Stay tuned for our upcoming website. Emmy nominations came out yesterday. You can read our full report here as well as our look at the surprises and snubs. I’ll offer my usual caveats that awards don’t measure anything other than an ability to win awards. But still  —   that’s a fun ability to measure at least sometimes, isn’t it? This weekend, I’ll be waiting for everyone to binge all of Netflix’s supernatural drama “Stranger Things” so I can talk about it excitedly. As always, if you’d like to share your thoughts with me and Team Watching, we’re at watching@nytimes. com. Stay cool out there. “Vice Principals,” Sunday, 10:30, HBO Watch if you miss “Eastbound  Down,” or like creative cursing and shows with a dark streak. If you like Danny McBride’s signature       characters, “Vice Principals” is your jam. The show stars McBride and Walton Goggins (from “Justified” and “The Shield”) as rival vice principals who are deeply aggrieved when neither is promoted to principal. The show can be   silly, but there’s a through line of genuine meanness that’s not for everyone. “Black Mirror” (Netflix) Watch if you like the scariest episodes of “The Twilight Zone. ” Warning: This is not a show you should binge. But if   global affairs have you feeling not great, and all the Pokémon Go madness has you feeling a tiny bit conflicted about the role of technology in our society, go ahead and drive into that skid with the anthology series “Black Mirror. ” Every episode (there are only seven so far) is a   story, so there’s no need to watch them in order, and each episode has something intriguing to offer, so you can’t go too wrong. Season 1’s “National Anthem,” is the most overtly critical of power (it’s about the British prime minister being put in an impossibly vile position) Season 2’s “White Bear” is the most outright disturbing and “The Waldo Moment” is the most pessimistic about the populace at large. One of those should suffice. “RuPaul’s Drag Race” (Hulu) Watch if you like reality contest shows. The eighth and most recent season of the show that’s “Project Runway” for drag queens is now streaming on Hulu. If you’ve never watched the show, I encourage you to check out at least one season before jumping in here, since there’s a lot of history baked into the show. (Season 4, also streaming, is a good place to start.) “Drag Race” outshines other similarly constructed shows with its   confessionals: Grandiose insults are part of drag culture, so contestants have far better quips than the people on, oh, “America’s Next Top Model” or “Top Chef. ” Are you looking for your next great TV love? (Or your next great show divorce?) Watching is here to help. Send in a question to watching@nytimes. com. I have lots of    chores and would like some TV options to keep me company during my attempts to be productive. Preferably something that doesn’t require tons of attention (or wouldn’t be horribly ruined if I miss a little bit of dialogue here and there) but is fun enough to help the time move by quickly. Any advice?  —   Katherine Dear Katherine, I feel you. If I’m home, I’m always watching (or at least listening to) something. Saying these are good    shows is not at all meant as a knock, and of course you would get more out of them with devoted viewing. But perhaps not a ton more. These are organized from least to most   you could do your taxes while watching the shows at the top of this list, but I’d save the ones farther down for   chores. • “My Cat From Hell” (some episodes available on OnDemand) has pretty much the same plot every time: There is a cat (often multiple cats) they complain, scratch and relieve themselves at inopportune times their owners are despondent  —   but usually weirdly complicit in this behavior hero cat whisperer Jackson Galaxy saves the day. It’s also fine for all ages, as long as your kids aren’t freaked out by how weird human beings are. • “The Profit” (Hulu) follows entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis as he goes around to failing small businesses. Much like “Tabatha’s Salon Takeover,” it’s secretly a show about how much debt many people are in, though this has more of a   spirit. I love it, but it’s the kind of show I watch with a lot of   because every important moment gets played at least twice this is a good one to watch if you’ll be in and out of the room. • “America’s Test Kitchen” (Netflix America’s Test Kitchen’s website) is the most educational food show on TV, but unlike the screaming carnival atmosphere of Food Network shows, this is more of a calm PBS oasis. Where to start? It doesn’t matter! Every episode is equally good. • “Drop Dead Diva” (Netflix) has some of the   courtroom scenes and legal strategies any lawyer show has ever had. Its plot, in which a model is reincarnated as a   lawyer, is somehow more believable. It’s an easy, charming, gentle show  —   nothing major, but more endearing than you’d expect. • “Elementary” (Hulu) is one in a line of many iterations of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but this is the one that has Lucy Liu. • “Sleepy Hollow” (Hulu) is just at the cusp of being too engrossing for this kind of task, so save it for something mindless like  . Time travel, American history, ghosts, monsters, but ultimately yes, another   cop show. Season 1 is fantastically fun, but things get way  —   and then way  —   worse after that. But 13 episodes of snappy,    horror fun is better than nothing. ’’ • “East Los High,” complete fourth season, Hulu • “Power” Season 3 premiere, Sunday, 9 p. m. Starz • “Ballers,” Season 2 premiere, Sunday, 10 p. m. HBO Looking for a foreign language drama about the perils of growing up? In the Oscar nominated 2015 Turkish film, “Mustang,” five young orphans earn the scorn of their guardians when they’re caught playing with their male classmates on the beach. With their freedoms restricted, the girls make use of what’s left of their childhood before forced arranged marriages. Although this is a stormy    story, the sisters’ relationships with one another remain strong, and they find a few empathetic women in their family who understand their struggle against a conservative father figure. Director Deniz Gamze Ergüven captures the quiet beauty in the sisters’ playtime, in their routines and in the world around them, even though it is shrinking. With a bittersweet running time of only 97 minutes, it’s just enough subtitled teen angst. (Available on Netflix)  —   Monica Castillo",1
25894,"Almost 100, ‘Forgotten Legend of Basketball’ Still Marvels at the Game - The New York Times","MINNEAPOLIS  —   John Kundla sat in a wheelchair playing cribbage opposite his    son, calling out numbers in a quiet, deep voice. The efficiency apartment here had a twin bed under a painting of Jesus tending sheep a desk topped with a large magnifying glass and a Bible and, resting on a shelf, a photograph taken on a basketball court in 1952 showing Kundla atop the shoulders of a jubilant George Mikan, the sport’s most dominant big man in the first half of the 20th century. Kundla, 99, was the head coach of the Minneapolis Lakers’ championship teams of the 1940s and 1950s  —   professional basketball’s first modern dynasty. He is the oldest living Hall of Famer in any of the four major American team sports and one of three N. B. A. coaches, along with Red Auerbach and Phil Jackson, to have won three or more consecutive titles. Kundla is “a forgotten legend of basketball,” according to the historian John Christgau, author of the book “The Origins of the Jump Shot. ” Kundla’s Lakers ruled the league in the years before the shot clock, when players were still shooting free throws underhand. Kundla coached in the N. B. A. ’s first four   Games, and his five league titles are tied for third with Pat Riley and Gregg Popovich. He is also the only coach in league history to win a title in his first two N. B. A. seasons (the first when it was called the Basketball Association of America)  —   a feat that Steve Kerr will match if the Golden State Warriors win this season’s championship. Yet even at the peak of his team’s success, Kundla was so   during games and overshadowed by his talented players that The Sporting News once said, “Few ever heard of John Kundla. ” After coaching, Kundla taught physical education today, he lives about five blocks east of the Mississippi River, in an assisted living home where he plays bingo several days a week, and where, sometimes, he positions his wheelchair a few inches from a small analog television and watches basketball, marveling at the size and speed of modern players. Kundla dresses and cooks by himself, and he exercises daily on a stationary bicycle. His hearing and eyesight have waned, though, and recollections of certain events and facts  —   like the circumstances surrounding his Lakers hiring and how many championships he won  —   have grown hazy with time. Identifying dates and years can give him trouble. But many memories remain vivid and accurate: details about his youth the story of how he met his wife the names and tendencies of players he coached. He still visualizes and recounts plays that he designed around Mikan. He tells of how playing in New York made him a “nervous wreck” of how after winning one title there, he and his players celebrated at the Copacabana nightclub of the joy he felt in that moment, after capturing another championship, when Mikan lifted him onto his shoulders. And it was early one recent evening, in front of a shelf stuffed with worn books on his Minneapolis Lakers and on basketball history, that Kundla spoke about his life, and the game that has defined it. Born in Star Junction, Pa. Kundla moved to Minneapolis at age 5 with his mother, an   immigrant. Neither spoke English. But Kundla learned the language  —   and basketball  —   and went on to star in high school and at the University of Minnesota. In 1937, The New York Times heralded the    Kundla as one “of the finest players in the Midwest. ” In the early 1940s, he coached at Ascension, a Catholic grade school, and then at DeLaSalle, a high school on an island in the Mississippi River. After serving in the Navy during World War II  —   he played pickup basketball games on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean, he said  —   he coached at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul. In 1947, two Minnesota businessmen bought the Detroit Gems, a team in the National Basketball League that had disbanded after a   season. The new club was called the Lakers, and Kundla, at 31, became its coach. The franchise signed Jim Pollard, a swift and     forward, and Mikan, the   center who wore thick glasses and had an unstoppable hook shot with each hand. Kundla developed set plays, including a   game involving his two superstars, and preached wise shot selection. “Don’t shoot too quick,” he urged his players. “Nobody in for a rebound. ” He emphasized fundamentals, like sprinting back on defense after missed shots and communicating passionately while defending screens. The Lakers were   and won the 1948 N. B. L. championship. The next season, they joined the B. A. A. (which the N. B. A. considers its predecessor) defeating the Washington Capitols, coached by Auerbach, in the finals. The Lakers played most of their home games at Minneapolis Auditorium, which had steep seats and a theatrical stage behind one basket. Christgau, 82, who attended Lakers games there growing up, recalls peering through the arena’s cigar smoke during timeouts to see an “always calm and cool” Kundla, with “players all clumped around him, like a hog pile, all listening and paying attention. ” Road trips often meant long journeys by train, during which Kundla and his players bonded over card games. “It was like a family playing for John,” said Arnie Ferrin, 90, who played for the Lakers from 1948 to 1951. Before the   season, the B. A. A. and the N. B. L. merged to form the N. B. A. The Lakers acquired the rookies Vern Mikkelsen, a rugged and savvy big man, and Slater Martin, a short,   Texan known for gritty defense. They were   and beat the Syracuse Nationals in the championship. Guard Pep Saul, whom the Lakers purchased in 1952, was struck by how quiet Kundla was compared with other coaches. If a player made a mistake, “he didn’t holler at you,” Saul, 92, said. “He would talk to you like a man and say, ‘Here’s what you have to do to correct it.’ He was a teacher as well as a coach. ” The Lakers kept winning, even after the league doubled the lane’s width in 1951 to slow down Mikan, who had led the N. B. A. with more than 27 points per game for three straight seasons. They beat the Knicks in the 1952 and 1953 championships, and in 1954, they won their third straight title and fifth in six years. By late 1956, Mikan and Pollard had retired. The game had evolved: Scoring was up  —   the shot clock had been instituted in 1954  —   and the racial makeup of the league was changing. The Lakers’ title teams had been all white in the   season, the team had three black players. The Lakers were   that season. Behind the rookie Elgin Baylor, they advanced to the championship before falling to the Boston Celtics, led by Bob Cousy and Bill Russell. Kundla resigned at age 42 with a   record. (In 1960, the Lakers moved to Los Angeles, becoming the league’s first West Coast team.) Kundla, meanwhile, took over as head coach at the University of Minnesota. During his tenure, the basketball program included black players for the first time, and he became its first coach to give scholarships to   players. (Hate mail arrived regularly at his house, he said.) Led by the future N. B. A.   Lou Hudson and Archie Clark, the Gophers were   in   and   in  . In 1968, Kundla retired, finishing his career there with a   record. He accepted a position teaching physical education on the university’s St. Paul campus, including courses in basketball and tennis. He and his wife, Marie, who had met as undergraduates, had raised six children in a white,   suburban house with a wooden hoop nailed to the garage. The couple went ice skating together every Tuesday and took their children on fishing trips. In 1981, Kundla retired from teaching. Throughout the years, he had remained close with Mikan and Mikkelsen often, the three would meet for breakfast, and reminisce. In a 1992 column for USA Today, Peter Vecsey, lamenting Kundla’s exclusion from the Hall of Fame, labeled him “all but forgotten. ” From Kundla’s   window, one can see beyond the river, to downtown Minneapolis, where the Lakers’ arena once stood. He moved into this assisted living community in 2008, the year after Marie died, after 67 years of marriage. Kundla’s son James, a retired railroad track worker, walks over every morning from his nearby home and keeps him company. Once a month, Kundla rides by bus with fellow residents to a church downtown for bingo and lunch organized by the League of Catholic Women. He also plays bingo downstairs and at an adjoining nursing home, where he sits beside residents in need and helps them with their cards. Kundla keeps his own winnings, green notes called Bingo Bucks, in a billfold in the cupboard under his TV, which he redeems every Friday for Hershey bars. At night, Kundla, who has short silver hair and wears hearing aids, watches TV programs like “Dancing With the Stars” and reruns of “The Lawrence Welk Show. ” Earlier this year, James said, the cable company offered a free promotion allowing Kundla to watch N. B. A. games daily. But when the deal expired, the additional cost was “not in the budget,” James said. Kundla listens to Minnesota Timberwolves games on the radio, and when he watches a game on TV, he looks for those “little things,” he said  —   like distinguishing between a good and bad shot  —   that consumed him as a Lakers coach. Basketball has changed for the better, he said. Defensive intensity has improved (“Jeez, they get after you!” he said) and when a team hustles back on defense after a missed shot, he is delighted. The   shot excites him. “That’s the big difference,” he said. “You get behind  —   you can catch up, you know?” Referring to today’s players, Kundla said: “It’s unbelievable how big they’ve grown. But there’s still finesse in there  —   the way they handle that ball, pass it around. ” For Kundla, who turns 100 on July 3 (“Another day and I would have been born with a bang,” he likes to say) proper recognition came relatively late in life: He was inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame at age 78, in 1995. The next year, for the “N. B. A. at 50” celebration, he was voted one of the top 10 coaches in league history. In 2002, during a ceremony at Staples Center in Los Angeles, Kundla and living Minneapolis Lakers players were awarded championship rings, and two banners commemorating their dynasty were raised. Since then, four of the five Hall of Famers who played on Kundla’s title teams have died: Mikan, Mikkelsen, Martin and Clyde Lovellette. (Pollard died in 1993.) Bob Harrison, 88, who hit a long   for the Lakers to win Game 1 of the inaugural postmerger N. B. A. championship in 1950, was emotional when reached at his home in Palm City, Fla. and asked about Kundla. In 1954, Harrison said, upon being traded to the Milwaukee Hawks, Kundla sat him down and apologized. “He made me feel important,” Harrison said. “A lot of coaches are more interested in building their reputation, and John wasn’t like that. Naturally, he wanted to win, and he did. But he did it with kindness and love. ” One evening in May, Kundla sat glued to a TV in the dimly lit lounge down the hall from his apartment, watching Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. “Look at the tattoos on the shoulders  —   jeez,” Kundla said, as the Cavaliers’ J. R. Smith shot free throws in the first quarter. The second quarter was a noisy blur of fast breaks,   and acrobatic layups by the host Cavaliers. Kundla looked riveted, gradually inching his wheelchair closer to the screen. On one play, Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving blew past a defender on a fancy    dribble and converted a layup. “Jeez,” Kundla muttered, “poor defense there by Toronto. ” With the Cavaliers ahead by 15, Kundla watched as LeBron James drove the baseline, cupped the ball in his right hand and dunked ferociously, screaming in celebration as he backpedaled. “Oh, my God, another one,” Kundla said. At halftime, Kundla returned to his room. A nurse arrived to check in and then left, and Kundla was alone. On a desk next to his bed was a picture of Kundla and Marie on their wedding day, and a photo of a smiling Mikkelsen in his later years, signed: “To John, my leader and good friend. ” Kundla settled into bed. It was dark now, but from the wall by his pillow came a radiant orange glow: from a tiny night light, in the design of a basketball.",1
25896,How the West Provoked the New Cold War,"How the West Provoked the New Cold War October 31, 2016 
The mainstream U.S. media portrays the New Cold War as “white-hatted” Americans standing up to “black-hatted” Russians to stop aggression against NATO and to save children in Syria, but the reality is much more gray, says ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern. 
By Ray McGovern 
How did the “growing trust” that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his “working and personal relationship with President Obama ” change into today’s deep distrust and saber-rattling? 
Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. President Barack Obama addresses the United Nations General Assembly’s seventy-first session on Sept. 20, 2016 (UN Photo) 
But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented: “My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.” He complained about “people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.” 
A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, “My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry’s] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.” 
Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire — not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals — were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. 
A New Nadir 
Relations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses UN General Assembly on Sept. 28, 2015. (UN Photo) 
On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft — including any stealth aircraft — over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. 
It seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course — perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, “I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft … if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.” 
Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia’s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft. 
Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing “a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team” as a “major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.” 
“This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,” he explained, referring to NATO’s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. “The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.” 
On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the “myth” of a “Russian military threat,” calling this a “profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets … expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.” 
Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia’s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against “saber-rattling,” adding that, “We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.” 
Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two-and-a-half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d’état in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia’s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by “mainstream” media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which “Yats” (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington’s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. 
This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, “really the most blatant coup in history.” 
It’s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now? 
Ray McGovern (rrmcgovern@gmail.com) was an Army officer and then a CIA analyst for 27 years, during which he was chief of the Soviet Foreign Policy Branch and later a presidential briefer during President Reagan’s first term.

25897,"N.F.L.: Cowboys Like Their New QB, Patriots Love Their Old One - The New York Times","■ On the Tom Brady Revenge Tour there will be no such thing as “enough” offense. The Patriots quarterback, fresh off of a   suspension, threw for 406 yards and three touchdowns in a blowout win over the Browns but spent his postgame interview talking about how rusty he felt. ■ You never know what you’ll get with rookie quarterbacks. Some make the transition to the N. F. L. look easy (Dak Prescott of the Cowboys) some make mistakes that cost their team badly (Carson Wentz of the Eagles trying to air it out with a   yard heave that was intercepted by Detroit). Some can’t do enough to carry their defense (Paxton Lynch of the Broncos) and some can’t finish the game (Cody Kessler of the Browns, who left his team’s loss to the Patriots with a rib injury). ■ Guessing the last team to remain unbeaten can be tricky, and very few predicted the Vikings would open the season   playing without the team’s two most famous names (Peterson and Bridgewater). But with a defense that is almost impossible to pass against, Minnesota goes into the bye week with a legitimate claim as the hottest   best team in the N. F. L. ■ Whatever coach Rex Ryan said to his team after a Week 2 loss must have been impressive, because the Bills have won three straight games behind tremendous defense and a great running game. Ryan could not help gloating a bit, saying sarcastically “You guys know me, I’m just an average coach. I never win three straight games. ” Perhaps the most impressive part of the streak is that two of the three wins have been on the road. On the 321st snap of Dak Prescott’s rookie season, the young quarterback finally committed his first turnover. Luckily for the Dallas Cowboys, the team was off to a   start at the time of the fumble in what proved to be a   over the Cincinnati Bengals. Committing a breach of ball security was the exception that proves the rule for Prescott, who was drafted in the fourth round and has thus far done an incredible job filling in for the injured Tony Romo, showing a veteran’s ability to take chances while rarely taking unnecessary risks during the team’s   start to the season. Between his efficiency, and the   running game led by his fellow rookie, Ezekiel Elliott, there is little reason for Cowboys fans to hope Dez Bryant and Romo can come back soon, as the team is in good hands. The easy win proved to be a relatively modest day for Prescott, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 227 yards and 1 touchdown. Along the way he did manage to increase his rookie record for consecutive passes without an interception to 155. A big passing day by Prescott was not necessary as Elliott continued his assault on opposing defenses, taking advantage of the huge holes afforded him by the Cowboys’ dominant offensive line, rushing for 134 yards on 15 attempts, including a   touchdown run in which he was not touched. For good measure he even recovered an onside kick late in the fourth quarter to help preserve the win. Prescott, Elliott and the rest of the Cowboys will have a tough test next week on the road against the Green Bay Packers and then will have a bye week before a Week 8 matchup against Philadelphia that has been cited as potential return date for Romo. If Prescott can beat the Packers at Lambeau Field, there may be talk of a quarterback controversy. If today’s game is any indication, the Tom Brady Revenge Tour around the N. F. L. is going to be ugly for the opponents of the New England Patriots. Brady, having returned from a   suspension, was at his best against a terrible Cleveland Browns defense, completing 28 of 40 passes for 406 yards and three touchdowns. His 271 passing yards in the first half broke the franchise’s previous record of 264, and the Patriots won easily,  . At his postgame news conference, Brady seemed uninterested in discussing his suspension, saying it was not a time to reflect on things and that he had simply focused on being ready for the game. “It felt very much like a normal week for me once I got into it,” Brady said. “It was fun to come out and play and fun to win. ” Brady showed very little or no rust from the long layoff. He completed passes to seven different receivers, with all three of his touchdown passes going to   acquisition Martellus Bennett, who appears   to being the   of New England’s two tight end offense alongside Rob Gronkowski. He opened the third quarter scoring with an incredible      where he streaked down the sideline with the ball and jumped over a defender into the end zone. In a diverse attack, Chris Hogan led New England with 114 receiving yards on just 4 catches, Rob Gronkowski looked revitalized with 5 catches for 109 yards, and Bennett finished the day with 6 catches for 63 yards. The Denver Broncos finally found a quarterback they could not win with. Paxton Lynch, a rookie pressed into service because of an injury to Trevor Siemian, struggled to get anything going on offense as the Broncos’ vaunted defense faltered in a   loss to the Atlanta Falcons. Denver’s defense did an excellent job limiting Julio Jones, the Falcons’ star wide receiver, who had just 2 catches for 29 yards a week after he torched Carolina for 300 yards. But running back Tevin Coleman had a   touchdown reception as part of a     day and the Falcons, not known for defense, were able to keep Denver from getting back into the game after a slow start. Siemian, who has a strained AC joint in his   shoulder, is expected to be back on Thursday night against the Chargers. He may not have quite the pedigree of Lynch, was drafted in the first round this year, but he is clearly farther along in his development. Darius Slay almost   ended the unbeaten start to Carson Wentz’s career. With a forced fumble and an interception in the fourth quarter  —   the first interception of Wentz’s career  —   Slay helped the Detroit Lions reverse a   collapse and beat the Philadelphia Eagles,  . The first half had been all Detroit, with Matthew Stafford throwing three touchdown passes on the way to a   start to the game. But in the second half, Philadelphia’s defense tightened up and Wentz, the No. 2 pick in this year’s draft, steadily got his team back into the game. But that is when Slay took over. With his team trailing   in the fourth quarter, the    cornerback jarred the ball free from Ryan Mathews on a rushing attempt. The Lions recovered the ball and drove 34 yards for a     field goal, with 27 of the yards coming on a big reception by Golden Tate, the team’s embattled wide receiver, who had just one catch last week. Given the ball back with a chance to engineer a   drive, Wentz, who to that point had begun his career with 134 passes without an interception, aired the ball out in an attempt to catch the Lions off guard. But Slay once again came through, jumping over Nelson Agholor for the ball and sealing Philadelphia’s fate. It was more of the same for the Minnesota Vikings, as the team improved its record to   with a familiar formula of stifling defense and efficient offense. Sam Bradford threw for two passing touchdowns and Matt Asiata ran one in as part of a   blowout of the Houston Texans. The Vikings’ stellar secondary frustrated Houston’s Brock Osweiler all game, holding the young quarterback to just 19 completions on 42 attempts and Minnesota ended up outgaining Houston 351 to 214. Minnesota goes into its bye week with a perfect record and some extra time to prepare for a matchup with Carson Wentz and the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 7. Read more about the unbeaten Vikings here. For what it is worth to the Giants, Green Bay’s quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, wore a disgusted look while walking to the sideline almost as frequently as his counterpart on Sunday, Eli Manning. With both teams missing critical players in the defensive secondary, Rodgers and Manning seemed likely to amass big passing statistics on Sunday night at Lambeau Field. That is not how things played out. An unexceptional Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and two interceptions in the Packers’   victory. Manning struggled for the second consecutive week as the Giants scored just one touchdown and lost their third straight game.  —   Pat Borzi Here’s our report from Lambeau Field. ■ Chargers Melt Down Again: Derek Carr threw a     touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree on a    gamble and added another TD pass to Amari Cooper to lead the Oakland Raiders to a   victory over the   San Diego Chargers. San Diego ( ) committed four turnovers and then botched the hold on a potential tying field goal. Rookie Drew Kaser couldn’t hold the snap on what would have been a   field goal attempt. Here’s how the Raiders won. ■ Steelers Pick Jets Apart: Ben Roethlisberger passed for 380 yards and four touchdowns and the surging Pittsburgh Steelers pulled away in the second half for a   win over the New York Jets on Sunday. Sammie Coates caught six passes for a   139 yards and two scores, including a      for a score on Pittsburgh’s opening drive as the Steelers moved the ball at will against a secondary missing injured star Darrelle Revis. Read more about the Steelers’ victory here. ■ Redskins Win Third Straight: The Washington Redskins abandoned their usual formula for victory  —   the passing of Kirk Cousins  —   to extend their winning streak to three.

25899,Trump Begins to Walk Back Illegal Immigration Promises | Daily Wire,"Frank Camp November 13, 2016 
During an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes , which will air in its entirety Sunday night, Donald Trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants: 
""We are getting them out of our country,"" the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records. ""After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people who we're going to make a determination on, but before we make a determination, we want to secure our border."" 
Gasp. 
Donald Trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration. Throughout the primary process, he promised a "" deportation force ,"" telling MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski in November 2015: 
""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely. Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they're waiting to come in legally. And I always say the wall, we're going to build the wall. It's going to be a real deal. It's going to be a real wall."" 
In August, Trump delivered a major immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he softened his stance a bit, focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes: 
""Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice."" 
He then added that ""anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don’t have a country."" 
During the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump reiterated his position against amnesty: 
""Well, first of all, [Clinton] wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders."" 
For Trump diehards, these statements were enough. Their guy was going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and no one would tell them otherwise. However, as anyone with access to Google should know, the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion. 
In July 2015, Donald Trump told CNN's Dana Bash: 
""I would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legal…A lot of these people are helping us…and sometimes it’s jobs a citizen of the United States doesn’t want to do. I want to move ’em out, and we’re going to move ’em back in and let them be legal."" 
What Trump was talking about is known as ""touchback amnesty."" Such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants, but allow them an expedited means of returning to the United States in order to obtain legal status. In other words, they touch base in their home country, then come right back. 
In November 2015, Eric Trump repeated his father's plan during an interview with Fox News' Megyn Kelly: 
""The point isn’t just deporting them, it’s deporting them and letting them back in legally. He’s been so clear about that and I know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it, but its deporting them and letting them back legally."" 
Going back further, Trump's support for amnesty is even more stark. Speaking on Fox & Friends in 2012, he said: 
""For people that have been here for years that have been hard-workers, have good jobs, they’re supporting their family–it’s very, very tough to just say ‘By the way, 22 years, you have to leave. Get out’…I’m one of the world’s very conservative people, but I have to tell you on a human basis, how do you throw somebody out that’s lived in this country for twenty years?"" 
During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Trump even called Mitt Romney's idea of self-deportation "" maniacal ,"" and remarked that Republican Party policy toward illegal immigrants was "" mean-spirited ."" 
Donald Trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win. Now that he has won, he's already backtracking on multiple campaign promises, from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to the deportation of illegal immigrants. Tags ",1
25901,15 Guantánamo Detainees Are Sent to Emirates in Largest Obama-Era Transfer - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Pentagon said on Monday that it had sent 15 Guantánamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates in the largest single transfer of the Obama administration. The move eliminated a fifth of the wartime prison’s remaining population, which dropped to 61. While it appears increasingly unlikely that President Obama will succeed in closing the prison before he leaves office in January, the transfer brought him significantly closer to another goal: getting out every detainee who has been approved for transfer. Some have been stranded on that list for years because they could not be repatriated. The detainees sent to the United Arab Emirates included 12 Yemenis and three Afghans. The United States had held each of them without trial for about 14 years. Their departure reduced the list of prisoners approved for transfer to 20 men, although a   review board occasionally adds new names to it. “The United States is grateful to the government of the United Arab Emirates for its continued assistance in closing the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay,” Lee Wolosky, the State Department special envoy who negotiates such transfers, said in a statement. The Obama administration has made a sustained diplomatic push to persuade Persian Gulf states to resettle detainees from troubled countries like Yemen. American security officials see them as attractive places to send such detainees both because they share the same language and culture, and because they have security agencies with the capacity to monitor them. Oman was the first gulf country to provide such help, agreeing to resettle 10   detainees in two batches in early and  . At a meeting in May 2015 at Camp David with leaders or representatives from the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Mr. Obama sought to leverage that deal by urging others to help out, too, officials said. The United Arab Emirates resettled five Yemenis last November. It put them into a modified version of a custodial rehabilitation program it had developed for its own citizens who had been drawn into Islamist extremism, according to officials familiar with the transfer. In January, Oman resettled another group of 10. And in April, Saudi Arabia resettled nine. Qatar has taken on a different headache: In 2014, it resettled five   Taliban prisoners whom the administration exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Those former prisoners continue to live there under restrictive conditions. The transfers announced Monday were approved by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. Under restrictions imposed by Congress, he must tell lawmakers at least 30 days before any transfer that he has determined that security conditions in the receiving country are adequate. One of the detainees in Monday’s transfer, an Afghan named Obaydullah, was arrested in 2002 and accused of hiding   mines for an insurgent cell. Late in the Bush administration, he was charged in the military commissions system with providing material support for terrorism, although the charge was later withdrawn for technical reasons. His defense team later visited Afghanistan and reinvestigated his case, developing what it said in 2012 was evidence that the accusations against him were mistaken, although the team failed to persuade a court to order his release. Last spring, however, the review board decided that he should be sent to a country with a strong reintegration program and monitoring capacity. “In making this determination, the board noted that the detainee has not expressed any intent to   in terrorist activities, has not espoused any  . S. sentiment that would indicate he views the U. S. as his enemy, that neither the detainee nor his family have any ties to extremists outside of Guantánamo, and that the detainee has been mostly compliant while at Guantánamo,” the review board explained in a report. Maj. Derek A. Poteet of the Marines, a military lawyer who helped represent Mr. Obaydullah, said he visited his client at the prison about three weeks ago. Mr. Obaydullah had already heard a rumor that the United Arab Emirates had agreed to resettle him, he said. “He had hope on his face and relief when I was able to confirm that hope,” Major Poteet said. “My paralegal and I were in there, and he reassured us that ‘I want to live a life of peace with my family, and I want nothing to do with politics. ’” When Mr. Obama took office in 2009, 242 detainees remained at Guantánamo. He has proposed closing it by bringing several dozen detainees who are not approved for transfer to a replacement prison on domestic soil. But Congress has blocked that plan, and some Republican lawmakers have proposed shutting down transfers of   detainees to other countries, too. “The   responsibility of the federal government is to keep the American people safe, yet the Obama administration’s misguided commitment to releasing detainees in order to eventually close Guantánamo unacceptably gambles with our nation’s safety,” Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, said last week.",1
25903,Trump Recording Narrows Divide on Sexual Assault - The New York Times,"Of all the silver linings one might have expected from this   election, a new national understanding of sexual assault would have been quite hard to imagine. Until two weeks ago. One   recording of Donald J. Trump boasting about how his stardom gave him license to grope women’s private parts appears to have prompted the kind of change in public consciousness that usually takes decades. The lewd and aggressive comments by Mr. Trump, the Manhattan tycoon turned Republican presidential nominee, revealed a generational divide in the way many Americans understand sexual assault and consent. But, remarkably, the widespread outrage and outpouring it unleashed, with millions of women speaking out about their own experiences  —   appear to have narrowed that gap. “This is a moment of transition,” said Estelle B. Freedman, a Stanford University historian who studies the evolution of laws and norms surrounding sexual assault. “We are having a national conversation about new rules,” she added. “We are nationally trying to rethink issues of sexuality, consent, autonomy, relationships. ” While the Trump tape and its aftermath feel like a turning point in the public understanding of sexual assault, Alexandra Brodsky, a   of Know Your IX, an organization dedicated to ending sexual violence on college campuses, believes that “it’s actually a reflection that we are already past the turning point. ” “It is not obvious to me that five years ago, grabbing or kissing someone without her permission would have been recognized as sexual assault,” she said. Dr. Freedman sees this moment as the culmination of decades of change. Until the   century, her research shows, sexual assault and rape were viewed primarily as crimes against the honor of women’s husbands and fathers, not themselves. As women gained new rights to control their own property and legal decisions, sexual assault began to be considered a matter of consent, not honor. But there was little agreement about what consent meant, Dr. Freedman said. Many people believed consent could be implied or presumed by the way a woman dressed, for instance, or even her decision to accept a job with a male boss. By the 1990s, feminist advocacy had begun to push the idea of “no means no. ” Antioch College in 1991 adopted a code of conduct requiring students to affirmatively opt in to sexual activity starting with a kiss. While such   rules were lampooned on “Saturday Night Live” as political correctness run amok, they have become increasingly mainstream. States including New York and California require colleges and universities to adopt them. The widespread backlash to Mr. Trump’s comments, experts say, was fueled in part by the growing view, among people in their 20s and 30s, of affirmative consent as a guiding principle, not a lofty ideal or extreme demand. “I think that affirmative consent is an imperfect legal concept,” Ms. Brodsky, a recent graduate of Yale Law School, allowed. “But it’s a powerful normative concept. ” But old beliefs about honor and consent persist. Mr. Trump’s bragging in the video that women “let” him kiss and grope them because he was a star, for instance, seems straight out of the   era, in which anything other than a clear “no” could be seen as passive acquiescence. Dr. Freedman also detects shades of the old   system in some men’s responses that, as husbands and fathers, they found the video unacceptable. Until recently, pervasive shame and stigma meant that silence was often the rational choice for survivors of sexual violence. That was particularly true for women who grew up in an era when any sexual activity outside of marriage was considered unacceptable: revealing an assault risked being labeled promiscuous or worse. But as those norms have changed, the costs of speaking out have dropped. Younger women in particular are becoming more willing to protest sexual assaults that once might have been deemed too minor to merit reporting. And that, in turn, may be affecting the way older generations of women perceive episodes from their own pasts. It certainly worked that way for Emily Hoffman, 25, who works in the television industry in New York, and her mother, Amy Plummer. “I really don’t want to post this,” Ms. Hoffman wrote on Facebook on Oct. 10, a few days after the Trump tape was aired. But she went on to reveal to her 1, 326 Facebook friends what for seven years had been one of her most private secrets: that she had been assaulted by a senior male colleague while an    intern at a   company. He attacked her in a deserted stairwell, Ms. Hoffman announced, kissing her, groping her breasts and genitals, and then forcibly masturbating against her. “My experience mimicked what Donald Trump described in those tapes,” she said in an interview. “It was very upsetting. ” For Ms. Plummer, who is in her 60s, seeing her daughter’s post was transformative. “When Emily felt brave enough to put her experiences down was when I specifically started to think about my own experiences,” she said. “And I realized I would not have had the courage she had to say it publicly. ” But she also realized she had things of her own to share. She still felt that some of her experiences were too “explicit” to discuss. But she shared others with her daughter. How in junior high, for instance, her male guidance counselor told her that she should “consider a career as a Playboy bunny. ” And how she left graduate school without her master’s degree after a professor told her that she would not be able to pass her oral exams “unless I was ‘nice’ to him. ” One thing is notably missing from most of the stories survivors are now sharing: perpetrators’ names. The stigma of having been assaulted may have waned, but making an accusation against a specific individual is a different matter. It can raise the risk of legal consequences such as libel or slander suits. Many survivors, however, say social consequences are a more significant deterrent. “There is a sense that a ‘good victim’ merely shares her story to raise awareness or make people feel less alone,” Ms. Brodsky said. “But the minute there is a desire for accountability or change or retribution, suddenly she’s untrustworthy. ” When women accuse celebrities or other   people like Mr. Trump or Roger Ailes, the former Fox News executive, she said, “that triggers the unfounded but insidious myth that women say that they’ve been assaulted for attention or money. ” The pressure not to name names can be strong whenever the perpetrator is someone the woman knows. An accusation forces everyone who knows the two people to choose a side: accuser or accused? Choosing the accuser often means going against the broader group or community. In her work on college campuses around the country, Ms. Brodsky said, she has observed that “peers and friends are much more inclined to be sympathetic to victims if they don’t make anyone’s life more complicated. ” “Naming names creates an inconvenience,” she added. Psychological research shows that people find it extremely difficult  —   even painful  —   to challenge their peer groups. In the famous “conformity study” conducted by Solomon Asch, a professor of social psychology at the University of Pennsylvania who died in 1996, participants were asked to answer a series of simple, questions with obvious answers. There was a catch, though: Before the subject had a chance to respond, other research assistants disguised as participants all confidently selected the same wrong answer. That set up a dilemma: Choose the right answer, or conform to the group by selecting the wrong one? Even though the stakes were very low, about   of participants capitulated to group pressure at least once. Ms. Hoffman believes that her decision not to name her accuser is the reason her post has received such a uniformly positive response. “I’m not naming anybody in particular,” she said. “So they don’t feel like there’s somebody who they need to defend. ” But according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, 60 percent of sexual assaults are committed by an intimate partner, relative, friend or acquaintance. So the pressure on individuals not to name names can add up to widespread impunity for perpetrators. Nancy Erika Smith, a New Jersey lawyer who has represented victims of sexual assault and discrimination for more than two decades, said she recognized that asking people to identify who had harmed them was in many ways an unfair burden. “Don’t do it for yourself,” she said. “Do it for all of us.

25904,Yahoo Said to Have Aided U.S. Email Surveillance by Adapting Spam Filter - The New York Times,"A system intended to scan emails for child pornography and spam helped Yahoo satisfy a secret court order requiring it to search for messages containing a computer “signature” tied to the communications of a   terrorist organization, several people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Justice Department obtained an individualized order from a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year. Yahoo was barred from disclosing the matter. To comply, Yahoo customized an existing scanning system for all incoming email traffic, which also looks for malware, according to one of the officials and to a third person familiar with Yahoo’s response, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. With some modifications, the system stored and made available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation a copy of any messages it found that contained the digital signature. The collection is no longer taking place, those two people said. The order was unusual because it involved the systematic scanning of all Yahoo users’ emails rather than individual accounts several other tech companies said they had not encountered such a demand. News of the order has opened a new chapter in a public debate over the   between security needs and privacy rights that has cast a spotlight on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes antagonistic relationship between Silicon Valley companies and the United States government. It comes six months after a standoff between the F. B. I. and Apple, in which the government obtained a federal magistrate’’s order to force the company to help it unlock an encrypted iPhone from one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The F. B. I. gave up the fight with Apple after it found a way into the iPhone without the company’s help. By contrast, Yahoo cooperated with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, although the technical burden on the company appears to have been significantly lighter than the one the F. B. I. placed on Apple. Details of Yahoo’s cooperation with the court order come two weeks after the company reported that hackers had broken into its computer network, stealing the credentials of 500 million users. Yahoo engineers discovered the breach this summer, two years after it had occurred, and just weeks after Verizon Communications announced plans to buy the troubled internet company for $4. 8 billion. The two government officials familiar with the matter said the digital signature Yahoo was ordered to look for last year was individually approved in an order issued by a judge, who was persuaded that there was probable cause to believe that it was uniquely used by a foreign power. Investigators had learned that agents of the foreign terrorist organization were communicating using Yahoo’s email service and with a method that involved a “highly unique” identifier or signature, but the investigators did not know which specific email accounts those agents were using, the officials said. The officials’ description of the unusual surveillance operation carried out at Yahoo shed new light on a report by Reuters that has attracted widespread attention and provoked outrage among privacy and technology specialists. The Reuters article reported that in response to a “broad demand” from the government, Yahoo had “secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers’ incoming emails for specific information provided by U. S. intelligence officials. ” According to the government officials, Yahoo was served with an individualized court order to look only for code uniquely used by the foreign terrorist organization. Two sources, including one of the officials, portrayed it as adapting the scanning systems that it already had in place to comply with that order rather than building a   capability. The other official did not comment on the technology. The officials did not name the terrorist organization. Asked on Wednesday about the information obtained by The New York Times, Suzanne Philion, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the company had nothing further to say. Earlier in the day, the company said in a statement that the Reuters article was “misleading. ” “We narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure,” the Yahoo statement said. “The mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems. ” Richard Kolko, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declined in a statement to discuss specific foreign intelligence collection techniques, but referred to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. “Under FISA, activity is narrowly focused on specific foreign intelligence targets and does not involve bulk collection or use generic key words or phrases,” he said. “The United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people. ” Technology companies like Yahoo, Google and Microsoft scan for child pornography and are required to report any discoveries to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They similarly search traffic for malware and spam, which companies disclose in their terms of service. There is no engineering limitation preventing technology companies from using their spam and child pornography filtering systems to search email traffic for other sorts of digital signatures, said Hany Farid, chairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth, who helped develop the child pornography scanning system with Microsoft. But the use of that technology to carry out an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to search for a digital signature used by a foreign power is rare, and one of the officials portrayed it as innovative. “This is another example of how the government is pushing secretly novel or innovative interpretations of surveillance law” to conduct wiretapping in broader ways than the public realizes, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society. The government has not released any intelligence court opinion explaining how the judge interpreted FISA to authorize such surveillance. Although Congress in June 2015 enacted a law that required the government to make public novel and significant rulings by the court, the order to Yahoo appears to have predated that legislation, the USA Freedom Act, by several months. Yahoo has an inconsistent record with meeting government data demands. In 2007, the company settled a lawsuit related to allegations that it helped the Chinese government crack down on journalists by passing along their Yahoo emails. But that year, the firm fought a legal battle, then secret, before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, challenging a mandate that it turn over, without a warrant, emails from user accounts the F. B. I. and the National Security Agency said belonged to noncitizens abroad who had been targeted for surveillance. That litigation became an important test of whether Congress could legalize the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program through the Protect America Act and, later, the FISA Amendments Act. Ultimately, the intelligence court ruled against Yahoo, and after being threatened with a huge fine, the company cooperated. Yahoo was not able to clarify details of the Reuters article on Tuesday because orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are secret by law, and an increasing number of other government requests come with gag orders that prohibit tech companies from even acknowledging they exist. Tech companies complain that such gag orders make it impossible for them to explain to customers what sort of data they do and do not turn over. Twitter and Microsoft have separately sued the Justice Department over the gag order practice, and both cases are pending. Dozens of other companies have filed briefs in support of Microsoft. In its brief, Apple said it had received about 590 gag orders, of unlimited or indefinite durations, in the first eight months of 2016.",1
25906,"From a Dacha Wall, a Clue to Raoul Wallenberg’s Cold War Fate - The New York Times","MOSCOW  —   The 1945 disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg  —   a Swedish diplomat who  saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi gas chambers  —   ranks among the most enduring mysteries of World War II. Suspicion for the snatching of Wallenberg off the streets near Budapest fell almost immediately on the Soviet Union. To the Soviets occupying Budapest, the ties that Wallenberg had forged with senior Nazis and Americans smelled like espionage, with rescuing Jews an implausible cover story. But his disappearance went unexplained, right through the Gorbachev era of glasnost and the chaos after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This summer, however, the newly published diaries of the original head of the K. G. B.  —   found secreted inside the wall of a dacha  —   have shed fresh light on the case by stating outright for the first time that Wallenberg was executed in a Moscow prison. “I have no doubts that Wallenberg was liquidated in 1947,” wrote Ivan A. Serov, a Soviet military man who ran the K. G. B. from 1954 to 1958. Tantalizing hints that Wallenberg, the scion of a rich, prominent family of Swedish industrialists, was imprisoned in Moscow emerged immediately, then dripped out at long intervals. Alexandra M. Kollontai, the domineering Soviet ambassador to Sweden, initially told Wallenberg’s mother that the diplomat was in custody, but backtracked after the Kremlin announced that it knew nothing of the case. In the 1950s, Moscow began releasing war prisoners, and some reported meeting a V. I. P. inmate. Some called him mysterious some knew his name. Sweden started asking pointed questions, and seeking to improve ties, the Kremlin released a report in 1957. It said a newly discovered, partial medical report indicated that Wallenberg, age 34, died of a heart attack in prison in July 1947  —   a stock Soviet cover story. The next halting step toward resolution came with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin agreed to cooperate with a comprehensive   effort that included archival research and interviews with retired state security employees. But the final report in 2000 reached no definitive conclusion about Wallenberg’s fate, and found that documents had been destroyed or altered to eliminate all traces of him. In time, Wallenberg’s rescue work became an lasting symbol of the international human rights movement, but the mystery of his fate seemed likely to endure forever  —   until the Serov diaries came to light. Memoirs from   Kremlin officials are exceedingly rare, and this one, while hardly definitive, contains several references to previously unknown documents on Wallenberg. They include a report about Wallenberg’s cremation, and another quoting Viktor Abakumov, who preceded Serov as head of state security but was tried and executed in 1954 in the last Stalin purges. Abakumov apparently revealed during his interrogation that the order to “liquidate” Wallenberg had come from Stalin and Vyacheslav M. Molotov, the foreign minister. The word “killed” has never appeared in any official documents released from the Soviet side, according to Nikita Petrov, a historian with the Memorial organization in Moscow who specializes in the Stalinist era and Serov himself. “They did not use this word,” Mr. Petrov said. “They said it appears he was killed, but we know nothing about this, we don’t have any documents. In Serov’s diary, you can find this word as a fact. ” Memoirs lack the weight of official documents, Mr. Petrov noted, but Serov also described reading a Wallenberg file. Previously, the security service denied that any such files existed, according to diplomats, historians and others who have long worked on the case. “There should have been a personal or prisoner file which was created for every prisoner,” said Hans Magnusson, a retired senior diplomat who directed the Swedish side of the   Working Group. “The Russians said that they did not find one. ” The Serov book is called “Notes From a Suitcase: Secret Diaries of the First K. G. B. Chairman, Found Over 25 Years After His Death,” and appeared in Russia in June with its own extraordinary tale. Four years ago, Serov’s only grandchild, Vera Serova, 57, a retired ballet dancer, hired workers to renovate the garage at the dacha she inherited from her grandfather in northwestern Moscow. The workers demolishing the internal walls stumbled upon a few hidden suitcases. “They thought it was money or gold, but it was only papers,” she said in an interview, flashing a smile. Mr. Petrov said the suitcases probably went into the wall around 1971, when the Central Committee first got wind of the writing project and had Serov followed. Mrs. Serova turned over a copy of the diaries to a publisher, who condensed them into a single,   volume. The book was released in conjunction with a small museum exhibition curated by the Russian   Society. The exhibition skips the dark periods in Serov’s career. There is no mention of his role in organizing the mass deportations of minorities deemed potential wartime collaborators, nor establishing the secret police used to eliminate opposition to Soviet rule in East Germany and Poland. After leaving the K. G. B. for military intelligence, Serov was eventually disgraced after one of his underlings was exposed as a Western spy. He died of a heart attack in 1990 at 84. Mrs. Serova said she had published the diaries to restore her grandfather’s reputation. “It is important for me because we wanted to rehabilitate his name. Very few people in Russia know him, almost nobody,” she said. “He was acting on the orders of Stalin and others. ” In the   pages devoted to the Wallenberg case  —   somewhat sketchy and written in dry, bureaucratic language  —   Serov said Nikita S. Khrushchev, who succeeded Stalin as Soviet leader, had asked him to investigate what happened, respond to Sweden and help purge Molotov. Serov wrote that ultimately he failed to uncover the full circumstances of Wallenberg’s death, and found no evidence that he had been a spy. Foreign governments and researchers have long suspected that Moscow was withholding documents, unwilling to confirm that Stalin would coldbloodedly order the murder of a foreign diplomat rather than admit that the Kremlin had been lying. The most important document never released is a letter from Abakumov to Molotov on July 17, 1947, which researchers believe contains the details of Wallenberg’s death. In the archival material that was released, researchers found a note scrawled in the bottom corner of another letter saying that “Ab,” or Abakumov, wrote a personal letter to Molotov and giving the document’s reference number. Letter   was listed in a K. G. B. register of outgoing letters, according to the   report, showing that it was despatched on July 17 and indicating that it concerned Wallenberg. A different memo said it had been received. But the actual letter has never been found. “The Russian side’s explanation for this is that the letter was personal and particularly sensitive in character,” said the joint 2000 report. Marie Dupuy, Wallenberg’s niece and heir to the sustained clan effort to unearth the truth, said she would like to see the original diaries and ask the F. S. B. the successor agency to the K. G. B. for the documents mentioned by Serov. “Numerous questions remain about the source material, which must be thoroughly evaluated before any conclusions can be drawn,” Ms. Dupuy said in a statement on her website. Last year, historians with long experience on the case organized the Raoul Wallenberg Research Initiative, a renewed, international attempt to comb the archives, and they have compiled a   list of questions for the Russian government. The media office of the F. S. B. did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would release the documents Serov mentioned or cooperate with renewed research. Perhaps the underlying Russian attitude was succinctly summed up by Khrushchev, whom Serov quoted as uttering a blunt Russian expression after being briefed on the case. “These scoundrels,” he barked, naming Stalin and his coterie, “brewed this rotten porridge, while we have to gulp down the sewage. ”",1
25907,Tunisian Detained as Possible Accomplice in Berlin Attack - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   A    Tunisian man has been detained as a possible accomplice of Anis Amri, the man identified as the terrorist who carried out the truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people, German officials said on Wednesday. The Tunisian was held in Berlin, news agencies reported, after a search of a home and offices associated with the man, whose name was not released. Information about him was found in the cellphone of Mr. Amri, a    Tunisian, who was killed on Friday during a shootout with police officers outside Milan. The development on Wednesday was announced by the office of Peter Frank, the public prosecutor general, which is based in Karlsruhe. “The investigations indicate that he could have been involved in the attack,” Mr. Frank’s office said in a statement, adding that officials expected to know by late Thursday if there were enough grounds to press criminal charges. “To what extent suspicions about the arrested person will be firmed up remains to be seen, after further investigation. ” The truck attack, on Dec. 19, was Germany’s deadliest terrorist attack in decades. The Islamic State claimed responsibility and released a video that Mr. Amri had recorded, in which he pledged his allegiance to the group’s supreme leader. But it is not known if Mr. Amri had accomplices. Nor is it clear precisely how Mr. Amri made his way back to Italy, where he was from 2011 to 2015, when he moved to Germany. Italian and French officials have said that Mr. Amri most likely traveled by train on the evening of Dec. 22 from Lyon, France, transferring trains at the town of Chambéry, near the border with Italy, before making his way to Turin and then Milan. From Central Station in Milan, he went to the northern suburb of Sesto San Giovanni, where two police officers on a routine patrol stopped him early Friday morning and asked for identification Mr. Amri opened fire and was fatally shot. How Mr. Amri reached Lyon from Berlin remains unclear, but Agence   citing unidentified Dutch officials, reported on Wednesday that he took a bus from Amsterdam or the Dutch city of Nijmegen, near the   border, to Lyon on Dec. 21, two days after the attack. (There is no direct bus service to Lyon from Amsterdam or Nijmegen travelers have to change buses in Brussels Düsseldorf, Germany Frankfurt or Paris.) “The suspect in the Berlin attack was very likely at the Nijmegen station two days after the attack,” Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the Dutch national prosecutor’s office, said in a statement on Wednesday. In a phone interview, he said that officials believed that Mr. Amri obtained in Nijmegen a free cellphone SIM card that the Italian police found on his body after he was killed. Mr. de Bruin said that the police were following up on reports from people who thought they might have seen Mr. Amri. “We have to investigate the reports because we would like to reconstruct the route he took in the Netherlands to get from Germany to France,” he said in the interview. He added that investigators were working closely with their counterparts in Germany, France and Italy. Mr. Amri is said to have careened into a Christmas market at the symbolic Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin just after 8 p. m. on Dec. 19. The police initially detained a Pakistani man who was found to have no connection to the truck and thus the assault. The error ended up giving the suspect a head start of almost 20 hours to flee, before investigators scouring the cab found a migration document that led to Mr. Amri. Mr. Amri, who had a history of petty crime and used several aliases in his odyssey around Europe, applied for asylum in Germany in April. His application was rejected in June, and he was ordered deported, but he managed to slip through the cracks. He may have benefited from Germany’s decentralized political system. Power is spread over 16 states, and police, judicial and migration officials have distinct spheres of authority. For example, Mr. Amri was detained for two days in the southern German town of Friedrichshafen on July 30, after trying to take a bus to Zurich, when the police noticed he was under deportation order. But an office for registering foreigners in Kleve, in the far northwest of Germany, which was responsible for the order, said it did not have the papers from Tunisia necessary to carry out the deportation, so Mr. Amri was ordered released. Adding to the confusion, on leaving jail in the south, he gave an address in Karlsruhe, in the southwest  —   hundreds of miles from Kleve. This jumbled state of affairs  —   a reaction to the abuses of centralized power under fascist and communist governments  —   has frequently been criticized, and with the new focus on terrorism, both politicians and ordinary Germans are again clamoring for change. In France, which has a fairly strong central government but is also struggling with terrorism, a    man was arrested Tuesday morning in a police raid at his home in Cugnaux, near Toulouse in the country’s southwest, on suspicion that he had been planning an imminent terrorist attack, officials said on Wednesday. His name was not disclosed.   Falcone, the head of the national police, told the French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that France remains under “high” threat of another attack, and that the Berlin attack “confirms that a heavy set of security measures, both active and passive, has to be put into place around mass gatherings. ”",1
25911,’Strategic Patience’ Is Over: Tillerson Floats Military Action in North Korea - Breitbart,"U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters in Seoul on Friday that the Trump administration is open to military action against North Korea as a last resort, and that the   policy of “strategic patience has ended. ”[“The policy of strategic patience has ended. We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures. All options are on the table,” Tillerson told reporters at a press conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun  . “If North Korea takes actions that threaten South Korean forces or our own forces, that will be met with an appropriate response. ”  “If they elevate the threats of their weapons program to the level that we believe requires action, that option is on the table,” Tillerson added. He emphasized that the United States would attempt to avoid to the extent possible any military actions against North Korea, particularly those that may put North Korean civilian lives in danger. “We hope that that will persuade North Korea to take a different course of action. That’s our desire,” Tillerson concluded. Tillerson also took the opportunity to once again call for China to take on a larger role in containing North Korea’s escalating belligerence and objected to China cutting economic ties with South Korea over the deployment of the America Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. “While we acknowledge Chinese opposition, its economic retaliation against South Korea is inappropriate and troubling. We ask China to refrain from such actions. Instead, we urge China to address the threat that makes that necessary,” Tillerson said. Tillerson is currently in the middle of a   trip to Asia, having left Japan on Thursday and scheduled to meet with leaders in China on Saturday. The Secretary of State’s remarks regarding potential military action against North Korea follow remarks in Japan that emphasized a “different approach” to the rogue government in Pyongyang. “Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,” Tillerson noted on Friday in a press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. The Trump administration has hinted at a change in America’s approach towards Pyongyang in other venues, as well. Earlier this month, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters in New York that the White House is “not ruling anything out” to keep North Korea from developing and using nuclear weapons. Haley described the THAAD system as a necessary response to Pyongyang’s insistence on violating UN sanctions with missile launches that could threaten Japan and South Korea. “We are not going to leave South Korea standing there with the threat of North Korea facing them and not help. The reason for THAAD is because of the actions of North Korea,” she said in response to Chinese and Russian opposition. Following Tillerson’s remarks Friday, President Trump himself issued a warning to North Korea on Twitter: North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been “playing” the United States for years. China has done little to help!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2017, Tillerson’s message towards China was also similar in Japan: as its largest trading partner, take a more prominent role in containing North Korea. “We look to China to fulfill its obligations and fully implement the sanctions called for,” he said. Anticipating Tillerson’s visit, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters Wednesday he was “optimistic about the future of   relations” and anticipated a positive outcome from Tillerson’s visit. President Donald Trump is reportedly working with Chinese officials to plan a U. S. visit by President Xi Jinping next month. These statements represent a nearly complete shift away from what former Secretary of State and   presidential candidate Hillary Clinton described as “strategic patience“: a policy of waiting for the North Korean economy to implode and Pyongyang finding itself no longer able to afford to ignore UN sanctions and the rejection of the international community. This policy largely failed because China continued to trade with North Korea, providing the fellow communist regime a vital lifeline. The response in Seoul to the new, robust U. S. policy is largely divided along partisan lines, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. Conservative leaders have expressed gratitude for Tillerson’s strong support for their country. “We highly appreciate his comments as he expressed a strong willingness to respond to North Korea’s reckless behavior,” Liberty Korea Party spokesman Rep. Choung   told Yonhap. One   leader, in contrast, told Yonhap: “We are supporting the U. S.’s move to strengthen the effectiveness of sanctions against the North through cooperation with relevant countries, but we cannot help expressing concerns about the U. S. stance that there will be no dialogue until North Korea gives up (nuclear weapons). ”   North Korea appears to have responded to Tillerson’s presence in the region with the publication of a “human rights white paper” condemning the United States as a serial violator of human rights, condemning the presidential election itself as a human rights violation against the American people and labeling the nation a “human rights desert. ”  ",1
25913,Can Evolution Have a ‘Higher Purpose’? - The New York Times,"About 25 years ago, a conversation between me and one of the greatest biologists of the 20th century took a weird turn. I was talking to William D. Hamilton, who was famous for coming up with the theory of “kin selection,” which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species, including ours. This and other seminal ideas had earned Hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern Darwinian understanding of social behavior. Richard Dawkins, in the preface to his landmark 1976 book,“The Selfish Gene,” paid tribute to Hamilton and the three other “dominant figures” in social biology whose ideas formed the book’s foundation. I was interviewing Hamilton at the University of Michigan, where he was on sabbatical from Oxford. A video camera was rolling. I had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology, and I was hoping to create a documentary on the subject. The documentary never materialized, and Hamilton died in early 2000. My interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year, when I tracked down the tape containing it. During the interview, I was trying to steer Hamilton toward philosophical topics, and at one point he went further than I had expected. He said, “I’m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature  —   that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is, coming from some other source. ” That’s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say, but the most unusual part was still to come. Hamilton continued, in his British accent, “I could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere, and so on, but I think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion. ” Well, maybe, but this sounded at least as interesting as the general topic of discussion. I asked him if he meant that there was some kind of “transcendental purpose” that we humans are generally oblivious to. He answered: “Yes, yes. There’s one theory of the universe that I rather like  —   I accept it in an almost joking spirit  —   and that is that Planet Earth in our solar system is a kind of zoo for extraterrestrial beings who dwell out there somewhere. And this is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans who go around doing things  —   and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn’t look quite right  —   this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that. ” So, he continued, these extraterrestrials “insert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize. ” He reiterated: “I put it forward in an almost joking spirit. But I think it’s a kind of hypothesis that’s very, very hard to dismiss. ” The headline almost writes itself: “  Scientist Says Miracles Can Happen!” The subhead would add: “Extraterrestrials may play a role. ” But that’s the headline you’d write if you were just trying to maximize clicks. If you wanted to capture the philosophical significance of what Hamilton was saying, you’d take another tack. Rather than focus on miracles, you’d focus on the idea of “higher purpose”  —   the idea that there’s some point to life on earth that emanates from something that is in some sense beyond it. And  —   in hopes of generating as many clicks as possible, notwithstanding the philosophical significance  —   you’d put this in listicle form, laying out several misconceptions that Hamilton had implicitly dispelled. You could call these the “Three Great Myths About Evolution and Purpose. ” Myth number one: To say that there’s in some sense a “higher purpose” means there are “spooky forces” at work. When I ask scientifically minded people if they think life on earth may have some larger purpose, they typically say no. If I ask them to explain their view, it often turns out that they think that answering yes would mean departing from a scientific worldview  —   embracing the possibility of supernatural beings or, at the very least, of immaterial factors that lie beyond scientific measurement. But Hamilton’s thought experiment shows that this isn’t necessarily so. You may consider aliens spooky, but they’re not a spooky force. And they’re not supernatural beings. They’re just physical beings, like us. Their technology is so advanced that their interventions might seem miraculous to us  —   as various smartphone apps would seem to my      —   but these interventions would in fact comply with the laws of science. More to the point: If you ask how Hamilton’s aliens had initially imparted “purpose” to life, the answer is that they did so in concrete fashion: by planting simple   material on earth a few billion years ago, confident that it would lead to something that would keep them entertained (keeping them entertained being, in this scenario, life’s purpose). Which leads to: Myth number two: To say that evolution has a purpose is to say that it is driven by something other than natural selection.  The correction of this misconception is in some ways just a corollary of the correction of the first misconception, but it’s worth spelling out: Evolution can have a purpose even if it is a wholly mechanical, material process  —   that is, even if its sole engine is natural selection. After all, clocks have purposes  —   to keep time, a purpose imparted by clockmakers  —   and they’re wholly mechanical. Of course, to suggest that evolution involves the unfolding of some purpose is to suggest that evolution has in some sense been heading somewhere  —   namely, toward the realization of its purpose. Which leads to: Myth number three: Evolution couldn’t have a purpose, because it doesn’t have a direction. The idea that evolution is fundamentally directionless is widespread, in part because one great popularizer of evolution, Stephen Jay Gould, worked hard to leave that impression. As I and others have argued, Gould was at best misleading on this point. And, anyway, even Gould admitted that, yes, on balance evolution tends to create beings of greater and greater complexity. A number of evolutionary biologists would go further and say that evolution was likely, given long enough, to create animals as intelligent as us. In fact, that idea is implicit in Hamilton’s saying the aliens could have “set up” evolution in such a way that “it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans. ” This part of Hamilton’s scenario requires no intervention on the part of the aliens, because he believed that evolution by natural selection has a kind of direction in the sense that it is likely, given long enough, to produce very intelligent forms of life. (When speaking more precisely, as he did in other parts of the interview, Hamilton would say that the human species per se wasn’t in the cards  —   that it wasn’t inevitable that the first intelligent species would look like us.) With these three myths dispelled, you’re left with this philosophically liberating upshot: You can entertain the possibility that evolution has a purpose, a kind of goal (a “telos,” as philosophers say) without departing from a strictly Darwinian view of evolution  —   without abandoning belief in natural selection as evolution’s only engine, and without surrendering your credentials as a modern, scientifically minded kind of person. In case you’re still feeling a little uneasy about becoming a purpose ponderer, I should emphasize that not all teleological scenarios that pass scientific muster involve space aliens. Indeed, some scientists have suggested that natural selection has a purpose that wasn’t instilled by any kind of intelligent being. This scenario emerges from one version of physicist Lee Smolin’s theory of “cosmological natural selection. ” Smolin thinks our universe may itself be a product of a kind of evolution: maybe universes can replicate themselves via black holes, so over time  —   over a lot of time  —   you get universes whose physical laws are more and more conducive to replication. (So that’s why our universe is so good at   making!) In some variants of Smolin’s theory  —   such as those developed by the late cosmologist Edward Harrison and the mathematician Louis Crane  —   intelligent beings can play a role in this replication once their technology reaches a point where they can produce black holes. So through cosmological natural selection you’d get universes whose physical properties were more and more conducive to the evolution of intelligent life. This might explain the   observation that the physical constants of this universe seem “ ” to permit the emergence of life. Crane, in a recent dialogue on my website meaningoflife. tv, told me that in this scenario “human life —  and I don’t mean on an individual scale, but as a whole —  has a purpose in the same sense that a chicken’s egg has a purpose. The purpose of a chicken’s egg is to create a chicken. ” Crane isn’t using language carelessly here. Some philosophers are comfortable talking about animals having a “purpose” imbued by natural selection (to spread their genes). So if biological evolution is a product of cosmological natural selection, it has a purpose in a defensible sense of that term —  and we’re part of that purpose. So add another item to our listicle: Myth number four: If evolution has a purpose, the purpose must have been imbued by an intelligent being.  That said, one interesting feature of current discourse is a growing openness among some scientifically minded people to the possibility that our world has a purpose that was imparted by an intelligent being. I’m referring to “simulation” scenarios, which hold that our seemingly tangible world is actually a kind of projection emanating from some sort of   powerful computer and the history of our universe, including evolution on this planet, is the unfolding of a computer algorithm whose author must be pretty bright. You may scoff, but in 2003 the philosopher Nick Bostrom of Oxford University published a paper laying out reasons to think that we are pretty likely to be living in a simulation. And the simulation hypothesis has gained influential supporters. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and America’s de facto astronomer laureate, finds it plausible. The visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says there’s almost no chance that we’re living in “base reality. ” The New Yorker reported earlier this year that “two tech billionaires”  —   it didn’t say whether Musk is one of them  —   “have gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. ” I’m guessing that will take awhile, and meanwhile I’d like to note an irony. When an argument for higher purpose is put this way  —   that is, when it doesn’t involve the phrase “higher purpose” and, further, is cast more as a technological scenario than a metaphysical one  —   it is considered intellectually respectable. I don’t mean there aren’t plenty of people who dismiss it. I’m talking about how people dismiss it. The Bostrom paper drew flack, but a lot of it was from people who thought the chances that we’re living in a simulation are way less than 50 percent, not from people who thought the idea was wholly crazy. If you walked up to the same people who gave Bostrom a respectful hearing and told them there is a transcendent God, many would dismiss the idea out of hand. Yet the simulation hypothesis is a God hypothesis: An intelligence of   power created our universe for reasons we can speculate about but can’t entirely fathom. And, assuming this intelligence still exists, it is in some sense outside of our reality  —   beyond the reach of our senses  —   and yet, presumably, it has the power to intervene in our world. Theology has entered “secular” discourse under another name. Personally, I’m fine with that. I think discussion of higher purpose should be respectable even in a scientific age. I don’t mean I buy the simulation scenario in particular, or the space alien scenario, or the cosmological natural selection scenario. But I do think there’s reason to suspect that there’s some point to this exercise we Earthlings are engaged in, some purpose imbued by something  —   and that, even if identifying that something is for now hopeless, there are grounds for speculating about what the point of the exercise is. I won’t elaborate much on this, since I’ve done that elsewhere, arguing that higher purpose can be framed as a hypothesis, and that evidence for or against the hypothesis can be marshaled. But I will say that the evidence I see for purpose includes not just the direction of biological evolution, but the direction of technological evolution and of the broader social and cultural evolution it drives  —   the evolution that has carried us from   bands to the brink of a cohesive global community. And if the purpose involves sustaining this direction  —   becoming a true global community  —   then it would seem to include moral progress. In particular, our purpose would involve transcending the psychology of tribalism that can otherwise divide people along ethnic, national, religious and ideological lines. Which would mean  —   in light of recent political and social developments in the United States and abroad  —   that our work is cut out for us.",1
25916,Koch Brothers Helped Incite the Impending Bloodbath Among Republicans,"By Rmuse   7:57 pm ""If the party doesn’t learn lessons and change based on what’s gone on for the last year and a half, I think it’s going to be just catastroph[ic].""   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
It may be the understatement of the year to say the Republican Party is on the verge of a full-on civil war, and it may be obvious to many Americans that the blame for the inter-party discord is its standard bearer Donald J. Trump. However much Trump’s candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of Trump’s reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion-minded Trump supporters, the real instigators are the Koch brothers. 
Although the oil magnates were never on the Trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the Trump loyalists within the GOP who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nation’s political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. The tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former House Speaker John A. Boehner out of Congress, morphed into the inaptly- named Freedom caucus that has embraced Trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isn’t solely to put current Speaker Paul Ryan out of a job, although that is high on the Trump supporters’ to-do list. 
As noted in Wednesday’s New York Times, “ Mr. Trump’s supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress — a target many of them seem…eager to take down .” 
The right-wing extremist that actually “ took down ” former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, conservative extremist and House Freedom Caucus member David Brat, issued a warning to establishment Republicans: 
“ There’s a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to D.C. Leadership comes and smacks our guy? That’s where you’re going to put down a marker? Really? And the American people are just scratching their head saying, ‘Really? That’s rich .’” 
Brat has been a thorn in the establishment’s side since Paul Ryan became Speaker and he joins a dangerous number of “ real conservatives ” who cannot understand or comport with Ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize Trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after Hillary Clinton. 
Donald Trump and a few of his “ senior aides ” are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending Trump. In fact, besides assailing Ryan for not sticking by Trump, it is reported that Trump said privately that Ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the Trump candidacy. And, during an interview with Reuters he complained that “ The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top .” Win or lose, there is going to be a major blood-letting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a Herculean task to save the party. 
This impending conflict within the GOP has been brewing longer than Donald Trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti-establishment devotee to run his campaign. The chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get Paul Ryan out as House Speaker because he is not a “true conservative” intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber-conservative paradise. And “uber-conservative” is just a different way of saying a “ non-government ” according to the Koch brothers’ vision of American libertarianism. Don’t believe it? 
Two groups closely aligned with the Koch brothers, Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks , have been pushing Republicans as a Party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the party’s decisions; something establishment types are resisting. 
Over the past few days, leaders of both Koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the House; something typically occurring directly after the general election in November regardless the outcome. 
According to the chief executive of Heritage Action, Michael Needham, there is going to be Hell to pay for establishment Republicans if they don’t bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the Kochs and heavily courted by Donald Trump. Mr. Needham said, 
“ If the party doesn’t learn lessons and change based on what’s gone on for the last year and a half, I think it’s going to be just catastrophe .” 
Another conservative extremist, House Freedom Caucus member and ardent Donald Trump supporter echoed Needham’s sentiment and said, “ You can’t ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle. ” 
The dilemma for Republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. That doesn’t seem likely because if Trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of Hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of Trump’s more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. If Trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on November 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among Republicans. 
The Republican Party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the United States or shutting down the government as a show of anger. After four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past year-and-a-half of incitement by Donald Trump, the Republican Party faces a serious threat to its long-term survival. It is a threat that began about six years ago when the Koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that Donald Trump took advantage of to seize control of the Republican Party.",1
25919,Berkley Professor Claims Hillary Clinton Email Investigation Nothing More Than a Sexist ‘Bitch Hunt’,"at 3:47 pm Leave a comment 
Today’s college-related article is not about safe spaces, macro aggressions and trigger warnings. Rather, it’s about a remarkably stupid claim made by Robin Lakoff (a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley), that the entire email scandal plaguing Hillary Clinton is a nothing more than a vast patriarchal driven conspiracy manufactured by men for the sole purpose of taking down a strong and powerful woman. No, I’m not kidding. 
  delusional Time published article, Hillary Clinton’s Emailgate Is an Attack on Women : 
‘It’s not about emails; it’s about public communication by a woman’ 
I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It’s us. 
The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she’s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. 
If the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no “scandal.” Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory. 
Clinton’s use of a personal server has not been found to be a crime. Then how is it that so many have found the charge so easy to make, and make stick? How has her use of the server made plausible all the claims that she is “deceptive” and “untrustworthy”? 
It’s not about emails; it’s about public communication by a woman in general. Of course, in the year 2016, no one (probably not even The Donald) could make this argument explicitly. After all, he and his fellow Republicans are not waging a war on women. How do we know that? They have said so. And they’re men, so they must be telling the truth. 
But here’s Hillary Rodham Clinton, the very public stand-in for all bossy, uppity and ambitious women. Here are her emails. And since it’s a woman, doing what decent women should never do—engaging in high-level public communication—well, there must be something wrong with that, even if we can’t quite find that something. We will invoke the terminology of criminal law to account for our feelings. She’s getting away with treason! Put her in jail! We can’t quite put our fingers on it, but the words sure do make a lot of people feel better, so they must be right. 
So that’s the take of Berkley linguistics professor Robin Lakoff. Now here’s the take from Charles S. Faddis, a former CIA operations officer with 20 years of experience in intelligence operations. 
As Mr. Faddis writes   I have worked in national security my entire life. Most of that has been in the intelligence community surrounded by   For twenty years, I worked undercover in the Central Intelligence Agency, recruiting sources, producing intelligence and running operations. I have a pretty concrete understanding of how classified information is handled and how government communications systems work. Nobody uses a private email server for official business. Period. Full stop. 
The entire notion is, to borrow a phrase from a Clinton campaign official, “insane.” That anyone would presume to be allowed to do so is mind-boggling. That government officials allowed Hillary Clinton to do so is nauseating. Classified and unclassified information do not mix. They don’t travel in the same streams through the same pipes. They move in clearly well defined channels so that never the twain shall meet. Mixing them together is unheard of and a major criminal offense. If you end up with classified information in an unclassified channel, you have done something very wrong and very serious. Accidentally removing a single classified message from controlled spaces, without any evidence of intent or exposure to hostile forces, can get you fired and cost you your clearance. Repeated instances will land you in prison. Every hostile intelligence agency on the planet targets senior American officials for collection. The Secretary of State tops the list. Almost anything the Secretary of State had to say about her official duties, her schedule, her mood, her plans for the weekend, would be prized information to adversaries. It is very difficult, in fact, to think of much of anything that the Secretary of State could be saying in email that we would want hostile forces to know. As we wait for more information on the latest revelations, let’s quickly note what we already know Hillary Clinton did. While Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email address for official business. Instead of using a State Department account, she used a personal email account, housed on a private server located in her home in Chappaqua, New York. The Department of State exercised zero control or oversight in this process. No government security personnel were involved in protecting them. When the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked to see these emails, the Department of State said they did not have them. Clinton’s lawyers then went through all the emails on her server. They turned over 30,000 emails they decided were work related and deleted all of the rest. How they made the decision as to which emails to share and which to destroy remains unknown. Active government officials were not involved in this process. Hillary says she did not use the account to transmit   This has been proven false. The FBI found over 100 messages that contained information that was classified when sent, including numerous email chains at the level of Top Secret/Special Access Programs. They don’t get any more highly classified, it’s the virtual summit of Mt. Everest. One theme pertained to the movement of North Korean nuclear assets obtained via satellite imagery . It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out this is extremely sensitive information. The FBI found another 2,000 messages containing information that should have been classified at the time it was sent. How much more classified information may have been in the tens of thousands of emails, which Clinton’s lawyers erased, is completely unknown. Hillary Clinton supporters like to ask rhetorically, “Well, what about Colin Powell?” Nice try , but using your own private email address which received 2 emails determined to be classified later, is nothing like deliberately operating a home brewed server, and then see it handle thousands of classified e-mails. 
What happens next we do not know. What we do know already is this. While serving in one of the most senior positions in the United States Government, Hillary Clinton was at a minimum, grossly negligent in the handling of classified information and when confronted with this practice, acted immediately to destroy information and prevent a full, fair and complete investigation of any damage to national security. Anyone else who did such things in the government would long ago have been tried, convicted and sent to jail. You decide if you want to send her to the White House instead. 
I’ll let readers decide who has a better read on the situation. In the meantime, back to your safe spaces my little snowflakes. In Liberty,",1
25921,Selective Outrage Over SPLC’s 'Anti-Muslim Extremist List',"Search Selective Outrage Over SPLC’s 'Anti-Muslim Extremist List' Leftists and atheists appalled that SPLC’s hit list of Islam critics includes…Leftists and atheists. October 31, 2016 Robert Spencer 
Sam Harris thinks it’s “unbelievable” that Maajid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali made it to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s hit list of “Anti-Muslim Extremists.” He said nothing about me or the other people whom the SPLC included, which is not surprising, since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the SPLC list exemplifies. 
Hemant Mehta of The Friendly Atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over Nawaz and Hirsi Ali being included: “If criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists, then it won’t be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too. And make no mistake, that’s what Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are doing. That’s all they’re doing. They’re not anti-Muslim; they work with moderate Muslims. They’re critical of the worst aspects of Islam.” 
The problem with being angry about Nawaz and Hirsi Ali being on the SPLC list, but silent about everyone else who is on it, is that what Mehta says about Nawaz and Hirsi Ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list. If criticizing religious beliefs makes them “extremists,” then it won’t be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about Islam will be on the list — and that is indeed the objective of the list: to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics. Mehta protests that Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are “not anti-Muslim; they work with moderate Muslims. They’re critical of the worst aspects of Islam.” 
But no one would think that the other 13 were “anti-Muslim” if it hadn’t been for the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Hamas-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years, in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression with hating a group of people — a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression. Mehta and co. are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends. 
And as for working with moderate Muslims, for 13 years Jihad Watch has contained this invitation : “Any Muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our anti-jihadist efforts.” It is Nawaz (as well as other moderates) who has attacked me, in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among Muslims; I never attacked him, and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise. 
In complaining that Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are merely “criticizing religious beliefs” and are “not anti-Muslim,” Mehta is strongly implying that the others on the SPLC list are doing something beyond “criticizing religious beliefs” and are indeed “anti-Muslim.” On Twitter the last couple of days I’ve seen many people express outrage that Nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of Spencer; but when I ask them what the big difference is between us, or for quotes from me that are actually “bigoted,” they go silent. 
Mehta, Harris, Haider and the others who are only angry with the SPLC’s hit list because it included Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are, by their selective outrage, acquiescing to and legitimizing the SPLC’s demonization of the other people on the list. (In his own defense, Hemant Mehta wrote me to explain, somewhat unsatisfactorily: “I focused on those two because they’re well known in atheist circles.”) This is a self-defeating choice for them to have made, for the SPLC has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of Islam, and never will: the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about Islam that is not warmly positive. 
The turn of Mehta, Harris, and Haider will come for the same treatment. One wonders if, when this happens, there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as “anti-Muslim,” with their tacit approval.",1
25924,Senate and House Leaders Call for Inquiry of Russian Hacking in Election - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The top two Republicans in Congress said on Monday that they supported investigations into possible Russian cyberattacks to influence the American election, setting up a potential confrontation with   Donald J. Trump in his first days in office. “Any foreign breach of our cybersecurity measures is disturbing, and I strongly condemn any such efforts,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, adding, “The Russians are not our friends. ” Mr. McConnell’s support for investigating American intelligence findings that Moscow intervened in the election on Mr. Trump’s behalf could presage friction between the Republicans who control Congress, and who have long taken a hard line against Russia, and the   who has mocked the findings. Mr. McConnell also went out of his way to address Mr. Trump’s claim that the C. I. A. could not be trusted because of flawed intelligence before the Iraq war. “Let me say that I have the highest confidence in the intelligence community,” Mr. McConnell said, “and especially the Central Intelligence Agency. The C. I. A. is filled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people. ” The top Republican in the House, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said he supported a continuing investigation by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. In a statement, Mr. Ryan said: “As I’ve said before, any foreign intervention in our elections is entirely unacceptable. And any intervention by Russia is especially problematic because, under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests. ” Congressional Republicans announced their support for inquiries after Mr. Trump railed for much of the weekend against the intelligence findings. But their remarks, especially Mr. Ryan’s, were far from fiery, reflecting both a fear of offending Mr. Trump, who has taken many positions against traditional Republican orthodoxy, and the Republicans’ belief that Democrats have selectively leaked intelligence information for political gain. Critics from both parties are questioning Mr. Trump’s apparent choice of Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, as secretary of state, particularly because of his longstanding business connections with Russia and his close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin, whom he has known for two decades. Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday night that he would make a formal announcement on the job on Tuesday morning. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, both Republicans, have expressed concern about the reports of cyberattacks, as have numerous Democrats. But Mr. Rubio, in an apparent reference to Mr. Tillerson, went a step further on Monday, writing on Twitter, “Being a ‘friend of Vladimir’ is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState. ” Mr. McConnell said the Senate investigation would be led by Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will add a subcommittee to look into cyberattacks, led by Mr. Graham. “The first thing we want to establish is, ‘Did the Russians hack into our political system? ’” Mr. Graham said in an interview on Monday. “Then you work outward from there. I have a high degree of confidence Russia did this. ” Mr. Nunes, a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team, said in a statement that the Intelligence Committee had been “conducting vigorous oversight of the investigations into   cyberattacks. ” Mr. Nunes also noted that his committee would be scrutinizing the review of the Russian effort to influence the election ordered last week by President Obama. Democrats have used the latest intelligence findings to renew their calls for an urgent inquiry. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, demanded on Monday that all information about Russia’s meddling be declassified, and that the Obama administration explain what it knows about the hacking and when it knew it. “We now know that the C. I. A. has determined Russia’s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,” Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. “This should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. ” Three Senate Democrats  —   Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont  —   called on Monday for the creation of an independent, nonpartisan commission to comprehensively investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of calling for a special select committee, saying that the Senate Intelligence Committee was “more than capable of conducting a complete review” of the matter. While he stopped short of saying whether he agreed that Russia had interfered in the election in support of Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell said, “We need to approach all these on the assumption the Russians do not wish us well. ” Mr. McCain was less equivocal, saying Monday that there was “no doubt about the hacking” by Russian intelligence services. He called the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and related accounts “another form of warfare” in an appearance on “CBS This Morning” with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader. And one week before the Electoral College meets to ratify Mr. Trump’s election victory, 10 electors have demanded their own intelligence briefing on Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump. For his part, Mr. Trump was dismissive of the intelligence findings and suggested that Democrats were simply stirring controversy. “Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the   card. It would be called conspiracy theory!” Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that the administration would support a congressional review. He also rejected the notion that the administration had failed to adequately highlight the Russian efforts before the election, saying it had extensively briefed Congress all year about Russian electoral meddling. “There has been intensive cooperation between the intelligence community and other national security agencies, and members of Congress in both parties, both before and after the election,” Mr. Earnest said. “The briefings have been provided in a variety of settings, both classified and unclassified. ” Even beyond the conclusions of the intelligence community, Mr. Trump’s campaign had widely known and extensive ties to the Russian government. A campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had worked for the   government in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, had consulted for a   media group, Mr. Earnest noted. Mr. Earnest said that Congress had a “special responsibility” to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, because those connections were widely known before the election. He added that, for Capitol Hill Republicans, how to “reconcile their political strategy and their patriotism is something they’re going to have to explain. ”",1
25928,Manning: Sabotage of Trump Agenda by Bureaucrats Should Spark ’10 to 20 Percent Reduction of Federal Workforce’ - Breitbart,"Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning wants Congress to help President Trump get rid of “rogue bureaucrats [who] are not serving the American people” by “cutting the personnel budgets of   civilian departments and agencies, reducing the enacted   equivalent number for each department, agency and office by 10 to 20 percent reduction in the workforce on a       basis,” according to a statement released on Friday. [“By now it should be abundantly clear to the Trump administration that there are Obama administration holdovers in the 1. 3 million   civilian federal workforce who have no other intention than to politically damage the White House,” Manning said.  Breitbart News has reported extensively on many ways federal bureaucrats who oppose President Trump’s policies are sabotaging his agenda. “That sabotage comes in several forms, from secretly circulating emails among fellow ideologically committed members of the federal bureaucracy plotting strategy, to working behind the scenes with Democratic legislators to create     bureaucratic actions, to leaking confidential documents to the press,” as Breitbart News reported earlier this month. A number of federal bureaucrats are expanding the means by which they are resisting the policies of President Trump. On Tuesday, FederalNewsRadio. com in Washington, D. C. part of the Hubbard Radio empire owned by Minnesota billionaire Stanley Hubbard, reported that “Twitter [has become] an outlet of resistance [to the Trump agenda and] information for federal employees. ” When a former employee of Badlands National Park took over the park’s official Twitter account to tweet climate change facts in direct defiance of the Trump administration, they couldn’t have known that they were starting a movement. Almost one month later, more than 80 accounts claiming to represent various federal organizations and employees, many of them national parks, exist in opposition to the Trump administration and its policies. “The goals and methods of these accounts vary widely. Some stick to spreading scientific facts and research performed by their agencies, especially regarding climate change,” David Thornton, FederalNewsRadio. com’s digital editor reported. “Others, lacking specific actions or nominees to oppose, share memes and ridicule the President, his staff and lawmakers to maintain engagement,” Thornton notes: And some, like Alt Immigration, [using this Twitter address: ””>reported earlier this week, the Acting Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] at the Department of Homeland Security, Lori Scialabba, made waves earlier this month when she released an internal memo countermanding President Trump’s executive order temporarily blocking the issuance of visas to citizens of seven Middle Eastern countries and temporarily banning the arrival of refugees. Scialabba released her internal memo one day before Federal District Judge James Robert issued a temporary restraining order halting President Trump’s executive order. “Sources tell Breitbart News that the Department of Homeland Security, and in particular U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] is a hotbed of career open borders ideologues, many of whom intend to directly and indirectly subvert President Trump’s agenda,” as Breitbart News reported: “If you go down the list of current management at USCIS, probably 80 percent are     ideologues,” a source, who has worked at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a decade and supports President Trump’s agenda, tells Breitbart News. “USCIS probably has the most violent   people in the United States. These are in the management. These do not believe in borders. I know them personally,” the source says. “The whole reason the District of Columbia was created without voting rights or representation was so that those who work for the federal government would not wield political power. They are supposed to be neutral. Working for the government is a privilege, not a right, and it’s time that President Trump remind them by removing Obama administration hires, particularly if there is no other way to root out subversive employees,” Manning said in his statement: Part of the problem is former President Obama changed civil service rules to make it easier to hire federal employees. Trump has solved that by initiating his hiring freeze. But federal rules also make it extremely difficult to fire civil servants. It is a process that can take up to two years, even when there is cause. That said, problem employees who, say, don’t show up for work should be dealt with through this process immediately. In addition to “reducing the enacted   equivalent number for each department, agency and office by 10 to 20 percent reduction in the workforce,” Manning wants Congress to take two additional steps: “Taken together, a comprehensive civil service reform can only possibly be accomplished in the context of the upcoming continuing resolution and budget process, by simply not appropriating monies for the same number of   equivalent employees as last year, and defunding preferences for rehiring previously laid off personnel. Not only can’t Trump do it alone, Congress should step up to the plate exercising their Article I powers and rein in this rogue administrative state,” Manning concluded in his statement.",1
25930,"Joe Paterno Knew of Sandusky Abuse in 1976, According to Court Testimony - The New York Times","A graphic description of sexual abuse from 1976 detailed in court documents released Tuesday cast new doubt on assertions by Joe Paterno, the former Penn State football coach, that he did not know until 2001 that his former assistant Jerry Sandusky had abused minors. The testimony, which was revealed in the course of a lawsuit between Penn State and one of its insurers over nearly $100 million in settlements the university reached with 32 of Mr. Sandusky’s victims, implied that Mr. Paterno knew about child sexual abuse by Mr. Sandusky years earlier but did nothing about it, allowing Mr. Sandusky to continue to abuse dozens of boys for decades. Mr. Sandusky’s serial sexual abuse became public in 2011. Mr. Paterno said in sworn testimony that year that he first heard of accusations about Mr. Sandusky in 2001. A   university report later concluded that Mr. Paterno, who died of cancer in 2012, had been made aware of complaints against Mr. Sandusky, a longtime Penn State assistant coach, as early as 1998. The distinction is potentially worth millions of dollars to Penn State. The insurer, Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association Insurance, is hoping the documents released Tuesday will show that Penn State should have informed it of Mr. Sandusky’s abuse as early as 1976, and thus allow the company to avoid reimbursing the university for tens of millions of dollars in settlements. The company contends that had it known about the episode, as well as others in the late 1980s, it would have declined to insure the university against sexual abuse lawsuits. Mr. Sandusky, 72, is serving 30 to 60 years in prison. In the deposition from 2014 released Tuesday morning, a man called John Doe 150 in the documents testified that Mr. Sandusky touched him inappropriately in a shower room in 1976, when he was 14 and attending a football camp. The accuser said that he cried out when Mr. Sandusky penetrated him with a finger, a cry loud enough for other campers to hear, and that he later reported Mr. Sandusky’s inappropriate behavior to adults at the camp. The next day, the accuser said, he sought out Mr. Paterno and described the encounter in the hallway of a football office building as Mr. Paterno was on his way to a meeting. “Is it accurate that Coach Paterno quickly said to you, I don’t want to hear about any of that kind of stuff, I have a football season to worry about?” a lawyer for the insurer asked the accuser, according to the deposition. “Specifically, yes,” the man replied. Mr. Paterno then walked away, the man said. The documents released Tuesday showed that Gary C. Schultz, a former university vice president, and Timothy Curley, a former athletic director, both of whom the report said knew about a 1998 allegation, cited the Fifth Amendment’s protection against   when asked questions about the scandal in 2015. The documents also said that Mike McQueary, an assistant coach who said he witnessed Mr. Sandusky molesting a boy in 2001 and subsequently told Mr. Paterno about it, had testified that he had also informed another Penn State assistant at the time, Tom Bradley, who in turn told Mr. McQueary that a previous assistant, Greg Schiano, had been aware of similar allegations in the 1990s. Mr. Bradley is currently U. C. L. A.’s defensive coordinator Mr. Schiano, later a head coach at Rutgers and for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is now the defensive coordinator at Ohio State. A lawyer for Mr. Bradley denied Mr. McQueary’s assertions, saying he had become aware of the allegations only in 2001. Mr. Schiano responded on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, writing, “I never saw any abuse, nor had reason to suspect any abuse, during my time at Penn State. ” In a statement Tuesday morning, a Paterno family spokesman continued the family’s defense of the coach. “The materials released today relating to Joe Paterno allege a conversation that occurred decades ago where all parties except the accuser are now dead,” the family said. “In addition, there are numerous specific elements of the accusations that defy all logic and have never been subjected to even the most basic objective examination. Most significantly, there is extensive evidence that stands in stark contrast to this claim. ” The university’s settlement with this accuser, the Paterno family spokesman added, “does not remotely validate the assertions about an uncorroborated conversation with Joe Paterno. ” Penn State’s president, Eric Barron, also released a statement Tuesday. “Although settlements have been reached,” he said, “it also is important to reiterate that the alleged knowledge of former Penn State employees is not proved, and should not be treated as such. Some individuals deny the claims, and others are unable to defend themselves. ” Tom Kline, a lawyer who represented a victim of Mr. Sandusky’s who has arrived at a settlement with the university, said in an interview that the depositions appeared convincing. “We now no longer have conjecture on some of the issues that relate to Joe Paterno,” he said, noting that the accusers were testifying as third parties. Most settlements took place before these depositions those who had already settled, Mr. Kline said, would have had no interest in lying. In May, Judge Gary Glazer of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas ruled that while the insurer was responsible for settlements regarding events that occurred before 1992, it might not be for episodes of abuse that occurred after that date. While the documents released Tuesday could have significant repercussions in the lawsuit, it is unlikely they will affect Penn State’s   football program. Mr. Paterno is dead. Mr. Sandusky is in prison. The penalties Penn State agreed to as part of a settlement with the N. C. A. A.  —   including bowl bans, scholarship restrictions and a $60 million fine  —   have been carried out, and the N. C. A. A. was seen to lose credibility when it was revealed that it might have essentially bluffed its way into those penalties. After being rebuilt under Coach Bill O’Brien, the Nittany Lions are entering their third season under the highly regarded coach James Franklin. The team’s most immediate obstacles are not court documents but Ohio State, Michigan State and Michigan. Mr. Paterno ended his career after 46 seasons as Penn State’s head coach as the   football coach with the most wins, a distinction regained last year when the N. C. A. A. restored 111 wins it had vacated as part of the settlement. Mr. Kline noted that the information that became public in May and was sketched in fuller color Tuesday might never have seen the light of day had Penn State not elected to sue its insurer in 2013 over reimbursement. Calling the information dump “foreseeable,” Mr. Kline said of Penn State, “They would have weighed this consequence versus getting’’ paid tens of millions of dollars. He added, “Penn State doesn’t have the same interest as the Paterno family. ”",1
25932,Pope Francis Apologizes for Catholic Church’s Role in 1994 Rwanda Genocide,"This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics. com,  Pope Francis meets Rwanda’s president Paul Kagame on Monday (CNA) In 1994, there were two major ethnic groups in Rwanda: the Hutus and the Tutsis. They had lived together for decades, had intermarried, had their kids play games with each other and so forth. The iconic genocidal war between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi in 1994 was the culmination of centuries of generational crisis wars between the two tribes, where the Tutsis were the herders who controlled the land, and the Hutus were the farmers who worked for the Tutsis. On April 6, a plane crash killed Juvenal Habyarimana, the president of Rwanda, a Hutu, when the plane was shot down by an unknown assailant. Next, a Hutu leader announced over the radio, “Cut down the tall trees,” referring to the Tutsis, who were generally taller than Hutus. The radio announcement, which was heard all over the country, was some sort of prearranged signal. On cue, each Hutu did something like the following: Picked up a machete, went to the Tutsi home next door, or down the street, murdered and dismembered the man and children, raped the wife and then murdered and dismembered her. Close to a million Tutsis were tortured, raped and murdered in a three month period. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this is the purest modern example of an “organic” or “indigenous” genocide, as opposed to a   genocide such as is occurring today in Syria. And in Rwanda, it made no difference that almost everyone is Christian, mostly Catholic. All humans, of whatever religion, have the same DNA. Since 1994, relations between Rwanda and the Vatican have been stormy, with the Tutsis accusing the Church of being close to the Hutus, and for having participated in the massacres. Although some Hutu clergy members helped the Tutsis, in other cases, Hutu clergy were perpetrators. In some cases, the Hutu clergy ushered Tutsis into church buildings, promising them security, and then allowed them to be slaughtered. On Monday, Pope Francis met at the Vatican with Rwanda’s president Paul Kagame, and issued a statement apologizing on behalf of the Catholic Church for the Church’s involvement in the 1994 Rwanda genocide: In this context, the Pope conveyed his profound sadness, and that of the Holy See and of the Church, for the genocide against the Tutsi. He expressed his solidarity with the victims and with those who continue to suffer the consequences of those tragic events and   …     he implored anew God’s forgiveness for the sins and failings of the Church and its members, among whom priests, and religious men and women who succumbed to hatred and violence, betraying their own evangelical mission. In light of the recent Holy Year of Mercy and of the Statement published by the Rwandan Bishops at its conclusion, the Pope also expressed the desire that this humble recognition of the failings of that period, which, unfortunately, disfigured the face of the Church, may contribute to a “purification of memory” and may promote, in hope and renewed trust, a future of peace, witnessing to the concrete possibility of living and working together, once the dignity of the human person and the common good are put at the centre. Pope Francis referred to a statement published by the Rwandan Bishops on November 20, 2016: We apologize for all the wrongs the Church committed. We apologize on behalf of all Christians for all forms of wrongs we committed. We regret that church members violated (their) oath of allegiance to God’s commandments  …     Forgive us for the crime of hate in the country to the extent of also hating our colleagues because of their ethnicity. We didn’t show that we are one family but instead killed each other. While the Bishops’ statement was welcomed last November, the government of Rwanda issued a stinging rebuke: This step is welcome, as individual expressions of remorse. However, its profound inadequacy only serves to highlight how far the Catholic Church still remains from a full and honest reckoning with its moral and legal responsibilities. First, as they apologize on behalf of a few unnamed individuals, the bishops appear to take the extraordinary step of exonerating the Catholic Church as a whole for any culpability in connection with the Genocide. Everything in the historical record contradicts this divisive claim  …     Finally, given the scale of the crimes, there is ample justification for an apology from the Vatican, as has occurred repeatedly with other cases of lesser magnitude. This rebuke led to the Pope’s apology on Monday. Vatican Press Release and Catholic News Agency (  ) and Govt of Rwanda (  ) Related Articles, It is to the credit of the Catholic Church that the Pope is willing to apologize for its part in the Rwanda genocide, even if it take over 20 years for the apology to occur. However, the Rwanda genocide should remind us that what Generational Dynamics tells us is true: That when it comes to genocide, every ethnic group, every religious group, every geographic group, is the same as every other. Indeed, if some religious or ethnic group refused to commit genocide, then in a matter of one or two centuries they would be exterminated by another group that was not so fastidious. Whether a particular demographic group is involved in or inclined to genocide or ethnic cleansing or atrocities depends on which generational era it is in. A group in a generational Awakening era, like America in the 1960s, would be very reluctant to commit atrocities because the atrocities from the previous generational crisis war would still be well remembered by its survivors. But as a group goes deeper into a generational Crisis era, as the survivors of the previous crisis war die off, as do the memories of the atrocities that occurred during that war, then the population is more willing to commit atrocities, ethnic cleansing and genocide. People of the Muslim faith are most closely identified with atrocities in the current era, which is not surprising since almost every atrocity in the news these days is almost always perpetrated by some Sunni Muslim jihadist group. However, it is worth pointing out that of the 1. 6 billion Muslims in the world, there is only a very small number, probably in the thousands or tens of thousands, that support the   and ISIS atrocities. From the point of view of generational theory, this situation is attributable to the fact most Sunni Muslim countries are deep into a generation Crisis era, much more so than the Christian nations. The reason is that their last crisis war for many Sunni Muslim nations was not World War II, but was World War I, including the destruction of the Ottoman Empire. This means that there are absolutely no Sunni Muslim survivors remaining who remember the horrors and atrocities of WWI, and the younger generations have no fear of repeating them. People who say that there is a war by Muslims against Christians are completely missing the point. It is true that jihadist groups sometimes target Christians, but these are almost always little more than gruesome publicity stunts. The number of Christians being killed by Muslims is minuscule compared to the number of Muslims being killed by Muslims. Jihadist groups linked to   or to the   Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh) are overwhelmingly targeting other Muslims, and rarely Christians. The genocide being perpetrated by Syria’s president Bashar   serves as an example to distinguish between   atrocities, for which   is responsible, and “organic” atrocities, such as those committed by ISIS fighters or the Hutus in Rwanda. As I’ve been reporting many times over the last couple of years,  ’s army is supporting him only   with massive numbers of desertions.   himself said in 2015 that his army was near defeat, but was saved by the Russians. Syria is not in a generational Crisis era. It is in a generational Awakening era, and the public supports the war   just as the American public   supported the Vietnam war in the 1960s. From the point of view of generational theory, it is rare for a genocide or ethnic cleansing to be purely organic or   but in an Awakening era, it is going to be almost completely   while in a Crisis era, it will be “organic,” whether or not it is government led. In an Awakening era, the atrocities are often perpetrated by a leader who refused to lead office, such as we are seeing in Syria, Burundi, and Zimbabwe. Two modern special cases are worth mentioning. In the Central African Republic (CAR) there are atrocities being committed on both sides, by both Muslims and Christians. CAR’s last crisis war climaxed in 1932, so the country is well into a generational Crisis era, and that affects both the Christian and Muslim population. The other special case is occurring in Myanmar (Burma) in the early stages of a generational Crisis era, where Buddhists, led by Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu and his “969 movement,” are conducting atrocities targeting the Rohingya Muslims, including rapes, torture and other atrocities committed by Buddhists, targeting the Rohingyas. The Rohingyas have a darker skin than Burmese, and they speak a Bengali dialect. The actions by the Buddhists were similar to the actions by the Nazis against the Jews. So it’s good that the Catholic Church has apologized for its participation in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, although it took over 20 years for the apology to be forthcoming. Perhaps in another 20 years, some Muslim clerics will apologize for the atrocities being committed today in the name of Islam.

25935,Hillary Wins Popular Vote; Trump Will Be the Next President,"Email 
Following one of the most contentious presidential elections in recent memory, Hillary Clinton won more popular votes than Donald Trump in the nationwide election — while losing to Trump in the Electoral College vote. As of Wednesday morning (when this is being written), incomplete returns showed Clinton leading Trump by 165,292 popular votes — 59,344,158 to 59,178,867. But since the Constitution still reigns, members of the Electoral College are expected to meet next month and elect Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. 
Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution states: Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress…. 
That means that 100 electors (representing two senators from each of the 50 states) plus 435 electors (representing the 435 members of the House of Representatives) plus three electors granted to the District of Columbia (a total of 538 electors) will actually elect the next president of the United States, not the voters themselves. Those electors are going to give Trump at least 289 votes, more than the 270 needed to elect him as president. 
If Hillary had her way she would be president instead. As far back as the year 2000, in her first public appearance as New York’s junior senator-elect, she said: “I believe strongly that in a democracy [sic], we should respect the will of the people, and to me that means it’s time to do away with the Electoral College and move to the popular election of our president.” 
Which is precisely why the Founders of the Republic did everything they could think of to keep the newborn republic from being transformed by power seekers such as Clinton into a democracy by putting in place such apparent anomalies as the Electoral College. 
Writing in The New American , constitutional lawyer Joe Wolverton explained one of the reasons why. In an article just before the national elections in 2012, he noted: As the situation stands today, a successful candidate is required to build a coalition of electoral support from across the country. The frequent trips to Iowa, New Hampshire, and other less populous states witness this campaign reality. To be elected, a candidate cannot simply woo voters in urban areas while ignoring those citizens living between the two coastal megalopolises. Should [a] National Popular Vote measure become the de facto law of the land, a candidate could simply spend time, money, and attention on the large cities in order to ensure garnering a plurality of votes on Election Day. 
John Ryder, then a member of the Republican National Committee, expanded: “Under such an arrangement, presidential candidates would have no incentive to campaign anywhere except the major media markets in a few states. The country would, in essence, cede our presidential elections to the largest metropolitan areas, whose concerns are different from those of other areas of the country.” 
The Founders knew from history the dangers of letting a majority override the interests and rights of a minority — that that majority would eventually become tyrannical, inimical to the minority’s rights. Constitutional scholar Dan Smoot explained: From their vast knowledge of history, the American Founding Fathers knew that unlimited political power cannot safely be trusted to anyone — not to appointed officials of government, not to elected representatives of the people, not to the people themselves. Hence, they devised a system to control political power by dispersing it and balancing it so that too much power could not be concentrated in any one place. 
By requiring the states to nominate its own electors, those smaller states would have a larger voice in the national election, as James Madison noted in The Federalist Papers : “It may well be that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people , will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves.” (Emphasis added.) 
Madison continued: The immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president] and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choices. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to so complicated an investigation. 
Pulitzer-Prize winner and conservative commentator George Will saw clearly what the Founders were trying to accomplish through the Electoral College’s interposition between the people and those running for the presidency, noting: The core principle of our republicanism is representation: The people do not decide things[;] they decide who will decide. Representatives are supposed to deliberate about the national interest, not just broker demands registered from various factions. 
There were other reasons as well. Gouvenour Morris, a Founding Father who represented Pennsylvania during the Constitutional Convention in 1787, explained that there were fears of “intrigue” if the president were chosen by a small group of men who met clandestinely, as well as concerns over his independence from the Legislative branch if he was elected by the Congress. 
Fisher Ames, a member of the first three Congresses, was blunt: The Electoral College was designed to protect the citizenry against the dangers and ravages of a runaway democracy: “Popular reason does not always know how to act right, nor does it always act right when it knows.” He added that “every move … towards a more complete, unmixed democracy is an advance towards destruction; it is treading where the ground is treacherous and excavated for an explosion. Liberty has never yet lasted long in a democracy; nor has it ever ended in anything better than despotism.” 
A scant 165,292 votes cast on Tuesday, without the Electoral College in place, would have elected one skilled in the ways of treachery, despotism, and destruction.

25937,Charts Indicate Now May Be an Excellent Entry Point For Silver,"Charts Indicate Now May Be an Excellent Entry Point For Silver Posted on Tweet Home » Silver » Silver News » Charts Indicate Now May Be an Excellent Entry Point For Silver Calling an end to the correction in silver is tricky, but technical analyst Clive Maund sees an intermediate base forming for silver stocks, a “classic buy spot.” Submitted by Streetwise : 
Although at first glance it’s a tricky call, because superficially a bear flag appears to be completing in silver, on closer inspection it now looks like silver’s correction is done and an intermediate base pattern is completing . If so, we are at an excellent entry point for many silver stocks, which have been savagely beaten down over the past several months—a necessary correction following their outsized run-up earlier in the year. 
On its one-year chart we can see that silver’s corrective action from early July has brought it all the way back to its steadily rising 200-day moving average, a classic buy spot, where a potential intermediate base has formed. This corrective action has more than completely unwound the earlier overbought condition. 
However, there are grounds for concern on two counts. One is that the steep drop early in October broke the price below the uptrend line shown, and the other is that the pattern that has since formed looks very much like a bear flag at first glance. If it is, another sharp drop will follow soon. 
Thus, it is interesting to observe that the volume pattern is not consistent with this being a bear flag. Instead, it is consistent with this being an intermediate base pattern. To properly examine the volume pattern in this sideways formation, we need to refer to a three-month chart, which opens it out sufficiently to see what is going on in detail.

On the three-month chart, we can see in detail the tight pattern that has developed following the sharp drop early in October. It looks like a bear flag until you look at the volume. Instead of a volume pattern consistent with a bear flag, which would feature greater downside volume days than upside volume, and a steady trend to lighter volume, we have the exact opposite over the past couple of weeks—greater upside volume days and a trend of increasing volume. To steal a term from Infowars or Zero Hedge, this suggests a “false flag” that will lead to an upside breakout. 
On silver’s seven-year chart we can see the 2011–2015 bear market in its entirety, and how breakout from the major downtrend channel led to a not-particularly impressive rally up to important resistance, where the advance stalled out and reaction set in. The relative feebleness of the rally following the breakout from the downtrend is not a cause for concern, as in the early stages of a bull market gold tends to outperform silver—and it certainly didn’t bother silver stocks any. Silver’s next major upleg should take it above this resistance, albeit perhaps after something of a battle, and then on toward the next important resistance level in the $26–27 zone. 
Although silver’s long-term, 20-year chart presents a more messy picture than gold’s 20-year chart, it does also show that the 2011 bear market may be viewed as a big correction to the major bull market advance from late 2001, as is the case with gold. Unlike gold’s corrective bear market, which stopped at a major support level related to an extensive period of trading in 2008–2009, silver dropped down through its corresponding support level on its corrective bear market, and found support at a lower level related to an extensive period of trading in 2006–2007. All of this does mean that, so far, silver has been underperforming gold.

25938,How to Become a C.E.O.? The Quickest Path Is a Winding One - The New York Times,"How does a person get to be the boss? What does it take for an ambitious young person starting a career to reach upper rungs of the corporate world  —   the C. E. O. ’s office, or other jobs that come with words like “chief” or “vice president” on the office door? The answer has always included hard work, brains, leadership ability and luck. But in the 21st century, another, less understood attribute seems to be particularly important. To get a job as a top executive, new evidence shows, it helps greatly to have experience in as many of a business’s functional areas as possible. A person who burrows down for years in, say, the finance department stands less of a chance of reaching a top executive job than a corporate finance specialist who has also spent time in, say, marketing. Or engineering. Or both of those, plus others. However, there is still such a thing as too much variety: Switching industries has a negative correlation with corporate success, which may speak to the importance of building relationships and experience within an industry. Switching between companies within an industry neither helps nor hurts in making it to a top job. These are some of the big findings in a new study of 459, 000 onetime management consultants by the social network LinkedIn. Experience in one additional functional area improved a person’s odds of becoming a senior executive as much as three years of extra experience. And working in four different functions had nearly the same impact as getting an M. B. A. from a   program. This interactive graphic shows how different traits affected a former consultant’s likelihood of ending up as a top executive of a midsize or large company. Similarly, Burning Glass, a firm that scours millions of job listings to detect labor market trends, has found a surge in demand for what it calls hybrid jobs, incorporating expertise in, for example, both technology and finance. And researchers have found that M. B. A. holders with a variety of experiences get more offers and higher bonuses from investment banks than those with narrower experience. While some of this might sound intuitive, and top executives have always needed to have grounding in a range of specialties, huge collections of data about individuals have only recently made it possible to analyze in such detail what traits and experiences seem to predict success in the job market. In effect, the increased ability to collect and analyze such troves of data raises the possibility that in the future we’ll be able to better understand what types of education the workers of the future most need, how companies can best recruit future star performers and how individuals can position themselves to benefit from shifts in what skills the modern economy most rewards. There is a lot of work to be done to get to that point. But this early evidence suggests that success in the business world isn’t just about brainpower or climbing a linear path to the top, but about accumulating diverse skills and showing an ability to learn about fields outside one’s comfort zone. “Work used to be much more hierarchical, and in many instances rote,” said Gary Pinkus, McKinsey  Company’s managing partner for North America. “You could build a nice career within any particular function by taking on more responsibility within that specialty. But if you look at most companies now, work has become incredibly  . ” Once upon a time, Mr. Pinkus said, an operations manager might be   on making a factory work efficiently. Now to be great at that job  —   and earn a promotion to vice president or beyond  —   that manager had better also understand how the factory’s inventory procedures tie in with the company’s sales and marketing strategy, and any tax laws affecting inventory management, while assuring the reliability of the supply chain. The manager had better also be adept at using the technology that links all that information together. Marc Andreessen, the prominent venture capitalist, has gone so far as to call this the “secret formula to becoming a C. E. O. ” The most successful corporate leaders, he wrote, “are almost never the best product visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best finance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25 percent in some set of those skills, and then all of a sudden they’re qualified to actually run something important. ” George Kurian was a young engineer at Oracle in the early 1990s, helping build database software. Then a manager pushed him to break out of his software engineering silo and see what it was like to deal with potential customers. That’s when things got interesting. “I had built a set of technologies I thought were groundbreaking,” he recalled recently. “I went into this meeting expecting I was going to bring my engineering skills and wow this customer with our amazing technology. She asked, ‘Who built this piece of software?’ and I said, ‘Yes, that was me.’ ” Her next comment, though, wasn’t what Mr. Kurian expected at all. “She said, ‘You have no idea what my day looks like,’ ” Mr. Kurian recalled. The software didn’t solve the problems the customer actually had. The valuable lesson for the young engineer? Work that seems impressive on an engineering level isn’t always what will most satisfy paying clients. As a product manager, Mr. Kurian added sales and marketing and team management to his engineering background. He later did a stint as a strategy consultant, which he recalls as a crash course in quickly synthesizing information about unfamiliar situations. He considers the combination of all of these areas a key to his path to becoming chief executive of NetApp, a data storage company with a $10 billion market value. He represents one common way to collect experience across functions: Within a larger company, pursue opportunities that are adjacent to, yet different from, existing expertise. “People tend to think of their career as a linear progression,” he said. “I think having a nonlinear career progression helped me. ” The LinkedIn data doesn’t address causality. Did Mr. Kurian advance to a C. E. O. job because he gained experience across different functions, or did the traits that led him to take on a variety of assignments in his career also lead to his being an attractive candidate for top jobs? And the former consultants who created detailed LinkedIn profiles may be different in some systematic way from those who did not, which would distort the results. Beyond the results on job functions, the data from LinkedIn shows some trends for which the explanations aren’t completely obvious. For example, former consultants who lived in New York or Los Angeles had higher odds of ending up with a top job than people in other large cities like Washington or Houston. A former management consultant with 15 years of work experience in six different functions and an M. B. A. from a top school had a 66 percent chance of becoming a top executive if he lived in New York compared with a 38 percent chance in Washington. But regardless of how exactly the cause and effect works and how the consultants analyzed might be different from others who weren’t included in the sample, there is evidence that more top jobs in business require an ability to meld knowledge from different fields. In a 2014 survey of 2, 100 chief financial officers by Robert Half Management Resources, 85 percent said their role had expanded beyond traditional accounting and   work over the preceding three years, most commonly into human resources and information technology. And two business school professors, Jennifer Merluzzi of Tulane and Damon J. Phillips of Columbia, studied hundreds of graduates of an elite M. B. A. program who went into investment banking. The people who were specialists  —   who had focused only on banking in the past  —   received fewer offers and lower starting bonuses than those who had worked across various specialties. Burning Glass found a 53 percent rise in the number of openings for hybrid jobs requiring both technological and business acumen from 2011 to 2015, for jobs like product management and marketing analytics. “The common theme that we see in the jobs that are the   and have the highest value for employers and job seekers is this set of jobs that require a mix of skills that don’t tend to ride together in nature,” said Matthew Sigelman, the chief executive of Burning Glass. There are ways a young person can gain experience across functions that aren’t a matter of taking on different assignments within a big company. Marla Malcolm Beck embodies this other, more entrepreneurial path. Ms. Beck worked in consulting right out of college in the   then studied at Harvard Business School and worked briefly in private equity. But she found the work unfulfilling, and in 1999 started Blue Mercury as an online seller of beauty products. Soon after, as the   boom turned bust, the company pivoted toward physical stores. Ms. Beck built Blue Mercury into a   chain. Macy’s acquired the company for $210 million last year, and she remains its chief executive. In her days as a consultant she had worked on projects like figuring out the pricing of mutual funds and   the claims process for an insurance company. As a retail C. E. O. she essentially trained herself across the various functions it takes to make a retail business work: inventory and supply chain management, information technology systems and everything else. She acted as the company’s chief financial officer even as it grew, entrusting routine accounting to a controller but doing the strategic work of forecasting and financial modeling herself. Some fields have come easier to her than others. “I think I’m almost too logical for some of the emotion around marketing,” she said. Her approach has been to break down each of these new areas in which she had to immerse herself as a   founder the way she once did in unfamiliar fields as a consultant. “What I really learned from those experiences was how to break down even the most complicated processes into their most minuscule components,” she said. “It’s an approach that you can use to tackle any process in any organization. ” In hiring at Blue Mercury’s corporate headquarters in Washington, she has focused less on traditional retail industry experience and more on people who have a comfort with engineering processes, skills they can apply to whatever urgent task arises. In other words, she didn’t become chief executive by getting loads of experience across functions. Rather, she took some core analytical skills and used them to learn to develop experience in those functions as she went. There are some parallels with programs that the biggest companies have long operated to deliberately rotate promising young executives across different divisions, to ensure that as they hit midcareer they have broad experience. The challenge can be to replicate that kind of experience even in a world where few people sign on with a single large employer for decades. To be a C. E. O. or other top executive, said Guy Berger, an economist at LinkedIn, “you need to understand how the different parts of a company work and how they interact with each other and understand how other people do their job, even if it’s something you don’t know well enough to do yourself. ” Kai Monahan embodies a third pathway through different specialties into top executive jobs. He didn’t start his own company, like Ms. Beck, or gradually add different layers of experience that were adjacent to his previous job, like Mr. Kurian. Rather, at some key junctures he jumped headlong into an entirely new function. In 1999, he left the (now defunct) accounting and consulting firm Arthur Andersen, where he had worked on projects to transform businesses, for Ernst  Young, where he focused on risk management, a less sexy field that became more in demand after the accounting scandals at Enron and others starting in 2001. In 2008, he joined Nationwide Insurance as its chief audit executive, before quickly moving out of the back office and into selling financial products to consumers in an operational role. He became president of Nationwide’s mortgage business in 2014. It helped that he had an early mentor who encouraged him to take risks in his career by taking on jobs he was unfamiliar with  —   and bosses willing to take a chance on assigning him jobs he wasn’t qualified for on paper. After all, if you assign, say, an accounting specialist to run a logistics operation, there’s a chance that person will fail. What’s best for the employee who wants to get broad experience to help climb the ranks may not be what is best for the employer who wants deeply experienced people in every job. “There’s comfort in familiarity,” Mr. Monahan said. “Leaders can be reluctant to hire someone who doesn’t have directly applicable experience. That’s still a   that is fairly prevalent. ” But how does one navigate into sharply different functional specialties while also dealing with new colleagues and a new organizational culture? “If you’re in your comfort zone, it’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone,” said Paul McDonald, a senior executive director at the recruitment firm Robert Half International. “What was critical for me in going into new functional areas was breaking that habit of feeling like you have to know it all,” Mr. Monahan said. “When you’re honest with yourself and with others in terms of your need for their support and involvement, generally people are willing to share with you what they know and help you be successful. ” In other words, the path to the executive suite may be long and winding, and include stops in many different types of specialties. But the key to navigating it is being able to learn from others all along the way.",1
25942,Big Government Republicans Rebuke Trump Budget - Breitbart,"Kentucky Republican congressman Hal Rogers, who has spent more than three decades on the House Appropriations Committee, including six years as the chairman, rejected President Donald Trump’s fiscal year 2018 budget as Congress begins consideration of the president’s rearrangement of priorities. [“While we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the President’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,” said Rogers,  one of the   “cardinals,” the nickname for the lawmakers controlling how federal money is spent.  Rogers said he was concerned about cuts to programs in Kentucky. “In particular, the Appalachian Regional Commission has a   history of bipartisan support in Congress because of its proven ability to help reduce poverty rates and extend basic necessities to communities across the Appalachian region,” he said. “Today, nearly everyone in the region has access to clean water and sewer, the workforce is diversifying, educational opportunities are improving, and rural technology is finally advancing to 21st Century standards. “We will certainly review this budget proposal, but Congress ultimately has the power of the purse. As the full budget picture emerges in the coming weeks, I am optimistic that we can work with the Administration to responsibly fund the federal government, including those agencies which serve as vital economic lifelines in rural parts of the country that are still working to overcome substantial challenges. “As the full budget picture emerges in the coming weeks, I am optimistic that we can work with the Administration to responsibly fund the federal government, including those agencies which serve as vital economic lifelines in rural parts of the country that are still working to overcome substantial challenges. ” Another top House Republican and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Mike Conaway, took shots at the president’s cuts to the agriculture programs. “At first blush, I am pleased that the administration is working to restore the strength of our nation’s armed forces to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the equipment that they need to defend our country and our interests around the world,” said Conaway, a Texas Republican who also sits on both the Intelligence and Armed Services Committee. “On the USDA budget, I am concerned that the cuts, while relatively small in the context of the total federal budget, could hamper some vital work of the department,” he said. “I think it is very important to remember that net farm income is down 50 percent from where it stood just four years ago. America’s farmers and ranchers are struggling, and we need to be extremely careful not to exacerbate these conditions. In fact, we need to do all we can to be there to help our farmers and ranchers. The work they do is critical. “I think it is very important to remember that net farm income is down 50 percent from where it stood just four years ago. America’s farmers and ranchers are struggling, and we need to be extremely careful not to exacerbate these conditions. In fact, we need to do all we can to be there to help our farmers and ranchers. ” Another Republican taking on the president’s budget cuts is Sen. Rob Portman ( ). “The Great Lakes are an invaluable resource to Ohio, and The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a successful   partnership that helps protect both our environment and our economy,” Portman said. “The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a critical tool in our efforts to help protect and restore Lake Erie, and when the Obama administration proposed cuts to the program, I helped lead the effort to restore full funding,” he said. “I have long championed this program, and I’m committed to continuing to do everything I can to protect and preserve Lake Erie, including preserving this critical program and its funding. ” When he announced the president’s budget, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, explained that his budget request was based on Trump’s own speeches and campaign promises. “Knowing what you know about the President, you could imagine what that budget would look like before you even see it, which is that there will be more money on defense  —   $54 billion,” Mulvaney said. “There’s more money for enforcing security at the border. There’s more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally. Then, there’s more money for things like private and public school choice,” he said. “Conversely, since the President wanted to do that without adding to the   $488 billion deficit in fiscal year 2018, there were reductions elsewhere to offset dollar for dollar, all of those increases,” he said. Taking the opposite tact was Sen. Bob Corker ( .) the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he was willing to accept cuts to the State Department and other projects under his jurisdiction as long as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is comfortable with the loss of budget funds. “Secretary Tillerson has said he willingly accepts this challenge, and I look forward to sitting down with him soon to discuss this proposal and how he believes he can accomplish his work at these budget levels,” he said. “At the end of the day, while the administration proposes a budget, ultimately it is the role of Congress to dispose it and fund government,” he said. I believe we can strike an appropriate balance that recognizes the critical role of diplomacy in keeping our military out of harm’s way and appropriately advancing our nation’s interests while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used in the most efficient and effective manner. “I believe we can strike an appropriate balance that recognizes the critical role of diplomacy in keeping our military out of harm’s way and appropriately advancing our nation’s interests while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used in the most efficient and effective manner. ”",1
25947,THE END GAME closes in on the Clintons as the deep state turnsâ€Ś massive collection of criminally damning evidence about to be revealed that will bring down the Clinton crime family forever,"
 


by Mike Adams , the Health Ranger


(NaturalNews) My fellow Americans, we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime. As of today, I am now convinced that the deep state has turned on Hillary Clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the Clintons’ reign of terror over America and collapse her bid for the presidency.
The mainstream media, of course, will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal Clinton cartel. As such, they will lie to the public to the bitter end, even as the Clinton Titanic sinks with all of them on board (in deep, frigid waters, no less, with no more lifeboats to be found).
The so-called “deep state” — the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy — has decided Hillary Clinton is too damaged to defend any longer . Even if she were to win by stealing the election, she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survival.
It has now been decided, I believe, that Hillary Clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the NSA and FBI. This will likely happen before the coming weekend. Once that is accomplished, the next goal will be to wait for President Trump to take office, then destroy the U.S. economy through a controlled, global debt collapse so that Trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies. (Remember: The deep state isn’t pro-Trump. They’re still all about defending the establishment. But Hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomach…)
Instead of allowing Hillary Clinton to take power and destroy America from the top, in other words, deep state power brokers have reverted to “Plan B” which is to let Trump take the White House, then destroy America through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy. This is simpler than it sounds. Bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly $20 trillion in national debt isn’t exactly rocket science. All they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates. Monetary gravity will do the rest…
In the mean time, Hillary Clinton and a long list of her co-conspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice , lying under oath, destruction of evidence, conspiracy, corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for many.
The criminal racket of the Clintons is about to implode. The participants will be charged under the RICO Act for “racketeering” activities, for which ample evidence already exists.
A new video from Steve Pieczenik describes some of this In this video, intelligence insider Steve Pieczenik lays out how high-level intelligence insiders are now working in concert to “reverse the Clinton coup” that’s attempting to take over America and destroy it from within.
Even if you don’t believe Pieczenik — and I fully realize he’s controversial in his own way — this short video is a very important “must watch” explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing… “we’ve initiated a counter-coup…”
 
The Clintons are going to go “full murder” in a last ditch, desperate effort to save themselves Beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days. Like a cornered wild animal, the Clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going “full murder” in an attempt to save themselves.
I will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week. Watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes, swimming pool accidents or “natural” deaths involving people like James Comey, who’d better have armed security personnel around him at all times.
Look for desperate measures such as the Clintons attempting to blackmail Obama, Comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins. We might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days, although that’s increasingly unlikely since it seems the Clintons are now on their own (they would need the assistance of Obama to pull off another Sandy Hook, you see).
A deal has already been struck with Obama Most likely, deep state operatives have already struck a deal with Obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as Hillary Clinton’s head is served up on a platter. This likely explains why Obama is now publicly saying he trusts Comey (and refuses to go to bat for Hillary). There’s no love lost between Obama and the Clintons (remember 2008?).
As all this is going down, the propaganda ministry of the Clinton regime — CNN, NYT, Washington Post, etc. — is going to explode into an all-out “bat-s##t crazy” conspiracy theory phase where they blame the Russians, extraterrestrials, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster for everything that’s imploding around the Clintons. Mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke. Maybe crop circles were created by the Russians as a secret code to Wikileaks and Donald Trump, eh?
Meanwhile, conspiratorial operatives like George Stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition , so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put Hillary in the White House via any means at their disposal, including totally faking negative news against Donald Trump (which is, of course, the entire news mission of CNN at this point, a disgraced propaganda network run by anti-American traitors).
If the vote is stolen for Hillary Clinton, all hell breaks loose Should the globalist Soros operators manage to steal the vote, bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place Hillary Clinton in the White House, all Hell breaks loose across America :
â€˘ The FBI goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the Clinton criminal regime.
â€˘ Donald Trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome, dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud, the rigging of voting machines, the attempted bribery of Electoral voters and so on.
â€˘ The U.S. military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose Clinton and restore democracy. This one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated… (and yes, YOU will beg for a short-term military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose Clinton and restore open, fair and free elections).
â€˘ Armed U.S. citizens prepare for a massive march on Washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite don’t get away with corruption, fraud and murder. Expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds.
â€˘ The NSA likely goes into “full dump” mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against Hillary Clinton. This will likely be joined by CIA assets who already have the goods on the Clintons and their “Lolita Express” pedo joy rides.
â€˘ Wikileaks, Anonymous and every former NSA analyst goes into “destroy the Clintons” mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the Clintons and anyone close to them. Anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help. (I expect Kim Dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well, as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward Hillary Clinton… as do we all, come to think of it.)
â€˘ The establishment Republicans in the U.S. Congress will, as usual, meekly surrender to the democrats, pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because that’s what they do best when the going gets tough. Totally useless politicrats like John McCain can’t get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something. These useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of Washington as the revolution unfolds, replaced with individuals who actually honor the U.S. Constitution (like Rep. Louie Gohmert).
I root for all groups working to save America and expose the criminal politicians Bring out the marshmallows and weiners, folks: This is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to U.S. history that anyone has witnessed in over 200 years. Try not to trip and “face plant” into the flames as all this unfolds. It might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready, since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get. (And thank God Hillary doesn’t have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes, or she’d probably launch them just to change the narrative…)
As for me, I’m with anybody who’s trying to save America , restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison. Like almost everybody else, I’ve had enough of the lies, the corruption, the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in Washington D.C. who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much they’re universally despised. The revolution is ON. Anonymous, Wikileaks, Project Veritas, the FBI and the NSA have all been activated. There’s no stopping them now, and all the details of all the crimes of the Clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history, dirty deeds and all.
Be warned, you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the Clintons really are. You will probably vomit.

25949,"Avalanche in Italy Buries Hotel, Leaving up to 30 Missing - The New York Times","ROME  —   As night fell in Italy’s Apennine Mountains on Thursday, prospects dimmed of finding survivors of an avalanche that had swept over a small resort hotel the previous night. At least 30 people were missing, according to the authorities. The avalanche occurred after four earthquakes struck central Italy, which has been hit hard in recent months. Giampiero Parete, a cook at the Rigopiano hotel and one of the two known survivors, had gone out to get something from his car when the avalanche struck. His wife and two young children remained inside and are among the missing. Quintino Marcella, a restaurateur, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he had received a frantic call for help from Mr. Parete on Wednesday night. Mr. Parete told him that the hotel had been wiped out: “The hotel isn’t here anymore, it’s not here,” Mr. Marcella told the newspaper. He said that the guests had been waiting for a snow plow to clear the roads. “All the guests had their bags packed and were waiting to leave,” he said. Mr. Marcella said that he called the prefecture in Pescara, and an official told him that they had spoken to the hotel a few hours earlier and that everything was under control. “I insisted,” Mr. Marcella told Corriere della Sera. He said that he called police, the carabinieri, until someone finally said “maybe there’s something there. ” The authorities told the Italian media that they responded as soon as they learned of the disaster. The latest seismic activity, which prompted officials to close schools and the subway system in Rome as a precaution, shifted the nation’s attention back to areas in central Italy that were devastated by last year’s earthquakes, leading to criticism that victims had been left to fend for themselves. Fabrizio Curcio, the chief of the civil protection department, told RAI News that    teams had reached the hotel but that they faced an enormous challenge. Rescue workers, including dog units, were moving with caution he said, and some   teams reported no signs of survivors. News channels in Italy showed images of the roof collapsed on the Rigopiano, and    photographs suggesting that much of the structure had been buried by the avalanche. The last time Fulvio Vagnarelli heard from his brother Marco, who was staying at the hotel with his girlfriend Paola Tomassini, it was via a social media message late on Wednesday afternoon. “He told me that they were about to leave but that they were delayed because of the snow,” Mr. Vagnarelli told the Ansa news agency. Cars were blocking the road, “and they were waiting for it to be cleared. ” The father of a woman who worked at the hotel told Radio24 that the staff had asked to leave after the quake “because it was felt very strongly up there, and so they asked to come down. But there were three meters of snow, how were they supposed to leave?” Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the rescue effort presented officials with “unprecedented” difficulties, describing the area as caught in a vise after intense snowfall “that hadn’t been recorded for decades,” and the strong earthquakes on Wednesday. The epicenters of the four earthquakes were in central Italy, which has been hit by deadly quakes with increasing frequency in recent years. Officials registered more than 100 aftershocks on Thursday. Emergency vehicles tried to assist mountain rescue teams in the region, part of the Gran Sasso National Park, but their efforts were hampered by heavy snow. Francesco Provolo, the prefect of Pescara, the province that includes Farindola, told RAI that rescuers had to travel more than five miles on skis and snowshoes to reach the hotel, as billowing snow continued to fall throughout the night. A spokesman for the civil protection department in Pescara estimated that up to 30 people were in the hotel at the time of the avalanche. The   hotel has 43 rooms, but it was not clear how many guests were staying there at the time of the avalanche. Rescue efforts continued at the hotel, which officials said had been swept from its foundations by the avalanche. Walter Milan, a spokesman for a specialized mountain rescue team, told RAI that rescuers were examining the scene of the avalanche section by section “to exclude that people remained trapped underneath. ” In the nearby hamlet of Ortolano, which has been cut off by the snow, 21 people were airlifted by helicopter to the airport in L’Aquila, said a spokesman for the Italian Financial Police, which was involved in the rescue operations. Three quakes in central Italy last year killed nearly 300 people in and around the medieval town of Amatrice on Wednesday, the tower of one of that town’s churches was destroyed by temblors. In 2009, the town of L’Aquila was devastated by an earthquake that killed more than 300 people. The latest earthquakes were a new setback for thousands of commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises in four central Italian regions that have been struggling to recover from the natural disasters of the summer and fall. Mr. Gentiloni praised the courage of rescue workers trying to reach the hotel, and he said the country’s “heart and mind” were closely following their efforts. “Everyone is doing as much as they can” to reach people, clear roads and bring electricity to areas that have been cut off for days, the prime minister said. “But I ask all operators to increase their commitment. They have shown that they exist, are present, and are working  —   but I ask them, if possible, to do even more. ” The avalanche had buried cars and nearly everything else in its path. The National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology said that more than 47, 000 temblors and aftershocks had rattled the region since August, and that there was no sign the situation would change anytime soon. After the earthquake in L’Aquila in 2009, the earth shook for four years, even though it wasn’t always perceptible to people, said Carlo Meletti, the director of the seismic hazard center at the institute. “We expect the sequence will last for many weeks,” he said. “After yesterday’s quakes, it is as though it has picked up in vigor. ” “We have always said that there were strong possibilities of new, stronger earthquakes, and now a new fault has opened,” he continued. “The one thing we don’t know is when they will occur or where, because the area that has been affected by the quakes is so vast. ” Mr. Meletti said in a telephone interview that it was unclear if the avalanche was a direct result of the earthquakes on Wednesday, but that a link was possible “considering that a lot of snow had fallen in a very short time and it was very unstable. ” Echoing a refrain heard after the earthquakes last year, many residents complained on social media that they had been abandoned, even as officials pledged that they were doing everything they could to reach stranded towns and hamlets. “Only the earthquake remembers the earthquake victims,” a banner headline on the front page of the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano read on Thursday.",1
25950,City Council Votes to Put “In God We Trust” Plaque in City Hall,"Email 
When then-President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the country’s motto “In God We Trust” on July 30, 1956, he stated, “In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America’s heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country’s most powerful resource in peace and war.” 
Last week, the City Council of Chesapeake, Virginia, agreed with Eisenhower , unanimously voting to celebrate the motto’s 60th anniversary by putting up a plaque in the town’s city hall emblazoned with it. Suzy Kelly, the council member who sponsored and promoted the proposal, explained: “As our founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence, our inalienable rights come from our God, not our government. Displaying ‘In God We Trust’ in City Hall, or any government hall where elected officials enact legislation, makes perfect sense.” 
The phrase appears to have origins in the fourth stanza of “The Star-Spangled Banner”: O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved homes and the war's desolation, Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n-rescued land Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust."" And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
""In God we trust"" also echoes the Bible: Psalm 118:8: “It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.” Psalm 40:3: “He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the LORD and put their trust in Him.” Proverbs 29.25: “Fear of many will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.” 
On the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the motto, the U.S. Senate reaffirmed it, while five years later the House passed a resolution reaffirming it as well, with just nine members opposed. 
But some disagree. In March, the board of commissioners in Saluda, North Carolina, voted unanimously not to display “In God We Trust” in its city hall, claiming that it would offend and “ostracize” some with non-Christian or secular beliefs. 
Attorney and atheist Michael Newdow appears to have made a living bringing lawsuits challenging the motto, along with the words “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance. Back in January, for instance, he filed one, claiming that the motto violates the “separation” of church and state and that his belief in nothing is “substantially burdened because he is forced to bear on his person [presumably, the paper currency he carries in his wallet with the offending phrase printed on it] a religious sentiment that causes him to sense his government legitimizing, promoting and reinforcing negative and injurious attitudes not only against Atheists in general, but against him personally.” 
The outcome of that lawsuit apparently is still pending, but if precedents hold, he will once again be out of luck. In 1970 Stefan Ray Aronow filed the first lawsuit against the motto, Aronow v. United States . The court ruled that Aronow didn’t have standing to sue but decided to address his complaint anyway. Wrote the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency “In God We Trust” have nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise. 
The Establishment Clause in the First Amendment — “Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion” — was successfully defended years earlier by the Supreme Court in 1952 in Zorach v. Clauson . Writing for the majority, Justice William Douglas stated: We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being…. Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the proclamation making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; ""So help me God"" in our courtroom oaths — these and ... other references to the Almighty ... run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies ... [including] the supplication with which the Court opens each session: ""God save the United States and this Honorable Court."" 
Suzy Kelly and other members of the City Council of Chesapeake have been inundated with expressions of support for their decision. ""When I speak with people,"" said Kelly, ""they often indicate how they feel our country has turned away from its founding principles. This vote has given hope to many.""

25955,Israeli President Hosts Quiet Meeting of Muslim and Jewish Leaders - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   The guests who arrived at the Israeli president’s home on Thursday evening were an eclectic mix. They included the chief Sephardic rabbi of Israel, the president of the Sharia Court of the Palestinian Authority and two rabbis from a West Bank yeshiva. The highly unusual meeting was intended, according to organizers, to forge a joint effort against religious violence, and to promote peace and coexistence. But, underscoring the fissures that have made the   conflict so durable, the Palestinian religious leaders refused to be photographed, so there was no visual documentation of the meeting, and all but one refused to have their names appear in the official statements. They seemed to be hoping the whole event would remain below the radar, and hours afterward it appeared to have gone unreported in the Palestinian news media. Still, the host, President Reuven Rivlin, described the meeting in a statement as “important and significant —   perhaps the most important meeting that could be held during these days. ” Another statement put out on behalf of the participants said: “We believe the deliberate killing of or attempt to kill innocents is terrorism, whether it is committed by Muslims, Jews or others. In this spirit, we encourage all our people to work for a just peace, mutual respect for human life and for the status quo on the holy sites, and the eradication of religious hatred. ” The gathering was originally supposed to have taken place on Monday but was postponed after a Palestinian gunman from East Jerusalem went on a shooting rampage the day before, killing an Israeli grandmother and a special forces police officer. Mr. Rivlin spent that day visiting the bereaved families instead. Sunday’s attack, though largely nationalistic at core, also had a religious motif, like much of the violence over the last couple of years. The killer, a supporter of Hamas, was well known for his activism around the contested East Jerusalem holy site known to Muslims as the Aqsa Mosque, or the Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as the Temple Mount. Palestinians had nicknamed him the “Lion of Al Aqsa. ” In a reflection of the fierce competition over ownership of the site, the Jerusalem meeting coincided with the passing of a resolution by Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, condemning Israeli actions in and around the holy compound. The resolution, promoted by Arab parties and similar to one adopted a year ago, stirred outrage in Israel because its wording appeared to negate any historical Jewish connection to the sacred mount, revered in Judaism as the location of the two ancient temples. It also seemed to question the Jewish connection to the Western Wall, a retaining wall of the mount and the holiest place where Jews can pray. “To say that Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount and the Western Wall is like saying that China has no connection to the Great Wall of China or that Egypt has no connection to the pyramids,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a broadcast statement. “By this absurd decision, Unesco has lost what little legitimacy it had left. ” Mr. Rivlin also denounced the resolution earlier in the day. The Palestinian leadership welcomed it. The meeting of religious leaders at Mr. Rivlin’s official residence in western Jerusalem resulted from months of negotiations and dialogue begun by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy based in the United States. “When we see a complete impasse at the political level we’re looking for ways to have an impact on public opinion on both sides,” said David Makovsky, a scholar at the institute who helped lead the initiative. “Religious figures might not have the power but they have enormous influence,” especially in the Middle East, he said, where “religion and nationalism are intertwined. ” Mr. Makovsky emphasized that Thursday’s encounter was just a beginning. “No one meeting is transformative. ” The hope, he said, was to have a   meeting in the Palestinian Authority’s administrative capital of Ramallah in the West Bank. Sheikh Mahmoud Habbash, the head of the Sharia court who also serves as the Islamic affairs adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas, was the lone Palestinian leader to allow his name to be mentioned in the statement. But he refused to comment on it when reached by telephone after the meeting, saying that he would not go beyond the statement, in which he was not directly quoted. Sheikh Habbash, a native of the Gaza Strip who used to belong to Hamas but left the movement in the 1990s, has sounded less than conciliatory in some sermons broadcast on Palestinian television in recent months. In one in June that was recorded by Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli monitoring group, he dismissed the claim that there had been a Jewish temple on the site of Al Aqsa as a myth. “The problem between us and them is not is not a problem of religious or historical narrative,” he added. “The problem is that they are thieves. The problem is that they are thieves who stole the land, and who want to steal the history. ” Aware of those remarks, Mr. Makovsky said, “If there wasn’t a problem here we wouldn’t need to bring people together. You make peace between people who come from different perspectives. ” Sheikh Habbash, in the telephone interview, said he was not referring to Jews in that sermon. “We have no problem with Jews as Jews,” he said. “The problem is with the Israeli occupation. ” “Under the circumstances of the occupation we will continue our struggle until we achieve our independence,” he added. “Of course, the Palestinian leadership declared many times that our resistance will be by peaceful means, without any kind of violence. ” Among Mr. Rivlin’s other guests on Thursday were Rabbi Yitzchak Yosef, who is the chief Sephardic rabbi, and the two rabbis, who belong to the Har Etzion yeshiva in Gush Etzion, a group of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Har Etzion, known as a prestigious and intellectually moderate yeshiva, offers a   hesder program where students combine Torah study with army service.",1
25956,FULL TEXT – MILO at Cal Poly State University: ’No More Dead Babies’ - Breitbart," Welcome to the Dangerous Faggot Tour! I’m MILO, the supervillain of the Internet, but you already knew that.[ Congratulations to the people in the front row who got signed and numbered memorabilia tonight. I look forward to them showing up on eBay. By the way the numbers are edition numbers not ratings. Unlike progressives I don’t go around giving grades to abortions or celebrating the murder of innocent life. I’m happy that the final week of my college tour takes place in California. I feel like California is home. Of course I’m British, but I feel Californian inside. Well, I feel Californians inside. Is   a thing? The beauty of liberal identity politics is if you can imagine it, it’s real, no matter how ridiculous it is! Internet pornography, transgender pronouns, Amy Schumer’s sexuality. You name it. I don’t blame anyone for being  . You have beautiful weather, incredible forests and natural beauty, and plenty of completely insane liberals to laugh at. They say California girls are the best too, but I wouldn’t know anything about that. Because I’m gay, did you know that? If I look a bit jumpy tonight, it’s not the protesters that have me on edge. I’m fresh from an electroshock therapy session. Vice President Mike “if you like the cock, you get a shock” Pence sent me a gift voucher for these new Zap The Fag Away treatments they’re doing at Trump Tower. It’s like tanning  —   cheaper if you buy a course. I’m still hoping the therapy sessions work. I think they might be, it’s early days. I’m not quite into snatch yet, but I do feel guilty every time I see Idris Elba. Did you know Idris Elba is an anagram. If you rearrange the letters it spells YOU WILL NEVER BE JAMES BOND. Before we get to the fun stuff, I have an important announcement to make. My initiative to help white men further their education is now accepting applications! We’ve given it the brilliant name of the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant. I put my name in it because progressives are too stupid to remember how to spell it and too lazy to Google, so it reduces the abuse we get in our inboxes by about 90%. As of this second the website is live for you to apply at privilegegrant. com. My goal is to help more men, no matter what their major or political opinions, to reach their educational goals. You can even major in Gender Studies. I don’t care. Our pilot grant program will give 10 students $2, 500 towards their tuition, which will be paid directly to their college or university. The grant is open for U. S. Citizens attending a 2 year community college or 4 year college or university. Now the most important details are the dates. Submissions are open today, January 31st, and close February 14th, Valentine’s Day, which is the day fat people stock up on razor blades. So after you’ve finished crying and wanking and thinking about how alone you are, log on to privilegegrant. com and get yourself some free money. The recipients will be announced on March 31st, and the grants will be paid to the schools immediately upon IRS approval. Please do not treat this like a college class and open the submission on the last day! You’ll be writing a   and providing a video clip of up to 90 seconds via one of several private upload options, so you’re better off starting early. Although it took longer than I anticipated to get the Privilege Grant set up properly  —   your government bureaucracy is even worse than the UK’s  —   I am happy that we are now well on our way to assisting white men achieve their dreams. I hope everyone eligible in this room and watching our livestream applies! Males make up only 43% of America’s 20. 5 million college students. Since the 1980’s, women have performed better in high schools and earned the majority of BA degrees. There are thousands of scholarships for women and minorities, but very few for white men. Education is essential for young men to be successful in the American economy. Young adults with a bachelor’s degree earn 62% more than one with only a high school diploma. The percentage of jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree has doubled in the past forty years. These facts made it obvious to me that men need education to be successful, and education takes money. We look forward to helping 10 men in the Spring, and many more in the years to come. Cal Poly is my kind of school. So many universities I visit boast about boring alumni like pioneering surgeons and olympic athletes. But Cal Poly has none other than Weird Al Yankovic! And it just gets better. The student population is 53% male! Let’s hear it for the sausage party.  In fact, women were banned from Cal Poly from 1930 until 1956. For that brief, blissful   Cal Poly was a   safe space, like a country club or a Saudi Arabian highway. Now I want you to all be honest with me for a second  …     whenever there is a feminist protest or genderqueer slut walk or another outbreak of fake rape claims on campus, doesn’t a little piece of you think that letting women back on campus might have been a mistake. For those of you thinking yes  …    . Don’t worry! You’re not alone! And for women in attendance, I’m kidding, slightly. I know you feel the same horror as we do at these ludicrous feminist antics, with additional embarrassment on behalf of your gender. I do recognize it isn’t your fault that you happen to share a gender, one of the actual two genders, with batshit crazy,     and deeply unhappy feminist harpies. There is even more to love about Cal Poly! You have a freedom of speech loving President named Jeffrey Armstrong, who has made the brave decision to take a stand against   crybabies, and follow the path of the University of Chicago instead of the University of Missouri. President Armstrong put out a definitive statement about tonight’s event, and hasn’t budged an inch. Let me quote him here: “It is, in fact, the university’s responsibility to support the rights of all people to express their opinions and ideas  —   regardless of how unpopular they may be  —   while also encouraging students to think critically and independently.  “Protecting freedom of speech is not an option, it is a critical responsibility that the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend. ” President Armstrong is right, and the left is absolutely furious. They know they will never win in a world with   so they fight to censor everything to the right of them. It’s the same thing as when these idiots call everyone on the right a Nazi. They even do it to me, but the Nazis hate my guts! That word used to hold weight, you know. I am here tonight to talk to you about abortion, and why America must stop murdering babies. Abortion isn’t the same sort of demonic practise you’d find at one of Hillary’s spirit cooking sessions, but is no less evil. Before we talk about some of the serious issues about abortion, we must first touch on my own Catholic faith. You should always take what I say about religion with a grain of salt, because the 7 deadly sins are more like my seven daily activities. I try to check them all off at least once a day. All of them except gluttony my trainer keeps that under control. But I am a Catholic and I do believe in God, even as I recognise that the church is for sinners and I’m one of the most enthusiastic sinners. As someone once said, I might be bad, but imagine how much worse I’d be WITHOUT God. It is in the Bible that we should be fruitful and multiply, I don’t think it mentions shouting our abortions anywhere. This is especially critical at a time western civilisation is in crisis in the face of radical Islam. In short, we need to breed. That’s why I’ll finally be caving to public pressure and millions of fan letters and at last auctioning off my sperm for charity. I once wrote a column wishing we had a religious right movement in the United Kingdom, because religious people there don’t speak up the way religious people do here. I’m not going to go on too long about religion because not all of you have the good fortune to be Catholic, or even Christian, but there are a few important points to consider. Abortion is murder. Abortion is wrong. I think everyone knows that, which is why abortion activists are so angry all the time. It’s a bit like when you catch someone out in a lie and they get really mad at you really quickly and you can’t work out why until later. It’s guilt. When I say abortion is wrong, its defenders leap to their feet, demanding to know why I want to jail a    girl who has an abortion after a horrific subhuman rapes her. Well, guess what? I don’t want to jail that girl, and I defy you to find any opponent of abortion who does. I will make the distinction for you, because unlike feminists, my audiences are smart enough to enjoy the adventure known as Reasoning With Logic. I make this distinction, by the way, using the tools of the Catholic Church, which has been reasoning gracefully since long before the first feminist had a  . Don’t forget that the original feminists, like Mary Wollstonecraft and Susan B. Anthony, denounced abortion. In principle, the Church teaches, the direct, intentional taking of innocent human life is wrong. Because that’s a principle, it’s easy to say that, even in the most heartbreaking case, like that of the    we’re considering, it cannot be right to take the innocent life who is growing inside her and has done nothing worthy of the death penalty. But as Western civilization has always understood, hard cases make bad law. And the Church has long been the enemy of utopianism, the most prominent vice of leftists, who demand that each of us be perfect immediately, according to the warped view of perfection you find in gender studies classes and Marxist gripe fests. Here is the relevant distinction, and I’m quoting from the Church’s “Angelic Doctor,” St. Thomas Aquinas:  “Human laws do not forbid all vices, from which the virtuous abstain, but only the more grievous vices, from which it is possible for the majority to abstain. ” In other words, it’s not wise to punish with human law everything that may be opposed to the natural law. That means I can say it’s wrong to take innocent life, without having to say that we should outlaw abortions in every single case. In a sane country, we would argue about what cases should be illegal. Should you, for instance, as often happens in   lands, allow abortion when parents don’t want a girl baby? Here’s one more fact that will help you understand that Thomas Aquinas and the Church aren’t the   puritans that your lying professors claim:  St. Thomas and before him St. Augustine both followed this   view I’ve described when it came to prostitution. They thought it was wrong to do, but foolish to make illegal. I don’t think they’d approve of   so my 20s still require some apologizing for, but it is still an amazingly progressive position, Sorry feminists. Once again dead white man are clearer thinkers than your leading lights! Since I brought up catholicism, I have to mention Islam too. I do this because Islam is always wrong, but I could pacify the liberals in attendance by saying it was mandated by the diversity and inclusion office. We know abortion for sex selection has been common outside of western civilization. For example under China’s one child policy, many girls were aborted so the family could have a son. By 2001 there were 117 boys born for every 100 girls, leading the government to outlaw sex selective abortions in 2010, and even outlaw doctors telling parents what sex their child would be. Of course it still happens, the Chinese have become skillful at ignoring their authoritarian  . But another culture also values sons far more than daughters, and that is Islam. I’ve said on numerous occasions that if you are curious what effect mass Islamic immigration to the United States would have, all you need to do is look at Europe. And in this case my home country off England is telling. Statistical analysis of births in England, undertaken in 2014, prove that thousands of girls are being aborted for sex selection purposes. Of course the government and others will waive their hand and try to explain these things away, but a brave Greek stood up to them. You probably think I mean me, but there are OTHER brave Greeks, and this one’s name is Christoforos Anagnostopoulos, a lecturer in statistics at Imperial College London. Damn, I finally have some competition for most ludicrous Greek name. Christoforos dug into the numbers and found certain incontrovertible proof. Gender imbalances may be contributed to by multiple factors, but no set of factors can explain away the imbalances in immigrant communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. To quote him on this subject, “The only readily available explanation that is consistent with a statistically significant gender shift of the sort observed in the census data is   abortion. ” I’m curious how the   feminists off England will spin this data. Under Islam, many girl babies literally never see the light of day. Feminists hate the truth, science, and logical thinking.   feminism is entirely rooted in lies, distortion, and hysteria. Feminist arguments are absolutely no different. The underpinning of legal abortion in the United States is the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade. Many argue that the entire case is shoddy law, but I am not a lawyer and unlike pundits on both sides of the debate, I won’t argue a supreme court case for your entertainment. I will share some extremely unpleasant facts that professors and liberals just HATE being shared. The Roe in the name of the case was actually a woman named Norma McCorvey. Surprise surprise, she is now an   activist. She never had an abortion the child in the Roe V. Wade case was given up for adoption. McCorvey has three daughters of her own now. She has admitted, as part of turning against abortion, that the entire case was a sham.  In the case she claimed to have been   by thugs, which was a lie to make the case more sympathetic, like my earlier example. In fact McCorvey claims that she had minimal involvement in the case besides signing some papers. She was persuaded to play this part by her feminist lawyers. McCorvey became an   advocate after realizing the error of her ways. She bears a heavy heart, as some 50 million babies were legally killed following the passage of Roe V. Wade. How can feminism be   without being  ? There is nothing more unique about being a woman. But feminism loves abortion, and loves to put down motherhood. Just consider the Women’s March on Washington. Besides a bunch of women leaving garbage and signs littered all over the city, the prevailing moods were promoting Islam for women, and abortion for all. Sue Ellen Browder is yet another abortion activist who later became an   activist, witnessed firsthand how the sexual liberation of the late 60’s and early 70’s inserted abortion into the women’s rights movement. She eloquently points out that what the media can’t see is that the national debate over abortion is not a war against women, but rather a war between women. Motherhood and   became anathema to liberated women, and abortion became a prime component of women’s rights. One of the main reasons abortion became synonymous with women’s rights is the adoption of abortion  —   pun intended  —   into the political platform of the National Organization for Women. But I’d like to share a quote from Betty Friedan, who was the President of NOW at the time. In 2001 she said: “Ideologically, I was never for abortion. Motherhood is a value to me, and even today abortion is not  …    I believed passionately in 1967, as I do today, that women should have the right of chosen motherhood. For me, the matter of choice has never been primarily the choice of abortion, but that you can choose to be a mother. That is as important as any right written into the Constitution. ” If she said that in a room of   feminists, she’d be censored, kicked out, and possibly beaten up. Because feminists aren’t   they are  . Initiatives like #ShoutYourAbortion are not about choice, they are about glorifying the death of children. I will leave it up to you to browse that topic for disgusting positive reactions to abortions. They may a good weight loss aide if you eat too much and need to throw up. But I can’t get away without sharing one vile one at least. One #ShoutYourAbortion participant gushed that her Vacuum Aspiration made her “happy. ” That name just “tickles” her. You’re “vacuuming” out the “unwanted detritus” threatening your “aspirations. ” It’s like getting blood drawn —  she’s had “more painful experiences flossing. ” That is what killing a baby is to these people, just a different version of flossing. This quote is in fact a wonderful example of how these despicable people manipulate language to make abortion seem normal. A vacuum aspiration involves inserting a suction device into the mother’s body to suck out the poor little child. Aspiration refers not to the dreams of the mother, but the removal itself. They do vacuum aspirations when the child is too little to be valuable on the baby bodyparts sales channel. They only want the bigger babies for that  —   so they kill and remove them in completely different ways hoping to preserve the merchandise. #ShoutYourAbortion and movements like it seek to normalize abortion, but in fact it is very bad for women’s health. You know, the women feminism claims to care about. In 2010 the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry published a study based on a sample of 3, 000 women in the United States.  The findings of the effects of abortion are startling. If the cause of this mental anguish were anything besides abortion, women would be marching   against it, and Madonna would be threatening to blow the White House up over it. Abortion is clearly so bad for women’s mental health that it falls second only to Islam, and maybe the fact that I’m gay. Imagine if the parents of your favorite people in this world deciding against having them. Abortion is simply wrong. Imagine no Shakespeare, no Wagner, no Lil Wayne, no Mariah, no Daddy  …     Imagine no Perez Hilton  …     actually maybe abortion isn’t so bad after all. Joking! Abortion advocates ignore science, Feminists don’t really handle science well. They prefer feelings. So it is no surprise their abortion arguments are proven wrong time after time. Let’s start with the idea that a baby is like a parasite inside the mother, attack her body’s integrity. This is what many abortion advocates believe, that the woman’s body is occupied by this hostile force. Nothing could be further from the truth! In fact, babies pass beneficial cells to their mothers that can aide in healing throughout the mother’s life. A fantastic book has been written on this subject by Jena Pincott called “Do Chocolate Lovers Have Sweeter Babies?: The Surprising Science of Pregnancy”. I am a chocolate lover but despite my best efforts and the best efforts of my boyfriend I remain tragically unblessed. Another argument that we hear all the time is that it is a woman’s body and a woman’s choice. Women, let us dispel this notion quickly. A baby is not your body. A baby even at a quite early fetal stage has her own heartbeat, her own brainwaves, and her own separate DNA. How can you possibly argue a baby is part of you? Babies inside their mother have everything but fingerprints and a social security number. Babies in the womb are the real undocumented Americans we should care about  …    . Not Mexican gang members and Syrian Jihadists! Progressives like to insinuate that there is something sinister about Big Oil and Big Tobacco. They might even be right! But Planned Parenthood, Big Abortion, is worse. We were all shocked when undercover tapes came out showing they are in the business of selling baby parts to the medical industry. Can you imagine, and I don’t think this is a stretch, the senior leaders of Planned Parenthood sitting in a conference room discussing the best timing for an abortion, to maximize their profits from the dead baby’s body? It’s horrifying, and it’s what feminists want more of. Planned Parenthood can attribute a good portion of their boffo   business to their president since 2006, Cecile Richards. Richards is well on her way to personally matching Hitler’s body count. We’ve done the grim maths so you don’t have to. Using a conservative estimate of 300, 000 abortions a year  —   or 300 kiloscrapes, using the technical metric measure  —   Cecile Richards has presided over three million abortions, or three megascrapes in her ten years as president of the organisation. This has earned her “half Holocaust” status. Full Holocaust seems eminently reachable given Planned Parenthood’s growing hegemony in the abortion industry. To be clear, this is just since Richards took charge. Planned Parenthood has since 1970 performed 7 million abortions, comfortably surpassing Hitler according to its own annual reports. You have to admire the chutzpah, if you’ll forgive my terminology: Planned Parenthood has amassed a Third   death count completely legally and while pocketing half a billion dollars a year to do so. But under Richards the numbers have skyrocketed such that in just the last ten years, at least 3 million young lives were ended. If Cecile stays in her post another decade, she will reach “full Hitler,” by matching the six million deaths of the Holocaust. In fact it’ll probably be sooner than that, given the acceleration in procedures during her reign. The road ahead may be rocky. Besides the undercover videos still being released, some media sources are starting to cover the revolting practices of these sociopathic monsters. Nice normal people, whatever their views on abortion, have no stomach for these unashamed   activities. And perhaps President Trump will defund them. If you need to hear more about Margaret Sanger, here’s something she once said. She was inarguably racist. She spoke glowingly about a presentation to a group of KKK women in New Jersey, and they loved her messaging about the black race. Messaging like this, in a letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble: “We do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members. ” Notice like most liberals, she considers minorities that disagree with her to be rebellious, or uppity. Black Trump supporters heard these words and much worse during the campaign! Margaret Sanger’s goal was to diminish the black race, and one can argue she was at least partially successful. Stats about abortion by race are not always easy to find, but nonetheless paint a compelling picture about the race reality of abortion. New York City presents itself as a strong case study. In 2012, there were more black children aborted in New York City than born alive. More than 31, 000 compared to just under 25, 000 live births. Blacks accounted for 42% of the abortions in the city, with Hispanic women accounting for another 31%. That’s 73% of all abortions in the city killing black and Hispanic youth. Other national data from the Center for   Reform asserts that black women are 3 times more likely to have an abortion than white women. So isn’t it fascinating that intersectional   feminists fighting for abortion and so often    with Black Lives Matter?  To any BLM members tucked away in the audience, I can conclusively say that feminists are one group that do not believe black lives matter at all. Whether you believe in an immortal soul or not, babies are precious. You may not like some of the grim imagery associated with the   movement, and you may find the pictures of dead babies carried by protesters to be tremendously distasteful, BUT THAT IS THE POINT. Abortion SHOULD be considered terrible. The left knows it, and that is why they do their best to make people think babies are just lumps of cells that magically become humans upon birth. They prey on vulnerable women who are pregnant, while at the same time brainwashing the youth to praise abortion. I’d like to remind you that many of the great people in history were born as orphans or adopted. People like Julius Caesar, Bach, Steve Jobs, Aristotle, Louis Armstrong, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Bill Clinton. What if some of these people hadn’t existed? Don’t say anything about Bill Clinton  …     without him we wouldn’t have had Sick Hillary’s hilarious campaign! I call on everyone in this room and the many thousands of people watching at home to reject the cultural conditioning favoring abortion that we are all exposed to. You have already rejected so much, like the lie of campus rate epidemics and the gender pay gap. I’m asking you to go a little farther  …     because Western Civilization needs more babies, not fewer. Written from prepared remarks.",1
25958,‘We the people’ against tyranny: Seven principles for free government,"‘We the people’ against tyranny: Seven principles for free government By John W. Whitehead   John W. Whitehead 
“As I look at America today, I am not afraid to say that I am afraid.”—Former presidential advisor Bertram Gross 
As history teaches us, if the people have little or no knowledge of the basics of government and their rights, those who wield governmental power inevitably wield it excessively. After all, a citizenry can only hold its government accountable if it knows when the government oversteps its bounds. 
Precisely because Americans are easily distracted—because, as study after study shows, they are clueless about their rights—because their elected officials no longer represent them—because Americans have been brainwashed into believing that their only duty as citizens is to vote—because the citizenry has failed to hold government officials accountable to abiding by the Constitution—because young people are no longer being taught the fundamentals of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, resulting in citizens who don’t even know they have rights—and because Americans continue to place their trust in politics to fix what’s wrong with this country—the American governmental scheme is sliding ever closer towards a pervasive authoritarianism. 
This steady slide towards tyranny, meted out by militarized local and federal police and legalistic bureaucrats, has been carried forward by each successive president over the past fifty years regardless of their political affiliation. 
Big government has grown bigger and the rights of the citizenry have grown smaller. 
However, there are certain principles—principles that every American should know—which undergird the American system of government and form the basis for the freedoms our forefathers fought and died for. 
The following seven principles are a good starting point for understanding what free government is really all about. 
First, the maxim that power corrupts is an absolute truth. Realizing this, those who drafted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights held one principle sacrosanct: a distrust of all who hold governmental power. As James Madison, author of the Bill of Rights, proclaimed, “All men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.” Moreover, in questions of power, Thomas Jefferson warned, “Let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.” As such, those who drafted our founding documents would see today’s government as an out-of-control, unmanageable beast. 
The second principle is that governments primarily exist to secure rights, an idea that is central to constitutionalism. In appointing the government as the guardian of the people’s rights, the people give it only certain, enumerated powers, which are laid out in a written constitution. The idea of a written constitution actualizes the two great themes of the Declaration of Independence: consent and protection of equal rights. Thus, the purpose of constitutionalism is to limit governmental power and ensure that the government performs its basic function: to preserve and protect our rights, especially our unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and our civil liberties. Unfortunately, the government today has discarded this principle and now sees itself as our master, not our servant. The obvious next step, unless we act soon, is tyranny. 
The third principle revolves around the belief that no one is above the law, not even those who make the law. This is termed rule of law. Richard Nixon’s statement, “When the President does it, that means it is not illegal,” would have been an anathema to the Framers of the Constitution. If all people possess equal rights, the people who live under the laws must be allowed to participate in making those laws. By that same token, those who make the laws must live under the laws they make. However, today government officials at all levels often act as if they are royalty with salaries and perks that none of the rest of us are afforded. This is an egregious affront to the citizenry. 
Fourth, separation of powers ensures that no single authority is entrusted with all the powers of government. People are not perfect, whether they are in government or out of it. As history makes clear, those in power tend to abuse it. The government is thus divided into three co-equal branches: legislative, executive and judicial. Placing all three powers in the same branch of government was considered the very definition of tyranny. The fact that the president today has dictatorial powers would have been considered a curse by the Framers. 
Fifth, a system of checks and balances, essential if a constitutional government is to succeed, strengthens the separation of powers and prevents legislative despotism. Such checks and balances include dividing Congress into two houses, with different constituencies, term lengths, sizes and functions; granting the president a limited veto power over congressional legislation; and appointing an independent judiciary capable of reviewing ordinary legislation in light of the written Constitution, which is referred to as “judicial review.” The Framers feared that Congress could abuse its powers and potentially emerge as the tyrannous branch because it had the power to tax. But they did not anticipate the emergence of presidential powers as they have come to dominate modern government or the inordinate influence of corporate powers on governmental decision-making. Indeed, as recent academic studies now indicate, we are now ruled by a monied oligarchy that serves itself and not “we the people.” 
Sixth, representation allows the people to have a voice in government by sending elected representatives to do their bidding while avoiding the need of each and every citizen to vote on every issue considered by government. 
Finally, federalism is yet another constitutional device to limit the power of government by dividing power and, thus, preventing tyranny. 
These seven vital principles have been largely forgotten in recent years, obscured by the haze of a centralized government, a citizenry that no longer think 
It will mean “ voting with our feet 
As journalist Chris Hedges points out, “There were once radicals in America, people who held fast to moral imperatives. , not because it was easy or practical. They were willing to accept the state persecution that comes with open defiance. They had the courage of their convictions. They were not afraid.” 
Ultimately, as I make clear in my book , it will mean refusing to be divided, one against each other, by politics and instead uniting behind the only distinction that has ever mattered: “we the people” against tyranny.

25960,How the Artist Adrian Ghenie Became an Auction Star - The New York Times,"Many say it was the 2011 exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi museum in Venice that first ignited art buyers’ interest in a young Romanian artist named Adrian Ghenie, whose heavy   paintings are haunted by historical figures like Stalin, Hitler and the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Then, in 2015, Mr. Ghenie drew more attention when he commandeered the Romanian pavilion at the Venice Biennale. These days, this    artist’s work has sold for as much as $9 million at auction, with a waiting list of private buyers “spread out between four continents,” according to Marc Glimcher, the president of Pace gallery, which represents Mr. Ghenie in New York and is giving him a solo show opening in January. Mr. Glimcher added that “134 people think they’re first in line. ” Amid a decline in the market for young artists whose prices skyrocketed just a year ago, Mr. Ghenie is enjoying nosebleed prices at auction  —   but not everyone profiting from his success is entirely thrilled. “The market is overreacting,” said Thaddaeus Ropac, whose gallery represents Mr. Ghenie in Paris. “We would be happy if everything were strong but not crazy. ” Last month, Mr. Ghenie’s 2008   painting, “Nickelodeon”  —   depicting eight blurred figures in heavy overcoats  —   was the top lot at Christie’s in London after a bidding war pushed it to $9 million. That was more than four times its high estimate and a far cry from what the biggest Ghenies go for privately: about $650, 000. Just a few months before that, at Sotheby’s in London, Mr. Ghenie’s 2014 “Sunflowers in 1937,” which pictures van Gogh’s masterpiece with Nazi overtones, went for $4. 5 million  —   more than five times its high estimate. Why all the fuss? “He is an extremely talented painter  —   I don’t think anyone can deny that,” said Ali Subotnick, a curator at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, which in 2008 acquired two of Mr. Ghenie’s “Pie Fight” studies. “But it’s a little absurd. ” Several factors have contributed to what art experts describe as a perfect storm for the Ghenie market at auction: a demand for painting  —   as evidenced by the strong sales for artists like Francis Bacon, Gerhard Richter and Jenny Saville Mr. Ghenie’s limited output (10 to 15 paintings a year) the scarcity of masterpieces coming up for sale an affordable price point relative to the top of the market and an eager pool of wealthy Asian buyers. “Private buyers missed out on buying these works early on, and they’re playing ” said Brett Gorvy, Christie’s worldwide chairman for postwar and contemporary art. As they have with other artists of limited output  —   like Peter Doig and Mark Tansey  —   “buyers can flip” Mr. Ghenie’s works, Mr. Gorvy added, “quickly double or triple their value as soon as they take them out of the gallery. Only a few artists have that. ” At its postwar and contemporary auction on Nov. 15, Christie’s is selling Mr. Ghenie’s 2015 painting “The Bridge”  —   featuring the spectral figure of a man on a bridge that recalls the Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte’s “Le Pont de l’Europe” and the Expressionist Edvard Munch’s “The Scream”  —   for an estimated $1. 5 million to $2. 5 million. “‘The Bridge’ has a lot of commercial aspects  —   a sense of Impressionism, Munch, Bacon, Darwin,” Mr. Gorvy said, adding that it is one of several Ghenies owned by the undisclosed seller. “We said, ‘Sell one, keep five. ’” Mihai Nicodim said he sold “The Bridge” out of his Los Angeles gallery two years ago for about $400, 000. “I don’t like seeing it come up for sale again so quickly,” Mr. Nicodim said. “But when it gets to this level, you can’t blame the collectors. ” In response to several interview requests, Mr. Ghenie  —   who divides his time between Berlin and Cluj, Romania  —   said on Monday in an email, “Sorry for the silence, but I’m so immersed in work that I can’t think of anything else right now. ” But he is clearly aware of art market pressures. “The market is so crazy,” he told The New York Times at the 2015 Biennale. “It’s frustrating to see people make so much money so quickly. I feel I’m being speculated. It’s not me. It’s the new art world. ” Born in Baia Mare, Romania, in 1977, Mr. Ghenie graduated from the University of Art and Design in Cluj in 2001. After trying to make it as an artist in Vienna and Sicily, he returned to Cluj and started the Plan B gallery with Mihai Pop in 2005. Having grown up in Nicolae Ceausescu’s repressive Romania, Mr. Ghenie in his work wrestles with chapters of   European history. His “Pie Fight” paintings, for example, draw on Hollywood slapstick even as they depict menacing Nazi figures the smeared faces might have begun to deteriorate or simply been covered in layers of cream. “You will see Ceausescu, Stalin, Hitler, Mengele,” said Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, Europe, who said he was the first to put a Ghenie work in an evening sale, in 2013. That piece, “Dr. Mengele 2” (2011) sold in London for $190, 000 after an estimate of $47, 000 to $63, 000. “It’s not easy to sell a portrait of Mengele,” Mr. Branczik said. “In a way, we were testing the water. ” Mr. Ghenie’s galleries  —   which include Galerie Judin in Berlin and Plan B  —   contend they are trying to avoid the speculative fervor that has surrounded other young artists, like Lucien Smith and Oscar Murillo, whose rapidly rising values have declined precipitously because of oversupply and high prices. “We’re working on major museum shows,” Mr. Ropac said, “because this is what he needs now, not another auction record. ” Still, the frenzy has had an impact on private sales. Since Mr. Ghenie came to Pace five years ago, his prices have increased about 40 to 50 percent, according to Mr. Glimcher. Dealers say auction houses offer tempting guarantees: undisclosed amounts promised to sellers regardless of a sale’s outcome. At the same time, some skeptics in the art world say the Ghenie craze is largely hype. “Every gallerist will tell you there’s a waiting list,” said one art adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to alienate clients. Galleries, for their part, say they are making sure that Mr. Ghenie attains institutional bona fides. In addition to the Hammer, Mr. Ghenie’s work is so far held by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Tate. “For me, he’s still at a relatively early point in his career, but he’s made some extraordinarily strong, powerful paintings,” said Gary Garrels, the senior curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco museum, which acquired Mr. Ghenie’s painting “The Trial” and a “Pie Fight” study. “I don’t think every painting is successful, but he is an artist for the long haul that I intend to follow. ” Mr. Ghenie has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kuns, in Belgium and the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest. “He’s almost like a parallel to Neo Rauch 10 years ago,” Ms. Subotnick, of the Hammer Museum, said, referring to a German artist. “Ghenie has had a similar influence on a school of artists from Bucharest. ” Whether Mr. Ghenie proves to have staying power remains to be seen. “Fashions change quickly  —   there’s always going to be a backlash,” Mr. Gorvy said. “Then the question is, how long does it take for that artist to get back on top?”",1
25965,EXCLUSIVE – Rand Paul: Saudi Arabia’s Role in Backing Terrorism Raises Concerns with $100 Billion Arms Deal - Breitbart,"Last year, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) to allow the family members of those killed in the   attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for any part it played in those acts of terrorism. [President Obama vetoed JASTA, but Congress voted to override the veto.  Now, less than a year after Congress voted to let the victims and the families of victims of   sue Saudi Arabia, the current administration is proposing the   arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The arms sale allows the Saudis to immediately get nearly $110 billion in American weapons and an unimaginable $350 billion in arms over 10 years. After the veto override, former U. S. Senator Bob Graham stated, “[F]rom what I know today, there is ample evidence that   would not have happened but for the assistance provided by Saudi Arabia. ” He went on to say, “The results of that assistance was (nearly) 3, 000 persons murdered, 90 percent of them Americans. And a new wave of terrorism with Saudi financial and operational support has beset the world. ” The sale includes   bombs in the form of Paveway II and III weapons systems, as well as Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) guidance that converts unguided bombs into smart munitions. Selling military weapons to questionable allies is not in our national security interest. At some point, the United States must stop and realize that we are fueling an arms race in the Middle East. Even Hillary Clinton questioned the loyalty of Saudi Arabia in an email released by WikiLeaks, saying, “We need   …     to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. ” When we choose to intervene and provide or sell weapons to one nation, we only invite other nations to match or grow their own armaments  —   Iran and Israel will likely devote more of their funds to keeping up. Furthermore, U. S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia, which has come in the form of intelligence, refueling missions, and the sale of major U. S. defense equipment, has not abated the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.  If anything, it has exacerbated it. In January, the United Nations estimated that the war in Yemen had so far cost at least 10, 000 lives, and horror stories of civilian casualties continue to emerge from the conflict, including a   bombing of a funeral in October that wounded hundreds and killed over 100. A coalition airstrike on a hospital in August killed 19 and injured 24, according to Doctors Without Borders.  And these are only a couple of the examples one could cite. After the April airstrikes in Syria, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared, “We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world. ” Do we have to amend this statement to say, “  …     unless they have billions of dollars to invest in the United States”? So what does the U. S. gain from cutting this deal with Saudi Arabia? During my fight last year against a $1. 15 billion sale of Abrams tanks and associated major defense articles to Saudi Arabia, CNN host Wolf Blitzer attempted to answer that question by discussing maintaining full employment at U. S. defense contractors. He expressed concern that arms   jobs were at risk of being lost if Congress did not allow the sale to proceed.  President Eisenhower warned our nation during his farewell address to be very wary of the military industrial complex and its encroachment on civil society. The moment when the best interests of defense contractors start determining what is in the national security interest of our country, the tail has begun to wag the dog. Saudi Arabia’s relationship with radical elements is an open secret. Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U. S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations, wrote an article about Saudi Arabia’s admitted relationship with Islamic extremists. Regardless of its origins, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been using their ties with Islamic fundamentalists to further their influence throughout the Middle East and abroad through charities, schools, and social organizations. In a New York Times   Ed Husain stated, “Al Qaeda, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Boko Haram, the Shabab and others are all violent Sunni Salafi groupings. For five decades, Saudi Arabia has been the official sponsor of Sunni Salafism across the globe. ” Does this administration expect Congress to look the other way as it attempts to sell U. S. weapons to Saudi Arabia? Since Saudi Arabia’s incursion into Yemen, Iran has started shipping weapons to Houthi rebels, Al Qaeda has increased its territorial presence, and ISIS has several satellite offices in the country. The U. S. and coalition naval blockade of incoming vessels is just one of many examples of heightened tensions and military escalation on the Arabian Peninsula. Our prolonged military campaigns in the Middle East quagmire have not produced any net gains. When President Trump spoke in Saudi Arabia, he proclaimed the United States would not tell other people “how to live” or “what to do. ” That is a welcome change of tone from previous   leaders from both sides of the aisle. Realism, however, doesn’t mean we should sell arms to a country that doesn’t share our values or enhance any strategic vital interest of America. In the next few weeks, I, along with a bipartisan group of senators, will force a vote disapproving of this arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  Let’s hope the Senate will have the sense to stop this travesty.",1

In 2002 (gold $300/ oz.) MAM recommended to its investors to put 50% of their investment assets into physical gold stored outside the banking system. EvG specialises in M&A and Asset allocation consultancy for private family funds. MAM (based in Zurich, Switzerland) specialises in wealth preservation for high net worth individuals as well as institutions. The GoldSwitzerland Division was created to facilitate the buying and storage of physical gold and silver for private investors, companies, trusts and pension funds. About Us – Matterhorn Asset Management / GoldSwitzerland – GoldSwitzerland is the precious metals investment division of Matterhorn Asset Management AG (MAM), a Swiss asset management company specialising in wealth preservation for high net worth individuals and institutions. GoldSwitzerland advises investors on precious metals investments and buys, sells, transfers and stores precious metals for investors. The metals are stored in the name of the clients in ultra-secure vaults in Switzerland. MAM also assists clients in transferring existing gold and silver holdings out of the banking system to the private vaults. Clients have full control of their gold and silver bars which are allocated and segregated. Clients have personal access to the vaults to inspect or collect their metals. MAM is associated with the Aquila Group, Switzerland’s largest independent asset management group. 
Why Gold & Why GoldSwitzerland – There are times in history when protecting your wealth should be the primary objective of your investment strategy. As Mark Twain said: “I am more concerned about the return of my money than the return on my money.” To preserve wealth in a fragile financial system, involves investing in assets which have no counterparty risk. Gold is not an investment, it is real money. Gold reflects governments ongoing deceitful action in destroying the value of paper money. Matterhorn Asset Management (MAM) has invested in physical gold for clients for over 10 years. Back in 2002 we advised our investors to buy physical gold for up to 50% of their financial assets. The image shows how in 1913 you could buy nearly 50 oz of gold for $1,000 and today only 0.75 oz. Thus against real money – GOLD – the dollar has declined 98% since the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the USA in 1913. But it is not only the dollar that has declined in value, all major currencies have lost 97-99% against gold since 1913. Until 1971 the US dollar was backed by gold. Since Nixon abolished the gold backing, money printing started in earnest and in the last 41 years the dollar lost 98% in real terms . Egon von Greyerz: Founder and managing Partner of Matterhorn Asset Managment AG & GoldSwitzerlan – EvG forecasted the current present problems in the world economy over 12 years ago. In 2002 when gold was $300 per ounce, MAM recommended to its investors to put 50% of their investment assets into physical gold stored outside the banking system. Egon von Greyerz started his working life in Geneva as a banker and thereafter spent 17 years as Finance Director and Executive Vice-Chairman of a FTSE 100 company in the UK. Since the 1990s EvG has been actively involved with financial investment activities including Mergers and Acquisitions and Asset allocation consultancy for private family funds. This led to the creation of Matterhorn Asset Management an asset management company based on wealth preservation principles. The GoldSwitzerland Division was created to facilitate the buying and storage of physical gold and silver for private investors, companies, trusts and pension funds. EvG makes regular media appearances such as on CNBC, BBC and King World News and speaks at investment conferences around the world.

25968,How Much Silence Is Too Much? I Found Out - The New York Times,"This is not shaping up as a good year for silence. Wherever you go, the world blares with updates, alerts and urgency. Now comes a temporary reprieve: a   room at the top of the Guggenheim Museum, a work designed by the artist Doug Wheeler and known as “PSAD Synthetic Desert III,” which opened in March. Inside the room is enough   material to make it probably the quietest place you’ll ever go, unless you’re an astronaut or a sound engineer. Visitors with timed tickets can enter in groups of five, for 10 or 20 minutes. (The exhibition will be closed through April 12.) But too much hush can be unsettling. As Mr. Wheeler told my colleague Randy Kennedy, “In a supersilent anechoic chamber, the most that most people can endure is about 40 minutes before they start going batty. ” Not to   but I live near the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues in Brooklyn, on a block with a firehouse and a police station, surrounded by   construction projects. My children are 6, 4 and 1. Forty minutes? I asked for an hour. Here I should acknowledge that “Synthetic Desert” is not “going batty” quiet. Anechoic chambers are surreal, echoless spaces with noise levels below the threshold of human hearing. Mr. Wheeler estimated that his creation might reach as low as 10 decibels. My (relatively quiet) office cubicle measures about 50 decibels. Walking into “Synthetic Desert” is like entering a vault. There is a series of doors, and the final chamber feels pressurized, the air still and dense. I walked up a ramp into the silence and waited for nothing to happen. Every movement made noise, so I gave up trying to find a comfortable standing position and sat down. I focused on the room, which evokes the light before dawn, with a smear of sky painted across the wall and ceiling. No border is visible between the two, and there is no horizon or distance reference point. Deprived of stimuli, my ears got hungry fast, and quickly recalibrated themselves. I could hear a thin, high roar inside my head. John Cage was once told that this was the sound of the nervous system at work. Staring into the seemingly infinite space for a while had a similar effect on my vision. My eyes discovered, or invented, some entertainment for me: The colors of the room split apart, from purple into blues and pinks. I tried to quiet my breaths, and got to the point where I wasn’t sure if I heard them or felt them, or if there were any difference. The nerve signals of an ache in my foot seemed like actual noise, which gradually amplified into an inaudible scream and made me change positions. The sound of my legs shifting came from a distance. I think this was about 20 minutes in. To preserve Mr. Wheeler’s lighting design, no cellphones or cameras are allowed, and watching a timer was decidedly not the point. A low sound  —   maybe blood flowing through my vessels, or maybe part of the audio Mr. Wheeler has subtly incorporated into his design  —   became prominent. I found I could tune my hearing away from it, though, and began to hear other things  —   “noises” is not the right word. These were so soft I couldn’t be sure they were real: a wind blowing on the far side of a mountain a jet flying high above another continent. Around the   mark, the light glowing from beneath the acoustic cones on the floor intruded on my vision, their spiky pattern seeming to climb the wall. The room was unchanged, but my senses were operating independently of my mind. I watched inky patterns scroll across the wall: a hallucination, maybe, or some neural process I usually wouldn’t notice, a corporeal software update. In such a deadened room, a body bursts with life, spilling it out through every sense. I felt enraptured and paralyzed, as if I were a disembodied mind seared in the void, listening to a recording of silence played at top volume. Then a door opened, and a man poked his head in, a worker for the museum who’d come in earlier than expected. I couldn’t focus on him, and thought he might be unreal. He looked uncertain, then closed the door and locked it. Those sounds came to me as if through a tunnel. The room’s intensity, which had built up so slowly, dissipated quickly after that, like an airlock unsealed. In another couple of minutes I stood, and left. Elapsed time: 50 minutes. Out on the street, everything seemed louder, which was no surprise. It’s all hard surfaces and reverberation, concrete and cars. But I could articulate each part of the city’s soundscape. I tracked three simultaneous conversations on the No. 5 train, along with the crinkle of a candy wrapper and the falling pitch of the wheels on the tracks. The broken loudspeaker on a subway platform barked, harsher than before. Everyone, including me, was carrying some device that oozed sound of its own. Walking on the sidewalk, I got a lot of funny looks. My mouth was open, I realized. And I was staring too much.",1
25969,"A Call From Outer Space, or a Cosmic Wrong Number? - The New York Times","It’s probably just a piece of cosmic spam, the astrophysical equivalent of butt dialing. But nobody really knows for sure. The attention of the world’s astronomers has been riveted these last few days on a star in the constellation Hercules, wondering if the end of humanity’s cosmic loneliness was finally at hand. It was from that spot in Hercules that a team of Russian radio astronomers recorded a   burst of radio waves last year on May 15. But the Russians did not follow the usual protocol of alerting other observatories that could confirm the signal, and as a result nobody else knew about the pulse until a few days ago. That putative signal had the potential to be the fantasied “Hi there,” from another world that practitioners of the field known as SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, have been looking for over the last century. Or it could simply be a false alarm from terrestrial interference, a stray military transmission or some rare astrophysical misunderstanding. Astronomers already knew there was at least one planet, about 17 times the mass of Earth, circling that star, which is 94 light years from here and goes by the unheroic designation of HD164595. But there were also problems, the Russians, led by Alexander Panov of Lomonosov Moscow State University, realized. The signal appeared only once in 39 observations, and to produce the observed signal at such a distance would take a transmitter with the power of at least a trillion watts, comparable to the total energy consumption of all humankind. Moreover, the design of the Russian telescope, known as   a giant circle of antennas in the Caucasus near Georgia, leaves it susceptible, astronomers say, to radiation from unwanted directions, increasing the chances of interference from military or other terrestrial sources. Word finally got out a few days ago. Claudio Maccone, a member of the team and chairman of the SETI committee of the International Academy of Astronautics, circulated a description of the observations in advance of a SETI meeting to be held on Sept. 27 in Guadalajara, Mexico. While the report did not claim that this was an alien detection, it did say, “Permanent monitoring of this target is needed. ” In an email on Aug. 29, Dr. Maccone said he agreed. “I certainly share the view that it is likely not an intelligent signal,” he said. “Nevertheless it had to be PUBLISHED, rather than being kept secret for over a year, and this is what I did: convince the Russians to publish it. ” After the astronomy writer Paul Gilster reported it on his blog Centauri Dreams, the signal went supernova on the internet. But so far the results have been zilch. Starting on the evening of Aug. 28, astronomers from the SETI Institute of Mountain View, Calif. swung into action with the Allen Telescope Array, a set of antennas in Hat Creek, Calif. built specifically to look for alien broadcasts. After two nights of observing, Seth Shostak, spokesman for the institute reported, “We covered the frequencies observed by the Russians and more   …     No dice. ” Meanwhile astronomers from Breakthrough Listen, a new SETI project funded by the Russian philanthropist and entrepreneur Yuri Milner, used the Green Bank Telescope, in Green Bank, W. Va. the world’s largest steerable radio dish, to check out the star. They found nothing but noise. Indeed, according to Tass, the Russian news agency, the researchers had also concluded that their signal was a result of terrestrial interference. The observatory, the researcher Yulia Sotnikova said, was preparing an official disclaimer of any media claims of extraterrestrial contact. Everybody plans to keep looking, but for now the Hercules signal seems destined to join the other false alarms that have characterized the SETI endeavor, most notably the “wow” signal that appeared on the printout of an Ohio State radio telescope in 1977 but never reappeared. As Dr. Maccone said: “There were similar cases in the past, and probably there will be more in the future. The point is to PUBLISH everything and EXCHANGE DATA worldwide about the stars where they come from. ” Astronomers have been trying to tune in E. T. ever since Frank Drake, now at the University of California, Santa Cruz, aimed an antenna in 1960 at a pair of stars and thought he heard a signal  —   the first false alarm. But nothing has been able to discourage astronomers from a notion that is as powerful and simple as a poem: Radio signals can bridge the gulfs between stars more cheaply than spacecraft, allowing distant species to communicate by a sort of cosmic ham radio or galactic internet. There are more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way and some nine billion radio channels on which to listen  —   a “cosmic haystack” in the vernacular, of which only a minuscule fraction has been sampled to date. There is a lively and rich literature on what channels aliens might use and what kind of signals they might send, and an equally rich literature on why we haven’t seen any evidence of them (outside of the racks in supermarkets). Among the possible answers is that we are under quarantine, or that technological species kill themselves off before they get to the stage of reaching out. Or perhaps that we simply don’t have any idea what we are looking for. We know of only one example of life and intelligence in the universe, Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute once told me. That is of course our own biosphere. “In this field,” she said, “number two is the   number. We count one, two, infinity. We’re all looking for number two. ”",1
25970,"Reinventing Democracy in America Starts by Voting, Then Building an Accountability Movement","Reinventing Democracy in America Starts by Voting, Then Building an Accountability Movement Posted on Nov 2, 2016 ( The Prophet / CC BY-SA 2.0 ) 
Voting is supposed to be a constitutional right in the United States. But the sad truth is that voting is a privilege . This reality has been made colder since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. 
Steps have been taken to curtail the impact of that decision— Shelby County v. Holder —on the 2016 general election, but voter discrimination still exists. Some Americans have fewer rights than others. Compare minorities, the poor, immigrants, felons, ex-convicts and the elderly with well-off whites, the educated and so-called 1 percenters. Whose voices do you think are heard more? The current system has been designed to maintain the status quo and keep the disenfranchised from changing their status. Discriminatory voting laws compound the problem . 
  
According to the Brennan Center for Justice, new voting restrictions are in place in 14 states this year: “The new laws range from strict photo ID requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restrictions. Those 14 states are: Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.” 
Voter suppression is nothing new. In the latest issue of The New Yorker, Caleb Crain provides a history lesson in “ The Case Against Democracy ”: 
In the United States, élites who feared the ignorance of poor immigrants tried to restrict ballots. In 1855, Connecticut introduced the first literacy test for American voters. Although a New York Democrat protested, in 1868, that “if a man is ignorant, he needs the ballot for his protection all the more,” in the next half century the tests spread to almost all parts of the country. They helped racists in the South circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment and disenfranchise blacks, and even in immigrant-rich New York a 1921 law required new voters to take a test if they couldn’t prove that they had an eighth-grade education. About fifteen per cent flunked. Voter literacy tests weren’t permanently outlawed by Congress until 1975, years after the civil-rights movement had discredited them. 
The article reviews a new book called “Against Democracy,” by Jason Brennan, a political philosopher at Georgetown University who argues for “epistocracy,” a word (coined by another political philosopher, David Estlund of Brown) that means “government by the knowledgeable.” Brennan believes that uninformed voters do more damage than good, so decision-making should be left to the informed. In other words, voting should not be a duty for all. 
That’s a radical idea. But in a way, such thinking aligns with how the Founding Fathers viewed the electorate, Crain acknowledges. He cites a warning from James Madison: “There are particular moments in public affairs, when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind?” 
Madison wrote those words (under the pseudonym Publius) for Federalist No. 63 —an essay that was part of The Federalist Papers—to explain the concept of the United States Senate. He went on to say: 
The people can never willfully betray their own interests; but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every public act. 
The difference most relied on, between the American and other republics, consists in the principle of representation; which is the pivot on which the former move, and which is supposed to have been unknown to the latter, or at least to the ancient part of them. ... 
In the most pure democracies ... many of the executive functions were performed, not by the people themselves, but by officers elected by the people, and representing the people in their executive capacity. 
... 
Besides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage of facts, that the federal Senate will never be able to transform itself, by gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic body, we are warranted in believing, that if such a revolution should ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot guard against, the House of Representatives, with the people on their side, will at all times be able to bring back the Constitution to its primitive form and principles. Against the force of the immediate representatives of the people, nothing will be able to maintain even the constitutional authority of the Senate, but such a display of enlightened policy, and attachment to the public good, as will divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and support of the entire body of the people themselves. 
Here’s another radical idea: Instead of having only a few informed people make decisions for everyone, how about we make everyone informed by providing the same, free educational opportunities for every U.S. citizen? 
Over the 240 years of the American experiment, the nation has moved away from its early ideals. Democracy has been corrupted, becoming the perverted form of corporatocracy and plutocracy we now have. The only way we can fix the defects in our system is by voting in principled leaders, then insisting they follow through on what they promise. If they do not, we must vote them out and put people in power who do. 
Start in your own community. It will require some sacrifice. 
Lee Ellis knows about all about sacrifice . He spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He has written two books on honor, “ Engaging With Honor ” and “ Leading With Honor .” He has not lost faith in the United States and believes voting is a key to restoring honor to America. 
“When you become indifferent and refuse to stand up for your ideas, you forfeit and must live by the ideas of others,” Ellis told Truthdig in a telephone interview. “You are making a choice to let someone else make your choice for you. And I think that is a terrible way to live. We cannot afford to be indifferent about these key decisions. Evaluate the risk of the candidates. There are no risk-free choices. We’re always taking a risk. Which is the most likely to pursue the principles that you feel are important?” 
Apathy is no longer an option. It’s not too late for America, but we have to act fast. Now is no time to be timid. 
Look at the water protectors in Standing Rock in North Dakota. They are putting their lives on the line for us, our planet, the fate of generations. If you are a responsible U.S. citizen who cares about the future of our world, you have a role in our survival. That starts by voting. To be a responsible voter requires being informed. You don’t have to have a Ph.D. in political science or be the political equivalent of Ralph Nader . Anyone can know something . Everyone can do something . 
Research the candidates. Read up on ballot initiatives. Learn about down-ticket races. Check your sources—make sure they are trustworthy. Share what you know (in a respectful way) with friends and family and on social media. Encourage others to do the same.",1

ST: It is strangely reminiscent of the old Soviet times, when any criticism of Soviet policies was termed “anti-Soviet propaganda,” and was ascribed to some mysterious imperialist forces in the West that were out to subvert the Soviet Union and its “Fraternal Community of Socialist Nations.” It is rather funny that—more than a quarter of a century after the end of the Cold War—we see the exact replica of the mindset, and a state-financed reaction, on the side of the so-called liberal-democratic, free-market-oriented, “Western” members of NATO. It is also significant that one of the foremost critics of the Western policies in general, and in Ukraine in particular, is Vaclav Klaus, one of the most respected Czech politicians. 
My immediate thought is whether they regard Mr. Klaus—the elder statesman of the Czech Republic—as one of the exponents of the Russian propaganda who needs to be monitored and countered. My second thought is that, ultimately, it comes to the quality of information and analysis. If the makers of this new unit, fighting what they regard as Russian disinformation, are up against certain perfectly justified, rational, and well-reasoned criticism of Western policies, and those of NATO in particular, then they have a big problem. In this time and age, of the mainstream media being confronted by the social media, the Internet, they will have a problem, because the unspoken assumption is that the quality of information and analysis they can offer is better than what they regard as the Russian propaganda. 
As it happens, we have this counter-propaganda all the time, in the pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post, on the BBC, the CNN, and every flickering screen and every printed page all over the Western world. And yet . . . they are not doing a very good job. Ultimately, if we are looking at an informed and rational consumer of information, he or she will be able to make an astute judgment of who is in the right and who is actually a propagandist. 
Q: Srdja, if they consider this to be so important at this particular moment, why is this unit made up of only twenty people? 
ST: It could made up of only two people if they are well informed, capable of top-class analysis, and if they have strong arguments which can be used to counter what they regard as Russian disinformation. It boils down to what I mentioned earlier: the quality of information, and the quality of analysis. 
Q: Is it going to have any influence on anything at all? 
ST: Ultimately not. Obviously, the same job is being done by much better paid columnists of theWashington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde, the Frankfurter Rundschau—they are all up to the same thing: to discredit arguments against the global empire of the United States and its fellow travelers in Western Europe. If that job is not done much better by people who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros every year to do it in a systematic and coherent way, I don’t see any way for a bunch of twenty Czech bureaucrats to do it. 
Q: Let’s get back to the accusations that some Czech politicians have been throwing at Moscow, that they are forming the networks of pro-Russian groups that can be used to destabilize the country. How grounded are these accusations? 
ST: It reminds one of McCarthyism in the United States in the early 1950’s. If you are a “deviant” in your mindset, if you dare criticize the official line, if you say things that are outside the permitted parameters of rightspeak, then you must be an agent for a foreign power. It is a paranoid mindset, it is deeply antidemocratic, and it smacks of Stalinism. This is, of course, Stalinism in a postmodern-liberal guise, but it is not qualitatively different from the original model.",1

25978,The Grim Logic Behind Syria’s Chemical Weapons Attack - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The diplomatic situation had been looking bright for President Bashar   of Syria. With the help of Russia, he had consolidated his power, the rebels were on their heels and the United States had just declared that ousting him was not a priority. So why would Mr. Assad risk it all, outraging the world by attacking civilians with what Turkey now says was the nerve agent sarin, killing scores of people, many of them children? Why would he inflict the deadliest chemical strike since the 2013 attacks outside Damascus? Those attacks came close to bringing American military retaliation then. And in a stunningly swift reversal, Tuesday’s attack drew a response from President Trump: dozens of cruise missiles launched at a Syrian air base. One of the main defenses offered by Mr. Assad’s allies and supporters, in disputing that his forces carried out the strike on Tuesday, is that such an attack would be “a crazy move,” as one Iranian analyst, Mosib Na’imi, told the Russian   news site Sputnik. Yet, rather than an inexplicable act, analysts say, it is part of a carefully calculated strategy of escalating attacks against civilians. For years, at least since it began shelling neighborhoods with artillery in 2012, then bombing them from helicopters and later from jets, the Syrian government has adopted a policy of seeking total victory by making life as miserable as possible for anyone living in areas outside its control. Government forces have been herding defeated opponents from across the country into Idlib Province, where the chemical attack occurred. Starved and bombed out of their enclaves, they are bused under lopsided surrender deals to the province, where   groups maintain a presence the Syrian military uses as an excuse to bomb without regard for the safety of civilians. Dr. Monzer Khalil, Idlib Province’s health director, said such extreme tactics aimed to demonstrate the government’s impunity and to demoralize its foes. “It makes us feel that we are defeated,” said Dr. Khalil, whose gums bled after he was exposed to scores of chemical victims on Tuesday. “The international community will stay gazing at what’s happening  —   and observing the explosive barrels falling and rockets bombing the civilians and the hospitals and the civil defense and killing children and medical staff  —   without doing anything. ” “Militarily, there is no need,” said Bente Scheller, the Middle East director of the   Heinrich Böll Foundation. “But it spreads the message: You are at our mercy. Don’t ask for international law. You see, it doesn’t protect even a child. ” On Thursday, Syria’s foreign minister challenged accounts by witnesses, experts and world leaders that his government was involved. “I stress to you once again: The Syrian Army has not, did not and will not use this kind of weapons  —   not just against our own people, but even against the terrorists that attack our civilians with their mortar rounds,” the minister, Walid   said in Damascus. But the denial, as well as a Russian assertion that a bomb hit a chemical weapons depot controlled by the rebels, seemed perfunctory, almost without regard to the facts, which Western governments said pointed to a Syrian government hand. Critics of President Barack Obama, including President Trump, say that his decision not to enforce his “red line” on chemical attacks in 2013 convinced the Assad government it could get away with anything, and that it has been escalating its harsh tactics against civilians ever since. Since that “green light,” wrote Jihad Yazigi, an   Syrian economist, “Assad knows that a   attack against its civilians is a   public relations liability but a   political asset. ” That was only reinforced, critics say, by recent statements by American officials that it was time to accept the “political reality” of Mr. Assad’s grip on power. By showing it puts no limits on the tactics it uses, Mr. Yazigi wrote, “the regime shows to the world the West’s impotence and weakness. ” Dr. Khalil, 35, fled his job at a   hospital in 2011. The Syrian uprising was in its early days, with largely peaceful protests that faced crackdowns from security forces. He said he was threatened with arrest for treating wounded protesters. In 2015, a mix of   and other rebels, some supported by the United States and its allies, drove government forces from Idlib, the capital of Idlib Province. Dr. Khalil became the health director. The city then became a bombing target, and the Syrian government accused the Americans of backing the   group, then called the Nusra Front. “We are aware that we are in this Qaeda trap,” Dr. Khalil said. “But in Idlib we have 2. 2 million people, and how many Qaeda fighters? You cannot kill the two million for their sake. ” The fall of Idlib led to another turning point: Russia’s   entry into the conflict, adding its firepower to the Syrian government’s. Russia said it entered to fight the Islamic State, but directed most of its strikes at places farther west, like Idlib, where rival insurgents more urgently threatened government forces. Chlorine attacks continued  —   investigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations concluded the government had carried out at least three in 2014 and 2015  —   with little international reaction. Idlib’s population grew as rebels and civilians moved there from areas recaptured by Assad forces and allies. After Mr. Trump came into office, proclaiming a wish to work with Russia and maybe even Mr. Assad against the Islamic State, expectations grew that the international community would accept relegitimizing Mr. Assad. And last week came the statements from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, indicating effectively that Washington could accept Mr. Assad remaining in power. On Monday, Western officials were gathering in Brussels to weigh billions of dollars in reconstruction aid to the Assad government, amid opposition fears that they would drop their demand for a political transition first. By Thursday, however, American military officials were discussing a possible military strike on Syria, and Mr. Tillerson was saying there was “no role” for Mr. Assad in Syria’s future. And then Thursday  —   before dawn on Friday in Syria  —   Mr. Trump ordered the attack on the Shayrat air base, from which, he said, the chemical attack was launched. Witnesses described how Tuesday’s attack unfolded. That morning, a network of observers was, as usual, tracking the skies to warn residents and rescuers of possible airstrikes. They spotted Syrian aircraft and sent out warnings on  . Syrian   aircraft were then seen circling above Khan Sheikhoun at 6:47 a. m. and again at 6:51 a. m. One of the observers  —   based on long experience  —   believed that the planes might be carrying a chemical payload. “Guys, tell people to wear masks,” he warned. Witnesses put the attack itself at just before 7 a. m. A video of the area at that time shows three towering puffs of smoke and one smaller cloud. Dr. Khalil said he and his wife were drinking coffee at home at 8 a. m. when he got a call and rushed to Idlib’s central hospital. He found 60 patients already packing the wards. His nose began to itch, from the toxic substances, he believes. Back in Khan Sheikhoun, new airstrikes hit a hospital and a civil defense headquarters. Across the province, doctors were noticing symptoms similar to those from sarin. Some of the displaced people who wound up in Idlib in recent years come from the Damascus suburbs that were attacked with sarin in 2013. One, a media activist from near Damascus, Moaz   was sickened for two months by the 2013 attacks. Now living in Idlib, he was struck with the same vomiting and respiratory distress he remembered from that day. His voice remained hoarse on the telephone two days later.",1
25979,Trepidation at City College in Wake of President’s Abrupt Exit - The New York Times,"When students at the City College of New York, the flagship of the largest urban public university in the country, showed up for classes on Thursday for the first time since an extended holiday break, they returned to a vastly different campus from the one they left last Friday. That was when the college’s president, Lisa S. Coico, abruptly resigned, a day after The New York Times contacted officials with new questions about her administration’s handling of more than $150, 000 of her personal expenses  —   a subject that is currently being investigated by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn. By the time classes resumed after the break for Columbus Day and Yom Kippur, agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been spotted on campus, apparently to interview employees students were burning up social media with “Brace Yourself” memes inspired by the “Game of Thrones” TV series and the chancellor of the City University of New York system had convened emergency meetings to assuage the concerns of shellshocked faculty members and alumni. Small wonder, then, that many students and faculty and staff members interviewed on campus said they felt discombobulated by the torrent of troubling news. “There’s a mood of trepidation,” Ruth E. Stark, a distinguished professor of chemistry, said. “On the one hand, the handling of money has to be looked at carefully, and monitored carefully. But at the same time, I think this is a great concern about the multiplying investigations that will be enveloping us. ” Right now, two investigations are underway. The first is being handled by the office of Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. As part of that inquiry, additional subpoenas were issued in the last few days that, among other things, zeroed in on a memo related to Ms. Coico’s expenses that some college officials believe was fabricated to mislead prosecutors. CUNY, the college’s parent entity, and its Research Foundation, which manages the university’s research funds, were included in the new round of subpoenas. The second investigation is an internal one for CUNY being conducted by Andrew J. Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Soon, a third could be started: William C. Thompson Jr. a former New York City comptroller who is the new chairman of CUNY’s Board of Trustees, has urged the state inspector general to do a systemwide investigation of “all of the college foundations, alumni associations or other affiliated entities including the CUNY Research Foundation. ” The state provides the funding for CUNY’s   senior colleges. Ms. Coico, who has hired a lawyer, has declined to comment. Of more immediate concern at City College, though, is the leadership vacuum. For the next few weeks, the administrator in charge will be Mary E. Driscoll, the college’s new interim provost. The university’s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on Oct. 26 and appoint an interim president. After that, a search will begin for a permanent replacement, with the goal of having someone in place by September. To assure nervous faculty members and others, James B. Milliken, CUNY’s chancellor, visited City College’s Gothic campus early Tuesday morning, when its administrative offices were open, to voice his unwavering support for, and faith in, the college. In an interview, Mr. Milliken said he was encouraged by the shared belief that the college, which has produced 10 Nobel Prize winners and illustrious alumni like the former secretary of state Colin L. Powell and Andrew S. Grove, who was the chief executive and chairman of Intel Corporation, should focus on its future. “Whenever there’s a transition at a leadership level of an institution, particularly one that is fairly abrupt, there is a level of anxiety,” Mr. Milliken said. “That was one reason I wanted to be at City College when they opened the doors, the first day back at the office. We’re going to do everything we can to ensure that they have stable, talented leadership there. ” Many students said they did not have much contact with Ms. Coico, and rarely saw her on campus. Yelina Espinal, a    psychology major, said the only time she saw the former president was during freshman orientation she is now a senior. Still, Ms. Espinal was visibly disgusted with the news about Ms. Coico, as were many other students. “All the rumors about the things she’s done  —   it’s all over Facebook,” she said. “People are already upset about a lot of things on campus with the roofs leaking. Now we learn the extent that the president might be stealing? It’s ridiculous. ” Stephany Baez, 30, who works full time as a waitress while enrolled at the university, said she was offended by accusations that the president was pocketing extra money on top of her generous pay and benefits package, while she herself was struggling to pay for her classes. She also voiced frustration with the facilities, saying that escalators broke down routinely and that bedbugs had recently infested the library. “I’m so upset about this,” she said. “I struggle really hard. To find out that she’s being so greedy and taking advantage of students who are really having a hard time is really disheartening. ”",1
25980,Singers in Russian Military Choir Among 92 Feared Dead After Plane Crashes Into Black Sea - The New York Times,"SOCHI, Russia  —   A Russian aircraft bound for Syria carrying a famed military band to entertain Russia’s forces there crashed into the Black Sea moments after takeoff on Sunday, and the authorities said all 92 people aboard were believed dead. The cause of the crash is under investigation, although initial Russian news media reports indicated it was a technical failure rather than terrorism. The Russian military has had only minor casualties throughout its deployment in Syria, but the country has experienced a series of setbacks in recent days. On Monday, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated at an art exhibit in Ankara, with the killer yelling, “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!” That came not long after forces from the Islamic State recaptured the storied Syrian city of Palmyra, forcing the Russian garrison that had been stationed there since helping to take the city last spring to flee. The military plane, a   Tupolev   disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off from the resort town of Sochi. Russia’s official weather forecast agency said that conditions near the airport were “normal, easy,” the Interfax news agency reported. The airplane was technically fit, the Defense Ministry said. Wreckage of the plane, which was carrying 84 passengers and eight crew members, was found in the sea, most of it about one mile from shore, the Russian Defense Ministry said. No survivors have been found at the crash site, Russian officials said. Passengers on the flight, which originated in Moscow and stopped in Sochi to refuel, included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, the Russian military choir, who were traveling to Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. The band planned to serenade Russian personnel in Syria on New Year’s Eve. President Vladimir V. Putin deployed Russian armed forces in Syria in September 2015, ostensibly to fight terrorism but primarily to prop up President Bashar   the leader of the lone remaining Russian ally in the region, whose forces have been fighting an insurgency for nearly six years. Russian forces have been instrumental in helping the Damascus government regain the initiative, with the final rebels expelled from the besieged city of Aleppo on Thursday. Three journalists from Channel One, Russia’s main television station, were on the plane, as were journalists from the Zvezda and NTV television networks, news reports said. Yelizaveta P. Glinka, a prominent Russian philanthropist and a member of the presidential council on human rights and civil society, was also on the list of people on board. Mr. Putin recently honored Mrs. Glinka with a state award for her human rights and charity work. Valery V. Khalilov, the ensemble’s artistic director, was also on the plane, according to the list of passengers. Mr. Putin expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims, and he declared Monday a national day of mourning. (Christmas is not celebrated as an official holiday in Russia on Dec. 25, because the Russian Orthodox Church observes it on Jan. 7.) “First of all, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the families of our citizens, who died today, as a result of an aviation catastrophe over the Black Sea this morning,” Mr. Putin said in St. Petersburg, according to remarks published on the Kremlin’s website. He also ordered Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev to establish a state commission, headed by the transportation minister, Maxim Sokolov, to investigate the crash. The Defense Ministry said that 11 bodies had been recovered as search efforts continued, Russian news agencies reported. A memorial was installed inside the Sochi airport, and people brought candles and flowers. Relatives of the victims were whisked away by the authorities to a specially designated zone where they were treated by psychiatrists. Mr. Sokolov told journalists inside the terminal building that the rescue effort would not stop at night. “It is premature to say anything about the causes of this tragedy,” he told reporters. More than 30 vessels were deployed in the recovery operation, Mr. Sokolov said, and the Defense Ministry said that more than 100 divers had been sent to the crash site. Founded in the Soviet era, the Alexandrov Ensemble, which had performed in Syria earlier this year, is the official band of the Russian armed forces. It consists of an orchestra, a choir and a dance ensemble, and is one of the two Russian orchestras allowed to use the title Red Army Choir. The ensemble was founded by Aleksandr V. Aleksandrov, a prominent Soviet composer and the author of the music of the Russian anthem. His grandson Yevgeny told Meduza, a Russian news website, that “the best members of the ensemble died. ” “All the best soloists, the whole choir,” he said. “Everything will collapse now. The best ones are gone. ” Several independent news outlets in Russia reported that the Alexandrov Ensemble had planned to give a concert in Aleppo. In May, the Russian military had flown a symphony orchestra led by one of its   conductors, Valery Gergiev, to mark the reclaiming of Palmyra. Until recently, the   which was designed in the 1960s, was one of the most widely used civilian aircraft in Russian aviation. The plane that crashed on Sunday was made in 1983, underwent planned maintenance work in the fall, and was operated by an experienced pilot, the Defense Ministry said. Russian airlines have mostly replaced outdated Soviet planes with new ones in recent years and have vastly improved the overall safety record. Many government agencies continue to fly the   and other old Soviet aircraft, however. The age and reputation of the   as well as the fact that the aircraft had flown out of secure military airfields, meant that most senior officials speaking publicly ruled out the possibility that an attack had caused the crash. But there was speculation by a few aviation experts, echoed by some officials, that terrorism could not be ruled out given the suddenness with which the plane disappeared and the size of the debris field. “For us the worst version is an act of terrorism, because if this is the case, this will mean that we have paid another bill for Aleppo,” Vadim Lukashevich, an aviation expert, told Dozhd, an independent television station. In one of Russia’s most recent air disasters, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for planting a bomb onboard a Russian civilian Airbus that crashed in Egypt in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board in a flight from the Egyptian resort of Sharm   to St. Petersburg. Another   military plane crashed in eastern Siberia on Monday, seriously injuring 16 of the 39 people on board, and the aviation authorities recently grounded the country’s newest civilian airliner, the Sukhoi Superjet 100, because of concerns about metal fatigue.",1
25982,"After 6,000 Exorcisms, Priest Says ‘The Devil Is Afraid of Me’","A Mexican priest who has performed more than 6, 000 exorcisms in his   career says that he does not fear the devil, because the devil is afraid of him. [In a recent interview, exorcist Father Francisco López Sedano insisted that the devil exists and that he is not a mere personification of evil but an actual being. “Jesus often confronted Satan himself and spoke with him,” he said. “You do not talk with a thing, you talk to a person. ”  The priest, who normally treats three to five cases a day, says that he has personally spoken with the devil on many occasions. “Who are you to expel me?” Satan has challenged him. “And I answer: ‘I am nobody, but I come from Christ, your God and Lord and you leave right now, I command you in the name of Him to go away!” he said. Lopez Sedano said that Linda Blair’s portrayal of a possessed person in The Exorcist film is not so far from reality. “When the devil is present, anything can happen,” he asserts. One particularly memorable case was that of a boy in his late teens who “pushed five enormous, extremely heavy benches that not even 10 people could have moved. He had a tremendous strength,” he said. Possessed people “can climb walls, yes, and even fly,” he said. Lopez Sedano says he became an exorcist not by personal inclination but “out of necessity,” after witnessing some very serious and painful cases of demonic possession. “Before, I did not think the devil could act so aggressively. It seemed fanciful, not realistic. ” A fellow priest also told Father Lopez that fighting the Evil One was an obligation. “You have to get into this by the Lord’s command,” he said. The Word of God carries three mandates from Jesus, the priest added, “to preach the word of God, heal the sick and cast out demons. ” All three of these are still in force in the church, he said, but many priests do not dare to engage the devil because “they are afraid of him. ” Others, he said, simply do not believe in the devil. The priest said that he has had cases in which people have gone to their pastor with their problems, but he has responded: “You are imagining things, that doesn’t exist. ” And the person leaves without knowing what to do, “because at night ‘someone’ bothers him, hits him, throws him out of bed, throws him against the wall,” he said. Demonic possession manifests itself in many ways, Father Lopez says. “A person possessed by demons may start screaming, barking like a dog, shrieking or writhing on the ground like a snake. There are a thousand ways,” he said. The priest claims that he is not afraid because God protects him. “If he didn’t, nobody would get into this work,” he said. “The devil is afraid of me. ” What the devil looks for is “to turn us away from God,” the priest said. “He wants to make us lazy, tire us out, fill us with distrust, make us despair and hate. Everything negative,” he said. What he really likes is “to separate us from God, frighten us, threaten us, and keep us trembling,” he said. Lopez Sedano said that the devil often enters people because they let him in, because they play around with occult practices. “People let the devil in. He would not mess with us if we did not open doors for him,” he said. “That is why God forbids practicing magic, superstition, witchcraft, sorcery, divination, consultation of the dead and spirits and astrology. ” Those are the lands of “lying and deceit,” he said. According to the priest, consulting horoscopes is ridiculous, but can also be dangerous. Thinking that the stars influence our lives is “the biggest lie,” Lopez said. “They’re a million miles away! They are bodies made up of metals and gases, how are they going to influence us?” “The same goes for magic, which is to attribute to things a power they do not have,” the priest said. “Carrying around a horseshoe because it’s going to give me good luck is a lie,” he said. Despite the grim reality of the devil, Lopez Sedano says he keeps a positive attitude toward life. “My hope is confirmed because on the cross Christ already triumphed,” he said. “He won the absolute war,” he said.

25985,"Pillars of the West Shaken by ‘Brexit,’ but They’re Not Crumbling Yet - The New York Times","LONDON  —   On a day that blended dull ritual with undeniable historical import, Britain formally began its departure from the European Union with the delivery of a letter to Brussels, followed by lofty words from Prime Minister Theresa May in Parliament. Two years of grinding divorce negotiations now begin, with the outcome unclear, except that the talks are certain to be contentious and spiteful  —   and that the only sure winners will be lawyers and trade negotiators. For the first time, the European bloc is losing a member, not to mention its   economy. The multilateral architecture that has shaped the Western world since the aftermath of World War II has taken a severe blow, and as the letter was delivered on Wednesday, questions abounded about whether this pivot toward nationalism and   represented the beginning of a more volatile global era. When Britons voted last June to leave the European Union, the champions of “Brexit” argued that the country, with its exit, was at the front edge of a larger populist wave. Months later, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States only deepened the feeling that an   political contagion was sweeping across Western democracies, upending the established order. Britain, the argument went, would be a winner in this new era. Few people predicted the British exit, and fewer still predicted Mr. Trump’s victory. But few predicted where things stand now, either: The European Union, if still ailing and dysfunctional, is far from dead. Populist parties are sinking in the polls in Germany and underperformed in the Dutch elections this month. Opinion polls in many countries show continued public unhappiness with the bloc but little desire to see it fall apart. “No one is following Britain out of the E. U.,” Pierpaolo Barbieri wrote recently for Foreign Affairs, a magazine published by the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research group. The question now is whether some Europeans, having watched the first aftereffects of the vote to withdraw and the American presidential vote  —   political division in Britain and the fall of the pound, and political missteps in the Trump White House  —   are sobered by the chaos of the right. That thesis is speculative, too, and will be tested next month in France, where the traditional parties have imploded and the   nationalist Marine Le Pen, if victorious, has promised to take France out of the European Union. But for now, Emmanuel Macron, who is   is leading the polls. Picking winners at such a volatile moment is perilous, but many analysts agree that the British withdrawal, and the uncertainty it produced, has been good news for Russia, and possibly for China, as two large powers that can exercise greater leverage in negotiations with individual European capitals than with a tightly unified European bloc that, taken together, is a geopolitical powerhouse. “ ‘Brexit’ surely strengthens the disintegrative processes already underway in the E. U. and therefore is a boon” to Russia, said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at the   think tank Chatham House. “The E. U. is more powerful than any single actor, even Germany, so anything that diminishes a rival in the   terms in which Russia thinks strengthens the Russian voice in Europe. ” Britain’s absence at the European table could also help the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Partly pressed by Britain, the United States’ main ally, the European Union has been tough on Russia over its annexation of Crimea, and the bloc has moved to cut Europe’s dependence on Russian natural gas. Anything that shifts power in Brussels away from that   view is considered a plus for Moscow. The coming exit from the European Union has already turned Britain inward, with the government and the country’s powerful tabloid news media fixated on the particulars of its withdrawal: the uncertainties of whether the country will maintain access to the bloc’s single market demands that the country take control of its borders to stunt immigration and an insistence on “reclaiming sovereignty” by returning lawmaking powers to London. Those themes of national sovereignty and curbing immigration resonate across the Continent, which is why some saw the British exit as a political precursor and the European Union as an endangered species. In December, however, Austrians narrowly elected a   president, Alexander Van der Bellen, over Norbert Hofer of the   Freedom Party. In Spain, the populist Podemos party underperformed polling expectations last year and the conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, stayed in office. This month, the Dutch gave the     politician Geert Wilders fewer votes than expected in a northern European country similar in its political outlook to Britain. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel remains popular in the polls, although weakened by her long service in the job and by severe criticism of her 2015 “ ” immigration policy. The     Alternative for Deutschland is slipping, however, and Ms. Merkel’s main challenger is the   Martin Schulz of the Social Democrats, the former head of the European Parliament. Even Bulgaria, the European Union country considered most influenced by Russia, saw voters endorse the     party in elections last weekend. As European voters seem to be tentatively endorsing unity, Britain is confronted with widening divisions. On Tuesday, less than 24 hours before the exit letter was delivered to Brussels, the Scottish Parliament voted to demand a new referendum on independence from the United Kingdom. Such a referendum is unlikely to happen anytime soon  —   it requires the approval of the British government in Westminster  —   but the rising nationalism in Scotland is a reminder that London could get a taste of its own medicine. With her government desperate to maintain Britain’s standing in the world, Mrs. May has turned to President Trump. He and his chief political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, are deeply skeptical of multilateralism, free trade and “entangling alliances. ” While NATO may pass muster as a security shield (provided everyone pays up) the European Union, like the United Nations, seems an example of the world that Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon want to dismantle or, at the very least, weaken. Yet Mrs. May has also tried to present Britain as committed to globalization and to global trade  —   as, effectively, still open for business. It is a tricky circle to square, demonstrating how difficult it is to predict Britain’s future. Some envision the country’s fate as being a European equivalent of Singapore, sovereign and respected, a partner eagerly sought by the rest of the world. Others warn that Britain could be left much more isolated than it is now, especially since European leaders feel they must strike a hard bargain. “There is a political imperative that ‘Brexit’ not be seen as a success,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, “because every government in Europe is challenged to some degree by resurgent nationalists who would be encouraged and inspired by a ‘Brexit’ success. ” For those British lawmakers in favor of the withdrawal, like Jacob   a Conservative legislator, the exit “is a wonderful liberation for my country. ” The single market, he told Prospect magazine, “is a bureaucratic, highly regulated means of making British business more inefficient  —   it’s about having a closed,   Fortress Europe approach, rather than engaging with the world. ” There is “no political event in my lifetime that has been better or more exciting for the nation,” he added. But Mr. Leonard has his doubts. “Britain may be sailing off to sea,” he said, “but the welcoming arms won’t be that numerous. ”",1
25987,‘The Market Is Saturated’: Brooklyn’s Rental Boom May Turn Into a Glut - The New York Times,"From the roof of a building near the Atlantic Terminal transit hub in Brooklyn, the formerly expansive views of Manhattan are now blocked by a rising forest of towers, radiating off Flatbush Avenue. The sign for Junior’s restaurant, once impossible to miss, can be glimpsed only between the new construction. There are 19 residential towers either under construction or recently completed along the   section of Flatbush stretching from Barclays Center north to Myrtle Avenue. When all of them are finished, they will have added more than 6, 500 apartments  —   overwhelmingly rentals  —   to New York City’s housing stock. Another four buildings on Myrtle Avenue will add almost 1, 000 more units. There are so many new apartments in the neighborhood  —   roughly   of all rental units expected to become available in the city in 2016 and 2017, according to Nancy Packes Data Services, a research firm  —   that the Brooklyn rental market seems poised to zoom right past boom, to glut. “The market is saturated,” said Sofia Estevez, executive vice president at the developer TF Cornerstone, which will begin offering apartments in a     rental building at 33 Bond Street next spring. “I think it’ll take a couple years to stabilize. ” And just as overbuilding along Billionaires’ Row around 57th Street in Manhattan has caused prices to soften in the   market, the construction boom in this stretch of Brooklyn has prompted landlords to strike deals to fill their buildings, which dwarf the surrounding brownstones, rowhouses and tenements. At 7 DeKalb, a new   tower atop the City Point mall complex, the landlord is offering two months of free rent with a   lease, and use of the building’s fitness center and other amenities for a year without charge. That means a     place can be had for $3, 428 a month a     apartment goes for $5, 057. The Gotham Organization, the developer of 250 Ashland Place, a   tower with 586 units, and Two Trees Management, which is building 300 Ashland Place, a   tower near the Brooklyn Academy of Music, are offering similar “free rent” periods: one and two months gratis, respectively, with a new lease. With the discount, a   at 300 Ashland Place is being offered at $3, 375. Elsewhere, landlords are offering as much as four months free of charge. In at least one older building  —   meaning it went up in 2011  —   the landlord is offering existing residents   leases with no increase in rent for the first year in order to keep tenants who may be drawn to newer buildings. “It’s pretty astonishing,” said Gabby Warshawer, director of research at CityRealty, a research firm. “Clearly there’s a lot of supply right now. We’re seeing longer lease terms, which is fairly new. And months of free rent. ” Free rent is hardly what you would expect in Brooklyn, where demand for housing has been rising for a decade, driven by the borough’s reputation as a haven of youth, hipness and    entrepreneurialism. But the original hip neighborhood, Williamsburg, is now expensive. And with the pending temporary shutdown of the L subway line in 2019 lengthening the commute into Manhattan, that neighborhood is no longer as appealing. The boom in this corner of Brooklyn, which has one of the biggest transit centers in the city, owes a lot to the city’s 2004 rezoning of the downtown area to encourage the development of office towers and some residential buildings that could compete with Jersey City for back office operations. At first, there was little activity because the city was offering tenants and developers enormous subsidies to rebuild and move to Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the creation of an arts district around the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Barclays arena at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, and the adjoining Atlantic Yards development, now known as Pacific Park, inspired interest in the area. And the city’s population has swelled, to an estimated 8. 6 million people a year ago from 8. 2 million people in 2010, setting off a seemingly unquenchable thirst for housing, especially given job growth in Brooklyn, which outpaces the city over all. Developers and consultants are not predicting that rents will plunge, but they do expect them to stagnate and perhaps ease in the short term. “We’ve had a big   in rents,” said David Schwartz of Slate Property Group, which is developing a building at 1 Flatbush Avenue with 160 rental apartments, “but I don’t think we’ll see any significant growth in the next couple of years. ” Jonathan J. Miller, president and chief executive of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal and consulting firm, contends that the problem is not so much “too many units. ” “It’s too many units skewed to the upper end of the market,” above $3, 500 a month in rent, he continued. “The top of the market is soft for both rentals and condos. That’s where the bulk of the new supply is coming. ” Gary Barnett, founder of Extell Development Company, plans to start the third tower at City Point by the end of the year, but he is unsure whether it will be rentals or condominiums. The units, he said, will not be “superluxury. ” The Brodsky Organization, another developer, is finishing the second tower at the City Point complex with 440 apartments. Indeed, in a study of Brooklyn rents, Mr. Miller found that while median rents on   apartments had climbed by 50 percent to $2, 481 from 2009 to 2016, those at the borough’s highest end had fallen by about 4 percent, to a median of $4, 783. But nearly   of the apartments  —   a total of 1, 654 units  —   in the Flatbush corridor are reserved for     and   tenants under the city’s   housing program, which offered developers generous property tax breaks for setting aside 20 percent of a project’s apartments for such tenants. At the Hub, a   tower at 333 Schermerhorn Street with 750 apartments, 150 units are subsidized for poor and   families, while 76 of the 379 rentals at 300 Ashland Place and 200 of the 250 units at 7 DeKalb Avenue are set aside for   tenants. Roughly half of the subsidized apartments are connected to the first four buildings now under construction at the vast Pacific Park project next to Barclays Center and just south of Atlantic Terminal. That complex benefits from an enormous public investment. Some housing advocates, however, say there are still not enough apartments for the   tenants being driven out of the area by gentrification. They point out that the developer Forest City Ratner got 80, 000 applications for 181 subsidized apartments at 461 Dean Street in Pacific Park. Others complain that developers are not building the infrastructure required for such a large influx of residents. Developers are taking solace from a coming slowdown in the construction of rental buildings, with the number expected to fall to almost zero in 2018. That is partly because of the demise in January of the   program. And now 12 years after the Downtown Brooklyn rezoning, some developers are finally moving forward with plans for several office projects as well. “People really want to be living and working in Brooklyn, and that’s why you’ve seen so many developers flocking to this area,” said Amy Rose,   of Rose Associates, which is putting up a   building with 369 apartments at 210 Livingston Street with its partner Benenson Capital Partners. Mr. Schwartz, who is building the Slate tower at 1 Flatbush Avenue, said he was not worried about the number of buildings going up. Brooklyn, he said, is still “the coolest place on the planet. ”",1
25988,"The Dangers of ‘Polypharmacy,’ the Ever-Mounting Pile of Pills - The New York Times","Dr. Caleb Alexander knows how easily older people can fall into   polypharmacy. Perhaps a patient, like most seniors, sees several specialists who write or renew prescriptions. “A cardiologist puts someone on good,   medications for his heart,” said Dr. Alexander,   of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness. “An endocrinologist does the same for his bones. ” And let’s say the patient, like many older adults, also uses an    reflux drug and takes a daily aspirin or a zinc supplement and fish oil capsules. “Pretty soon, you have an    man who’s on 14 medications,” Dr. Alexander said, barely exaggerating. Geriatricians and researchers have warned for years about the potential hazards of polypharmacy, usually defined as taking five or more drugs concurrently. Yet it continues to rise in all age groups, reaching disturbingly high levels among older adults. “It’s as perennial as the grass,” Dr. Alexander said. “The average senior is taking more medicines than ever before. ” Tracking prescription drug use from 1999 to 2012 through a large national survey, Harvard researchers reported in November that 39 percent of those over age 65 now use five or more medications  —   a 70 percent increase in polypharmacy over 12 years. Lots of factors probably contributed, including the introduction of Medicare Part D drug coverage in 2006 and treatment guidelines that (controversially) call for greater use of statins. But older people don’t take just prescription drugs. An article published in JAMA Internal Medicine  using a longitudinal national survey of people 62 to 85, may have revealed the fuller picture. More than a third were taking at least five prescription medications, and almost   were using dietary supplements, including herbs and vitamins. Nearly 40 percent took    drugs. Not all are imperiled by polypharmacy, of course. But some of those products, even those that sound natural and are available at health food stores, interact with others and can cause dangerous side effects. How often does that happen? The researchers, analyzing the drugs and supplements taken, calculated that more than 8 percent of older adults in 2005 and 2006 were at risk for a major drug interaction. Five years later, the proportion exceeded 15 percent. “We’re not paying attention to the interactions and safety of multiple medications,” said Dima Qato, the lead author of the JAMA Internal Medicine article (Dr. Alexander was a  ) and a pharmacist and epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “This is a major public health problem. ” She was stunned to discover, for instance, that the use of   fish oil supplements had quadrupled over five years. Her research suggests that almost one in five older adults now takes them. Users probably believe fish oil helps their hearts. But Dr. Qato pointed out fish oil capsules lacked regulation and evidence of effectiveness, and can cause bleeding in patients taking blood thinners like warfarin (brand name: Coumadin). Though drug interactions can occur in any age group, older people are more vulnerable, said Dr. Michael A. Steinman, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying commentary. Most have multiple chronic diseases, so they take more drugs, putting them at higher risk for threatening interactions. The consequences can also be more threatening. Say a drug makes older patients dizzy. “They’re more prone to fall, because they don’t have the same reserves of balance and strength” as the young or   Dr. Steinman said. “And if they do fall because they’re dizzy, they’re more likely to get hurt. ” Some common combinations that cropped up in the study and could spell trouble: aspirin and the   drug clopidogrel (Plavix) both blood thinners that together increase the risk of bleeding with   use aspirin and naproxen (Aleve)    drugs that when combined can cause bleeding, ulceration or perforation of the stomach lining. Dr. Qato recalled reviewing the medications of a    man taking both the cholesterol drug simvastatin (Zocor) and the blood pressure medication amlodipine (Norvasc)  —   the most common combination of interacting drugs that emerged in her study. Statins, along with their   properties, can cause muscle pain and weakness Norvasc heightens that risk. A different blood pressure drug  —   there are many alternatives  —   would be a safer choice, Dr. Qato said. Yet almost 4 percent of the older adults in her study took both drugs. Moreover, though her patient wasn’t experiencing problems, he was also taking garlic and   supplements, which can interact with prescription medications. “Did you tell your doctor you were on them? ’” Dr. Qato recalled asking. “He said, ‘No, why should I? If it was important, why didn’t he ask me? ’” A reasonable question. A recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine, however, found that more than 42 percent of adults didn’t tell their primary care doctors about their most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines, including a quarter of those who relied most on herbs and supplements. Usually, that was because the physicians didn’t ask and the patients didn’t think they needed to know in a few cases, doctors had previously discouraged alternative therapies, or patients thought they would. And they might, especially for older patients with complex regimens. “I’m not a big fan of supplements,” Dr. Alexander tells patients taking lots of vitamins, supplements and herbal remedies. “I think the vast majority of evidence raises serious questions about their effectiveness or, in some cases, their safety. They’re less well regulated than prescription medications. I think you’d be better off stopping them. ” Patients often resist, he said, and “they’re the captain of their own ship. ” So he explains the risks and benefits, and negotiations ensue. Often, though, patients don’t know that a daily aspirin, Prilosec OTC or fish oil can interact with other drugs. Or they’re confused about what they’re actually taking. Dr. Steinman recalled asking a patient to bring in every pill he took for a   brown bag review. He learned that the man had accumulated four or five bottles of the same drug without realizing it, and was ingesting several times the recommended dose. Ultimately, the best way to reduce polypharmacy is to overhaul our fragmented approach to health care. “The system is not geared to look at a person as a whole, to see how the patterns fit together,” Dr. Steinman said. In the meantime, though, patients and families can ask their physicians for brown bag reviews, including every supplement, and discuss whether to continue or change their regimens. Pharmacists, often underused as information sources, can help coordinate medications, and some patients qualify for medication reviews through Medicare. “We spend an awful lot of money and effort trying to figure out when to start medications,” Dr. Alexander said, “and shockingly little on when to stop. ”",1
25993,Toyota Recalls 1.4 Million Vehicles as 2nd Major Airbag Maker Is Under Scrutiny - The New York Times,"Public concern about faulty automobile airbags spread to a second major supplier on Wednesday, after Toyota recalled 1. 43 million Prius and Lexus models equipped with bags made by Autoliv, a big   manufacturer. Although no injuries have been reported from the problem, there have been incidents in which the Autoliv bags deployed spontaneously in parked vehicles, sending metal pieces of the inflater into the cars’ cabins. The problem sounded ominously similar to issues with faulty airbags made by another major supplier, Takata, which have been linked to 14 known deaths and more than 100 injuries. Takata’s airbags have been the target of the largest safety recall in automotive history. Fourteen automakers have recalled more than 60 million Takata airbags in the United States, and millions more worldwide. Autoliv, based in Stockholm, provides airbags to most of the major auto companies and is supplying many of the replacement inflaters being fitted in cars affected by the Takata recalls. Autoliv and Takata, together with the American supplier TRW and the Japanese maker Daicel, provide   of the global supply of airbag inflaters. “Inflaters are one of the most complex automotive components to manufacture,” said Scott Upham, chief executive of the automotive consulting firm Valient Market Research. Airbag makers need to have extensive experience in chemistry, explosives, as well as quality control, he said. “This is the reason why there are so few inflater suppliers in the industry,” he said. Autoliv’s problem also underscored the challenges of overseeing the work of subcontractors in the making of crucial auto safety equipment. The company on Wednesday said substandard welds on inflaters made by a subcontractor from 2010 to 2012 were responsible for the problems leading to Toyota’s recall on Wednesday. The recall covered two models of Toyota hybrid vehicles, the Prius and the Lexus CT200h, from 2010 to 2012. They were equipped with Autoliv   airbags, which are fitted in the car’s side roof rails and meant to protect occupants in   crashes. Toyota did not name the airbag supplier when it announced the recall in Tokyo on Wednesday, but Autoliv later identified itself and said it was cooperating with the recall. Autoliv stressed that its airbag defect had caused no known injuries or deaths. And it was quick to distance itself from Takata’s woes, which have involved driver and   passenger airbags. “They are extremely different cases,” Thomas Jonsson, a spokesman for Autoliv, said Wednesday. Still, the defect in the Autoliv airbag inflaters share some similarities with the fault in Takata’s, raising concerns about possible wider manufacturing and design issues. In both cases, the airbag inflater can break apart when the bag engages, sending metal parts into the car’s cabin. And in both cases, high temperatures appear to play a role. All seven incidents known to Autoliv had occurred in parked cars in hot weather, Mr. Jonsson said. Echoing language initially used by Takata, Autoliv was still investigating the “root cause” of the defect, he said. At the heart of Takata’s defect is its propellant, the explosive that helps inflate the airbag in a tiny fraction of a second. Takata’s propellant is based on a solid compound called ammonium nitrate, which can break down over time when exposed to moisture or high temperatures. And in its   state, the compound can burn violently, causing the inflater to overpressurize and explode. In one recent incident, a Texas teenager was killed when an inflater fragment severed an artery in her neck. Autoliv does not use ammonium nitrate in its airbags, Mr. Jonsson said. Instead, its   inflaters use stored compressed gas and a different solid propellant to inflate the airbag. A welding problem in metal tubing made by an Autoliv subcontractor was causing a crack to appear in the inflater, Mr. Jonsson said, and in hot conditions, the gas could overpressurize, causing the inflater to break in two. He said the subcontractor deviated from approved manufacturing processes between 2010 and 2012, resulting in the defect. But that process has since been fixed, he said. Mr. Jonsson disputed Toyota’s description of the defect in its filing with Japanese regulators, which warned that inflater fragments could burst into the car’s cabin. Mr. Jonsson said that in six of the seven incidents, the broken parts of the inflater had stayed put or had simply dropped out in one case, there was “more movement. ” Autoliv supplied the inflater in question to four other automakers. Mr. Jonsson refused to name those automakers, however, saying Autoliv was not aware of any airbag incidents in their cars. Those automakers are not conducting recalls. Autoliv said in a regulatory filing in April that it was investigating six incidents related to its airbags, and possible recall costs of $10 million to $40 million. But the details of its airbag defect had not been known. Toyota on Wednesday issued a second recall in Japan, to fix a possible fault with a mechanism in vehicles’ fuel tanks that releases evaporated fuel.",1
25995,The Bangladeshi Traffic Jam That Never Ends - The New York Times,"Of all the dysfunctions that plague the world’s megacities, none may be more pernicious than bad (really, really bad) traffic. Sitting still in Dhaka, where bad design takes on epic proportions. I WAS IN DHAKA, which is to say I was stuck in traffic. The proposition might more accurately be phrased the other way around: I was stuck in traffic, therefore I was in Dhaka. If you spend some time in Bangladesh’s capital, you begin to look anew at the word “traffic,” and to revise your definition. In other cities, there are vehicles and pedestrians on the roads occasionally, the roads get clogged, and progress is impeded. The situation in Dhaka is different. Dhaka’s traffic is traffic in extremis, a state of chaos so pervasive and permanent that it has become the city’s organizing principle. It’s the weather of the city, a storm that never lets up. Dhakaites will tell you that the rest of the world doesn’t understand traffic, that the worst traffic jam in Mumbai or Cairo or Los Angeles is equivalent to a good day for Dhaka’s drivers. Experts agree. In the 2016 Global Liveability Survey, the quality of life report issued annually by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Dhaka ranked 137th out of 140 cities, edging out only Lagos, Tripoli and   Damascus its infrastructure rating was the worst of any city in the survey. Like other megacities of the developing world, Dhaka is both a boomtown and a necropolis, with a thriving   market, a growing middle class and a lively cultural and intellectual life that is offset by rampant misery: poverty, pollution, disease, political corruption, extremist violence and terror attacks. But it is traffic that has sealed Dhaka’s reputation among academics and development specialists as the great symbol of   urban dysfunction, the world’s most broken city. It has made Dhaka a surreal place, a town that is both frenetic and paralyzed, and has altered the rhythms of daily life for its 17. 5   residents. Not long ago, the   Daily Star newspaper published an article titled “5 Things to Do While Stuck in Traffic. ” Suggested activities included “catching up with friends,” reading and journaling. The first chapter of my own Dhaka journal begins in March of last year, on a highway that runs south from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport into the center of town. If you do a web search for this stretch of road, you may come across a Facebook page titled “Highway to Hell, Airport Road. ” Photographs posted online reveal the nature of the hell, aerial shots capturing a scrum of automobiles strewn at odd angles across eight lanes of road. It looks like a Matchbox set that has been scattered by an angry toddler: the morning commute as a cosmic temper tantrum. These images had me prepared for the worst. Yet on my flight to Dhaka I was told that the traffic in the city would be unusually light. For weeks, Bangladesh had been gripped by a hartal, a nationwide general strike and “transportation blockade. ” The hartal, called by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was an effort to pressure Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina into holding new elections. The strike had disrupted everyday life in the capital, with street demonstrations and sporadic violence causing Dhaka’s denizens to curb their normal routines. It had accomplished the seemingly impossible, breaking the logjam on Dhaka’s streets. A Bangladeshi on my flight explained the situation. “In Dhaka, you have either horrible traffic or really horrible traffic,” he said. “But with the hartal, there will be almost no traffic. Traffic will be O. K. ” Horrible traffic, really horrible traffic, almost no traffic, O. K. traffic  —   it takes just a few minutes in Dhaka to realize that these are not scientific terms. When my plane touched down I caught a taxi, which exited the airport into a roundabout before making its way onto the infamous highway. There, unmistakably, was a traffic jam: cars and trucks, as far the eye could see, stacked up in a configuration that bore no clear relationship to the lanes painted on the blacktop. My cab nosed into the convoy. Whereupon a crawl commenced. The traffic rolled south for 20 seconds. The traffic stopped. My cab idled for a couple of minutes at a dead standstill. Then, for mysterious reasons, it crept forward again. Occasionally, the traffic would flow unimpeded for a minute or so, reaching a clip of perhaps 15 miles per hour. But soon we’d lurch to a halt again. It was the kind of    routine I’d experienced on American interstates, the “  ” conditions that traffic reporters describe on news radio, shouting something about a jackknifed   over thumping helicopter rotors. In this case, though, the problem was not an accident. The problem was Dhaka. It was hot and I was  . I dozed off. When I snapped awake, about an hour later, the congestion had thickened and the scenery had turned frantic. We were in the heart of the city now, penned in by surging pedestrians and hundreds of vehicles competing for space on a wide road called Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue. There were passenger cars and puttering     rickshaws. There were buses so   with passengers that many riders were forced onto the exterior, clinging to open doorways and crouched on rooftop luggage racks. There were cargo tricycles, known locally as “vans,” heading to markets bearing heaping payloads of bamboo, watermelons, metal pipes, eggs, live animals. And, of course, there were the iconic Dhaka passenger vehicles, bicycle rickshaws. Officially, rickshaws are banned on major thoroughfares like Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, but there they were, in vast phalanxes, their bicycle bells pealing above the roar of the traffic jam. Eventually, my taxi reached a roundabout, and we turned left onto another thoroughfare, the Panthapath Tejgaon Link Road. There, the cabdriver executed a   and a tricky sequence of maneuvers to win a place in a feeder lane that permitted entrance to the driveway of my hotel. The lane was empty: our final hundred yards of terrain to travel, and our first stretch of open road. The distance from airport to hotel was eight and a half miles. The trip had taken two and a half hours. We wheeled into the hotel’s driveway and the cabby spun around to offer his verdict. “Some traffic,” he said. “Not so bad. ” “BANGLADESH IS NOT so much a nation as a condition of distress,” wrote the journalist William Langewiesche in 2000. It sounds like an overstatement, but to behold the gridlocked streets of Dhaka is to see distress in action, or rather, in inaction. The stalled traffic in the capital city is symptomatic of the nation’s broader woes, in particular population growth, which is moderate by the standards of the developing world, but disastrous given the size of Bangladesh. Fundamentally, traffic is an issue of density: It’s what happens when too many people try to squeeze through too small a space. Bangladesh is the 12th most densely settled nation on earth, but with an estimated 160 million citizens it is by far the most populous, and the poorest, of the countries at the top of the list. To put the matter in different terms: The landmass of Bangladesh is   the size of Russia, but its population exceeds Russia’s by more than 25 million. Bangladesh’s density problem is magnified in Dhaka, in part because, practically speaking, Dhaka is Bangladesh. Nearly all of the country’s government, business, health care and educational institutions, and a large percentage of its jobs, are concentrated in Dhaka. Each year, 400, 000 new residents pour into the capital, a mass migration that has made Dhaka the world’s most densely settled megacity, and one of the fastest growing. The town that those millions inhabit almost completely lacks the basic infrastructure and rule of law that make big cities navigable. There are just 60 traffic lights in Dhaka, and they are more or less ornamental few drivers heed them. The main problem with Dhaka’s anarchic streets, though, is that there aren’t enough. The Daily Star has reported that just 7 percent of Dhaka is covered by roads. (In places like Paris and Barcelona, models of   urban planning, the number is around 30 percent.) Footpaths are also an issue. There are too few sidewalks in Dhaka, and those that exist are often impassable, occupied by vendors and masses of poor citizens who make their homes in curbside shanties. The usual solution to congestion in cities like Dhaka is to move commuters under the streets rather than over them. But Dhaka has no subway, and no concrete plans to build one. The problem is compounded by the growing   appeal of private transport: a vogue for automobiles among Dhaka’s middle classes that is adding tens of thousands of new vehicles to the city’s streets every year. By the government’s own estimate, Dhaka’s traffic jams eat up 3. 2 million working hours each day and drain billions of dollars from the city’s economy annually. Traffic takes another kind of toll on the lives and minds of Dhakaites. “The city is atomized,” says Sarwar Jahan, a professor of urban and regional planning at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. “People cannot socialize because of the traffic problems. You can only occasionally go to a friend’s house or relatives. It simply takes too long. ” It is wrong, in other words, to speak of Dhaka’s traffic as an inconvenience even “crisis” is too mild a term. Adnan Morshed, an associate professor of architecture and planning at the Catholic University of America, has called Dhaka’s congestion “a vast urban pathology” that “continues to kill. ” Bangladesh’s thriving textile industry has given the nation’s economy a jolt, but analysts warn that if the capital cannot solve its traffic and infrastructure problem, such gains will prove fleeting  —   that progress itself may grind to a standstill.   roads are the indelible image of Dhaka’s agony. They may also be its single greatest cause. DHAKA’S TRAFFIC OVERLOAD is a sensory overload. You can smell and taste it: The exhaust fumes tickle your nostrils and coat your mouth, leaving an acrid taste on your tongue. You can  —   often, you must  —   reach out and touch the traffic, executing defensive   maneuvers to ward off vehicles and fellow pedestrians as you scramble across packed streets. But the traffic hits you most forcefully in your ears. Some historians claim that the city’s name derives from the dhak, a big drum with a clattering sound. True or not, there’s no mistaking the pounding that the city gives to your auditory nerves. Traffic is Dhaka’s deafening music, a dissonant theme song of shouting drivers, rumbling engines and, leading the attack, honking horns: vocals, bass,   brass. That din is the sound of aggression. Dhaka’s drivers may be the most brutish and pitiless on earth. They may also be some of the best, if your idea of skillful driving is expansive enough to include the lawlessness and daredevilry that Dhaka demands. One afternoon I hailed an   near the    National Cricket Stadium and took a long, meandering journey through some of the city’s most heavily trafficked streets. Dhakaites call   “CNGs,” because they run on compressed natural gas. They’re the kind of vehicles you find all over urban Asia, essentially small metal boxes, propped atop three wheels and divided into two tiny compartments, one for the driver, and another, slightly larger but still a tight squeeze, for passengers. In Dhaka, they’re painted forest green, nearly all of them are dirty and dinged up, and they make a lot of loud, unpleasant noise snarling through the streets. They’re scruffy, ornery little machines, the piratical cousins of golf carts. My CNG was piloted by an unsmiling man who looked to be in his late 20s. On the road, he was relentless. He vied for every centimeter of roadway in thick traffic and sped as fast as possible when congestion eased. We were in one of the busiest parts of town now, on Bir Uttam Rafiqul Islam Avenue, a wide street lined with malls and crammed with shoppers. Another mall, of a sort, had sprung up on the road itself. In Dhaka, a traffic jam is an economic opportunity: Vehicles are descended on by vendors hawking bottles of water, peeled cucumbers, books. Crime is an issue, too. Once, CNGs had no doors, but wire doors were added as protection from muggers who prey on riders in stalled traffic. Enterprising thieves have been known to drop in on passengers, clambering on top of CNGs and slicing through their canvas roofing to gain entry. The weapon of choice for some muggers is Tiger Balm, the heat rub, which they smear on victims’ eyes to disable them. My driver’s modus operandi was to keep his CNG in motion no matter what, even in    conditions. When he couldn’t push the thing forward vertically, he moved horizontally, crossing lanes of traffic by beating out a nattering pattern on his horn, nosing his way in between vehicles and forcing other drivers to budge in turn, even if the only movement possible was an inch or two. He kept repeating two syllables, barking at fellow commuters in between horn blasts: “ !” he cried. “ !  !  !” Later, I asked a friend who speaks Bengali to translate the word for me. Aste, it turns out, means “slowly, gently. ” There is one form of transportation in Dhaka that might be deemed gentle, at least by the city’s    standards. Bicycle rickshaws are the quaintest and most ubiquitous of all the vehicles on Dhaka’s streets. No one is certain about the size of the city’s rickshaw fleet. (Only a fraction of the vehicles are officially licensed.) Most estimates put the number upward of 200, 000 some reckon there are several times that many. Arguing about rickshaws is as big a pastime in Dhaka as riding them. There have been many proposals to ban the machines, but the efforts have always been beaten back. Some contend that rickshaws are the vehicles   to   roads, and the most environmentally friendly. Others say that they are inefficient, that four rickshaws rolling abreast on a Dhaka street take up the square footage of a bus while transporting just eight passengers. One thing that everyone agrees on is that Dhaka’s rickshaws look great. They have been called “moving museums. ” They’re elaborately appliquéd with tinsel and tassels their frames bear colorful paintings of flowers,   portraits, heroic images of Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence, pastoral and urban scenes. Scrutinize the cityscapes painted on rickshaws and you will note an irony. Invariably they show a dreamily placid city, with swooping birds and sunsets blazing behind turreted towers. As for the roads depicted in the paintings: They are tidy, tranquil, serenely  . FOR THE FORESEEABLE future, those rickshaw paintings are the closest thing to orderly street scenes that you’ll find in Dhaka. When experts are asked about solutions to the city’s woes, they recite a familiar litany. They talk about traffic lights, dedicated rickshaw lanes, arterial roads, light rail. They speak of decentralization, of easing the burden on Dhaka by developing secondary cities like Chittagong and Khulna. The government, for its part, is touting the    $1. 14 billion Dhaka Elevated Expressway, whose construction began in August of 2015. But skepticism about such projects runs deep in Dhaka, where progress has so often been stymied by government ineptitude and corruption. In the meantime, the capital’s roadways seethe. It takes just a few days in Dhaka to acclimate, and to develop an affection for the city’s impregnable streets. For a greenhorn, the traffic offers a novel perspective on an alien city. I learned to appreciate the way that 360 degrees of   traffic transformed sight lines, collapsing space and perspective, shattering Dhaka’s scenery into Cubist shards: splashes of color a flash of a painted sign on a wall a glimpse of a driver’s beard in his truck’s rearview mirror a pile of corrugated metal siding, surreally floating a dozen feet in the air, the payload of an unseen cargo tricycle. I knew, of course, that it was unseemly for a visitor from one of the world’s richest cities to aestheticize the chaos and dysfunction of one of its poorest. Traffic in Dhaka is not just a nuisance. It is poverty, it’s injustice, it’s suffering. Yet nearly everyone I met in Dhaka spoke of the traffic as a trial by fire, a test of mettle, a horror that is also a perverse source of pride. One woman, a lifelong Dhaka resident, told me she “missed the jams” when she lived abroad: In the big cities of Europe and America, the relative lack of congestion unnerved her. When you make it through a day in Dhaka, when you make it across a snarled intersection, you have triumphed against the odds, and over the gods. The town puts you in a philosophical frame of mind. Dhaka teaches that travel is hell, but it also reminds you of the primitive wonder of travel, the truth that, to complete any journey, no matter how quotidian, is to conquer space, and  —   depending just how awful the congestion is on the Mirpur Road  —   to subdue time. When the day came for my return to New York, I’d been in Dhaka long enough to have learned its golden rule of commuting: Leave early. So I arranged for a   call and at 4:45 a. m. more than five hours before my flight’s boarding time, I staggered into a waiting taxi. The cabdriver assured me that the traffic at that hour would not be so bad. Lo and behold, he was right. The sun hadn’t yet risen, and the taxi went hurtling through the black streets of central Dhaka. There was no traffic  —   zilch. We gained the Airport Road, and whizzed faster still. I watched the kilometers tick off on the dashboard speedometer and I rolled down my window. As the taxi revved past 50 miles per hour, we seemed to be flying. Then, a mile or so south of our destination, a formation of cars and trucks and CNGs pressed up against us, the taxi slowed and suddenly we were earthbound again: on a   road in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We stopped, we started, we stopped again. The cause of the congestion was unclear, but it was obvious that I’d have no trouble making my flight. So I relaxed: I was going to relish the madness one last time. Eventually, the speedometer nudged a hair above five miles per hour, and as we started to crawl forward again, a thought stole into my mind, proof that Dhaka had done its work on me. You call this traffic? C’mon. This isn’t traffic.",1
25997,"California Today: What, Exactly, Is in Your Sushi? - The New York Times","Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) JoAnna Klein, a science writer, brings us today’s introduction. Earlier this month, the scientific journal Conservation Biology published a study that found that nearly half of the fish sampled at roughly 10 percent of Los Angeles sushi restaurants were not what they were purported to be on menus. In many cases fish were substituted with cheaper, more environmentally sustainable catches. But in some instances, replacement fish were actually endangered or threatened. Halibut and red snapper were found to be the most frequently misidentified. Between 2012 and 2014, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University sent their students to 26 Los Angeles restaurants with various price points and high ratings on Yelp and Zagat. Their mission was simple: Order dishes containing each of nine targeted fish that are common on menus and often mislabeled confirm with the restaurant that the fish was what the menu said it was collect a piece of sushi about the size of a kernel of corn drop it in a labeled jar of ethanol and take it back to the lab for DNA analysis. Knowing rates of mislabeled fish is important, the authors say, because it threatens consumer health. It also threatens a marine ecosystem and the billion dollar fishing industry that depends on it. But studies in the past have been inconsistent in terms of seafood mislabeling rates. “We wanted to see why there is that huge level of variation,” said Demian Willette, a biologist who helped lead the study. So they did the same thing at the same place each year for four years. The students collected more than 350 samples over all. In every restaurant, there was at least one case of mislabeled fish. But the researchers say you can’t blame the restaurant in every case. Like their diners, and even their grocers, the restaurants were most likely victims of fish fraud. For consumers going forward, Mr. Willette suggested asking your waiter directly what you’re ordering. The Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch also offers resources and a phone app to help  .

25999,"Awkward Sex, Onscreen and Off - The New York Times","Perhaps you’ve seen the new TV series whose pilot episode begins this way: A man and a woman are having sex, but something soon goes awry, and the whole production wraps up on an ungainly, awkward note. If you’re having trouble naming the show, it’s because there isn’t just one that commences this way. The   awkward sex scene has become a staple of the modern television series opener. And while it can seem like merely a (now hackneyed) storytelling device, its prevalence may also reflect recent tectonic shifts in heterosexual politics. First, a rundown of some examples (with a tip of the hat to Benjamin R. Cohen, a professor in engineering at Lafayette College, who alerted me to the trend): In “Love,” we are treated to no fewer than three sex scenes within the first six minutes, the most dramatically significant one being the male protagonist having stiff, monotonous sex with his aloof girlfriend, both of them still wearing tops, as he asks her to move in with him. (She says yes a month later, in their next scene together, she breaks up with him.) In “Togetherness” (canceled by HBO after its second season) the male lead attempts to initiate   sex with his wife. When rebuffed, he begins masturbating, hoping she won’t notice. She does, and kicks him out of bed, but not before asking him to take the baby monitor with him. “Master of None” opens with a   accident during a   stand. The two characters end up doing an online search for the risk of impregnation from   fluid (and, in learning about it, he admits that he masturbated before going out that night). The two leads of “Broad City” are having a   conversation on their laptops it is later revealed that Ilana has been having sex with a guy during their talk while Abby has been engaged in a “scheduled” masturbation session. Some of this litany has to do with the medium. As an   narrative strategy, depicting sex (erotically or not, à deux or solo) invariably succeeds. Comedy, for which all of the shows in question aim, doesn’t play well with dim lighting, sultry music and simultaneous orgasms. Furthermore, TV writers, especially those in mostly   premium cable and streaming TV, are undoubtedly eager to push the envelope of frank realism in a less puritanical era. Yet, perhaps, a bigger engine for the proliferation of awkward sex scenes is the change occurring in the contemporary bedroom. Compare the aforementioned shows to how “Sex and the City” began in 1998, with Carrie’s   relating the tale of a seemingly storybook romance (replete with “wonderful” sex, filmed in moonlight with silhouetted figures) that, inevitably, crumbles because of yet another noncommittal “toxic bachelor. ” In Carrie’s first sex scene, she is gratified by cunnilingus before turning down a request for fellatio and skedaddling off to work. The mood is not one of unease or embarrassment, but empowerment through role reversal. “I’d done it,” she proudly tells the viewer. “I’d just had sex like a man. ” The   show “made big headway” when it came to women “talking about their sex lives in a public forum,” said Sarah Heyward, a   on “Girls. ” “If the public is forced to get more O. K. with women talking graphically about their sex lives, inevitably on TV we’ll see women being more aggressive and being the initiator. ” “Sex and the City” not only paved the way for onscreen representation of women with more sexual agency, but also underscored a sea change in how both genders approach love and lust behind closed doors. After the “Broad City” scene ends, the guy in bed (Hannibal Buress) asks: “What are we? Are we just having sex, hooking up, dating? What is this?” “This is   …     purely physical,” Ilana says. “Why does this always happen to me?” he wonders aloud. Two decades ago, it’s doubtful a male character would have uttered such a lament on television unless it was played for straight laughs. On “Broad City,” though, it reads as a sign of the times: A woman can have sex “like a man,” as per Carrie’s declaration, and a man can express emotions as vulnerably as women have historically done. While this progressive movement toward equality ideally results in more satisfying romantic lives for all parties, television has mined the oftentimes vexed and perplexing renegotiations of status for humorous material. Consider an example from the pilot episode of “Girls” (which doesn’t open the show but takes place a demure 15 minutes in). The elusive and carnally adventurous Adam instructs Hannah to hold a physically uncomfortable sexual position. What follows is a superb comic scene pitting Hannah’s verbally open vulnerability and desire to please  —   up to a point  —   in conflict with Adam’s inarticulate desire that is unconcerned with her needs. The end result is a dampening of arousal for both parties. To a degree, theirs is a   pairing: the laconic, detached Adam, one of Carrie’s “toxic bachelors,” with the garrulous, needy Hannah. (In subsequent episodes, Hannah plays the role of the initiator more frequently, often to amusing results.) And, obviously, moments just like this took place in real life before the sexual revolution they just couldn’t have been shown on TV. Yet they were likely far less commonplace than now, and the particulars of their arrangement would have been very different (for starters, back then,   Adam and Hannah would have more realistically been married, not having exploratory casual sex). Gus, the nerdy male protagonist of “Love,” is closer to Mr. Buress’s character on “Broad City” than he is to Adam, and he struggles with the problems presented by his own inclination to   romance. “The show is trying to explore the limits of being sensitive,” said Paul Rust, who plays Gus (and is the   of the series with his wife, Lesley Arfin). “Maybe during sex is not the best time to ask if you want to move in together. That might not necessarily be a   in bed. It’s pragmatic dirty talk. ” “Love” seems to posit that behind the genial, meek facade of the domesticated millennial guy lurks the atavistic anger and repressed hostility of the male animal. “What am I?” Gus demands of his girlfriend as they fight during their breakup. “Am I too nice? Am I too mean?” She yells back: “You’re not nice! You’re   which is worse than being mean. ” Gus’s erratic navigation between the Scylla and Charybdis of domineering   and emasculated   behavior  —   the former no longer as socially acceptable as it used to be, the latter still not doing one many favors even on Tinder, let alone at a bar  —   constitutes much of the show’s subtext (and comedy). “You can do this, Gus,” he tells himself in a bathroom mirror, trying to psych himself up before approaching a girl at a party. “You’re the man. You’re   …     like a man. You’re close to being a man. ” “I’m sure it’s confusing for men: ‘Be like Don Draper, but also be this nice guy,’” said Daley Haggar, who has written for sitcoms like “The Big Bang Theory” and “Anger Management. ” Jon Hamm’s character on “Mad Men” may have been one of the more attractive leading men on TV to female viewers in recent memory, but Ms. Haggar pointed out that much of his conduct would be considered   or inappropriate in the 21st century. “Women fantasize about Don, but they don’t want an actual Don,” she said. “He’s cold and mildly sociopathic and he cheats. What they want is Jon Hamm dressed up in a suit doing a sort of cosplay of a ’50s stoic guy and being dominant. What he does, you’d be arrested for now. ” Moreover, she added,   intercourse with a figure like Don probably wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be on the show. “I don’t know that there were great orgasms with Don Draper,” she said. Mr. Rust looked to a different decade, the 1970s, as a bridge between the eras portrayed by “Mad Men” and the current crop of shows, and noted a possible subconscious influence in opening “Love” with an anticlimactic sex scene. His favorite film, 1975’s “Shampoo,” begins with Warren Beatty’s Lothario hairdresser having sex as another woman interrupts with a phone call. Watching it for the first time was a revelation. “There was a relief for me: ‘Oh, man, even Warren Beatty can have awkward sex,’” he recalled. His acting turn may have similar repercussions for today’s young men exploring their own sensitive sides, including those who may appear at first glance not to have any. “I was at an A. T. M. a couple weeks ago, and a    dude walked up to me,” Mr. Rust said. “He   me and said, ‘Dude, thanks for the vulnerability. ’”",1
