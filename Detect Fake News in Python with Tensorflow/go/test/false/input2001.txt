24616,"CNN Contributor Blames Breitbart, White House for London Attack - Breitbart","CNN contributor Dean Obeidallah told CNN during Sunday evening’s live coverage of the apparent terror attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park in London that Breitbart News was to blame for inciting the attack. [Obeidallah, a former attorney and   comedian, was asked about what the media can to do “  the animosity” in society. He answered:  You see it on Fox News, you see on the Breitbarts out there, really demonizing Muslims, portraying us as threats to America. You have people in the White House now like Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka. You had Michael Flynn  —   who is no longer part of the administration, who was on the board of directors for ACT for America, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls the biggest   group in America. You have Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, got an award last year from ACT for America. So you have a direct line from the White House to   bigotry. I really hope as a nation we can take a step back and stop   hate. We saw a horrific attack this week on a member of Congress. Other members of Congress could have been hurt. It’s part and parcel of the same thing. It’s demonizing, ginning up fear, irrationally ginning up fear, and people responding in the worst way possible. So, I’m concerned. Last year, Obeidallah falsely blamed a “  activist” for a    attack against a Muslim woman in Belgium. When confronted about his error, he tweeted: “go f*ck urself. ” On Sunday evening, he took to Twitter to defend his commentary on CNN against someone who complained: look a trump supporter wants me off tv because I dared give facts that linked TRump and his admin with   bigotry https:  .   —   (((DeanObeidallah))) (@Deanofcomedy) June 19, 2017, While suggesting that Breitbart News and the White Houseare responsible for   violence, Obeidallah has pushed back recently on the idea that liberal media inspired the mass shooting at a Republican baseball practice last week. In an essay on CNN, he argued that Trump supporters were hypocrites for criticizing a production of Julius Caesar in New York City’s Central Park that featured a President Trump lookalike being assassinated, because past productions elsewhere featured Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton lookalikes in the title role.

24618,Talent Agency UTA Trades Oscar Party for Refugee Rally,"United Talent Agency, one of the   major talent agencies in Hollywood, has canceled its annual Oscar party and will instead host a rally in support of refugees at its Los Angeles office, according to a report. [According to the Hollywood Reporter, UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer informed agency staff of the change in a letter this week.  The company  —   home to   clients like Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey, Toby Keith and dozens of others  —   also plans to donate $250, 000 to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has worked to oppose President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily prohibiting immigration from seven countries, and to the International Rescue Committee. “This is a moment that demands our generosity, awareness and restlessness,” Zimmer reportedly wrote to his staff. “Our world is a better place for the free exchange of artists, ideas and creative expression. If our nation ceases to be the place where artists the world over can come to express themselves freely, then we cease, in my opinion, to be America. ” The move to cancel the glitzy annual Oscars party comes as Hollywood has become increasingly vocal about Trump’s policy proposals and executive actions, particularly his action on immigration. At the Screen Actors Guild Awards last month, several film and television stars used their acceptance speeches to speak out against Trump’s order actress Sarah Paulson specifically called for donations to the ACLU. THR further reported that Ari Emanuel,   of   and UTA competitor   sent an email to staff Wednesday notifying them that the company would be forming a political action committee, though it wasn’t immediately clear on what the PAC would focus. “This company’s greatest asset is the diversity of our backgrounds and beliefs,” Emanuel wrote to the agency. “Please know that we will do everything in our power to support and protect this diversity now and in the months and years ahead. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

24623,"Millions of Lives Endangered by 55,000 Gallon Pipeline Spill","Millions of Lives Endangered by 55,000 Gallon Pipeline Spill report this ad 
A pipeline owned by the same company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline has endangered the lives of six million people by leaking 55,000 gallons of gasoline into a major river in Pennsylvania. report this ad 

After heavy rainfall, the pipeline, owned by Sunoco Logistics, burst on Thursday, October 20th. The spill leaked 55,000 gallons of gas into Wallis Run, a tributary of the Loyalsock Creek that drains into the Susquehanna River. Once the leak was detected, the pipeline was shut down but as stormy weather continued, the actual break in the pipeline remained unidentified for almost a week. After the spill, Pennsylvania water authorities warned customers to refrain from using water from the river. More than half of Lancaster City’s water comes from this river. Although officials are now declaring the water safe to drink, residents affected by the leak are wary. 

Previously, the Susquehanna was declared the third most endangered river in the U.S. by the NGO American Rivers. The river has come under threat because of development of the natural gas industry, particularly fracking. Fracking has endangered many U.S. rivers because of the “Cheney’s loophole” which exempts natural gas companies from the vast majority of U.S. environmental regulations. American Rivers believes that fracking poses one of the greatest dangers to U.S. rivers and could have a detrimental effect on our country’s clean drinking water. report this ad 

Though the spill has been blamed on recent floods, many are bringing into question Sunoco’s extensive history of poor pipeline management. Pipelines managed by Sunoco Logistics spill far more frequently than others, with more than 200 recorded leaks since 2010. In 2008, an improperly installed valve “blew out” a pipeline in Murrysville, Pennsylvania. The Department of Environmental Protection stated that the area affected by the spill may never completely recover. 

Sunoco is also a subsidary of Energy Transfer Partners Limited. This is the company that owns the controversial Dakota Access pipeline . This access pipeline has become a major protest site due to the controversial placement of the pipeline right by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s water supply and sacred sites. 

While Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are major advocated for fracking and pipeline construction, the public is standing up to this construction because of the major environmental and social damage it could have. 

This recent spill is just another example of the many things that can go wrong when pipelines are built so close to water supplies and communities.

24625,EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Gitmo Warden ‘Disgusted’ Obama Released More Detainees,"Col. Michael Bumgarner, the former commander of the guard force at the U. S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stated in an interview on Sunday that he is “disgusted” by President Obama’s continued effort to empty out Gitmo. [Bumgarner charged Obama with attempting to use Gitmo to ensure his legacy at the expense of national security. He served from April 2005  —   June 2006 as commander of the Joint Detention Group, the guard force component of the Joint Task Force at the U. S. prison in Guantanamo.  The Pentagon announced last Thursday that four detainees had been released to Saudi Arabia, where they will purportedly participate in a rehabilitation program.  From the 535 detainees in Gitmo during Bumgarner’s work there, the population is now down to 55, and 19 of those have reportedly been cleared for release. There is speculation Obama may release more detainees in his final days in office. “It has nothing to do with national security reasons,” stated Bumgarner. He was speaking on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM. Listen to the interview here: Continued Bumgarner: His whole motivation has nothing to do with national security. In my mind, it is clearly a legacy issue for Obama who signed on, you know, day one of his presidency, ‘I am going to close Guantanamo.’ I knew then   …     that would never happen. It is just impossible. He had no clue what he had just signed. And he has found out how hard that is. So, the argument always is that they (the terrorists) make this a propaganda matter to recruit more people. You and I both follow this pretty closely. I don’t ever see it out there that Guantanamo is your call to battle, you know. I never see that. You and I both know what drives this fight. It has nothing to do with national security. Again, it’s a legacy issue for Obama. And I’m ashamed that it is occurring. Embarrassed. Disgusted. I don’t know how it to make it stronger. Asked whether he had any advice regarding Gitmo for   Donald Trump, Bumgarner replied: One, it certainly should not be closed. And two, increase its population. And by that it’s just not that we want to stack up Guantanamo Bay. But the whole purpose is  —   this may strike people as funny  —   but rather than kill the terrorists on the battlefield when we engage with the ISIS fighters, bring them in for the intelligence value that they can provide.   …     Use the intelligence value. The great capacity and capability of Guantanamo. Let’s fill it up with people and let the intelligence world go to work and develop the human intelligence that we so badly need. Fox News last week cited statistics from U. S. officials saying 30 percent of previously released Gitmo detainees are suspected of returning to terrorist activity. Bumgarner commented, “And you know Aaron when we talk about these numbers   …     let’s just think about that.   …     Think about the destruction that just one man carried out in Berlin. That fellow in France. So, if you can stop one, you saved numerous lives. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

24636,BREAKING BOMBSHELL: FBI re-opens Clinton email probe,"FBI re-opens investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server after new evidence is discovered. 
Elad Benari 
The FBI will re-open its investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she served as Secretary of State, NBC News reported Friday. 
FBI director James Comey made the announcement in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the network. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation … I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” he wrote. 
In July, Comey announced that he did not recommend charging Clinton with willfully mishandling classified information. 
In September, the FBI chief defended his agency’s decision to not press criminal charges in the investigation. Documents related to the case were released just before the Labor Day weekend and included a summary of Clinton’s

There are very difficult negotiations in process. Moreover, the US wants to pass a bill to declare certain orbits exclusively American."" | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A United Launch Alliance Delta IV lifts off from Space Launch Complex-37 with the Air Force’s Global Positioning System (GPS) IIF-5 satellite. Recently, the Russian space agency Roscosmos kicked off tenders for three GLONASS satellites to be launched in 2017-2018. The company is expected to spend over one billion rubles ($16 million) on the program. 
The first launch is scheduled for December 25, 2017, the other two – for November 25, 2018. The satellite will be carried by a Soyuz-2.1b rocket from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome spaceport. 
In February and May 2016, two Glonass-M satellites were added to the GLONASS system. Currently, the system involves 27 satellites, 23 of which are in operation, two are put in orbital reserve, one is undergoing flight tests, and the last is undergoing maintenance. 
In the event of a military conflict, communication satellites would be an important target, military expert and observer Viktor Baranets said. “The current situation in space is that no satellites are protected, no matter at what orbits they are. The reason is that alongside with development of space systems, the US is running on all cylinders developing space weapons,” Baranets told Radio Sputnik. Moreover, China already joined the game, with an anti-satellite missile test in 2007. 
“Russia has its own plans too. I think that if Washington keeps ignoring Russia’s calls for the demilitarization of space, the so-called ‘combat cosmonautics’ would become reality,” Baranets pointed out. 
His words were echoed by Russian defense expert Vasily Kashin. In an interview with Sputnik China , Kashin said that modern satellites are almost devoid of any opportunity to protect themselves from the impact of interceptor missiles. 
In 2008, the Russian and Chinese governments proposed an international agreement to prevent the deployment of weapons in outer space but the US government under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama has consistently rejected launching negotiations to conclude such a treaty. 
Before Barack Obama became president, during his presidential campaign, he called for talks with Russia on anti-satellite weapons which started back in the 1970s but then was terminated by Washington. However, no progress has been made on the issue. 
Baranets said it could not be ruled out that in the future space might be militarized which would pose a threat to the entire world. “Mankind will have to decide whether to militarize space or not. There are very difficult negotiations in process. Moreover, the US wants to pass a bill to declare certain orbits exclusively American,” Baranets said. 
According to him, the defense industries of both Russia and the US are working to develope space combat systems. If the process is not stopped “space wars may be possible.” 
The expert stressed that the 1967 Outer Space Treaty between the US, the USSR and Britain should be revised. The document represents the legal framework of international space law, including prohibition of weapons of mass destruction in orbit. 
“The treaty should be revised as soon as possible. This will prevent militarization of space. Now, space is becoming a place for effective strikes against the enemy,” the expert concluded. 
In turn, Kashin assumed that anti-satellite weaponry is a new reality that should be considered while planning a possible military operation. In this new reality, Russia, China, the US, as well as India and Iran will most likely possess domestically-made sophisticated anti-satellite weapons, according to him.",0

24644,Iraq bans alcohol,"Iraq bans alcohol Voltaire Network | 27 October 2016 français Español italiano Deutsch عربي On 22 October 2016, the Iraqi Parliament surreptitiously adopted an amendment to its laws affecting communes which bans the sale, the import and the production of alcohol.
The prohibition was adopted in order to satisfy the Islamists on the day before the liberation of Daesh-occupied Mosul.
The law sets fines of between $8,000 and $20,000 per offence.
Considering that the law is prejudicial to them, the Christians of Iraq (who use wine in the celebration of Mass) have decided to take legal action against the law before a federal tribunal.

Oktober 2016 Rufschädigung: Brauerei verbietet EU-Kommissar, den Namen Oettinger zu verwenden Oettingen (dpo) - Die Brauerei Oettinger aus Bayern sieht ihren guten Ruf durch den deutschen EU-Kommissar Günther Oettinger beschmutzt. Nun ging der Bierhersteller juristisch gegen den Politiker vor und untersagt ihm, öffentlich den Namen ""Oettinger"" zu verwenden. Das Fass zum Überlaufen brachten jüngst bekannt gewordene Äußerungen des CDU-Politikers auf einer Tagung in Hamburg. Günther Oettinger bezeichnete dort unter anderem Chinesen als ""Schlitzaugen"", Wallonen als ""Kommunisten"" und warnte eindringlich vor einer ""Pflicht-Homo-Ehe"". ""Jahrelang haben wir dem Treiben dieses Mannes zugesehen und uns geärgert, dass er unseren guten Namen in den Dreck zieht"", sagte ein Unternehmenssprecher. ""Jetzt hat es uns endgültig gereicht. Auch eine preisgünstige Biermarke wie Oettinger hat ihren Stolz!"" Wegen Günther Oettinger hat dieses edle Bier nun einen faden Beigeschmack. Immerhin werde das Bier der Brauerei international und von allen Bevölkerungsgruppen gleichermaßen getrunken, so der Sprecher. ""Selbst mit sechs Oettinger intus merkt noch jeder, dass dieser Politiker sich selbst und damit unseren Namen europaweit der Lächerlichkeit preisgibt. Die Grässlichkeit von Oettinger ist inzwischen schon fast sprichwörtlich. Also von dem Politiker Oettinger jetzt."" Inzwischen konnte die Brauerei beim Amtsgericht Nördlichen eine einstweilige Verfügung erwirken, die dem Politiker verbietet, den Namen Oettinger weiterhin zu führen, öffentlich zu verwenden und damit zu unterschreiben. Dabei schloss sich der Richter der Argumentation der Brauerei an, dass das Ansehen des seit 1731 bestehenden Betriebes durch die erst wenige Jahrzehnte dauernden politischen Aktivitäten eines Einzelnen dauerhaft beschädigt wird. Der derzeitige Digital- und künftige Haushaltskommissar der EU darf nun öffentlich nur noch seinen Vornamen Günther benutzen. ""Wenn er möchte, kann er sich ja gerne in Günther Warsteiner, Günther Hacker-Pschorr oder meinetwegen Günther Pflugbier Hörvelsingen nennen"", so der Sprecher, der den juristischen Sieg vor dem nördlinger Amtsgericht zusammen mit der Chefetage mit mehreren Flaschen Beck's feierte.",0
24646,U.S. Special Forces Join Fight For Mosul,"We Are Change 

Fierce battle for the city of Mosul continues to shock Iraq and the whole Middle East with no significant results. The leading role belongs to the assault of the Iraqi army and Kurdish Self-Defense Forces—which still lack experience and skills—to capture the city in the shortest time.
However, 500 elite commandos of the U.S. Special Forces, which had been transferred this week at Mosul should give new impetus to the assault. U.S. combatants are supported by Apache and Chinook helicopters.
According to the Inside Syria Media Center , the U.S. Special Forces are located at the forefront of Iraqi and Kurdish combat formations. Military experts believe these combat conditions are atypical for the special operation forces which are aimed to carry out reconnaissance and other specific tasks.
Elite combatants in Mosul actually perform the functions of infantry soldiers, resulting in inevitable great losses, which are going to be covered up and silenced by the Washington officials in the usual manner.
Although the U.S. officials have repeatedly stated Mosul should be liberated from terrorists to eliminate the Islamic State, the decision to use U.S. Special Forces looks unjustified at first glance. However, the protracted nature of the assault on the city is forcing the Pentagon to take extreme measures to complete the operation before the U.S. presidential election. Therefore, the White House uses this situation, first of all, as a large-scale PR-campaign to support the candidate of the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton.
In this context, it becomes clear why the U.S. Government refrained from active struggle against terrorists for so long choosing an opportune moment strangely coincided with the end of the presidential elections in the United States.
Liberation of Mosul should also demonstrate to the world community the importance and crucial role of the American nation in the fight against the Islamic State. It is even more regrettable in the light of the recent Wikileaks’ revelations, which confirmed the United States and American tycoons’ role in the creation and funding of the Islamic State terrorists.

24649,Tillerson: ‘Steps Are Under Way’ to Remove Assad From Power in Syria - Breitbart,"On Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said “steps are under way” to form an international coalition to remove the president of Syria Bashar   after Tuesday’s chemical bombings in Syria.  Partial transcript as follows: TILLERSON: Well obviously, the events that have occurred in Syria with the chemical weapons attack here in the past day I think have just horrified all of us and brought to the front pages and to our television screens as well the tragedy that is part of the Syrian conflict. There is no doubt in our mind and the information we have supports that Syria, the Syrian regime under the leadership of Bashar   are responsible for this attack and I think further it’s very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime. REPORTER: Does Assad have to go? TILLERSON: Assad’s role in the future is uncertain and with the acts that he has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people. REPORTER: And what steps is the United States prepared to take in order to remove him from power? TILLERSON: The process by which Assad would leave I think requires an international community effort, both to first defeat ISIS within Syria, to stabilize the Syrian country, to avoid further civil war and then to work collectively with our partners around the world through a political process that would lead to Assad leaving. REPORTER: So will you and President Trump organize an international coalition to remove Assad? TILLERSON: Those steps are under way. REPORTER: Has President Trump been talking about that with other leaders. TILLERSON:  We are considering an appropriate response which violates all previous U. N. resolutions, violates international norms and   agreements between parties including the Syrian regime, the Russian government and all other members of the U. N. Security Council. It’s a serious matter. It requires a serious response. Thank you. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
24650,Potential Homeowner in Detroit Finds Mummified Body in Garage,"A potential homeowner in Detroit found an unexpected surprise when he walked into the garage of the house he was considering purchasing. [What he discovered was a grisly scene: a mummified, decomposed body in the back seat of a car.  The discovery occurred around 1 p. m. Thursday afternoon. As the potential home buyer was inspecting the garage of a home in the 19900 block of Spencer, he found the mummified body, the Detroit News reported. Authorities said the body was found in the back of a 1990 or 1991 Plymouth Acclaim. Lloyd Jackson, a spokesman for Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office, said officials estimate that the body had been there for “years” and said “the body is brown”  meaning it is well past the decomposition stage. Jackson said medical examiners “inspected” the body but are waiting for an anthropologist from the University of Michigan that partners with the county to conduct special tests, such as those that will determine the body’s gender. Jackson told the Detroit Free Press that the body was found lying down in the back seat dressed in a shirt and pants. Detroit Police spokesman Dan Donakowski said officers were dispatched to the scene after the man discovered the body. “We talked to the current tenants of that location and they were told that the actual homeowners had said basically don’t go in the garage, don’t put anything in the garage,” said Donakowski, who also stated that the investigation is ongoing. This is not the first time a mummified body has been discovered in Michigan. Investigators also found a mummified body in Pontiac, Michigan, five years after its death in 2014.",0

24653,Rid Your Soil of Harmful Chemicals With This Grass,"by ARIANA MARISOL 
With pollution everywhere, it has become hard to find healthy soil that can support a good, healthy garden. This can be especially hard if you live in an urban area. Growing this grass will remove nearly half of all PCB contamination from your soil in only six months. 
Switchgrass, otherwise knowns as Panicum virgatum, is a perennial warm season bunchgrass native to North America. The prairies of the Midwestern United States were once covered with vast swaths of this grass, bringing nutrition to the soil. A versatile and adaptable plant, switchgrass can grow and thrive in many different weather conditions and soil types. It can grow in soil that is considered to be too erodible, too sandy, or even gravelly for most other crops. 
A study that was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program and the University of Iowa found Switchgrass to be a highly effective soil detoxifier. 

Results Polychlorinated biphenyls, also known as PCB’s, are highly toxic chemicals that were once widely used for industrial development. They are classified as persistent organic pollutants, meaning they are very hard to break down and have a tendency to accumulate in the bodies of living creatures. Even though the U.S. Congress banned these chemicals in 1979, PCB contamination is still a rampant issue.This contamination is the reason why residents are advised not to eat too much fish from regions of the Great Lakes. 
To test the effectiveness of switchgrass to clean soil, researchers took clean soil and contaminated it with dangerously high amounts of PCB, concentrations that are regularly found in soils throughout the U.S. In order to make sure the PCB fully leached into the soil, they sealed the soil in tubs and let them sit for two months at 77 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). 
Researchers then placed this soil into plastic containers and switchgrass seeds were planted. For comparison, another container was filled with contaminated soil and left unplanted. Researchers also planted switchgrass seeds in a container of healthy soil. All soils were analyzed after 12 and 24 weeks. 
After 24 weeks, the PCB levels in the switchgrass-planted containers had dropped by 40 percent. When researchers added PCB-oxidizing microorganisms to the soil, PCB levels fell to 47 percent. Researchers also found that this good bacteria had a easier time surviving in switchgrass-planted containers than in bare soil. 
Detox Your Soil 
This study helps to prove that we can use natural techniques to rid our soil or harmful toxins. PCB can have detrimental health effects on the people who consume food from the soil it has contaminated. Planting switchgrass can help your soil rid itself from these harmful chemicals and bring you healthy food that is safe for consumption. It can also work as a natural ground cover, companion plant, and erosion preventer. Switchgrass is extremely easy to grow and gives us hope to move towards a healthier future.

24658,NASA Space Camera Footage Shows UFO,"  Edmondo Burr in Weird // 0 Comments NASA’s space cameras have accidentally filmed another unidentified flying object ( UFO ) travelling out of earth’s atmosphere. 
The question is why did the space agency not turn off the live feed or try to cover up, as it usually does with UFOs and aliens? 
A disk-shaped UFO appears in the video giving support to the theory that extraterrestrial beings and their crafts are continuously visiting earth. 
Ancient Code reports: 
Ever since the footage was uploaded to YouTube, it generated great controversy both among those who support the idea that it might be an extraterrestrial object, as among those who are completely skeptical of the subject, and as a joke suggest that “UFO’s that are planning on entering our air space should be registered and pay taxes.” 
The truth is that on many occasions only fragments of videos in which these mystery objects are visible are released. 
However, the fact that NASA interrupts its live feed transmissions is what arouses more suspicion among those who are eager to find new evidence of the existence of alien life, UFO’s and how we are all part of a massive conspiracy. 
One user wrote on YouTube: 
“The question isn’t “ is this an alien spacecraft? ”, but actually “Why NASA didn’t cut or blur this video as they always do with other strange sights?” 
According to many people, in today’s era, it isn’t a question anymore whether or not UFO’s are real. 
In fact, if we look back into the past we will see numerous fascinating statements made by former astronauts, military officials and scientists about Alien life and the existence of UFOs. 
Here are only a few: 
“Intelligent beings from other star systems have been and are visiting our planet Earth. They are variously referred to as Visitors, Others, Star People, Et’s, etc…They are visiting Earth now; this is not a matter of conjecture or wistful thinking.” – Theodor C. Loder III, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University of New Hampshire. 
We cannot address the UFO phenomena without mentioning Dr. Edgar Mitchel, one of the best-known Apollo astronauts and the sixth man to walk on the moon; a retired Captain in the US Navy, aeronautical engineer and founder of the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) who had much to say about Alien life: “I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real…Yes, there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. We are not alone in the universe; they have been coming here for a long time.” 
Franklin Story Musgrave, an American Physician, retired NASA astronaut who worked on the design and development of the Skylab Program and the only astronaut to have flown missions on all five Space Shuttles had very interesting things to say about life elsewhere in the cosmos: “Statistically it’s a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence, life forms out there. I believe they’re so advanced that they’re even doing interstellar travel. I believe it’s possible that they even came here. It’s logical to presume the universe must have other life in it and by virtue of association that we could be visited at some point.”",0

Hodgkinson, 66, targeted Republican Members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game, in a shooting that left Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) and three members of the Capitol Hill Police severely wounded, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the House floor. [“I pray for Donald Trump, that his presidency will be successful and that his family will be safe,” Pelosi said of President Donald Trump.  “I have been probably the target of more, political target of probably more threats than anyone perhaps other than the President of the United States Barack Obama.

On Monday, Pelosi predicted that Trump would “ . ” But now, just a few days later, she is throwing her support behind the president in the wake of this tragedy in Alexandria. Earlier in her speech on the House floor on Wednesday, Pelosi said that “we speak for each other in saying, we send our thoughts and prayers to our colleague, Steve Scalise. ” She continued: Personally we have our   connection so as soon as I heard his name, I was filled with concern, as I would be for anyone here. But we had that special connection, and so our hopes and prayers  —   and as I said to the Speaker [Paul Ryan] I’ll be asking you every five minutes, ‘How is Steve coming along?’ Pelosi added that she prays “frequently, and certainly every Sunday. ” She added: When this team was on the field practicing with such brotherhood  —   I don’t know if you have any sisters on your team we have two on our team  —   for this person to take this action was so cowardly, so cowardly. We cannot let that be a victory for the assailant or anyone who would think that way. We will use this occasion as one that brings us together and not separates us further. Before taking the House floor Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi tweeted: On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our thoughts for the wounded. https:  .   —   Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) June 14, 2017,  However, for Hodgkinson  —   a staunch Bernie Sanders ( ) supporter who hated President Donald Trump  —   Republicans were his target. Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) was also present at Wednesday’s baseball practice. He said Hodgkinson had approached him and Rep. Jeff Duncan ( ) to ask which political party was practicing. “There was a guy that walked up to us that was asking whether there was Republicans or Democrats out there. And it was just a little odd  …     so we told the police that,” DeSantis said. In addition to his affiliation with a number of   groups, Hodgkinson belonged to one named “Terminate The Republican Party. ” Hodgkinson has since died, President Trump confirmed in his remarks, as a result of gunfire exchange between him and the Capitol Hill Police. The Capitol Hill Police officers were present because Scalise is a member of GOP leadership. Some members of Congress said that had it not been for Scalise’s security detail, the shooting could have turned into a massacre.

24663,Trick-Or-Treaters Get Their Socks Rocked By BADASS Hillary Pumpkin Outside,"Trick-Or-Treaters Get Their Socks Rocked By BADASS Hillary Pumpkin Outside Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This 
An incredible video is being shared on social media after someone wanted to go political with their jack-o-lantern carving this year. Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton, this badass pumpkin seemed to center around her – and it will surely knock the socks right off any trick-or-treater headed to their house tonight. 
Halloween is a fun time for many people – especially families with younger ones. However, it seems that a few homeowners decided to try and entertain the adults that may cross their path. Proving just that is a video shared to the Facebook page called “ Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children ,” which shows how one person went political with theirs. 
As can be seen in the short clip , the jack-o-lantern was emptied and carved to look like a set of jail bars. Making it just that much better, the person responsible for carving the pumpkin actually stuffed a picture of Hillary in there to make it appear as though she is in prison – where she belongs. 
Within just a few short days, the video has already been seen over 3 million times with that number on the rise. However, if you think people on social media are ramped up over the ingenious carving, you can imagine the reactions that thing will get from trick-or-treaters tonight. 
As it turns out, the cool idea actually sparked a bit of a movement with several other people doing the same. In fact, in order to make it crystal clear, others even wrote the words “Hillary 4 Prison” on their creations as well:",0
24664,Trump: We’ve Exceeded ’Most Bullish Predictions’ for Progress on Border Security - Breitbart,"During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated that on border security, “we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. ”  Transcript as Follows: “My Fellow Americans, We’re only 11 weeks in, but already my administration has achieved historic progress for the American people  —   in fact, 93% of our domestic manufacturers have expressed optimism in the future, a record. The confidence we are seeing in our Nation is about jobs and opportunity  —   but it’s also about safety and security. Security begins at the border  —   as a candidate, I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border, and that is exactly what I have done. We inherited a   border crisis  —   it was a disaster. Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64% reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border. At the same time, we are conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society  —   and they’ll be gone. In just the last few days our Nation’s ICE officers have arrested 153 criminal aliens in south Texas, 84 criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest, and 31 criminal aliens in Long Island, New York  —   these arrests include aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing, and many more. Much work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington  —   but, with time, dedication, and effort, we will get the job done, and save countless lives in the process. Providing security for the American People also means restoring America’s standing in the world. From the very start of my Presidency, I have worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe. This week, I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now, I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the Southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples. In our dealings with other nations, our conversations have been candid, open, and grounded in mutual respect. I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me, and so important to our people  —   one of the reasons, certainly, that I got elected. And I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens. In matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world  —   that is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people. Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals  —   and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences. A future of peace, safety, and prosperity  —   that is our guiding light, and always will be. Together, we will bring about this future for the land we love, and for the people who call it home.

24668,Kurds Worried Turkey Will Stab Them in the Back as They Fight ISIS,"Kurds Worried Turkey Will Stab Them in the Back as They Fight ISIS Turkey publicly opposes ISIS while supporting them behind the scenes Image Credits: Kurdish YPG fighters: Kurdishstruggle . 
Two months after being purged from the border town of Jarablus in northern Syria by a Turkish-led force — and just days after being targeted by Turkish airstrikes near al-Bab — Syrian Kurds now fear a “stab in the back” from Turkey’s military as plans for a U.S.-led push to clear ISIS fighters from Raqqa are carried out. 
“It is very important Raqqa is liberated,” a chief political leader of the main Syrian Kurdish party, the PYD, told Reuters . “But one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back.” 
At the end of August, Turkish forces took part in a U.S.-led operation to eject ISIS from the northern border of Syria. Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces — leading Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels — took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. 
The issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.-supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains : 
“Kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. 
“However, Turkey’s intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF.” 
The problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey who’ve been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. 
So regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, it’s taking a much more proactive stance than that. 
Last Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were “the heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria,” Turkey targeted three Kurdish-controlled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out “26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia” and “had killed between 160 and 200 combatants.” 
Turkey’s major concern is that Kurdish-controlled enclaves will physically unite, “thereby creating a de facto Kurdish mini-state along the Turkish border.” As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. 
This tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.-led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently — even if somewhat grudgingly — bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. 
“From now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us,” Erdogan said from his palace last week. “Let them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly: they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.” NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

24670,Almost 500 specialists to serve as judges at 3rd Military World Winter Games in Sochi - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site Rosa Khutor alpine ski resort in Sochi 
© ITAR-TASS/Artur Lebedev 
MOSCOW, November 15. /TASS/. Almost 500 specialists will serve as judges at the 3rd CISM Military World Winter Games that will be held on February 22-28 in Sochi, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. 
“The main sports event of 2017 will start in 100 days. The program of competitions and schemes of sports tracks were officially coordinated with national sports federations. Federations also preliminarily approved judging teams in different disciplines and the order of their arrival. The total number of specialists who will judge at the Games will stand at 488 people,” the defense ministry said. 
The defense ministry noted that the Organizing Committee already agreed on facilities that will be used at the Games. “Competitions will be held in coastal and mountain clusters: Laura biathlon and ski complex (biathlon, cross country skiing, ski orienteering), Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort (Alpine skiing, ski mountaineering), Iceberg Skating Palace (short track) and Bolshoy Ice Dome (rock climbing),” the ministry added. 
The ministry noted that preparations for the Games proceed in accordance with the schedule. “Our team synchronously develops several spheres in order to hold the most successful World Winter Games in the history of their existence,” the ministry quoted Chief of the Central Sports Army Club Mikhail Baryshev as saying. 
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, who heads the Organizing Committee, put forward the idea to hold the Games at Olympic facilities in Sochi. 
Around 2,000 athletes from 40 countries are expected to take part in the Games. Forty-four sets of medals will be up for grabs in individual and team disciplines. The opening ceremony of the 3rd CISM Military World Winter Games will be held on 23 February 2017.

24672,UNESCO passes anti-Israel resolution despite Tel Aviv brickbats,"Palestine The file photo shows a view of al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. 
UNESCO's 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday's secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris. 
Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. 
The resolution expresses UNESCO’s deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. 
Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
“Through an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem,” Erekat said. 
He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges “respecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.” 
Earlier this month, UNESCO’s 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. 
Wednesday’s vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regime’s ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel Shama-Hacohen, had been recalled for consultations. 
""We will decide what the next steps will be,” Netanyahu said in a statement. 
Elias Sanbar, Palestine’s UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were “politicizing religion and this is very dangerous."" 
Makram Mustafa Queisi, Jordan’s ambassador to UNESCO, also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a “technical point of view” while many parties were politicizing it. Palestinian Ambassador to UNESCO Elias Sanbar (L) and Jordanian envoy Makram Mustafa Queisi address the media after an anti-Israel resolution was passed by secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris, France, October 26, 2016.

Palestine became the 195th full member of UNESCO in October 2011, triggering a cut in Tel Aviv’s funding to the agency. 
The occupied territories have already been the scene of increased tensions ever since the Israeli regime imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015. 
More than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. Loading ...",0
24677,"Jim Harbaugh, Gridiron Ambassador in Europe, Can’t Explain the ’Foot’ in Football - Breitbart","Nothing says “ugly American” quite like getting kicked out of a posh Italian mall for playing catch with a pigskin. [Perhaps Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh could have worn a bolo tie, or blasted Rick Derringer’s “Real American,” while accomplishing all that on Monday. But his behavior did enough to offend the Old World cultural sensibilities.  Europeans don’t understand football. Neither do many Americans, including, apparently, the successor to Fielding Yost and Bo Schembechler, who, during his European junket, pleaded ignorance to an African man asking why they call his sport football and not throwball. The foot, not the arm, mattered most in early football, a game, as its name implies, that borrowed heavily from European football only to take it in a very North American direction.   collegiate seasons passed before the rules allowed for a forward pass. Throwball would have struck observers as oddly back then as football does to us today. Players competed with a round soccer ball rather than a prolate spheroid in the early days. The two games, soccer (a truncated name for association football) and American football exhibited a similarity in the size of the field, the number of players, and even the names of certain positions. Football used a goal identical to the soccer goal. The Americans imagined it a greater feat to kick the ball above rather than beneath the goal post. So, they erected uprights, which changed an “n” goal into the “H” goalpost that many high schools still favor over the slingshot goalpost. Once upon a time, Sebastian Janikowski mattered a whole lot more than Tom Brady. The conversion, as its name implies, represented the means by which a team converted a touchdown into points. “No good” meant no points. The early rules favored field goals over touchdowns. The team with more field goals but fewer touchdowns, for instance, won the first two meetings of  . If played under today’s rules, the losing team would have won in both cases. “A match shall be decided by a majority of touchdowns a goal shall be equal to four touchdowns but in case of a tie a goal kicked from a touchdown shall take precedence over four touchdowns,” read an early rulebook. For football’s first 35 seasons, field goals brought more points than touchdowns. In 1897, touchdowns garnered five points. Seven years later, field goals shrank to four points from five. Not until 1912 did the game adopt the scoring system, more or less, that we see today. The ball gradually getting longer and harder (easier to throw, harder to kick) the movement of the goalpost to the end of the end zone, the pushing up of kickoffs, and the elimination of the fair   kick at certain levels (the NFL still retains this quirky rule) all further marginalized kicking. Just as guards no longer guard the hoop and forwards no longer focus on the frontcourt in basketball, football’s name no longer resembles its game. That one of the sport’s greatest coaches appears at a loss to explain his game’s name indicates the totality of, and how much we take for granted, the football’s transformation. Daniel J. Flynn is the author of The War on Football: Saving America’s Game (Regnery, 2013).",0
24679,Drone Racing Becomes ESPN’s Newest Televised Sport - The New York Times,"First there was poker. Then there was the spelling bee, Scrabble and the recent emergence of  . Now ESPN is betting that speeding drones will be the next noncontact “sport” to find a mass audience. The Drone Racing League announced on Wednesday that it had signed deals to broadcast a   season on ESPN and ESPN2, along with the European stations Sky Sports Mix and 7Sports. The schedule begins with an introduction to drone racing on Thursday at 11 p. m. on ESPN2. Competition will begin on Oct. 23. ESPN2 will broadcast episodes on Thursday and Saturday nights, and ESPN will show the final episodes, including the   championship on Nov. 20. Drone . .. racing? It would be fair to wonder what that is. The technology to race drones is just a few years old, as is the technology to compellingly film them racing. The league’s officials say the drones will zip through   courses at up to 80 miles per hour, piloted by six stationary humans wearing something akin to a virtual reality headset. Tiny cameras mounted on the drones offer the pilots a   view, and they steer using joysticks similar to what you’d find on an Xbox controller. “It’s an exciting,   experience mixed with   dynamics,” said Nicholas Horbaczewski, the chief executive and founder of the league. “These races are short sprints. It has that thrill of a   dash or horse racing. ” The races are prerecorded, so viewers will see an edited mix of drone footage and set cameras during the races. It won’t be difficult to follow the action, Mr. Horbaczewski said. Taking a cue from ESPN’s other nonathletic programming, the series is expected to focus on turning the pilots into characters you can root for. Cameras followed several of the pilots to their homes, interviewing them about their lives and what brought them to the activity, Mr. Horbaczewski said. MGM Television, with Mark Burnett as executive producer, is onboard to create unscripted shows around the pilots and the technology behind the races. Each of the 25 pilots will use an identical drone measured down to the ounce, Mr. Horbaczewski said. They will be quadcoptors “stripped down to the bare minimum” and outfitted with colored LED lights. The pilots will navigate obstacle courses in the corridors of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, an abandoned mall in Los Angeles, a laboratory in New York, a paper mill in Hamilton, Ohio, and an auto plant in Detroit. The winner will get a salaried contract to race in the 2017 season. It’s the biggest move yet into the mainstream for an activity that started just recently. It bloomed quickly from hobbyists gawking in parking lots into a competitive industry. A variety of organizations have emerged to put on drone races, including the Drone Sports Association, which had its championship streamed live on ESPN’s digital properties in August. An edited,   version is scheduled for Sept. 18 on ESPN2. Matthew Volk, the director of programming and acquisitions for ESPN, said drone racing fit in with other recent shows ESPN had broadcast, including CrossFit and BattleFrog. “We think that they are emerging sports with emerging audiences because they’re the kind of activities that any fan can go out and do,” said Mr. Volk. The Drone Racing League races will be simulcast on Sky Sports Mix, a new channel for the United Kingdom and Ireland created in August, at the same time they are shown on ESPN, but because that’s 4 a. m. local time they will be repeated at 5 p. m. said Emma Lloyd the director for corporate development, partnerships and investments at Sky. Sky is among the early investors in the league in addition to the TV deal, the league also announced it had closed an investment round of more than $12 million, led by RSE Ventures and Lux Capital. “It’s an area that could become very important for our customers,” Ms. Lloyd said.",0
24680,Comment on Former US Attorney for DC: New Hillary Email Probe Was Result of ‘Revolt’ Inside FBI by Tonya Parnell,"Former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova suggested Friday James Comey’s reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails was the product of a “revolt” inside the FBI. 
While speaking with WMAL’s Larry O’Connor , diGenova was asked what Comey meant by saying newly discovered Clinton emails from Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s devices “appear to be pertinent” to the FBI’s prior investigation. 
“It tells me that the original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation,” diGenova said, “otherwise they would have discovered this — and I’ll tell you why.” 
“These were found on the phone that was used by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin,” he said. “Why was that phone not looked at originally?” 
“There could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright, and if she did, she’s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there’s nothing he can do about it.” 
diGenova continued: “And why this letter was sent today was very simple: the agents came to Comey yesterday, they told him about the evidence, and he said oh ‘S’, and realized that his goose was cooked, that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent, and he knew that the agents running the Weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress.” 
“And I’ve also been told something very significant, it’s been reported that those laptops [belonging to Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson] were destroyed, they were not, and the reason is the FBI agents refused to do it.” 
diGenova went on to say he believes “there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now.” 
“He sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau,” he said. “Comey sent this letter today because he had to. He has no moral authority inside the agency right now, he’s a joke, he’s a laughingstock of the agency, and among former FBI agents, he has become an anathema.”

24688,Mike Pence Is Fine With Trump Sexual Assault But Offended By Voter Suppression,"By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 12:08 pm Donald Trump's Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he's offended by, but it's not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. Nope. Pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
“That’s offensive to me, that kind of language. It’s not our operation,” Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBC’s Morning Joe . 
Yes, Donald Trump’s Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he’s offended by, but it’s not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. 
Nope. 
Did Pence read the story? No. But he’s offended. So offended. Because that kind of language is offensive. Not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because it’s not “our operation.” 
Watch here via MSNBC’s Morning Joe : 
Twice saying he hasn’t read the article, Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadn’t read, “That’s offensive to me, that kind of language. It’s not our operation,” Pence denied. 
“Donald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. And that’s our message, is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them. That we can have government as good as our people again, but it’s going to take all of us.” 
“And you saw Donald Trump … say that people who haven’t traditionally voted Republican, we’ve got an agenda to bring our cities back…” 
Pence is twice offended, so super offended: 
“I’ve never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. Frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because that’s just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign. It’s not the approach we’re taking. We’re reaching out to every American.” 
Pence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump. In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying, “It’s time for Republicans to come home” because Trump won the primary. 
Mike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because “It’s just not what I see out there.” 
Trump also loves to cite what he “sees” and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist – like videos he claims to have watched. 
This explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together. It turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the Republican establishment’s efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. Both Pence and Trump don’t care a whit about facts. This is more than typical campaign spin, it’s appalling in context. 
The context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a woman’s “p*ssy” without her permission, but he is publicly saying he’s offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
Pence didn’t even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesn’t care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. But why would he? 
Pence didn’t care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted – not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
Like Trump, Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.

24700,Incredible smoke haze seen outside NDTV office after Arnab quits; bursting of firecrackers suspected,"Incredible smoke haze seen outside NDTV office after Arnab quits; bursting of firecrackers suspected Posted on Tweet (Image via shutterstock.com) 
An incredible smoke haze was spotted seen outside the NDTV office on Tuesday. Onlookers claimed that the reason was and uninhibited bursting of firecrackers by people in the building. 
One onlooker claimed he also heard loud firecrackers-like noise near the NDTV office area followed by fumes curling up to form a V-sign. 
Experts say it will be difficult to ascertain the source of the emission. A leading pollution expert opined, “These days such peculiar fumes can be due to firecrackers during the Diwali season or because of pure human emotions giving rise to intense celebrations, revelry, etc.” 
This incident, according to the onlooker, happened on Tuesday evening, minutes after the news of journalist Arnab Goswami quitting Times Now surfaced. 
The UnReal Times could not verify whether the two events were correlated as the onlooker tried to imply. 
A few onlookers however insisted the fumes could be a smokescreen to hide some kind of celebrations inside the office. The UnReal Times could not even verify whether there was pun intended in this claim. 
Similar incidents of smoke over other media houses were reported too. 
Outside the CNN IBN office, one could see similar fumes rising, triggering alarm bells among onlookers. Again, firecrackers could have been behind the smoke, according to the observers. 
Outside the India Today office, not only was smoke seen rising in the air but a grey-haired man was seen enthusiastically distributing sweets among strangers. 
When asked, what was he celebrating the man replied, “Should we celebrate Diwali only during Diwali? Why not a day later? Does that mean we have become anti-national?” 
When asked if the celebration had anything to do with the Arnab Goswami resignation, the man replied with a grin, “Shubhratri. Good night!” 
Strangely, outside the Times Now office, no smoke was detected. Tweet About Amrut Thobbi

Biden Jr. performs his last constitutional act by presiding over the joint session of Congress Friday in the House chamber for the official acceptance of the Electoral College results from the states. [The Constitution directs Biden to break the seal on the results from the Electoral College votes held Dec. 19 in the state capitals and then tally the results to determine if a candidate has a majority of the electors. If no candidate has an absolute majority of electors, then    top three candidates are put up for a new election by the House of Representatives.  For the vote in the House, each state delegation votes among themselves and the winner inside the delegation is awarded the state’s single vote. Given that the Republicans hold the majority of 36 delegations, the Democrats hold 13 and Maine is a   tie, if the vote goes to the House, Trump wins in a huge landslide. The Electoral College is also determined by state, except Nebraska and Maine, which allow congressional districts to vote separately, regardless of the statewide vote. Voters are actually voting for a slate of electors chosen by the presidential candidate’s party to participate in the real election that happened in November. When Americans voted Nov. 8, Republican Donald J. Trump beat Democrat Hillary R. Clinton    when that vote was translated into the Electoral College. But in keeping with the constitutional plan, electors are free to vote for whomever they please, though some states have laws meant to bind them. After the vote Dec. 19, Trump led Clinton   . It is the    tally that Biden will verify Friday to be approved by the House and the Senate. There could be a challenge. First, a congressman makes a motion to challenge the tally, followed by a second congressman and one senator to   the challenge. In 2000, members of the Congressional Black Caucus challenged the results of an election that was marred by irregularities in Florida and one where the recount there was stopped by the Supreme Court just before the Electoral College met. The challenge did not go far because, despite the pleading of the congressmen, nary a senator would join the challenge. For that spectacle, Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. was the third man to preside over the final tally of his own defeat  —   Biden becomes the fourth. Four   have presided over their own victory: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, and George H. W. Bush. In 2004, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D. .) joined House Democrats in their challenge based on results in Ohio, which forced both chambers to separate and to debate the challenge for two hours.",0

[For those who fight at Standing Rock] 

Those sublime songs of Dakota 
Rushing hooves of wild buffalo 
Calloused tears and fragile fears 
When we held ourselves as each other’s dears 

When dancing water met with bovine oil 
And siblings from afar came across the hill 
We dug our heels deep in weary soil 
One people who would not be still 

Into these fields we staggered blue 
As their tanks and rubber bullets slowed our paces 
Phallic batons took their dreadful cue 
From hooded men with hidden faces 

They ordered us back and put up wires 
They said they had come to make all things better 
With jobs and dollars and ivory spires 
The old promises of the wounded tinkerer 

Black Snake must make his way, they said 
Our lands were dead and mute 
Their machines purred and thrummed and fed 
On the very music they sought to refute 

We knelt in stinging tears and cried 
As yellow cranes sliced our mother red 
A surgical operation to make abide 
That which was never even dead 

Their cameras turned away – our stories postponed 
The dogs were set on us – our honour dethroned 
The skies coughed with smoke – our visions abused 
Our bodies were tallied – our power refused 

So we poured a libation of limbs 
And danced and laughed and swayed 
We became like water, flowing defiant hymns 
Unstable ghosts, form delayed 
We could not be killed; we could not be set straight 
We were a murmuration of unholy stirring 
We were thick; we were many, and downright apostate 
Every gesture was a perverse gathering 

We were there to bleed, to shed old hides 
To tell the tales of stone, prairie and Sioux 
Our skins were a wordless prayer, a choir of haunting guides 
When they struck our bodies we melted through 

Their victory lay with utterly containing us, 
In tired halos of their own making 
But we held on to our kin, the open plains unctuous 
A victory nobler than winning 

We knew the pollination songs of bees 
We knew the sacredness of a handful of soil 
We knew the nobility of water and trees 
We knew their own eyes did not weep oil 

Hand in hand we stood on the rock 
Drunken children of returning water 
We stood for daughters and sons not yet flocked 
Their own happily ever after 

Never forget, we urged ourselves as many suns set 
Never forget! – our wounds yelled this anthem 
Never forget this day when each other we met 
To remember is to overcome 

And we remember, we remember 
Those sublime songs of Dakota 
Rushing hooves of wild buffalo 
Calloused tears and fragile fears 
When we held ourselves as each other’s dears 

When dancing water met with bovine oil 
And siblings from afar came across the hill 
We dug our heels deep in weary soil 
One people who would not be still",0

24712,Geert Wilders Will Not Be Prosecuted For 2015 Austrian Speech,"Dutch prosecutors have announced they will not be pursuing charges against firebrand Dutch politician Geert Wilders for a speech he made in Austria in 2015. [Prosecutors rejected an appeal from an Austrian Muslim association to prosecute the populist politician for incitement after he made a strong   speech in Vienna in 2015. The Dutch prosecutors said the content of Mr. Wilders’ speech was not punishable by Dutch law and that they will not pursue the matter any further, NU. nl reports.  Wilders was invited by the   migration Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in 2015 to give a speech on Islamisation at the Hofburg palace. During the speech, Wilders said: “Islam calls on people to become terrorists  —   the Quran leaves no doubt about it. ” He also stated: “Islam is an ideology of war and hatred. ” Wilders wrote a reply to the allegations saying that the charges were a “legal jihad” and “while the elites are to blame for the existential crisis we are currently in, with their open   and unprecedented love for Islam and their cultural relativism, they sell us out completely and put our freedom and security at stake. ” The Dutch prosecutor explained their decision saying: “Only if a statement focuses on a group characterised by a belief may be punishable. ” “Wilders spoke on this occasion about Islam, not about Muslims, a group characterised by their Islamic faith. This falls under criticism in Dutch law and is not as insulting a group of people. ” Wilders reacted to the decision on Twitter writing: “Beautiful. The only right decision. The truth must be said and can be correct about Islam!” Mooi. De enige juiste beslissing. De waarheid moet gezegd kunnen worden, juist over de islam! https:  .   —   Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) June 7, 2017,  The attempt to have Wilders brought to court for hate speech charges is not the first time the Party for Freedom (PVV) leader has been charged with incitement. Earlier this year, he was found guilty and fined 5, 000 euros for a speech he made in 2011 talking about the crime rates of Morrocan migrants in the Netherlands. Wilders’ PVV made substantial gains in the Dutch national elections earlier this year becoming the second largest party in the country. As the coalition talks stall, Wilders has said the PVV is “fully available” to take part in a new coalition government. Current Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has consistently said that he would not work with the PVV, as have other parties. If coalition talks continue to break down, the Netherlands could face the option of calling another election.",0

24714,Floyd Mayweather Next Fight: Should 'Money' Chase The 50th Win Of His Career? - Morning News USA,"Comment 
Floyd Mayweather Jr. has so far been mum on whether he will don boxing gloves once again despite call-outs from Manny Pacquiao and Conor McGregor. Pacquiao is coming off an impressive win over Jesse Vargas while “The Notorious” was responding to Mayweather’s jabs. 
Of the two, a rematch with Pacquiao is seen as a logical move as Mayweather eyes a 50-0 record. It would allow “Money” to break the tie though nothing has been set for now. Floyd Mayweather Sr. believes son should go for it 
Floyd Mayweather Sr. has had his share of do’s and don’ts and the recent dish adds yet another angle to Floyd Jr.’s plans. According to him, Floyd Jr. should consider fighting at least one more time to break the tie believing it will take years before anyone can break it, Fighthype.com reported. 
Also read : Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao Rematch Will Be A Disappointment, To Be Staged Just For Money? Floyd Sr. sends stern warning to Conor McGregor 
Similar to his son, Floyd Sr. believes Conor McGregor should slow down and keep quiet. He is confident that McGregor could be in for a beating, World Boxing News reported. As most know, this fantasy match is nowhere near of happening so perhaps it would be best to leave it as it is – a dream. 
On the serious side, a rematch with Pacquiao should be the perfect setting. The Filipino may do the necessary adjustments but it is still the logical and lucrative one. The revenue may not be similar to the first encounter but is nevertheless expected to be millions. 
Any boxing return eventually falls on the hands of Floyd Mayweather Jr. He seems content living out his retirement though the urge to go for 50-0 is still in the air. His father believes he should go for it, same with boxing aficionados. At the end of the day, it all depends on whether “Money” is willing to enter the ring for one last fight.

France’s interior minister has ordered the closure of four mosques that allegedly espoused a ‘radical ideology,’ the latest such shutdowns among dozens since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks nearly a year ago. 
A state of emergency in France allows for the closing of places of worship where the preaching risks provoking hate, violence or acts of terrorism.

24716,Trump Spokesman Is ‘Very Confident’ Wiretapping Evidence Will Emerge - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In the latest verbal acrobatics over President Trump’s allegation that President Barack Obama spied on him during the 2016 campaign, the White House spokesman said on Tuesday that he was confident Mr. Trump’s claim would eventually be found to be true. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he was “very confident” that the Justice Department would submit data to the House Intelligence Committee after it missed a Monday deadline to produce evidence of Mr. Trump’s claim. The House committee is investigating Russian interference in the presidential election. Mr. Trump is “extremely confident” that there will be evidence to support his accusation, Mr. Spicer said on Tuesday. “There is significant reporting about surveillance techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election. I’ll leave it to them to issue their report, but I think he feels very confident that what will ultimately come of this will vindicate him. ” Mr. Spicer also said that Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump who suggested in an interview that the surveillance could have included a microwave oven, made the comment as a joke. “The microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone, and I think that has been cleaned up,” Mr. Spicer said. “It was made in jest, so I think we can put that to rest. ” Ms. Conway said on Monday that she had not been referring to Mr. Obama’s surveillance against Mr. Trump when she mentioned a microwave, although she made the remark in response to a question about that topic. Mr. Spicer’s comments on Tuesday were the latest in a series of shifting explanations and deflections as Mr. Trump’s inner circle has tried to adhere to his extraordinary Twitter posts two weekends ago about his predecessor. After Mr. Trump posted statements claiming that Mr. Obama had tapped Mr. Trump’s phones at Trump Tower, White House officials said they had referred the matter to the House and Senate intelligence panels and would have no further comment until those findings were complete. But that posture has been difficult to maintain in the face of mounting questions from lawmakers and others about what Mr. Trump meant and where he got his information, with calls for him to publicly explain himself. On Monday, Mr. Spicer said that the president had not meant to imply that Mr. Obama had tapped his telephone, but that he was referring in general to surveillance that had been well documented, including articles by The New York Times, during the presidential race. But The Times did not report that Mr. Trump was the target of any surveillance, even though that notion has gained currency on   websites, including some that traffic in conspiracy theories. Mr. Spicer’s assertion on Tuesday that the allegation would ultimately be proved correct suggested either that the president believes there was enough evidence for himself to be implicated in a serious crime or as an agent of a foreign power, or that the Obama administration had flouted the law to spy on him. Asked directly whether Mr. Trump believed that microwave ovens or televisions had been used to spy on him, Mr. Spicer said: “I would just say that the president has tweeted about this. He’s pretty clear that he believes that there was surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election. ”",0
24717,AUDIO: Wayne Allen Root Shocks Trump On Air With Revelation About DNC Lies,"Obamacare Architect Admits on Live TV That This Is How Obamacare Was DESIGNED 
The various revelations from WikiLeaks were also a topic of discussion, with Root bringing up a message he had seen from Democrat National Committee head Donna Brazile to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta about just how terrible the economy really was, despite all of the glowing reports and reassurances to the general public from the administration and liberal media. 
Trump was actually somewhat shocked by the news, having not seen that particularly incriminating email yet, and begged Root to send him a copy or link to it so he could familiarize himself with the details and use it on the campaign trail. 
The topic of voter fraud also came up in the conversation, though the ever-optimistic Root insisted that Trump’s supporters would be capable of overcoming with a massive turnout whatever tricks might be in store. Root even jested that Trump would actually win the race by 10 points but be declared a winner by only two due to widespread fraud and irregularities.   
You can listen to the entire interview right here, with the interesting bit regarding Brazile’s email to Podesta about the economy coming shortly after the eight-minute mark. 
While the discussion was quite encouraging for Trump, it was also rather enlightening, as Root revealed more of the duplicitous nature of the Clinton campaign that Trump had not yet been made aware of. 
Hopefully Trump will follow the advice given him by Root and others and keep a focus on Obamacare over the remainder of the race, as that issue hits home with virtually all voters and most certainly doesn’t help Clinton at all.  ",0
24721,Brits Warned To Expect ’Indiscriminate Attacks on Innocent Civilians’,"Britain’s new terrorism watchdog Max Hill has expressed “enormous concern” about returning jihadis, warning that Islamic terrorists have UK cities in their sights for future attacks. [Mr Hill, who was unveiled last week as the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the Sunday Telegraph that there was an “enormous ongoing risk which none of us can ignore”.  One of Britain’s leading prosecutors, he said the risk of terror in Britain is at its highest since the 1970s. He cautioned that “it would be wrong to draw a simple comparison between Irish republicanism and the ideology of   Islamic State. “But in terms of the threat that’s represented, I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning  —   with a view to indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour in metropolitan areas  —   represents an enormous   risk that none of us can ignore. ” Mr Hill, whose appointment follows a 30 year legal career, also expressed concern over the imminent return to Britain of hundreds of jihadis who have been fighting with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “It’s an enormous concern that large numbers  —   we know this means at least hundreds of British citizens who have left this country in order to fight  —   are now returning or may be about to return,” Mr Hill said. “Of course the imminent fall of Mosul and perhaps the prospective retaking of Raqqa are both bound to lead to a higher instance of returning fighters. Does that mean that the British public need to be immediately alarmed at a spike in terrorist activity within this country? “The answer to that is, I don’t know, but it doesn’t follow as a matter of fact that those who chose to go to live or fight abroad will bring that fight back to this country. ” Mr Hill further cautioned that British teenagers are being “radicalised by hate speech online”. But he defended ministers who approved the reported £1 million payout to Ronald Fiddler  —   the former Guantanamo detainee who this month carried out a suicide bomb attack. Figures disclosed by the Home Office in May last year showed that just one in eight jihadis who fought in the Middle East for extremist groups had been successfully prosecuted. Earlier this week a National Front member was sentenced to five years jail after making a series of offensive posts online, and distributing racist stickers and posters near his house. “We are as committed to apprehending and prosecuting far right extremists who commit terrorist offences and promote hatred as we are those who support and promote Islamic State. Both are intent on destroying communities and pose a real risk if they are allowed to continue” said Dean Haydon of the Counter Terrorism Command following the verdict.",0

24724,Politico Scoop: Lara Trump Supports Beagle Rescue Org with Felon in Leadership - Breitbart,"Politico Senior White House Reporter Darren Samuelsohn kicked off Memorial Day 2017 by hawking a hot investigative scoop: Lara Trump, wife to President Donald Trump’s son Eric, supports a beagle adoption advocacy group where one top executive once served time in prison for encouraging activists to torment animal researchers. [Lara Trump’s animal rights partner did 6 y in fed prison 4 harassing  stalking researchers. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Darren Samuelsohn (@dsamuelsohn) May 29, 2017,   “Eric Trump’s wife has publicly aligned with a controversial animal rights group,” Samuelsohn writes, “the Beagle Freedom Project, whose leadership includes a felon who served a   sentence in federal prison for harassing and stalking researchers. ” The connection, he asserts, “brings political risk. ” Said felon, Kevin Chase (née Kjonaas) was sentenced in 2006 and released from prison in 2011. And while there is no defending the acts which led to Chase’s conviction, Samuelsohn employs little more than innuendo to link them to BFP. “Lara Trump’s support for the Beagle Freedom Project has alarmed researchers and leaders from the pharmaceutical industry,” Samuelsohn writes, “as well as other animal rights organizations who say studies involving dogs and cats are well regulated by the federal government. ” BFP advocates for state laws forcing animal testing facilities to put research animals up for adoption instead of euthanizing them and performing more tissue tests  —   as well as encouraging individuals to rescue said animals. The group has partnered with celebrities such as Maria Menounos, Whitney Cummings, Corey Feldman, Amy Smart, Sia Furler, and Miley Cyrus in the past. Samuelsohn acknowledges that the only controversial element of BFP is Chase’s criminal history. “The Beagle Freedom Project’s stated goals are more mainstream” than his past groups, the Animal Liberation Front and Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, he writes. He also notes that the org received a $500, 000 contest reward from Microsoft  —   even after critics brought up Chase’s past. Samuelsohn did not answer an email asking if it was his idea or an editor’s assignment to veer from his White House beat to cover the loose association between a   activist and a New     to the President.",0
24725,China Tries to Censor AI Victory Over Go Champion - Breitbart,"The Chinese government attempted to prevent its citizens from watching Google’s AlphaGo AI defeat the world’s best player. [Ke Jie’s “horrible experience” against Google’s latest AI experiment was withheld from live broadcast by state censors. As reported by the China Digital Times, the censorship notice dictates that “Regarding the go match between Ke Jie and AlphaGo, no website, without exception, may carry a livestream. ” If a livestream had been announced in advance, the notice demanded that the announcement be immediately withdrawn.  Go is a    pastime that has remained largely unchanged from its earliest historic iterations. Competence in playing has been considered a sort of status symbol for countless generations, and the potential for a computer to unseat Ke Jie seems to have been enough to unsettle Chinese censors. The Go champion was himself put off by AlphaGo’s uncanny prowess, saying “I feel like his game is more and more like the ‘Go god. ’” He vowed never to play against AlphaGo again  —   a stark contrast to the bravado of his “Bring it on!” enthusiasm following AlphaGo’s   victory against South Korean Grandmaster Lee Sedol. Regardless of the government’s wishes, sites like bilibili. com skirted the ban by recreating the game, move by move, on their own Go boards. Meanwhile, Google’s DeepMind YouTube channel has the matches available for interested viewers outside of China. AlphaGo is part of the DeepMind AI project acquired by Google in 2014. It is partially   having played millions of games against itself in order to master the strategic complexity of the ancient game.

24731,Baghdad Car Bomb Kills Scores in Shiite Neighborhood - The New York Times,"ERBIL, Iraq  —   A car bomb exploded in a crowded Shiite Muslim neighborhood in Baghdad late Thursday afternoon, the latest terror attack in the capital claimed by the Islamic State, security officials reported. At least 54 people were killed and at least 63 more wounded in the bombing, making it the deadliest in Baghdad in at least a month. The attack came as Iraqi security forces, backed by American military advisers and Special Operations forces, prepared to assault an Islamic State stronghold in Mosul, Iraq’s   city, about 225 miles north of Baghdad. The country has been consumed by news from Mosul, where Iraqi forces have been mounting the country’s largest military operation since the United States invasion in 2003, driving Islamic State fighters from eastern Mosul over the last month Security officials said the bomb in Baghdad went off in a parked pickup truck. Ambulances responding to the scene quickly filled to capacity, so the police and civilians helped transport other victims to hospitals, according to Abu Jafar, a police commissioner. Mr. Jafar said the morgue at Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad was overflowing with bodies of the dead, and the hospital’s emergency room was filled to capacity with seriously injured people. The Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, posted a statement online claiming responsibility for the attack, and said that it was aimed at Shiite Muslims, whom many fundamentalist Sunnis consider to be nonbelievers. Shiites are a majority in Iraq and dominate the national government. Prime Minister Haider   convened an emergency meeting with top military and security officials Thursday night to discuss efforts to combat terrorist attacks. A witness to the bombing, Amir Abas, 35, said he was standing about 150 yards from the pickup truck when it exploded. “I saw a lot of burned bodies, and injured people and burned cars everywhere,” he said. The bombing took place in the Baya neighborhood of southern Baghdad, where there are a number of parking lots in which people gather to buy and sell used cars, attracting large crowds on weekday afternoons. Civilians in Shiite neighborhoods have often been the targets of attacks claimed by the Islamic State. Shiite militias, known as popular mobilization forces, are expected to take part in the military assault in western Mosul and particularly in the neighboring city of Tal Afar to the west. On   television channels in Iraq, news reports from Mosul are shown with a standing logo that says in Arabic and English, “Nineveh, We Are Coming. ” Mosul, the last major city in Iraq where the Islamic State still maintains significant control, is the capital of Nineveh Province. Baghdad has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks recently. At least 11 people were killed Wednesday by a bombing in another   lot at the edge of Sadr City, a large Shiite neighborhood. A suicide bombing in January in Sadr City killed more than 30 people. Hakim   a legislator who heads the security and defense committee in Parliament, criticized intelligence and security officials for failing to anticipate the attack on Thursday. Mr. Zamili has been a frequent critic of the security establishment. “This explosion indicates the weakness of the intelligence network in Baghdad,” he said in a telephone interview on Thursday night. Islamic State terrorists are able to carry out attacks “at any time and anywhere” in the capital, he said.",0

24733,"House Freedom Caucus Saved GOP Majority from Ryancare Disaster, Says Voter Study - Breitbart","A sophisticated analysis of polling data shows that the House Freedom Caucus saved the GOP’s House majority from a huge electoral backlash by helping to defeat the House Speaker Paul Ryan’s alternative to Obamacare, says Chris Wilson, head of WPA Research. [The “House Freedom Caucus members held the line, and the data show that is precisely what their constituents wanted,” he wrote in a report, titled “Analytics shows HFC saved GOP on Health Care. ”  On Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert predicted any approval of Ryan’s healthcare overhaul would wreck the GOP’s House majority in 2018. “This bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority   …     [and] If we pass a bill that doesn’t bring down premiums and give the American people hope, and not give more power to the government   …     then we will deserve to be voted out,” he said in a speech on the House floor, according to TheHill.   “While full repeal and replace of Obamacare has overwhelming support in these districts, even keeping Obamacare intact was more popular than the AHCA, often by more than a    margin,” said Wilson, who managed Sen. Ted Cruz’s voter analysis and tracking efforts in 2016.   The same analysis was applied to 2018 Senate races and concluded that “the House Freedom Caucus did   …     Republicans’ hopes of expanding their Senate majority, a great service in stopping the [Ryancare] bill before it made it across the Capitol,” Wilson wrote.  But Wilson’s analysis also shows strong public support for an alternative    “plan that allows for the sale of insurance across state lines, expands Health Savings Accounts, incentivizes states to create   pools, block grants Medicaid, and is portable so it can be taken from job to job. ” Wilson’s analysis is based a huge national survey, which allows his group to understand the preference of each population subgroup. For example, voters are asked three questions about each issue, he said. Typically, one question is skewed from a   perspective, one question is skewed from the right, and the third question is intended to be unbiased, he said. In turn, the team then used three   models to predict preferences among each politicians’ particular subgroups of voters. In this survey, the models were used to gauge each district’s’ voters preference for three healthcare options  —   continuing Obamacare, establishing Ryan’s “Ryancare” replacement, and the third option, “Repeal and replace. ” Subsequently, the analysts spend much time check and rechecking the accuracy of the   models in each district, he said, adding “you’ve got to spend time ” Politicians are increasingly using this style of voter analysis to understand their constituents, amid constant pressure from lobbyists and donors, he said.  In the healthcare analysis, Wilson said he didn’t try to gauge why the voters approved or rejected each of the three policy options. “I don’t have the ability to discern or divine the reason why the voters answered as they did  …     that’s the next stage” of development, he added.

24734,Comment on New USDA Rules Eliminate Junk Food in Schools by conflictedhealth,"Apparently Michelle hasn’t ruined the kids’ lunches enough already. An example of Michelle Obama’s mandated school lunches 
From Yahoo : Students might notice some changes in the cafeteria when they go back to school in a few weeks. The USDA will announce rules today that require schools to get rid of unhealthy snacks and eliminate students’ exposure to junk food , ABC News has exclusively learned. 
The biggest difference this year will be what students see around the school. If a snack, food item or beverage is not healthy enough for a school to sell or serve, it can’t be advertised either. That means no more pictures of soda on vending machines or in the cafeteria. 
Katie Wilson, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said many schools requested these changes. “Education and wellness and advertising to kids about healthier choices [and] that all has to be part of the school environment just like making sure they have pencils and paper and computers,” Wilson said. 
One study found that 70 percent of elementary and middle school students see ads for junk food at school and research published earlier this month showed that kids tend to eat more after seeing ads for unhealthy food. Another lovely school lunch 
Snacks can’t have too many calories or too much sodium, fat or sugar, according to the guidelines for schools . Foods that are “whole grain-rich” or mostly made up of fruits or vegetables are emphasized, and schools are recommended to sell only water, low-fat milk or milk alternatives, or 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice. 
Wilson said 98 percent of schools around the country already meet these standards. Now that the rules are finalized, she said the USDA will continue its efforts to educate parents, communities and school staff about better nutritional food choices. 
Healthier food in schools is nothing new. Guidelines about healthy school lunches and snacks have been rolling out for several years and are part of First Lady Michelle Obama ’s “Let’s Move” campaign launched in 2010 to fight childhood obesity .

24735,World’s tallest church being eroded by urinating revellers,"World’s tallest church being eroded by urinating revellers  14 Get short URL The church is the tallest in the world. © akinchelow / Instagram The 162m tall Ulm Minster church in Germany isn’t just attracting people answering the call of God but also those answering the call of nature and it’s now contributing to the erosion of its sandstone base. 
Increased patrols and fines have failed to stop those who use the landmark as a meeting point and to urinate on the base of the church. The urine’s acid and salts has contributed to the erosion of its sandstone base, according to the Südwest Presse . A photo posted by Zara :] (@osnapitszara) on Oct 15, 2012 at 5:50pm PDT There are 768 steps to the top of the Ulm Minister, but the views from above are worth the climb! #GermanTownTuesday pic.twitter.com/Hn6DUutcun — German Embassy (@GermanyinUSA) June 21, 2016 
""I've been keeping an eye on it for half a year now and, once again, it's coated with urine and vomit"" the church’s head of maintenance Michael Hilbert told the Presse. Hilbert said he does not want to be known as the “pee police” but that the issue “is about preserving law and order."" 
Fines for public urination have doubled to €100 but this has done little to stem the practice. 
Located at the popular Münsterplatz, the church will probably see an increase in those needing to relieve themselves next month as a wine festival and Christmas markets land on its doorstep. Hilbert said free toilets are needed in the area to help prevent further deterioration of the church's base because of the urination on the church. 
During the town’s holiday of Schwörmontag this year, the southern part of the church was closed off to the public in an effort to prevent the offence, but this failed to make much of an impact according to one city spokeswoman. 
“As long as there are people” the problem will persist, she told the Presse, admitting that public urinators had proved elusive,with virtually none of the perpetrators caught in the act. 
The Lutheran church is the tallest church in the world and the fourth tallest structure built prior to the 20th century, making it one very large tree to pee on.",0
24736,Those Threats Are Real,"Christopher Manion https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/threats-real/ 
Back in the 1980s, I was involved in Senate hearings that exposed some of the corruption in the Mexican government, business elites, police, and the military. 
We were only touching the tip of the iceberg, of course, but the State Department vehemently opposed us nonetheless (yes, there were neocons there then as well). 
The hearings were ignored in the States, but they raised Hell in Mexico, and that meant that it raised Hell in the coven of apparatchiks at State as well. They did their best to retaliate, and, fortunately, the leader of the pack pleaded years later to federal charges of lying to Congress (“Hey, doesn’t everybody???!!”) on another matter (Sometimes the chickens do come home to roost.). 
But the Mexican corruptos were a different breed. Nobody was going to bring them to justice – the ruling PRI (then and now) was seamlessly coordinating and cooperating with the drug gangs, the military killers, and the corrupt elites. 
Several years later, I planned to attend a conference in Mexico City – where I used to live, but had not visited since our hearings. Then, out of nowhere, at a social function, a diplomat from the Embassy of Mexico in Washington approached me and said, “I hear you’re going to Mexico.” (How did she know?) 
“Go nowhere alone,” she said sternly. “Stay in your hotel after dark. Travel only with the other conferees on the bus (she knew everything about this very non-political conference). And NEVER hail a cab!” 
So there I was. I couldn’t go to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe. I couldn’t go visit old friends in their homes. I couldn’t even go look at the house in Colonia Polanco where Stalin’s secret agent from Barcelona killed Leon Trotsky with a pickaxe. 
So I asked this generous woman, who was probably risking her career, why she was telling me this. 
“They have long memories. They have a kill list. I’ve seen it,” she said. 
Period. 
The (im)moral of the story: Death threats are real. So this recent headline caught my attention: 
Dave Schippers, who served as the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee’s probe into whether Bill Clinton committed impeachable offenses, is “terrified by Hillary Clinton.” 
Read it . He wanted to investigate everything, including the corruption, the cattle futures, the murders – not only Vince Foster’s, but all those folks in Arkansas But he was waved off. He read every single document that had been collected on the breadth and depth of the Clinton Corruption Machine, but he was stiffed by unidentified higher-ups. 
Ever since, he’s watched his back. I’m sure that he can’t walk around alone at night, or hail a cab on a busy street, or take his kids to the park. 
Why? Because death threats are real. Ignore them and you die.",0

Obvious political double standards
When it comes to scandal-plagued and utterly dishonest Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch clandestinely meets on the tarmac of Sky Harbor airport for a tête-à-tête with Hill’s husband Bill aboard a private jet — ostensibly to discuss grandchildren.
And, though FBI Director James Comey found compelling evidence of concerning issues in Hillary Clinton’s use of multiple private email servers, he concluded that he would not recommend charges against her, though he conceded Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” in handling classified information. Comey refused to recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton, despite “evidence” she violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, jeopardizing U.S. national security. These breaches occurred during her term as Secretary of State. “There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information,” Comey acknowledged.
Additionally, Comey noted that other individuals in a similar situation would not necessarily be let off the hook with no charges, and would probably face penalties. “But that’s not what we’re deciding now,” he glibly fed us, the sheeple. “We are expressing to Justice our view that no charges be made in this case.”
“Justice,” of course, is U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the tarmac meeting fame. Addressing the people of the United States, the FBI director actually said that “no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear” on the investigation. He neglected to mention the inappropriate meeting between former president Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch aboard a private jet.
Hillary Clinton is free to run for the U.S. Presidency, guaranteeing Obama’s third term.
Here in Arizona, we have what clearly appears to be a personal vendetta carried out by a federal judge timed to coincide with the General Election in which popular Sheriff Joe Arpaio is on the ballot running for a seventh term. He was formally charged Tuesday with criminal contempt of court for ignoring U.S. District Judge Murray Snow’s order in a three-year old racial-profiling case. Arpaio acknowledged violating Snow’s order but insists the breach wasn’t intentional
Arpaio’s challenger in the race is once again rough ‘er up Democrat Paul Penzone, funded by multi-billionaire Socialist George Soros, who is contemptuous of national borders. Soros also funds Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
If convicted, Sheriff Arpaio could face up to six months in jail. A misdemeanor conviction would not bar Arpaio from serving as sheriff.

24741,Study Finds 88 Percent of Media Coverage is Anti-Trump,"A new study finds that 88 percent of coverage of President Donald Trump and his administration is negative. [The study by the Media Research Center (MRC) found that the evening newscasts on the “Big Three” TV networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, were overwhelmingly hostile to Trump.  In its study, the MRC found that over the president’s first 30 days in office, the networks dedicated 16 hours of coverage to President Trump, 54 percent of its total news coverage. MRC found up to 674 negative statements aimed at Trump while only a tiny 88 statements were deemed positive. “Our measure of media tone excludes soundbites from identified partisans, focusing instead on tallying the evaluative statements made by reporters and the   talking heads (experts and average citizens) included in their stories,” MRC noted. “In their coverage of Trump’s first month, the networks crowded their stories with quotes from citizens angry about many of his policies, while providing relatively little airtime to Trump supporters. The MRC also noted that “anchors and reporters often injected their own   editorial tone into the coverage. ” The study also noted that the president’s call for a temporary moratorium on travel from seven   nations drew the most negative coverage. Other negative coverage centered on Trump’s border policies, his economic plans, the battle over his cabinet picks, as well as Trump’s “complicated relationship” with Russia. “Further highlighting the hostile tone of these newscasts, nearly an hour of coverage (56 minutes) was given over to   protests on various topics, with nearly   (82 out of 442) of the Trump stories or briefs aired during these 30 days including at least some discussion of an   protest,” the MRC concluded.

24746,Poland Establishing New Territorial Defense Force to Fight ‘Russian Threat’,"Politics Poland Establishing New Territorial Defense Force to Fight ‘Russian Threat’ 
Poland's right-wing government is creating a new military arm to counter the supposed Russian threat, as well as planning to double the size of Poland's armed forces Originally appeared at Sputnik 
The Polish government has given a final go-ahead to the planned creation of a territorial defense force, which local media were quick to call the “personal army” of Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz. Sputnik Poland discussed the issue with Polish politician and commentator Mariusz Olszewski. 
“ Macierewicz is a very efficient politician and defense minister and his ability to place [the territorial defense force] under his personal command, rather that the president’s is nothing short of a political masterpiece, ” Mariusz Olszewski told Sputnik Poland. 
He added that the new force was obviously meant for use inside the country against the so-called “death squads” trying to destabilize the political situation in the country. 
“If this is really what is happening, then the government’s fears are fully justified,” Olszewski chuckled. 
In the event of an armed conflict the territorial defense units will be called up to secure their designated areas, stamp out attempts to stoke up ethnic and religious conflicts and attempts to destabilize the country. 
When asked whether it means that the Territorial Defense Force (TDF) would serve as a kind of “personal police” for the ruling Law and Justice party, Mariusz Olszewski said that it would rather serve the national security minister. 
“The very list of threats the TDF is supposed to deal with looks a bit strange though as we have no internal threats, neither have we any regional or ethnic minorities here,” Olszewski said, adding that the real threat to the powers-that-be came from people who “use Western money to destabilize the country through media ‘death squads’ and challenge the constitutional order in Poland.” 
“I am also worried by Ukrainian media saying that it could take the Polish army just five days to reach the border of the Second Polish Republic [prior to 1939 — Ed.]. This is exactly the kind of misinformation Western propaganda was spreading about Russian troops needing just 24 hours to reach Warsaw. Someone is trying to pit Eastern European countries against each other, to make people believe that war is imminent,” Mariusz Olszewski warned. 
While admitting that security was something no country should ignore, he added that a country the size of Poland might need a territorial defense force, but only as a backup to the regular forces, “not as the mainstay of national defense as our defense ministry wants us to believe. This is either someone’s mistake or just a PR stunt.” 
“Poland needs ground forces, an Air Force and, to a lesser extent, a Navy. As for territorial defense, it is just a smokescreen meant to hide what is really happening in our army,” Mariusz Olszewski emphasized . 
The Territorial Defense Force (TDF) is a planned military reserve component of the Polish armed forces which is currently being formed. 
Plans call for the force, once fully active, to consist of 35,000 part-time volunteers. Poland plans to deploy the new territorial defense units on its eastern border and to transfer the acting brigades there with an eye to becoming one of the largest NATO armies in Europe. 
Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said that the deployment was aimed against Russia, describing it as a ""measured, proportionate"" response to ""the prospect of aggressive Russian action."" 
He also supports the idea of significantly boosting the Polish armed forces, from the current 80,000 servicemen to some 150,000.  ",0
24747,Popcast: The Best Albums of 2016 - The New York Times,"One of the unexpected byproducts of the streaming era is how a certain tier of artists  —   already famous, prone to eccentricity  —   have doubled down on albums. These blocks of work demand to be consumed as a whole, and serve as an enemy of the ephemerality of music consumption. This year, artists like Beyoncé, Bon Iver, Kanye West, Sturgill Simpson and Frank Ocean delivered albums that were meant to be taken in all at once, and pushed aesthetic boundaries while doing so. All of their albums appear on     lists from the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times  —   some on more than one. On this week’s Popcast, I speak with Jon Pareles, the chief pop music critic, and Joe Coscarelli, the pop music reporter, about the year’s best albums, the ones widely agreed on and the ones with more specific, narrow appeal.

New Wikileaks documents show that Hillary Clinton, in association with the mainstream media, was given debate questions ahead of time. What’s more, as you’ll see below, Hillary, who claims she was merely taking notes, was actually reading directly off of the podium , almost as if someone was feeding her answers and bullet points… 

From Mac Slavo, SHTFPlan : 
New Wikileaks documents show that Hillary Clinton, in association with the mainstream media, was given debate questions ahead of time. It’s also been rumored that the former First Lady may have used an ear piece at one of the debates, giving her a significant advantage. 
Last week footage of the final Presidential debate begain circling the internet and showed that Clinton may have been using some sort of screen at her podium. While many dismissed this as a lighting effect, an investigation by Piper McGowin at The Daily Sheeple suggests thatHillary may have actually been using some sort of tablet device. 
The following video will leave little doubt that something just wasn’t right at the last debate. As you’ll see, Hillary, who claims she was merely taking notes, was actually reading directly off of the podium, almost as if someone was feeding her answers and bullet points. 
Moreover, and quite damning, the notes Hillary was supposedly taking were were being written down with a pen that didn’t have a tip on it . So, either she wasn’t taking notes, or, she was using a stylus on an electronic device.

24749,"Fire Tears Through Manila Slum, Leaving 15,000 Homeless - The New York Times","MANILA  —   A fire raced through a squalid Manila shantytown teeming with people on Tuesday night, as residents armed only with buckets of water tried to fight the inferno. As day broke on Wednesday, more than 15, 000 people found themselves homeless, bereft of their few worldly possessions and forced to sleep on the Philippine capital’s streets. “It spread fast across the neighboring homes made of light materials,” said Wilberto Tiu, Manila’s fire chief. “Firemen had trouble reaching the area because of small alleyways,” Mr. Tiu said of the warren of closely built homes, some constructed of no more than plywood and scrap metal. He said the alleys between homes were too narrow for fire trucks. Residents tried to outrun the blaze, grabbing whatever they could carry: pots and pans, family pets, washing machines and electric fans. Dozens of people were injured in the stampede, but miraculously, officials said, no one was killed. The blaze had been brought under control by Wednesday morning. Fires in the country’s slums are a regular occurrence. About 1, 200 families were left without homes in January after a fire in Navotas, a suburb of Manila. Residents of shantytowns are at particular risk in the months of February and March, as the weather warms and the rains stop, officials said. In March 2015, more than 7, 000 families were left homeless when a blaze tore through the same slum, Parola Compound, near the capital’s main port. In 2014, the homes of at least 2, 500 families in the slum were destroyed in a predawn blaze. Investigators said they believed Tuesday’s blaze was caused by faulty electrical wiring or a malfunctioning gas stove. By Wednesday morning, hundreds of families were left to sleep on the street, some at a makeshift shelter at a covered basketball court, disaster officials said. Television footage showed children sleeping on sidewalks along streets near the slum, as health workers distributed food and other supplies.",0

[The rape survivor, Emma, told Katie Hopkins on LBC radio on Sunday: “I actually reported my abuse 14 years ago. I went to the authorities, my parents did. I sat and gave video interviews with the police, I was willing to work with them.  “But as soon as I said the names, I was made to feel as though I was racist and I was the one who had the problem. ” “I was specifically told not to comment on the ethnicity of the perpetrators,” Emma said, adding she was told “numerous times” by police and social workers not to mention race. “I knew I wasn’t racist, but I felt like that was used as a way to silence me. ” Asked by Ms. Hopkins how that made her feel at the time, Emma said: “My perpetrators made me feel like I was in the wrong and they [police and social workers] fed into that. And I felt like: ‘Maybe my perpetrators are right. Maybe it’s not them that’s got the problem, maybe it’s me’. ” Groomed from 12, Emma told LBC listeners she was a virgin when she was raped at age 13. Detailing that the rapes happened regularly, she described one occasion where she was locked in a property and sexually assaulted by multiple men. The Muslim grooming gang then began blackmailing the young teen, and threatened to gang rape her mother if she told her parents. “That was my life,” she said. The rapes continued after she reported it to police, as authorities told her it was “[her] word against his”. The police had also lost the clothes she had been raped in, leaving her with no evidence for a prosecution. Let down by authorities, she found herself being further abused by other rape gangs. She reported rape again at the age of 14, but police said there was not enough evidence. Eventually, her parents moved her out of the country. “Nobody wanted to stop it, and that was the only way they could stop it,” Emma said. Ms. Hopkins told Emma that other parents of victims of Muslim grooming gangs had moved their daughters abroad, saying moving girls to different parts of the country was ineffective as the rape gangs are “networked between cities”. The Rotherham child sex abuse scandal is the biggest child protection scandal in Britain’s history, where, since the late 1980s, police and social services failed to protect girls from predatory grooming gangs made up of Muslim men for fear of being labelled racist, leading to institutional  .

24761,Comment on Fury as German primary school ‘forces’ children to chant ‘Allahu Akbar’ in Muslim prayer by Dr. Eowyn,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by DCG | 2 Comments 
Ain’t multiculturalism grand? 
From Daily Express : The father of the pupil at the girl’s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. 
He claimed she had been “forced” by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. 
The handout read: “Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.” 
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in “ethics” at the Bavarian school. 
Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. 
The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children’s nursery was refusing to acknowledge “Christmas rituals” to accommodate the “diverse cultures” of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils were Christian. 
A spokesman for Kassel explained: “There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.” 
Migrants now outnumber native children at many schools in Germany as the country has been inundated with migrants in recent years. More than one million migrants are estimated to have arrived in Germany during the last year alone. 
The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees estimates that another 200,000 people will apply for asylum in 2017.

24764,How We Put Together Our 52 Places to Go List - The New York Times,"For the 12th straight year, the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue. You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? What’s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes. ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017.  What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country?  Canada has it all (O. K. maybe not tropical beaches). It’s a world unto itself, with Vancouver Island surf breaks, culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal, and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And, let’s face it, clichés of Mounties and hockey aside, Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. It’s a great time to correct that, as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you’ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. “Travel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place,” said Maureen Towey, the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. “We ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle, a   balloon or a ski lift, we say yes every time. ” On a computer, you’ll also notice a stunning drone video, shot in Tofino, on the western coast of Vancouver Island. “After many wet days, there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better,” said Josh Haner, a staff photographer who shot the footage. “As my drone’s batteries were running out, I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes. ” And print readers will notice something new as well: a special   presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall). How do you start the process? We ask our regular contributors, many of whom live overseas or roam the globe, for ideas. We get hundreds of them. What are you looking for in those ideas? First, why now? That is, why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both   and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots even though cities like London, Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting, they didn’t make this year’s list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A   meeting, in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didn’t make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are, of course, just the start. There are thousands of wonderful destinations to consider. We’d love to hear your suggestions  —   use the #52Places2017 hashtag on Instagram to suggest yours.",0
24769,Rick Perry Accuses Texas A&ampM of Disqualifying Student Government Election Winner in ’Name of Diversity’ - Breitbart,"Rick Perry has accused administrators at Texas AM of disqualifying a student who was elected to serve as student body president “in the name of ‘diversity. ’”[Robert McIntosh, the son of a prominent Republican fundraiser who supported President Trump in his bid for the White House, was disqualified after winning an election for Texas AM’s student body president by over 700 votes. The position of student body president was awarded to the   finisher, Bobby Brooks, a junior who became Texas AM’s first openly gay student body president.  McIntosh was initially disqualified over claims that he may have engaged in voter intimidation tactics. The concern was quickly dismissed by Texas AM’s Judicial Court, which The Washington Post calls “the university’s version of a student supreme court. ” But McIntosh’s disqualification was upheld, with the reason given that he “failed to disclose financial information for glow sticks briefly featured in a campaign video. ” Secretary of Energy and former Governor of Texas Rick Perry, who is an alumnus of Texas AM, wrote a column for The Houston Chronicle citing his concerns over the decision to take the position away from McIntosh over the purchase of glow sticks that appeared in his campaign video. “As Texas’ first Aggie governor and as someone who was twice elected Yell Leader of Texas AM University, I am deeply troubled by the recent conduct of AM’s administration and Student Government Association (SGA) during the Aggie   president elections for ” he began. Mainstream media outlets like The Washington Post were quick to question the motivations behind Secretary Perry’s criticisms, running the headline “Rick Perry accuses Texas AM’s first gay student body president of stealing election” on their Facebook page. ”I viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character”  —   Rick Perry on election of gay student. Does this headline suggest that? pic. twitter.   —   Tommy (@tciccotta) March 23, 2017,  Perry argued that the student body’s support of Brooks as an openly gay student was a “testament to the Aggie character. ” “When I first read that our student body had elected an openly gay man, Bobby Brooks, for president of the student body, I viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character. I was proud of our students because the election appeared to demonstrate a commitment to treating every student equally, judging on character rather than on personal characteristics,” he wrote. Despite The Washington Post‘s suggestion, Perry’s criticism wasn’t pointed at Brooks it was pointed at the administrators responsible for disqualifying McIntosh on a technicality. “In its opinion, the Judicial Court admitted that the charges were minor and technical, but, incredibly, chose to uphold the disqualification, with no consideration given to whether the punishment fit the crime. The desire of the electorate is overturned, and thousands of student votes are disqualified because of free glow sticks that appeared for 11 seconds of a   campaign. Apparently, glow sticks merit the same punishment as voter intimidation,” he argued. Perry claimed that McIntosh received the glow sticks for participating in a charity event before the campaign and also that the other candidates weren’t asked to itemize the expenses of props used in their campaign videos. “Now, Brooks’ presidency is being treated as a victory for ‘diversity.’ It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for ‘diversity’ is the real reason the election outcome was overturned,” Perry argued. “Does the principle of ‘diversity’ override and supersede all other values of our Aggie Honor Code? “Honestly, we were just surprised to see that the secretary of energy would take the time to weigh in in detail,” Amy Smith, the school’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, told the Texas Tribune, “and we respectfully disagree with his assessment of what happened. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

24770,"WATCH: Diamond And Silk Slam Obama, Kerry For ’Stabbing Israel In The Back’ - Breitbart","TEL AVIV  —   The YouTube sensations known as Diamond and Silk released a new video slamming President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry for “stabbing Israel in the back. ”[The hilarious duo, sisters with the real names of Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, rose to fame when they shot videos in ardent support of   Donald Trump during his bid for the Republican nomination.   Their latest video, entitled “We Stand With Israel: Kerry and Obama don’t know where they stand,” lambasts Kerry for his address last week on the   conflict. In apparent reference to Kerry’s wife Teresa Heinz, Hardaway said, “Kerry must be slipping in all of that Heinz Ketchup —  ’cause he trippin’!” Hardaway continues by attacking Obama for not having Israel’s back and for being “out of touch. ” “Let me tell you something: Israel is our ally, so that means we have to have their backs! I don’t care if their back is small, and our backs are big, we still got to have their backs  —   period. ” “[Obama] was out of touch with this election. He was out of touch with the American people. And now he is out of touch with Israel,” she says. “And if he’s not careful, somebody will end up stabbing Israel in the back,” she cries, as Richardson animatedly demonstrates the    action. “And we can’t let that happen!” To end, the two sisters declare in unison: “Guess what  —   We stand with Israel!

24771,Ronald Reagan: ’Those Who Seek to Inflict Harm Are Not Fazed by Gun Control Laws’ - Breitbart,"During his 1983 speech to the NRA Annual Meetings in Phoenix, Arizona, Ronald Reagan noted that “those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws. ”[Reagan stood before an applauding NRA crowd and reminded them that he, too, was a member of the NRA. He praised the NRA for the work it was doing to defend the right to keep and bear arms and pointed out that a large portion of the group’s two and a half million members had rallied to defeat gun control in California in November 1982.  He then said, “It’s a nasty truth, but those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws. ” He added, “I happen to know this from personal experience,” referencing the assassination attempt on his own life in March 30, 1981. Reagan then said, “I’ve always felt a special bond with the members of your group. You live by Lincoln’s words, ‘Important principles may and must be inflexible. ’” He added: [The NRA’s] philosophy put its trust in people, so you insist [that] individuals be held responsible for their actions.  The NRA believes that America’s laws were made to be obeyed and that our constitutional liberties are just as important today as 200 years ago. And by the way, the constitution does not say that government shall decree the right to keep and bear arms. The constitution says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Reagan gave his NRA speech in 1983 and no president followed suit until President Donald Trump. The NRA announced that Trump will speak at the Annual Meetings on April 28, 2017, in Atlanta. NRATV is celebrating Trump’s coming speech in a video that features snippets of Reagan’s 1983 speech, then segues to candidate Trump speaking at the Annual Meetings in 2016, when the NRA endorsed him.

24772,Former NFL Player Aaron Hernandez’s Body Found with Bible Verse Written on His Forehead - Breitbart,"Authorities are now reporting that Aaron Hernandez had a verse from the Bible written on his forehead when he was found hanged with a bed sheet in his prison cell on Wednesday. [The    former New England Patriots star was found dead in his jail cell only days after being pronounced not guilty in a second murder trial, the AP reported.  Officials now say that Hernandez had written a portion of John 3:16 across his forehead, the New York Daily News said. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,” the verse in question reads. Prison officials also noted that the troubled player’s Bible was lying near his body and opened to the same verse. Sources told the paper that an investigation had been launched to find out if Hernandez had somehow gotten hold of a synthetic marijuana called K2 on Tuesday night. Even as Hernandez’s death was labeled a suicide, some of the   player’s family and friends insisted that he would never have done such a thing to himself. On Wednesday, his former lawyer, a sports agent, at least one of his former teammates, and his family all expressed doubts over the claim that Hernandez committed suicide. Some even speculated that he may have been murdered. Despite being acquitted in his most recent murder case, Hernandez was serving a life sentence for the 2015 murder of Odin Lloyd.

24778,More Asylum Requests in Germany than Rest of EU Combined,"Germany received more asylum requests in 2016 than the rest of the European Union (EU) combined. In response to the report, the Bundestag   warned Germany’s migrant crisis was not over. [According to the European Commission’s statistical office Eurostat, of the 988, 000 applications for asylum made in the EU in the first nine months of 2016 approximately   were made in Germany, reports Deutsche Welle.  The exact figure, however, cannot be agreed upon by Commission and German agencies with Eurostat putting the number at 612, 000, while the Federal Interior Ministry puts it at 658, 000. Of the actual number of asylum requests processed,  756, 000 were processed in the EU between January and September 2016, 55 per cent of which were handled in Germany. Speaking to Die Welt, German Bundestag   Johannes Singhammer said the figures “[make] it clear that the refugee crisis in Germany has not been overcome. ” Die Welt said a number of those reported may already have been in the country prior to January 2016. Since Chancellor Angela Merkel’s invitation to over a million people to migrate en masse in September 2015, government systems were overwhelmed with many unable to make asylum applications for some months. The German newspaper reports in the first nine months of 2016, more than a quarter of a million, 272, 000, new migrants were registered on the nation’s systems. However, Denmark saw a sharp decrease in the number of asylum applications, falling from roughly 21, 000 in 2015 to 5, 300.  Denmark’s strict migrant legislation may account for this drop which includes shortening the duration of residence permits and limiting the number of family reunifications. The Danes have also enacted the ‘Jewellery Act’ whereby cash and valuables can be confiscated from migrants to offset the cost of their care in an effort to relieve the burden on Danish taxpayers. In December, Mr. Singhammer, member of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) the coalition partner of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) stated his fear that the number of Syrian migrants in Germany could double due to family reunification alone. He added, “The burden of family members’ immigration could be higher in the immediate future than the burden of newly arriving Syrian refugees. ”",0

Son Paul Hobbs said: “Come to think of it, dad has seemed a bit pissed off since a few years after I was born. “Maybe something happened near the start of the 20th century that annoyed him. “I suppose we could ask him but that might just make it worse.

Muallem went on to give the same account of the incident that Russia has insisted upon, claiming that Syrian warplanes “attacked an arms depot belonging to   Front,” which is  ’s affiliate in Syria. The Foreign Minister claimed the Nusra Front, ISIS, and other organizations “continue to store chemical weapons in urban and residential areas. ” He dismissed calls for an international investigation by saying Syria’s previous experience with “politicized” investigations was “not encouraging” because “they come out of Damascus with certain indications which then change at their headquarters. ” Walid also went out of his way to slam Turkey, evidently in response to Turkish denunciation of the attack in Idlib, and Turkey’s treatment of victims from the chemical weapons deployment.

It includes undeclared drone war begun post-9/11, Obama continuing what George Bush began, civilians harmed most of all. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia and other regional rogue states, backed by America and its NATO partners, began terror-bombing Houthi forces, falsely called terrorists. Casualties are multiples higher than officially reported, civilians ruthlessly slaughtered – war in Yemen another bonanza for US, UK, French and German weapons makers, along with war-profiteers from other countries. Earlier in October, Saudi warplanes terror-bombed a Sanaa Houthi funeral ceremony, killing and wounding hundreds of civilians – the single deadliest incident in over 18 months of fighting so far. Washington bears full responsibility. Riyadh shares it. Conflict continues raging, the Pentagon selecting targets for Saudi warplanes to terror-bomb. Over the weekend, a Saudi-led “coalition” airstrike targeted a prison and nearby administration buildings in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah, destroying facilities struck, massacring dozens, wounding many more victims, separately hitting Hodeidah’s port. Saudi military spokesman General Ahmed Asiri lied, claiming facilities struck were used as “a command and control center for (Houthi) operations.” Hours before the Hodeidah terror-bombing, Saudi warplanes massacred at least 18 civilians in Taiz, including 11 members of one family. Throughout months of fighting, Saudi warplanes terror-bombed schools, hospitals, residential areas, commercial marketplaces and other nonmilitary targets. Conflict resolution efforts failed because Washington, Riyadh and their rogue partners want war, not peace – holding an entire nation hostage to their viciousness, a severe humanitarian crisis taking unknown numbers of lives. Separately, on October 28, Saudi Arabia was overwhelmingly reelected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), a body infested with major human rights abusers. Heavy US pressure got General Assembly members to vote Russia off the HRC. Genocidal war on Yemen continues, the body failing to condemn the slaughter. It doesn’t promote human rights. It supports horrendous abuses committed by Washington and its imperial allies. Submit your review",0

By Fred Lucas 
Veterans must be given preference in securing federal jobs, according to long-standing laws, but hiring hasn’t always worked out in their favor. A federal audit found that on numerous occasions, agencies placed Obama administration political appointees into career government jobs with civil service protections—bypassing veterans. 
Much of the federal bureaucracy has turned against men and women who served the country in the military, said Darin Selnick, a retired Air Force captain and former official at the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
“There is a clear bias against veterans. They think veterans should start at the bottom like everyone else,” Selnick told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.

The state Duma will not pass a bill on fines for “superiority” machines — that is summer tires in the winter and Vice versa: according to our information, on 1 November, the Duma Council decided to establish an ad hoc working group on the revision of the initiative.

Originally planned to be introduced in 2014 by a group of senators and MPs at the meeting of 21 October, but the agenda was very intense, and until this subject is not reached. 
Then attracted great attention of the public document it was proposed to include in the agenda of the meeting on 2 November. But now his fate will be decided by the ad hoc working group. 
As reported by “MK” sources familiar with the situation, even at the last Duma Council the question arose about why the bill on amendments to the Code of administrative offences went through the Committee on transportation and construction and not through the profile for all of the bills offering to rule of the administrative code, the Committee on state construction and legislation. 
And here, according to another source, “MK”, November 1, the Council of the Duma the head of the Committee on transport and construction Yevgeny moskvichyov ( United Russia ) has proposed to establish a joint working group of representatives of the two committees, and to discuss again all disputed issues. 
We recall that the bill was discussed on amendment of the administrative code, which promised to be fine in 2 thousand rubles for violation of requirements of operation of tires and wheels. 
The Committee on transport and construction, proposing to support the project in the first reading, said that from 1 January 2015 entered into force the technical regulations of the Customs Union “On safety of wheeled vehicles”, one of which forbids to operate vehicles without winter tires in winter. But the timing of the entry into force of this regulation “was determined based on the training of owners of vehicles (especially large trucking companies) to the introduction of these rules, and also taking into account the possibility of domestic industrial enterprises to ensure that all vehicles operated on the roads of our country, winter tires”. 
The disadvantage of the bill, noted in the Committee ’s opinion, is the absence in it of provisions concerning the right of subjects of Federation to change the terms of the prohibition of winter tyres and tyres with spikes of snow. ",0

Why don’t we see if every night  —   and twice in the afternoon for 12 weeks  —   if a piece of theater could raise enough of a ruckus to discombobulate a man sitting in the Oval Office?”  “I don’t know, but I’d like to find out.

The      also assured that his show will include a message that will appeal to Republicans and middle America. “I have found that Republicans or conservatives often will come to my films in part because I speak the language of the Midwest the people who voted for Trump are my neighbors,” Moore said. “I’m always excited to talk to them. I’ve noticed since the election that people who voted for Trump will stop and talk to me on the street because before the election, I was the only liberal who said he was gonna win.

24798,Silicon Valley Techies Complain About ’Scraping By’ on Six-Figure Salaries - Breitbart,"Several Silicon Valley employees, including a software engineer for Twitter who made a $160, 000 salary, were mocked online after complaining about their living standards in an article for The Guardian. [In the article, entitled “Scraping by on six figures? Tech workers feel poor in Silicon Valley’s wealth bubble,” the employee complained that his   salary was “pretty bad” for the area.  “I didn’t become a software engineer to be trying to make ends meet,” proclaimed the employee. “Families are priced out of the market. ” “The biggest cost is his $3, 000 rent  —   which he said was ‘ultra cheap’ for the area  —   for a   house in San Francisco, where he lives with his wife and two kids,” reported The Guardian sympathetically. “He’d like a slightly bigger property, but finds himself competing with groups of twentysomethings happy to share accommodation while paying up to $2, 000 for a single room. ” “The prohibitive costs have displaced teachers, city workers, firefighters and other members of the middle class, not to mention   residents,” they continued. “Now techies, many of whom are among the highest 1% of earners, are complaining that they, too, are being priced out. ” The Guardian also covered other Silicon Valley employees in the piece who were earning “between $100, 000 and $700, 000 a year” but still allegedly had trouble “making ends meet. ” “One Apple employee was recently living in a Santa Cruz garage, using a compost bucket as a toilet. Another tech worker, enrolled in a coding bootcamp, described how he lived with 12 other engineers in a   apartment rented via Airbnb,” The Guardian reported. “It was $1, 100 for a fucking bunk bed and five people in the same room. One guy was living in a closet, paying $1, 400 for a ‘private room,’” one man complained, while a female employee added, “We make over $1m between us, but we can’t afford a house  …     This is part of where the American dream is not working out here. ” Several San Francisco residents mocked the employees for their complaints. “Scraping by in the Bay Area on a   salary sure must be difficult!” joked San Francisco Chronicle reporter Lizzie Johnson.

24799,Theresa May refuses to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia,"Foreign Policy During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia’s place at the UN Human Rights Council despite the regime’s atrocities in Yemen. 
During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
""The issues are being investigated… We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen,"" May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. 
Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK government’s contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. 
Corbyn also questioned May’s support for Saudi Arabia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will take place later this month. A Yemeni man stands on October 24, 2016 at the site of an air raid on a funeral ceremony that killed 140 people and wounded 525 on October 5. (Photo by AFP) 
London has repeatedly been blamed by human rights groups, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, for fueling the Yemeni war by supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons. 
Since the conflict began last year, the British government has approved more than £3 billion ($3.7 billion) in arms sales to the Saudis and military contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline. 
Yemen has been under almost daily airstrikes by Saudi Arabia since March 2015. International sources put the death toll from the aggression at almost 10,000. 
Rights groups have also condemned the Kingdom’s crackdown on dissent and prosecution of pro-reform activists. Loading ...",0

BRIDGEPORT, CT—Thinking back on how happy and untroubled he had been during that time and how different he feels in the present day, local man Jason Moulton, 52, reportedly paused Wednesday and nostalgically recalled the simpler era of 20 hours ago. “Everything seemed so much brighter back then before 9 p.m. last night—nothing like the way things are now,” said Moulton, wistfully reflecting on how, back before yesterday evening, things had seemed to make sense and the future appeared to hold endless promise. “America was a different place all those hours ago. Things were safer then, and the economy was strong—it was just a better time. But it’s all gone downhill ever since. We just don’t have the same values anymore.” Moulton then reportedly shook his head and said that while he would love for the country to get back to the good old days of November 8 and earlier, realistically he knew that would never happen.

24808,Reductress » This Little Girl’s Mind-Blowing Protest Speech Is Everything Her Mother Told Her to Say,"This Little Girl’s Mind-Blowing Protest Speech Is Everything Her Mother Told Her to Say Womanspiration - Nov 3, 2016 By: Editor SHARE: 
Seven-year-old Candace Bailey wowed everyone in the room when she gave a mind-blowing protest speech about climate change, just like her mother coached her to do. 

Little Candace addressed the New Mexico state legislature with an impassioned speech about the need for clean energy and a collective effort to reduce the effects of human consumption on the planet. Good job Candace—and good job, Candace’s mom, for telling her exactly what to say! 

Witnesses were impressed by the maturity of the local second grader and her ability to sound out big words. 


“I couldn’t believe she was able to memorize all that,” witness Anna Hines says. “It didn’t really change my mind, but she was so adorable up there on that podium!” 

Candace reportedly spoke about her own challenges, like turning the water off while she’s brushing her teeth, as well as the future world she hopes to live in. 

“When I grow up, I hope to live in a world where we can reduce carbon emissions and be a model for the rest of the world,” the seven-year-old said, inspiring the room with the beautiful words her mother wrote for her. 

“Her speech gave us all a lot to think about,” one state representative says. “Namely, how hard the mother must have worked to make this all happen.” 

“Does this kid even understand what a carbon emission is?” she added. Probably not! 

“I could see her mother sort of mouthing along the words as Candace was speaking,” friend of the family June Gordon says. “I don’t know why Breanne didn’t just speak herself. It would have been less jarring, that’s for sure.” 

Though Candace’s mother’s involvement is clear, the young girl is proud about standing up in public about climate change. 

“I hope the state legislature will listen to me, since I am the future,” Candace says. “Mom, did I say that right?” SHARE: ",0

24812,Here’s Proof That The Iowa Cop Killer Is A Trump Supporter,"Comments 
Many people have been wondering whether or not a white man known for waving Confederate flags at black teenagers and just murdered two cops is a Trump supporter. 
Grant Rodgers, a journalist for the Des Moines Register , did some investigating and found some pretty undeniable evidence that yes, Michael Greene Scott supported the Republican nominee for President. 
The house is Greene’s last listed address, which he shares with his mother. 
Greene turned himself into earlier today and is in custody after allegedly firing thirty or more shots into a parked patrol car, killing two police officers in Des Moines, Iowa. It is the second act of domestic terrorism to take place in the United States in the past day, coming just two hours after Trump supporters in Mississippi set a historically African-American church on fire and spray-painted “VOTE TRUMP” on it. 
Donald Trump has begun a movement, indeed – a movement of hatred and violence that has now lead to multiple deaths, thousands of dollars in property damage, and unquantifiable emotional trauma across the nation as Latinos, blacks, Muslims, and sexual assault survivors are forced to bear the brunt of the gaslit firestorm that Trump ignites with his bullying and his dog-whistles.

24820,BOOM: The “Clinton Double Standard” Brutally Exposed,"Pinterest 
From Sierra Marlee : Laws for thee, but not for me. 
The FBI’s Hillary Clinton decision may just make it impossible to prosecute anyone caught in wrongful possession of classified information. 
For instance, let us look at the case of Petty Officer First Class Kristian Saucier, who was discovered to have taken pictures of the inside of a classified U.S. nuclear submarine. He is making a plea for leniency based on the fact that former-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn’t see any jail time for getting caught in a similar situation. 
The 29-year-old man is to be sentenced Friday on the felony charge of “retaining national defense information without permission,” according to Politico . 
While it is clear that being in violation of this law calls for a sentence of 63-78 months, Saucier’s defense attorney claims that his client should only receive probation, based on precedent created by the FBI’s decision to not indict Hillary Clinton, despite acknowledging that she was in possession of classified emails on her home server. 
“In our case, Mr. Saucier possessed six (6) photographs classified as ‘confidential/restricted,’ far less than Clinton’s 110 emails,” Hogan wrote. “It will be unjust and unfair for Mr. Saucier to receive any sentence other than probation for a crime those more powerful than him will likely avoid.” 
There are distinctions in the two cases – for instance, Saucier plead guilty to the charge, admitting that he knew his actions were illegal, and destroying evidence after being confronted about his possession of the classified photos. However, it is clear that his will not be the last case to cite Hillary Clinton’s lack of jail-time as a reason for a criminal to go free. The FBI and federal government as a whole have opened up a can of worms that will potentially put all of America at risk. 
Will America be able to punish any federal employee or member of the military for gathering classified information, or with the FBI be forced to re-open the investigation into the Clinton server and recommend indictment of Hillary? 
This young man should absolutely go to jail for what he did, because he knew it was against the law, and I’m holding all federal employees to the same standard. There is no way one can become Secretary of State and not be told what the parameters and limitations are when exchanging classified information. 
If they choose to jail this man, but excuse the actions of the Clintons, there are going to be a lot of angry Americans come November, and it could potentially lead to a Trump presidency.

24821,Congressman Backs Libertarian Presidential Candidate in Campaign First - The New York Times,"Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia says he plans to vote for the Libertarian Party’s presidential ticket, becoming the first member of Congress to express support for Gary Johnson’s   campaign. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Rigell, a Republican, said he had settled on Mr. Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, as the best option available. “I’ve always said I will not vote for Donald Trump and I will not vote for Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Rigell said. “I’m going to vote for the Libertarian candidate. ” Mr. Rigell is the second Republican member of Congress this week to back a candidate other than Mr. Trump in the presidential race the other, Representative Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Both Mr. Rigell and Mr. Hanna are retiring from Congress at the end of their current terms. But Mr. Rigell’s support for the Libertarian ticket may be more portentous: Mr. Johnson and his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, have been seeking to woo disaffected Republicans who view Mr. Trump as unacceptable. Should additional Republican officeholders follow Mr. Rigell in backing the   ticket, it could help Mr. Johnson gain credibility as an alternative choice. A former car dealer who represents a moderate district on the Virginia coast, Mr. Rigell said he expected more congressional Republicans and local Republican officials to break openly with the party’s presidential candidate as the election draws nearer. Many Republican candidates have asked him for advice, Mr. Rigell said, about separating themselves from Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Rigell has been saying since the winter that he could not support Mr. Trump. “When their own conscience is seared by some statement that Trump has made, I have encouraged them to be direct and also, in a timely manner, repudiate what he said,” Mr. Rigell said. “People will respect it if you have a reason and you put it out there. ” Mr. Rigell said he still considered himself a Republican. But that would change, he said, if the Republican Party were to become synonymous with Mr. Trump and his ideas in a lasting way. “Then I’m done,” Mr. Rigell said, “and I’ll be an independent. ”",0
24822,BREAKING: Trump Was RIGHT,"Pinterest 
GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been proven right once again. This time it has to do with a prediction he made about Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. 
On Friday, the FBI announced in a letter to Congress that they were reopening the Clinton email investigation in light of emails unearthed in their investigation of disgraced former New York Democrat Congressman Anthony Weiner’s sexting an underage girl. 
On Aug. 29, not long after top Clinton aide Huma Abedin announced that she and Weiner were separating, Trump released a statement. “Huma is making a very wise decision,” Trump said. 
“I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” he added. “Who knows what he learned and who he told?” Trump, in July: ""I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.” https://t.co/qICt22PfzM

— Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) October 28, 2016 
The Washington Examiner reported : 
After the bombshell report about the FBI’s reopened investigation first emerged Friday afternoon, the New York Times reported that the “new emails” that have led investigators to take a second look at the case were discovered on devices seized from Abedin and Weiner’s home during a separate investigation into Weiner’s alleged sexting with a minor. 
Comey, in a letter to eight Republican congressional committee chairs, did not clarify what emails led him to revisit the Clinton case. He said only that investigators had recently briefed him on “the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” 
“And I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information,” Comey wrote. 
Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire on Friday he hopes the FBI will “right the ship” after the agency declined to indict Clinton in July, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent. 
Trump has been proven right to the point that the mainstream media even had to admit how right he was. That’s saying something. 
It will be very interesting to see what the FBI has found/will find in their investigation. The FBI certainly could be reopening the investigation to somehow help Clinton — perhaps there’s an angle that makes this the better option — or maybe there is something so potentially damning that even they couldn’t figure out a good way to bury it. That seems fairly unlikely, but it’s hard to say. 
Once again, Trump has been proven right and that’s largely because he gets it. Trump has called himself a “common sense conservative” and the many times he’s been proven right on the campaign trail, along with the many policy positions he’s taken that show that he is in touch with Americans and has common sense, prove this label correct.",0

MUNICH — World War II marked a crucial turning point for U.S. empire building and the growth of global capitalism, according to the historical analysis of noted political philosopher and scholar Noam Chomsky.
Chomsky examined U.S. domination of world affairs in “ Who Owns The World? ,” a speech he delivered at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2012. In May, he published a book, “Who Rules The World?,” which examines similar themes.
Watch ‘ Noam Chomsky: Who Owns the World? Resistance and Ways Forward ‘ :
He revisited the topic in a recent conversation with Zain Raza, a senior editor at the independent media outlet acTVism Munich. An excerpt from that conversation was published on Tuesday as part of acTVism Munich’s “Reexamining History” series .
Much of the U.S. government’s global strategy both during and after World War II was based on a plan proposed by the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations , which Chomsky describes as the “major, non-governmental institution concerned with foreign affairs” whose membership “draws from a wide range of elite elements, business, politics, academics, and so on.”
Between 1939 and 1945, the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations held regular strategy meetings to develop a post-war economic plan. These meetings led to proposal under which the United States would dominate a vast swath of the globe that came to be known as the “Grand Area,” Chomsky said. Explaining that the “Grand Area” would include “the Western Hemisphere,” Chomsky said:
“It included the former British Empire, which the U.S. was intending to largely take over, maybe Britain would be a junior partner. And as much of Europe, the commercial and industrial center of Europe, as much of that as possible. Certainly Western Europe, its industrial, technological, commercial center.”
Within the “Grand Area,” Chomsky continued, “the United States would have pretty much complete economic and political control.”
With the collapse of the German economy after the war, and amid the beginnings of the Cold War with Russia and China, the United States was in a unique position to implement this plan. Chomsky said:
“The war was very beneficial to the U.S. economy. Its industrial production virtually quadrupled, wartime spending ended the Depression, which had not been ended before — enormous stimulus to the economy. The technology that was developed just laid the basis for post-war growth. In that context ‘Grand Area’ planning of the kind I described was by no means unrealistic.”
Far from a Pentagon pipedream, the “Grand Area” became concrete U.S. foreign policy, and its effects linger to this day.
“If you look at the policies implemented and developed in the early post-war period, they follow these prescriptions pretty closely,” Chomsky said.
As Chomsky and other historians have observed, Washington’s plans to dominate the “Grand Area” led directly to the Vietnam War. They were also crucial in the development of the International Monetary Fund , which continues to disrupt global economies for the benefit of multinational corporations and the military-industrial complex.

24829,Bronx Assemblyman Files Complaint Against the Police - The New York Times,"A New York State assemblyman from the Bronx has filed a formal complaint against the police, claiming he was roughly handled by an officer after asking about police activity in his district. The assemblyman, Michael Blake, said that while he was attending a family event at the Gouverneur Morris Houses at East 169th Street and Washington Avenue, he saw a woman in handcuffs and approached the officers involved to discuss the situation. Moments later, Mr. Blake said, an argument broke out behind him. In a phone interview on Sunday, Mr. Blake said that as he rushed toward the confrontation a uniformed officer   him, lifted him off the ground and “slammed” him against a gate outside the housing complex. “It was not a pleasant interaction,” said Mr. Blake, 33, a freshman Democrat who represents part of the South Bronx. The Police Department confirmed that a sergeant and an officer were responding to an argument between neighbors shortly after 3:30 p. m. on Saturday. The police said that the assemblyman approached the sergeant from behind, without identifying himself, and “grabbed” his shoulder. A police spokeswoman said the officer, perceiving “a possible threat to the sergeant,” moved Mr. Blake about five feet and put him against a fence. Then, a captain from the Police Service Area patrolling the complex intervened after recognizing Mr. Blake as an elected official, the police said. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Police Department said that it “has been made aware of Mr. Blake’s allegations and will be conducting a review of the incident. ” Mr. Blake said he did not have time to identify himself as an elected official before he was grabbed, but confirmed that more senior officers intervened immediately and told the officer to let him go. The officer released him and was urged to apologize by superiors, the assemblyman said. And while the officer did offer an apology, Mr. Blake said, it fell short of an acknowledgment of fault. Mr. Blake said the officer claimed to be in “a protective mode” over his partner and added that “if the situation presented itself, he would do the same thing again. ” The assemblyman said that he did not recall touching the sergeant but that even if he had done so, “in the heat of the second, that didn’t justify what happened. ” Mr. Blake filed a formal notice Saturday night with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, claiming excessive force, something he thought may have been related to his race. “I can appreciate from the officer’s perspective that if they perceive someone is a threat to their fellow officer, regardless of race, they would act out in some way,” Mr. Blake said. “But I do believe that the level of response was far heightened because I’m a black man  —   no question. ” The use of excessive force by the police, particularly in relation to   has been a pressing local and national issue, highlighted by a series of   episodes across the country. Mr. Blake, said that he chose to make the complaint public because, “too often, people are quiet when these things happen” and “leaders have a responsibility to communicate to the community about how to take positive action. ” “I know that the only way that this is going to get better is if we are transparent and we talk about what we experience and what we learn, and how changes need to occur on all sides,” Mr. Blake said.",0

24834,"Former Cowboy Tony Romo: Now Lining Up Behind the Golf Ball, Fails in US Open Bid - Breitbart","Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo will be on his couch watching the U. S. Open next month along with millions of other golf fans, after failing to qualify for America’s most prestigious golf championship by shooting a   par 75, six strokes above the cut line. [The pride of the Dallas Cowboys didn’t even come close. Romo tied for 40th place out of 107 entrants in a regional qualifier at Split Rail Links and Golf Club in Aledo, Texas.   The        passer, joined about 9500 other golfers in their bid to    at Erin Hills, the site of the 2017 U. S. Open to be played June   in Wisconsin. It is the first time the tournament will be played at the gorgeous and demanding venue, and a first time for the state of Wisconsin to hold the Open. The golfers will be weaned down to about 70 players when the tournament commences. Romo has long prided himself on his golf, and plays to about a plus 3. 3 handicap, which is competitive with the majority of professional golfers. In 2009, Golf Digest ranked Romo as the number one golfer of professional athletes who doesn’t make their living playing golf. Nevertheless, it appears his game needs a bit of work if he plans on going pro. Jordan Spieth, a good friend of Romo’s, in 2015 claimed he was spotting the     a side and stuffing his wallet with Romo’s cash. In 2015 when sports commentator Jim Rome asked the 2015 U. S. Open winner how much he’s won from Romo, Spieth remarked: “I don’t know. I can’t even count that high. He’s a good friend and a great competitor so we have fun out there. ” Romo wouldn’t be the first NFL quarterback to join the ranks of professional golfers if he were to sharpen his skills enough to qualify as a professional tour player. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and 1970 NFL MVP, John Brodie, played on the Champions Tour from  . Brodie, who once threw for 30 touchdowns in one season, won the 1991 Security Pacific Senior Classic and captured 12   finishes during his golfing campaign. Brodie once said about the sport that many ridicule as not really being a sport, but a game:  Some critics claim golf is only a walk in the park and cannot be called an athletic event  …    . I think golf is the most demanding sport of them all in asking coordination from mind and body. It involves more qualities than any other game. Football is repetition. After many hours of work with teammates, you react by reflex and instinct. There are so many factors depending on more than one person.   …     I learned a lot on the tour. Possibly most important, I learned a lot about myself. NBC Sports reported that in 2010 Romo made it to the sectional qualifying, but had to pull out due to his obligations with the Cowboys. Also, in 2005 he qualified as an alternate for sectional qualifying. ",0

In response to concerns over the US sending 300+ Marines to the Russian border, in response to the UK sending 800 troops to the Russian border, in response to all the NATO countries sending small contingents of troops and equipment to the Russian borders we've heard one narrative consistently: ""Oh, that's not enough troops to indicate there's anything serious happening."" My how 2 year's passage of time has changed the narrative. A top Ukrainian army officer said a ""full-scale invasion"" of his country was under way Thursday, as a U.S. official said up to 1,000 Russian troops had crossed Ukraine's southern border to fight alongside pro-Russian rebels. Russia's military actions in eastern Ukraine ""must cease immediately,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday. ""I'm extremely concerned by mounting evidence that Russian troops have made large-scale incursions into South Eastern Ukraine, completely disregarding the sovereignty of a neighbor,"" Cameron said. ""The international community has already warned Russia that such provocative actions would be completely unacceptable and illegal."" Yet another example of the west's never ending ""NATO good, Russia evil"" narrative. When Russia involves 1,000 troops in assisting a region which requested their help (Crimea, or more recently Syria) the western leaders come unglued... but when the west does the same, it's ""exercises"" and ""no cause for any concern.""

24836,Marrying couple installs Gift Envelope Scanner at wedding hall door to check for ₹500 & ₹1000 notes,"Marrying couple installs Gift Envelope Scanner at wedding hall door to check for ₹500 & ₹1000 notes Posted on Tweet 
Chiranjeevi and Soubhagyavati, a couple who will be entering wedlock tomorrow, have undertaken a first-of-its-kind, unique feat – the bride and groom have installed an X-ray scanning device at the entrance of their wedding hall, to scan guests’ gift envelopes for the recently discontinued ₹500 & ₹1000 notes. (Image via Ephemera Studio) 
“With great difficulty, we’ve had to put all the wedding preparations on hold, stand in queues to deposit old currency for new legal tender and without even a day’s break, resume the preparations and planning. All thanks to demonetization. At the end of it all, the last thing we want is another set of old currency notes which we’ve to take to the banks for another exchange stint. We don’t want to be loitering around banks when should be honeymooning in exotic locations. In order to prevent this, we wish to inform all our guests that we have installed an envelope scanning device right at the entrance. You will be asked to pass your envelope through the scanner. If your envelopes are found to contain old currency, they will be handed right back to you. We’d rather you congratulate us without any gifts, than give us invalid currency,” Soubhagyavati, the bride-to-be told The UnReal Times . 
While the move has already reduced the anticipated guest number by the hundreds, the couple is determined to stand by their idea. “A lot of people have already informed us about ‘urgent meetings,’‘spouses unwell,’ and other things right after we announced this development. That’s still okay. We’re not yet done though. We’re also thinking of setting up an online transfer kiosk – so that people can swipe their credit cards and transfer money to us electronically, on the spot, if they really wish to gift us money,” an animated groom-to-be, Chiranjeevi added. 
The couple’s move won praise from across the border. “What a great idea! Pity I didn’t do this even in one of my weddings. The next time I marry, I surely should emulate this,” an amazed PTI chief and former world-cup winning Pakistani cricket captain Imran Khan exclaimed. Bollywood actor Kamaal R Khan, however, was indifferent. “Makes no difference to me, I anyway put only ₹2 coins in all envelopes whenever I attend weddings,” the Deshdrohi actor chuckled. MNS Chief Raj Thackeray lauded the move, while also suggesting that those caught gifting such notes be made to gift an equal amount to the Indian army, by cheque. 
While many other wedding couples have been scampering all over the country in search of scanners, some have urged banks to grant them permission to conduct the weddings in their own offices. “It’s extremely efficient this way – the moment we get old currency, we exchange it then and there. No loss of time. Plus it’s booming business for the banks too,” one such groom said. Tweet About Ashwin Kumar

Be sure to vote today if you haven’t already! Even if you dislike the Presidential choices, downticket races are important. 
And an overdue note: Thanks SO much to those of you who came out to meet me in Dallas last week. We had a group of 30-35 attend, including someone from Iowa and a libertarian who declared that NC was one of only three non-libertarian sites that he reads. We have a lively discussion and I think everyone had a good time. 
The organizer of the evening, Steve in Dallas, circulated a list for people who wanted to be on a Dallas Meetup listserv. Some participants had already left by then, so if you missed the opportunity to sign up and would like to be included or missed this meetup but want to be kept in the loop, please ping me at yves_at_nakedcapitalism.com and I’ll send your coordinates to Steve. Please put “Dallas Meetup” in the subject line. 
At the end of the evening, Steve raised an important issue: he’s tried getting friends and family members to read NC and other independent media, with much less success than he’d like. I volunteered that most people don’t want to question authority, and that going outside the mainstream media was tantamount to admitting that the traditional press was wrong, or doing a superficial job. 
This chart might help get traditional media loyalists to consider that reporting isn’t what it used to be

24839,Should The Royal Monarchy Be Abolished? UK Taxpayers Think So,"Should The Royal Monarchy Be Abolished? UK Taxpayers Think So Nov 20, 2016 1 0 
The first few questions we should ask ourselves is “what point is there to even having a monarchy?” Additionally, “what good do they provide for the people of the UK and world? What is their purpose?” 
United Kingdom taxpayers are asking themselves these questions and more amid fresh calls for the monarchy to be dissolved. Personal wealth estimated at over £300m, yet they want taxpayers to pay for the building? 
The Independent reports that Buckingham Palace is in need of repair, which is projected to be a 10 year project and will cost around £400 million-all from taxpayer money. The British government agreed to the increase in taxpayer funding, which is set to increase by 66%. 
Those fighting for the abolishment of the monarchy are upset that the Royal Crown wants the public to pay for the renovation, all the while the Crown has an estimated worth of over £300 million, and owning land around the world estimated at a worth of over £7 billion. 
Graham Smith, who is the chief executive of the Anti-Monarch Group Republic said: 
This is an absolute disgrace. An indictment of the Queen’s scandalous mismanagement of royal finances over six decades. MPs have repeatedly called on the Palace to fund repairs by opening up to tourists all year round and they’ve refused. If the royals can’t look after the buildings and raise their own revenue to fund maintenance, it’s time to give them up. 
The royals cost the taxpayer over £334 million per year and that keeps going up. We need independent inquiry and full disclosure of their spending. The monarchy’s costs need to be stripped right back, put the institution on a proper budgetary footing and allow parliament to approve the budget each year.” 
Smith is right. Why is the cost to fund the royal family going up each year when they are worth over billions of pounds already? Additionally, we must ask why the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Keeper of the Privy Purse continue to agree to this increase in funding. 
Again, this is yet another example of how governments and the people who really run them, do not have any interest in bettering the world for all, but only for themselves. 
Furthermore, it is well known throughout the world how the Crown still owns the United States and that the IRS is nothing but a royal corporation, where U.S. taxpayer money conveniently works it way back to the top. 
The world also knows about the massive, pedophilia ring that the elites in London have been and continue to be involved in, thanks to 60 Minutes Australia (a mainstream source that did an incredible job investigating the still unsolved story). 
Lastly, we must all continue to declare our sovereignty from such oppressive, cunning and secretive cults. We are living human beings and no longer need rulers, especially those who continue to rule with such a dark agenda. 
While this story is still developing and the Crown will likely not go quietly into the night, humanity is waking up quickly and we can expect more people throughout the UK, as well as the world, to reclaim financial and social freedom. Perhaps Brexit was just the beginning.",0
24840,Uncollected Pallet Wondering What It Did Wrong,"0 Add Comment 
A NEGLECTED wooden pallet is said to be suffering from severe self esteem issues after it failed to be selected for a nearby bonfire by local youths, WWN understands. 
The pallet, left unattended for weeks behind a Lidl was not one of 70 pallets chosen to form part of a structurally suspect bonfire pile on a field in the Waterford area of Europe, prompting the pallet to spiral into an existential spiral which saw it question its own self worth. 
“I don’t know what I did wrong, but… I’m obviously hideous,” the pallet shared, which until last month had a family of 400 cans of Polish beer living on top of it. 
“You see the lads coming, pulling shapes and you think finally, I’ll feel special, feel wanted, but they never chose me. I just wanted to be doused in petrol and consumed by a raging hot fire, like any other of my kind,” added the pallet, who admitted at least a third of him was moderately soggy after being discarded in a puddle. 
“Ugh, what’s the point anymore, it’s going to rain so much between now and next Halloween, I’ll be rotten and unlovable by then,” the pallet concluded, full of anguish. 
There is some hope for the pallet, however, as a local hipster restaurant which has just opened in the city needs something to serve its food on that isn’t a plate.",0

24842,Thousands Of Buffalo Appear At Site Of Standing Rock Protest [Watch],"By Amanda Froelich at trueactivist.com
During a standoff between riot police and peaceful protesters, a herd of buffalo appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp.
Yesterday, tensions between law enforcement workers and peaceful protestors with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe escalated. A series of standoffs resulted in “protectors” being maced, shot with rubber bullets, tasered, and even attacked with sound and concussion cannons. Ultimately, 117 people were arrested in the plight to stop the four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from being constructed.
After months of similar struggle to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri river, opposers of the DAPL were blessed today when a herd of buffalo appeared from nowhere. While mass arrests, macing, and beatings from batons took place, a stampede of bison appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. Reportedly, a cry of joy erupted from the crowd, as protectors have been praying for help from the American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate) during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen.
As UsUncut relays , the Native American culture honors the Tatanka Oyate as a symbol of sacrifice. Its appearance is reportedly being hailed as a gift from the Great Spirit.
Despite impressive attention being given to the protesting of the Dakota Access Pipeline by alternative media sites , activists on the frontlines, and even celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Shailene Woodley , little is being done in Washington D.C. The tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and to stop the mistreatment of the indigenous who assert their ownership of the land due to a 1881 treaty.",0

24849,Washington Recruit Al Qaeda To Help Oust Assad From Syria,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in Middle East , News // 0 Comments 
Washington has authorised a CIA program of training and arming Al Qaeda in order to help them oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
According to various reports, a huge new effort to supply weapons to so-called ‘moderate opposition’ groups in Syria is underway, as the U.S. finds themselves unable to defend themselves against Russian and Syrian air power and artillery. Recommended 
The US have announced a strategic partnership with al-Qaeda in order to overthrow the Syrian government and oust President Assad. (2 hours ago) 
Southfront.org reports: 
The secret CIA program of training and arming ‘moderate terrorists’ has been the core of American strategy, aiming to overthrow Assad and set a puppet government in Syria, since the start of the war. Nonetheless, the Obama administration is likely set to postponed the resumption and expansion of this program and to pass the need to make a decision to next president. T 
he US leadership is not ready to make the decision now because the recent military developments have shown that despite all money spending, supplies and CIA efforts, Washington still cannot rely on the moderate terrorists as a clearly pro-US force on the ground. Every US attempt to separate secular militant groups from jihadi factions, at least for PR needs, have failed. 
And the recently created New Syrian Army (NSyA) has shown an impotence in clashes with ISIS. The US propaganda campaign to discredit Russian-Syrian-Iranian operations to liberate Aleppo faced a significant problem – massive civilian casualties during the Mosul offensive, supported by the US-led coalition. 
In this case, open and massive supplies of arms and munitions to the terrorist groups in Syria could lead to significant loses for Washington in political and PR terms and will hardly lead to strengthening of the US influence on the Syrian conflict. Recommended Pentagon Announce They Are Arming Al Qaeda To Oust Assad 
The Pentagon has announced that it is protecting and arming Al Qaeda/Al Nusra jihadists in Syria, in a last gasp effort to overthrow Assad. You read that correctly - the U.S. is now in coalition with Al Qaeda in a foreign war. (2 hours ago) 
If the US administration avoids to do this, Moscow, Damascus and Tehran will fully take the initiative in the war that would also lead to negative effects to the US influence in the Middle East. 
So, most likely, Washington will make a compromise decision to allow its regional allies – Saudi Arabia or Qatar – to supply limited numbers of man-portable air-defense systems to the so-called ‘opposition’, even if this opposition is al-Nusra Front. 
At the same time, the US-controlled media and diplomats will continue to put pressure on Syria, Russia and Iran over alleged civilian casualties in Aleppo city and ignore the humanitarian situation in Iraq. 
It will not allow the terrorists to re-take the initiative in the war but will buy time until the new US president comes into the office and start to impellent own strategy in the region.",0

24859,"Aleksei Navalny, Putin Critic, Says He’ll Run for President of Russia - The New York Times","MOSCOW  —   Aleksei A. Navalny, the most vocal critic of the Kremlin, announced on Tuesday his intention to run for president of Russia, though he is facing a court trial that could make him ineligible to participate in the campaign. “There have been no true elections in Russia since 1996, and this is one of the reasons of our plight,” Mr. Navalny said in a video statement, posted on his new campaign website. “I will participate in the election, and I will fight for victory. ” Apart from Mr. Navalny, only Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal party Yabloko, has declared his intention to run for the post. President Vladimir V. Putin has deflected questions about his own candidacy, saying it is too early to talk about it. But he is widely expected to run and, in light of his soaring approval ratings and control over the news media, is expected to win. The vote is scheduled to take place in March 2018. A lawyer by training, Mr. Navalny, 40, emerged as Russia’s most prominent opposition politician on the wave of public protests that followed parliamentary elections in 2011, seen by many as flawed. But as Mr. Navalny’s popularity was surging, Russian investigators got busy, filing a number of criminal cases that rights advocates have dismissed as politically motivated. In 2013, a court in the provincial Russian town of Kirov convicted Mr. Navalny on charges of embezzling timber worth $500, 000 from a   company and sentenced him to five years in prison. A few months later, the sentence was suspended but the criminal conviction barred Mr. Navalny from running for office  —   the outcome that Mr. Navalny and others say was the government’s goal from the beginning. In the meantime, Mr. Navalny garnered more than 27 percent of the vote in a race for mayor of Moscow, a better result than any other open critic of the Kremlin in a major election since Mr. Putin assumed office in 1999. That Mr. Navalny was even allowed to run was seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to make the election look more legitimate. In November, Russia’s Supreme Court overturned Mr. Navalny’s criminal conviction after the European Court of Human Rights ruled in February that Russian courts had violated his right to a fair trial. While Mr. Navalny is free for the moment to campaign, the criminal case will be retried by a court in Kirov, which could reinstate the conviction and again bar him from office. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told RBC, a Russian news website, that the Kremlin had no comment on Mr. Navalny’s announcement. Over the years, Mr. Navalny has repeatedly accused Mr. Putin and members of his inner circle of rampant corruption, and has been tolerated as long as he does not seem to pose a serious threat. In his statement, Mr. Navalny promised to raise the issue of official corruption during the campaign. “The Kremlin and the government are only worried about solving their own financial issues,” Mr. Navalny said in the video. “I will discuss what everybody is silent about, but what has to be said for a long time. ”",0

26 Oct, 2016 26  
During a radio interview, comic legend and political pundit Jackie Mason joked that the only time Hillary Clinton is not lying “is when her mouth is not moving.” “And even then, she is probably lying because she’s probably sitting there thinking of the next lie she is going to tell,” he added.
 
Mason claimed that Clinton is so untrustworthy that she likely couldn’t land a job as an “attendant in the ladies’ room because they would be afraid that she would steal the towels or the napkins. Even the toilet paper wouldn’t be safe from her.”
Mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.
Listen to the interview here: 

He continued:
Do you think that if she went for any other job besides the presidency that anyone would hire her anywhere? If you saw her resume which is a resume of accomplishing nothing and running from the police three-quarters of her life. She is always either indicted or almost indicted or about to be indicted. Her whole life spent fleeing from the Justice Departments of different countries. Now, this yenta, do you think she would be able to get any other job? …
Would you think they would hire her as a chambermaid? Do you know what all those sheets and pillowcases are worth? Do you think they would trust her with it? After they found out the history of her life. Let’s be honest about it, if you went on a vacation would you let her watch your house while you went on vacation? Would you expect to come back and find anything still there?

24867,"500,000 People Sign Petition Asking Electoral College to Pick Clinton as President Instead of Trump","  500,000 People Sign Petition Asking Electoral College to Pick Clinton as President Instead of Trump The petition, launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to “ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.” Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation’s popular vote.   11, 2016 A petition on Change.org calling for the Electoral College to elect Hillary Clinton as President has earned over half of the signatures needed for it to be sent to the governing body. EDITOR’S NOTE: As stupid as this seems on the surface, at this point, I am not taking anything for granted. Donald Trump voters across America need to be made aware of this, and even now be working against it. Remember that with the Clintons, it’s never over. Ever. And as Christopher Stevens and Vince Foster will tell you, these people will stop at nothing. And please be forewarned, while this petition strategy is far-fetched, it is not impossible. The petition , launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to “ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.” Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation’s popular vote . The Electoral College – which was first introduced in 1804 – is comprised of 538 electors. Each state’s number of electors is decided by its number of members in Congress, which is dependent on the state’s population. So, when American citizens cast their ballots, they aren’t directly voting for president – they’re voting for electors. This year, Trump took 279, to Clinton’s 228. Petition circulates for Clinton presidency: Most states use a “winner-take-all” system when it comes to electoral votes, although there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote a certain way. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., do, however, “bind” their electors to vote for the promised candidate on Dec. 19 – in this case, Trump. In many cases, “faithless electors” are forced to pay a fine if they vote against the popular choice. Understanding what a “Faithless Elector” is: 
In order for Hillary’s supporters to be successful, they will need to sway a significant number of the Electoral College to become “faithless electors”. This video will make it clear what exactly that is and how the process works. Maine and Nebraska follow a different method , called the congressional district method, which allots two electoral votes to the popular vote winner, and additional votes for each congressional district won by the candidates. Crying Hillary Voters Compilation: Faithless electors have not ever reversed the presidency. The Change.org petition, which was at over 500,000 signatures on Thursday afternoon, said that Clinton supporters would be happy to pay any fees accrued by those who choose to be faithless electors. “Mr. Trump is unfit to serve,” the petition claimed. “His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.” source  ",0
24868,Trump bored now,"09-11-16 DONALD Trump is bored of politics and wants to do something else now. The 70-year-old president-elect spent almost 20 minutes pretending to listen to a security briefing from the CIA, before telling the US Army to build a golf course on the moon. He said: “I get it, I’m the boss. Sure, Congress, whatever. But when do I get an eagle to perch on my arm? “Anyway, I want create the most beautiful golf course the moon has ever seen. Beautiful, just beautiful. You won’t believe it.” Drumming his fingers on his desk, he added: “Okay, what else? Can I pass a law today? Maybe annex some territory? “Hey, imagine how impressed Putin would be if I defeated Isis this afternoon. “Let’s do that. Yeah, we’re going to do that. We are going to do that.”",0
24871,BREAKING: FBI Director Comey Is Now Under Federal Investigation For Hillary Smear,"Comments 
It is almost certain that the United States Office Of Special Counsel (OSC) has opened an investigation into FBI Director James Comey over his questionable decision to reignite the Hillary Clinton email scandal just a week before the election. 
The OSC is a permanent independent federal investigative and prosecution agency that acts as an internal watchdog for federal employees. While the OSC refuses to confirm the truth, they always look in to inquiries. 
“It’s OSC’s longstanding policy not to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation In general, OSC opens a case after receiving a complaint.” The complaint was made by Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer. 
“The F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election” he wrote in the New York Times. 
If found guilty, OSC investigations usually lead to a rapid loss of employment. 
Director Comey certainly deserves to lose his job after throwing a wrench into the election, bowing to pressure from House Republicans and releasing an unnecessary and extremely misleading “update” on the new emails discovered in Anthony Weiner’s cellphone that have nothing to do Hillary Clinton, her email server, or the election at large – all the while refusing to release the results of their likely inquiries into Republican nominee Donald Trump’s relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.",0
24872,Erdogan Warns Europeans on Their Safety as Tensions Rise With West - The New York Times,"KASTAMONU, Turkey  —   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey warned Europeans on Wednesday that they would no longer be able to walk safely in the street if Western politicians continued with perceived provocations against Turkish leaders. Mr. Erdogan’s warning turned out to be awkwardly timed, coming hours before a deadly attack outside the British Parliament. In a Twitter post written in English, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, quickly condemned the assault in London, noting that Turkey had “suffered similar attacks many times. ” Mr. Erdogan’s comments were a response to restrictions placed on his surrogates in European countries including Germany and the Netherlands, where they have been barred from holding political rallies in support of a referendum in which Turks will decide whether to expand their president’s powers. “If you go on behaving like that, tomorrow nowhere in the world, none of the Europeans, Westerners will be able to walk in the streets in peace, safely,” Mr. Erdogan said at a meeting in Ankara, the capital. The outburst was his latest attempt to rally nationalist voters before the tightly contested referendum. In Germany alone, 1. 4 million residents have the right to vote in the referendum on April 16. Amid fears he might lose, Mr. Erdogan and his allies have issued   diatribes against European countries, a tactic that they hope will play well among swing voters. In previous days, he has frequently accused German and Dutch politicians of Nazism. He has also suggested that he might scrap the accord that restricted the passage of migrants through Turkey and send a new wave of migrants to Europe. Western news organizations have been quick to report on these provocations, which are then read and condemned by European leaders  —   creating a feedback loop that in turn gives Mr. Erdogan more excuses to criticize Europe and to begin the cycle afresh. The tactic appeals to some Turkish voters, including many of those who attended a rally on Wednesday in Kastamonu in northern Turkey, where Mr. Erdogan headed immediately after speaking in Ankara. “He defends our country against the whole world,” said Hasan Birgun, 59, a retired salesman in Kastamonu. “Until Erdogan, our leaders were just standing meekly in the outside world. ” Hopes that the dispute would ease were raised on Tuesday, after Mr. Erdogan’s party canceled plans to send more lawmakers to campaign in Germany. But the president’s inflammatory comments on Wednesday suggested those hopes were premature. In Turkey on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the Norwegian ambassador after Norway granted refuge to four Turkish asylum seekers accused by Turkey of being involved in the  coup attempt in July, Reuters reported.",0
24874,Poll: 50% of Russians fear US-Syria-Russia standoff could spark WW3,"Videos Poll: 50% of Russians fear US-Syria-Russia standoff could spark WW3 Just over half – 52 percent – of Russians said they approve of their country’s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Be Sociable, Share! 
Almost half of all respondents in a recent Russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West caused by the ongoing crisis in Syria could develop into a global military conflict. 
The share of those who see the probability of World War Three in the near future as high or very high is now at 48 percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise 42 percent of society, the privately-owned public opinion research center Levada reported on Monday. The remaining 10 percent of respondents said they couldn’t give a simple answer to the question. 
When researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that Russia and the West would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis, 35 percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely. Thirty-nine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and 26 percent said that they couldn’t answer the question. 
Just over half – 52 percent – of Russians said they approve of their country’s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Just under a quarter – 23 percent – couldn’t answer the question about their personal view on the subject. Those who thought that Russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided 49 percent against 28 percent respectively, with 24 percent finding the question too difficult to answer. 
The level of awareness about the situation in Syria and the Russian Air Force operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists there remained fairly high. Eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in Syria and 64 percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue. Just under a fifth – 17 percent – said that they were not interested in news about Syria. 
A similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent Levada Center showed that over 70 percent of Russian citizens supported the air operations against IS terrorists in Syria, and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for Russia to support the government of Syria’s democratically-elected President Bashar Assad. 
A different poll conducted earlier this month by the state-run research center VTSIOM showed that 73 percent of Russians believed that Western criticism of the air force’s counter-terrorism operation in Aleppo, Syria, was ungrounded and prejudiced. Only 6 percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Russian military have some basis in reality. 
Russia first deployed an air force contingent in Syria in 2015, after receiving a request for military help from the Syrian government, which is currently battling Islamic State and affiliated groups. Russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in Syria on September 30, 2015. Their work has aided the Syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country.

24882,ISIS Claims Responsibility for Killing of French Police Officer - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   A police captain was fatally stabbed and his companion was also killed at their home in a small town northwest of Paris on Monday evening, and within hours the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the murders. The police captain, who was not otherwise identified, was outside his home in Magnanville when he was stabbed by an unidentified assailant, who appeared to have then entered the house and took the captain’s companion and    son hostage, according to a statement on the website of the French Interior Ministry and a statement from President François Hollande. Members of an elite French police unit arrived and raided the home. They fatally shot the attacker, found the woman dead and rescued the boy. The statement added that the woman was an employee of the Interior Ministry. A statement issued in Arabic by the Amaq News Agency, which is linked to the Islamic State, said: “Islamic State fighter kills deputy chief of the police station in the city of Les Mureaux and his wife with blade weapons,” according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist websites. It is the second attack during Ramadan this year that has been tied to the Islamic State. The first was the shooting on Sunday in Orlando, Fla. in which 49 died, making it the worst mass shooting in American history. Before he was killed by the police, the gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims dedicated to fasting and prayer, has historically been a time when both Al Qaeda and now the Islamic State have escalated attacks. In his annual   speech, an Islamic State spokesman, Abu Muhammad    —   who had not issued a statement in approximately seven months  —     to call on the group’s followers to carry out assaults in Europe and America. “The smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us,” Mr. Adnani declared in the audio speech, which was uploaded to Telegram and Twitter on May 21. Mr. Hollande called the attack “a cowardly murder” in a statement issued late Monday, saying he would be briefed on the case early Tuesday and that the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, would travel on Tuesday morning to the area where the killings took place. Magnanville is about 35 miles from central Paris. With the Euro 2016 soccer tournament underway in France and multiple warnings of the possibility of terrorist attacks during the monthlong event, the authorities have been on alert for possible attacks. Extraordinary measures have been put in place to ensure that the crowds of visitors at the soccer matches will be safe. Much of the public focus has been on avoiding a repeat of the sort of attacks that killed 130 people in and near Paris on Nov. 13. In that case, a network of former Islamic State fighters from Belgium and France staged the attacks along with a few people who expressed loyalty to the extremist group but had not traveled abroad to fight. However, perhaps the risk that is harder to protect against are the   attacks encouraged by the Islamic State. Such   jihadists are harder for the authorities to detect. A similar case arose in June 2015 when an employee at a small trucking company beheaded his boss and attempted to set off an explosion at an   chemical and gas factory near Lyon. The man, Yassine Salhi, appears to have had a friend who had gone to Syria to join the Islamic State, and Mr. Salhi sent him pictures of the beheading. Mr. Salhi killed himself in prison in December while awaiting trial. The beheading, like the stabbing on Monday evening, took place during Ramadan.",0

24885,Tests Confirm Mosquitoes in Miami Beach Are Carrying Zika Virus - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Florida announced on Thursday that, for the first time, mosquitoes in Miami Beach had tested positive for the Zika virus, a disappointing confirmation that the virus is still active in the area. The Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads Zika is famously difficult to fight, and experts often say that testing the bugs to find the virus is like looking for a needle in a haystack. The three samples that tested positive all came from a 1.   area in Miami Beach where locally acquired cases of Zika had been confirmed. The significance of the results depends on where the mosquitoes were collected, said Scott C. Weaver, the director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch. If they are from in or around the houses of people with active infections, the chances of the bugs’ being infected are higher. If the virus was found in mosquitoes in a more distant location, that could point to a bigger infection area than thought. A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said state law prevented the disclosure of the traps’ location. The department said in a statement that since May, it had tested more than 2, 470 mosquito samples, consisting of more than 40, 000 mosquitoes. The three samples that the department announced on Thursday were the first to test positive. Zika causes mild symptoms  —   rashes and joint pain  —   for most people, but it can cause severe brain damage in the fetuses of pregnant women who are infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tracking more than 1, 500 pregnant women who have been infected with Zika. So far, at least 16 babies have been born with birth defects. Florida is the only place in the continental United States where Zika is actively circulating, but the virus is spreading. The first cluster of cases was in a Miami neighborhood called Wynwood. The outbreak in that area seems to have subsided, but health officials discovered a new cluster in Miami Beach on Aug. 18, and the C. D. C. warned pregnant women not to travel there. Zika is not expected to spread explosively in the United States as it has in Latin America and the Caribbean, because Americans live in less crowded conditions and usually have window screens and air conditioning, which block infected mosquitoes from spreading the virus. In all, Florida has more than 45 homegrown cases, nearly all in   County. The first were announced in July. “The good news is the weekly number of new cases isn’t changing much,” Dr. Weaver said. “If we were seeing at first five cases a week, then 10, then 20 and then 100, we’d be very concerned. ” Even so, the mosquito has proved a stubborn foe, particularly in Miami Beach. Aerial spraying, which has been effective in Wynwood, has not happened in Miami Beach, in part because its high buildings make spraying complicated, but also because some residents oppose it. But experts say aerial spraying there is possible, and on Thursday, Gov. Rick Scott said the C. D. C. had recommended that Miami Beach be sprayed using helicopters. He said the state had made funds available “to immediately conduct aerial spraying in Miami Beach. ” But it was not clear when that might happen. When asked about aerial spraying in a telephone interview, Michael Grieco, a Miami Beach city commissioner, said: “No determination has been made. It’s not really practical with all the geography. ”",0
24886,Republicans Clash Over Obamacare Taxes - Breitbart,"Republicans continue to clash over Obamacare taxes as Congress plans to draft a repeal package. [Conservatives worry that a tax credit included in the Ryan plan would cost too much and might create an expensive new entitlement program. Congressman Mark Walker ( ) chairman of the Republican Study Committee says, “I want to make sure that we’re not getting to a place where we’re providing this   benefit that enables people. ”  House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows ( ) said refundable tax credits could be a “new entitlement program. ” He doubts that House leaders possess the votes necessary to pass refundable tax credits. Other conservatives object to taxing   health insurance plans. Rep. Pete Session ( ) chairman of the House Rules Committee, told reporters that this would amount to “a Republican tax on Cadillac plans. ” Committees will meet in early March to draft Obamacare’s repeal, although House Republicans remain disunified on the details. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) assured his fellow Republicans, arguing that a tax credit offers immediate help. Brady said, “It covers more people, because it applies to those who don’t have a tax liability, and it’s advanceable, so it’s available today. ” Some    Republicans want to keep Obamacare’s taxes to provide revenue for Obamacare’s replacement. Brady, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has significant power to draft Obamacare’ replacement. He argued that Obamacare’s taxes are bad for economic growth. He said, “I’ll just tell you, I don’t want Americans to suffer under the Obamacare taxes. They’re   they drive the prices of healthcare up I just think they’re bad all around. ” Republicans continue to battle over Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.   states expanded Medicaid, and Congress continues to debate over how to scale back Medicaid expansion. The conservative House Freedom Caucus, along with Senator Rand Paul ( ) unveiled their Obamacare repeal bill that repeals Medicaid expansion entirely. The Ryan plan lowers the federal government’s match rate for Medicaid spending back its traditional level. Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn ( ) told Breitbart News, “There is wide agreement amongst the governors, Republicans and Democrat alike, that they would like us to send Medicaid to the states. ” Blackburn believes that   Medicaid to the states will, “get rid of some of the constraints from the federal government and offer a better product at a more affordable cost and help more people. ” Chairman Brady remarked that tax breaks in Obamacare’s replacement would benefit all Americans, not just the few. He said, “I’m not interested in raising taxes anywhere else, and so I think unlocking and redesigning the current tax break so not just a few Americans can use it, but all Americans can use it, I think that’s where we ought to focus our thought, make sure we design it right and get it right. ”",0

For centuries, the Catholic Church had locked up the Bible and kept it out of reach of the common man. As a result, when the Protestant Reformation ended the Dark Ages and removed the Bible from its Vatican shackles, it was a book that remained quite a mystery to most people. Out of all of its 66 books, the most misunderstood, most debated over and most feared book is, ironically and undoubtedly, the book of Revelation. 
On this episode of Rightly Dividing , we apply Paul’s command to “rightly divide” to the book of Revelation, and in the process of doing so remove much of the mystery in the process.

24894,Canadian Victim in London Attack Died in her Fiance’s Arms,"TORONTO (AP)  —   Canadian social worker Christine Archibald is being remembered as a “bright light” for her profession as those who loved her launch an online campaign of compassionate acts after she was struck by a van of terrorists on London Bridge and died in her fiance’s arms. [The    from Calgary, Alberta, had recently moved to the Netherlands to be with her fiance Tyler Ferguson, his sister Cassie Ferguson Rowe said. The couple was engaged three months ago.  Ferguson had been walking a few steps ahead of his fiancee on the bridge, and then held her as she died, said Ferguson Rowe. “My baby brother lost the love of his life on the London bridge. In a split second, his entire life was ripped away from him,” Ferguson Rowe said. Born and raised in Castlegar, British Columbia, Archibald had later lived in Calgary, where she worked at a homeless shelter before moving to Europe to be with Ferguson. Her family in Castlegar said in a statement that Archibald “would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death. ” “She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected,” the family statement said. Kathy Christiansen, executive director of Alpha House in Calgary, said Archibald had worked at the shelter for homeless people addicted to drugs and alcohol until recently. She called Archibald a talented social worker and exceptional human being who inspired all who worked with her. “Chrissy was a bright light,” she said. Before that, Archibald was an   social work student from Calgary’s Mount Royal University. Peter Choate, an assistant professor of social work, said his former student “fit the profession. ” “She was very caring but at the same time very professional. She understood that she wasn’t in charge of the lives of her clients. She was able to offer her clients opportunities to do things with their lives,” Choate said. “She got it. The family should be very proud of the young woman, the social worker that she was. As a profession for us it is a loss. ” The Archibald family asked that people honor her memory by making the community a better place. “Volunteer your time and labor or donate to a homeless shelter,” the statement said. “Tell them Chrissy sent you. ” The hashtag #Chrissysentme was being used on Twitter to express sadness for the family’s loss. Inspired by the call for meaningful action, some people pledged to make donations to shelters, soup kitchens and other community groups. Ferguson Rowe said she hoped the use of the hashtag would “urge people to not let her death be in vain, to do good in their community. ” “It’s what she would have wanted,” Ferguson Rowe said.",0
24895,President Elect Trump Promises to Help with #CalExit,"Thursday, 10 November 2016 President Elect Donald Trump This Morning at the White House 
WASHINGTON DC - Taking questions from the media this morning before his meeting with President Barack Obama - President Elect Donald Trump was asked about the YesCalifornia Independence Campaign. YesCalifornia or #Calexit is a referendum for California Independence from the United States of America. In the Spring of 2019, Californians will go to the polls in a historic vote to decide by referendum if California should exit the Union. 
""I think it is a great idea"" President Elect Trump answered, ""I've met a lot of fantastic wonderful people in California and not all of them agree with me. The most incredible thing about this great and wonderful fantastic country we live in is we have the ability to choose our own path and vote on it as a wonderful collection of great and incredible people. 
""I honestly do not want to keep anyone in this country that does not want to be in this country. My primary job as president will to be fix the economy. If the incredible wonderful fantastic people of California want to operate as an independent sovereign nation, I would love to help these wonderful people. Getting rid of California will help the economy greatly. 
""I have talked with advisers and we are checking the constitution. I have a transition team talking with incredible clerks in the Supreme Court to see if I can fast track the process. As long as I am constitutionally able to do so, I will sign an executive order to remove the State of California from the United States. I know they are having trouble with their economy and water, but they obviously have plans on how to fix this as an independent nation. 
""I will also take request from any other wonderful beautiful states who want to follow the same course. My aim is to make America great again. Removing the chaff from the wheat will help us in obtaining this goal. 
When President Elect Trump was asked about the future fifty-five electoral votes the state has he responded, ""oh I never thought about that. I guess that would [suck] for Democrats."" 
He also was jokingly asked if Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to the morning presidential briefings President Elect Trump is now part of, Trump replied, ""Of course not, but I'll update him on Twitter.""

24896,"WaPo Admits Single-Payer Health Care Would be ""Astonishingly"" Expensive","The Washington Post dealt a blow to a liberal pipe dream Sunday when the outlet’s editorial board highlighted the problems with   health care   —   arguing that it would be “astonishingly” expensive unless doctors are paid less and Americans are prepared to “accept different standards of access and comfort. ”[The piece, called “  health care would have an astonishingly high price tag” comes days after California’s Senate approved a   system for the state earlier this week, without having specified how it will pay for the estimated $400 billion price tag.    health care systems, such as those seen in Europe and Canada, have always been popular with the liberal wing of American politics, with top liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders ( ) and Elizabeth Warren ( ) calling for such systems in America. President Barack Obama also publicly supported   when he was a senator. The Post editorial is certainly sympathetic to those aspirations, arguing that such models are simpler for patients and employers. However, it says “the government’s price tag would be astonishing. ” When Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) proposed a “Medicare for all” health plan in his presidential campaign, the nonpartisan Urban Institute figured that it would raise government spending by $32 trillion over 10 years, requiring a tax increase so huge that even the democratic socialist Mr. Sanders did not propose anything close to it. Countering the argument of   advocates that   systems tend to be more   than the American system, the Post says the reason for that is political, blaming Republicans for framing ObamaCare’s Medicare cuts as attacks on the program instead of reform. The Post argues that a   system would face the same political barriers and that consequently, the only way to make such a plan affordable would be to get medical employees to be paid less, and to get Americans to accept lower quality of care: A     system would face all of these political barriers to   reform and more. To realize the   dream of coverage for all and big savings, medical industry players, including doctors, would likely have to get paid less and patients would have to accept different standards of access and comfort. There is little evidence most Americans are willing to accept such tradeoffs. The Post reiterates that “the goal must be universal coverage and cost restraint” but that liberals should be directing their energy to goals other than a complete government takeover of America’s healthcare system. There are many options short of a disruptive takeover: the government can change how care is delivered, determine which treatments should be covered, control quality at hospitals, drive down drug costs and discourage     plans even while making the Obamacare system better at filling coverage gaps.

24897,"Crystal Clear Agreements: Enduring subordination, by Manlio Dinucci","“The Art of War”
Crystal Clear Agreements: Enduring subordination by Manlio Dinucci Voltaire Network | Rome (Italy) | 27 October 2016 français italiano First, President Obama called upon the Italians to vote “yes” in the referendum, thus interfering in our national politics with the silent complicity of the parliamentary opposition. Then he went on to confirm to his “good friend Matteo” that the US has “clear agreements, long friendship” with Italy.
Noone would question that these agreements were crystal clear, especially the Atlantic Treaty that places Italy in a position of subordination to the U.S.A. The US President always appoints the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and all the other key commands are in US hands.
When the disintegration of the USSR brought the Cold War to an end, Washington declared the “fundamental importance of preserving Nato as a channel of influence and US participation in European Affairs so as to prevent the creation of exclusively European structures that would threaten the Alliance’s chain of command”, that is the US command. An idea reiterated by the NATO Secretary Stoltenberg during the recent round table on the “Big Idea for Europe”:
“We must ensure that building up Europe’s defense does not duplicate Nato’s defence and [Europe] does not become another Nato”.
Stoltenberg’s idea is guaranteed by the fact that 22 of the 28 EU member states (21 of 27 following Great Britain’s departure) are part of the US-led Nato, which is recognized by the European Union as “the foundation of collective defense”.
Thus the EU foreign and military policy is fundamentally subordinated to the US strategy and the European powers have aligned themselves to it. Their conflicting interests are ironed out when their fundamental interest is at stake: maintaining Western predominance, increasingly faltering when confronted by the emergence of new state and non-state subjects. All we need to do is to recall to our minds that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, created through a strategic China-Russia agreement, pools resources that makes it the biggest integrated economic area in the world.
In the context of the US/Nato strategy – reports the White House – Italy stands out as a “steadfast and active ally of the United States”. This is demonstrated by the fact that “Italy hosts more than 30,000 soldiers and civil officers of the US Defence Department in military establishments positioned all over the country”.
At the same time, Italy is “a US partner for global security”, supplying military forces and funding for a wide range of “challenges”: in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Baltic and elsewhere, that is, wherever the USA/Nato war machine has been and is deployed.
A final fact to confirm the nature of the US-Italian relationship – scheduled to arrive at the Amendola base (Puglia), probably on 8 November, are the first two of the 90 fighter planes supplied by Lockheed Martin (a US company), that Italy has undertaken to purchase.
The cost of Italy’s participation in the F-35 programme as a second-tier partner is officially calculated in the Stability Law of 2016: 12 billion 356 million euro of public money, plus additional costs for the continual updates to the fighter plane that still is not fully operative and will require constant modernization. Despite this – confirms Analisi Difesa – Italy will have “limited sovereignty” over the F-35 planes that form part of its own Air Force. A US law prohibits that “mission information” (software for managing the fighting systems of the fighter planes) is communicated to others. Thus the US will control the Italian F-35 which have been fitted out to use the new nuclear bombs B61-12 that the Pentagon will deploy against Russia, substituting them for the existing B-61, on our “national” territory.

According to Rai al-Youm newspaper , a Bedouin Jordanian poet has expressed his willingness to marry the daughter of Donald Trump , the US president-elect.
Falih Al-Jabour wrote in a poem that Jordanian officials are on their way to the white house to ask for the hand of Tiffany Trump, the president’s youngest daughter. He hoped the offer wouldn’t be turned down.
Al-Jabour proposed to Tiffany in his strange and humorous poem and even offered to pay a substantial price for the bride including 50 camels, 200 thoroughbred horses and a 15.5-acre field.
This Jordanian poet published his poem in social networks and asked the bride’s family not to reject him.
Falih Al-Jabour’s only condition for the marriage is that after marrying him and going to his home land, the bride has to wear burka, because she’s “so beautiful”, otherwise there will be a chaos in the tribe.

24901,‘The Daily’: President Trump’s Foreign Policy Muse - The New York Times,"Back on the campaign trail,   Donald J. Trump argued that the United States faced a threat  —   radical Islamic terrorism  —   on par with fascism, Nazism and communism.

24902,The War on UNESCO,"0 38 
Did Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, actually read the full text of the UNESCO resolution on Palestine and Israel, before he raved with anger? 
“I think this is a mistaken, inconceivable resolution,” he said. 
“It is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the UN and UNESCO that aim to attack Israel. It is shocking and I have ordered that we stop taking this position (his country’s abstention) even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of Europe,” he added. 
Renzi, who became Prime Minister in 2014 at the relatively young age of 39 knows exactly how the game is played. In order to win favor with Washington, he must first please Tel Aviv. 
His country has abstained from the October 12 vote on a resolution that condemns Israel’s violations of the cultural and legal status of Occupied East Jerusalem. This decision has ignited the ire of Israeli Ambassador to Rome, Ofer Zaks , who riled up the Jewish community in Italy to protest the abstention. Renzi, in turn, was converted into a champion of the ‘Temple Mount’, the name Israel uses to describe the Palestinian Muslim holy site. 
Renzi cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the resolution, which merely condemned Israel’s obvious violations of international law, and only calls for Israel to respect the status of Palestinian culture in the occupied city.

24903,News: Shattering The Glass Ceiling: It Is Finally Acceptable For Women To Cry At Work,"Email 
It’s no secret that workplaces in our country are still deeply misogynistic environments, but with her 2016 bid for the president of the United States, Hillary Clinton worked tirelessly to not just be elected but to also break down barriers for women everywhere. Today marks a big win for gender equality, because the glass ceiling has been shattered, and it is finally acceptable for women to cry at work! 
That’s right, ladies. It’s time to iron those pantsuits and put on those heels, because the day has finally come when it’s totally fine to sob openly in your office, and there’s nothing men can do to stop you! 
For far too long, women have been marginalized, written off, and told that there are certain things they can never achieve. But today, that all ends, because women are coming into work and crying at several unpredictable intervals throughout the entire day with absolutely zero negative consequences. As of now, it seems like anything is possible, because from the boardroom to the lab, women across the country are stepping up and owning their shit, skulking around their offices with puffy eyes and tears streaming down their faces, no ducking into the stairwell necessary. 
It’s 2016, baby, so if you have two X chromosomes, you better lean the hell in! This news has got us like: 
Considering that just a short while ago, most women were expected to be homemakers, it’s incredible to think that our nation has gotten to the point where not one, but all women can come to work and cry loudly in and around their workplaces, no questions asked. Just 100 years ago, women couldn’t even attend college, but now it is not only acceptable, but even expected that this morning, women went straight to the bathroom and cried uncontrollably out of anger or fear or downright despair! 
Y s, queen! 
Thankfully, today will go down as a huge victory for women, because we can show our daughters and our granddaughters that right now, it’s fine for their mothers to break down and spray a pool of mascara-soaked tears all over their desks. At this historic moment, the glass ceiling is totally shattered, and there’s absolutely no way it’s going back up!",0

24907,’Deport Me!’ Czech Child Abuser Begs the British Authorities,"A Czech child abuser has claimed that the UK has failed to deport him to a prison in his home country, in spite of a transfer request by the Czech authorities and his own willingness to go. [In a letter to the Sunday Times, Desan Juran details how both he and his home nation have repeatedly requested the British authorities deport him to serve out his sentence, but have been ignored for over a year.  Juran was working as a nanny in Bradford when he was arrested in connection with a child abuse in his home country. The police later discovered he had shared over 30, 000 indecent images of children online. It is not clear why Juran, who plead guilty to 19 offences involving the sexual abuse of a young boy in the Czech Republic, was not sent home to serve his sentence in the first place. He claims the Czechs have asked the British authorities for more information so they can help to facilitate a transfer, which the Rye Hill inmate requested last June, but “as of now, half a year later, British authorities still have not provided it”. “I am more than willing to go” said Juran. “I know that the British prison system is overcrowded and in crisis, and I believe that getting rid of foreign national prisoners would help solve the problem, and the government wants us to believe that it is its priority. “It is in [the] best interest of [everyone] for me to be repatriated   …     British taxpayers pay tens of thousands of pounds per year for keeping me here. Those six months of waiting   …     have already cost Britain over £15, 000, and I am just one person. There are hundreds, or possibly even thousands of people like me, and if something was done about the inefficiency of British bureaucracy, it would save the taxpayers millions of pounds every year. ” The Telegraph reported that there were more than 4, 000 European Union (EU) nationals in British prisons last September. Only 102 have been transferred to their home countries, despite the introduction of a prisoner transfer directive eight years ago. The number of EU nationals in English and Welsh prisons rose by 240 per cent between 2002 and 2014, costing UK taxpayers around £150m. In June 2016 the BBC reported on an admission by the Parliamentary   of State at the Ministry of Justice  —   removed from office by Theresa May following the Brexit referendum  —   that EU laws “prohibit [the] UK from sending foreign criminals home” even after they have served their sentences. Examples include Romanian rapist Mircea Gheorghiu, whose abusive history was uncovered by the Home Office after a   conviction in the UK. Gheorghiu, who entered the country illegally in 2002, was initially removed under a   deportation scheme, but returned after   judge Sir Nicholas Blake ruled that he was not a sufficiently serious threat and “should be reunited with his family as quickly as possible”.",0

B ritain’s economy expanded by 0.5pc in the three months following the EU referendum, slowing down a touch from the 0.7pc growth recorded in the previous quarter but defying the most pessimistic predictions made by the Remain campaign. 
The country’s economic performance was stronger than the 0.3pc predicted by economists, and in line with the official forecasts made before the referendum took place – in March the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted third quarter growth of 0.5pc. It also disproves the Treasury’s referendum campaign claim that a vote to leave the EU would r esult in 0.1pc fall in GDP in the third quarter that would herald the start of a recession. The Treasury’s worst-case “severe shock” scenario was even more pessimistic, predicting a 1pc fall in the three-month period. 
S terling rallied on the initial estimates from the Office for National Statistics, and economists said the unexpectedly strong numbers made it less likely that the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) would cut interest rates at next month’s monetary policy committee meeting.

The student activists claim there are “many incidents where students of color and historically marginalized communities are treated differently by police officers. ” They cite the Black Lives Matter platform as the blueprint for their draft of the legislation: “The Black Lives Matter platform calls on [sic] community control of the police because current policing practices  …    demonstrate a lack of voices for communities of color. ” The resolution, entitled“UWPD Accountability and Community Control of the Police,” passed by a unanimous vote in the student council and will now be passed on to the faculty senate for confirmation. The resolution argues that “the treatment and characterization of people of color by UWPD raises questions about their implicit bias and discriminatory policing procedures. ”  In response to the allegations of discrimination, the resolution demands that UWM “implement a community accountability board to review the policies and procedures that discriminate against people of color. ” The University of Wisconsin Police Department claims that the resolution is “irrelevant” to the department’s goal of carrying out their job in a way that maintains order and safety for all students on campus.

It goes about 300 million euros, which Arianespace was supposed to pay to Roscosmos, but the funds were frozen by the Court of Arbitration in The Hague in the case of former Yukos shareholders . Previously, Roscosmos had won a case in France about the arrest of accounts of the state corporation in the Yukos case. ""They acknowledged that our arguments were correct, but we will continue defending our interests,"" director of communications at Roscosmos, Igor Burenkov said. On April 11, France arrested $700 million of Roskosmos and Space Communications money in connection with a judicial decision on the case of Yukos.

24914,News: Disgrace: The CEO Of Beans Has Stepped Down Amid Reports That There Can’t Be A CEO Of Beans,"Email 
Oh, how the mighty have fallen. 
It’s always an embarrassing moment when a high-powered executive suffers a scandal that forces him or her to resign, but it looks like yet another head honcho is about to step into that humiliating spotlight: After nearly a decade on the job, the CEO of beans has officially stepped down following reports that there cannot be a CEO of beans. 
Yikes. Talk about a fall from grace. 
Patrick Buckley was an ambitious leader as the CEO of beans, often telling people that he was in charge of every single bean that came out of the dirt, and even going so far as to print up business cards with “CEO of beans” listed right on the front. With beans being such a common staple of diets worldwide, a man in Mr. Buckley’s position may have seemed poised to become one of the most powerful people in the food industry. But in the blink of an eye, everything the executive had been working for came crashing down before him, as reports began to circulate late last week that while bean manufacturers may have CEOs, it’s impossible for beans in general to have a CEO of their own. 
“After a wonderful career at the helm of beans, it has become apparent that there is no such thing as my job,” the scandalized CEO wrote in a brief statement to the press. “In light of this news that my position, and my former role as director of garbanzo, do not exist, it seems prudent that I step down immediately. I am proud of the work I have done for beans during my tenure, and I look forward to continuing to prepare and eat beans in the future.” 
As of this morning, the board of directors of beans has accepted Mr. Buckley’s resignation, and then the members promptly stepped down themselves amidst reports that beans cannot have a board of directors, either. 
Making matters worse, the entire corporate structure of beans now finds itself crumbling from the top all the way down, as an onslaught of new allegations indicate that beans, as a relatively loose category of foods, has never been and cannot be a staffable organization. 
Wow. It’s hard to imagine how Mr. Buckley will ever bounce back from such a disgrace, but hopefully he learns an important lesson from all this. CEOs, take note: Your mistakes will always come back to haunt you.",0
24917,Donald Trump to Be First President Since Reagan to Speak at NRA Annual Meetings - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump will be the first President to speak at the NRA Annual Meetings since Ronald Reagan did it in 1983. [He will speak to the NRA’s 2017 Leadership Forum in Atlanta on April 28.  Breitbart News reported that the NRA endorsed Trump on May 20, 2016, during the 2016 Annual Meetings in Louisville, Kentucky. Thereafter, the NRA campaigned for Trump, and Trump reminded voters again and again that he would work with the NRA to save the Second Amendment if elected. Trump will now return to speak to the gun rights group that cheered him to victory last year. Bloomberg reports that this will make him “the first U. S. president to address the   group since Ronald Reagan in 1983. ” Trump’s speech to the NRA will occur two months to the day after he signed a repeal of Barack Obama’s Social Security gun ban which would have allowed the Social Security Administration to strip beneficiaries of the Second Amendment rights without due process. The speech also comes nearly two months after his Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, ended an   ban against using lead ammunition on federal lands. On April 13, 2017, Breitbart News reported that the Trump administration has been quietly rolling back other   gun controls behind the scenes. McClatchy reported that federal agencies have “narrowed the definition of ‘fugitive,’” thereby limiting the number of people prohibited from gun possession because they are included in a fugitive database. Trump “officials have also signaled that they may no longer defend the Army Corps of Engineers’ ban on carrying loaded firearms and ammunition on federal lands. ” Trump’s greatest   Amendment accomplishment was nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and securing his confirmation. Trump had promised to use SCOTUS to save the Second Amendment from “people like Hillary Clinton,” and Gorsuch is widely viewed as a fulfillment of that promise.

And yes, be prepared to have a showdown. Be prepared to have a showdown and the competencies and the articulation as a Republican party that controls all that damn elected branches in Washington D. C. Time to make that case to the American people. That it is the despicable snake oil salesman Chuck Schumer and the despicable failure Nancy Pelosi who are destroying this economy, who are driving up the debt. And we have a president who wants to do something about both. We have a president who was elected to fund border security. It was always preposterous when he said that Mexico was going to do it. And I told you that. And I don’t care about that. Build the damn wall. You got the House. You got the Senate. You got the presidency. You got the bureaucracy. The art of the deal, screw the art of the deal. It should be the art of victory. The art of victory. It’s time to roll Schumer.

24923,UNAUTHORIZED VIDEO Of Hillary and Huma Leaks – Watch Before It’s Removed | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print Hillary Clinton got the shock of her life on Friday when the FBI reopened their investigation into her use of a personal email server during her time as Secretary of State. The investigation was reopened due to incriminating emails found on the server of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin. Days later, The Political Insider is reporting that the hacker group Anonymous has released a damning video exposing Abedin’s shady pass. The footage reveals Abedin’s extensive personal ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and that her mother is a member of the group’s counterpart organization for women. When she began interning for Clinton at the age of 20, Abedin was also working for a Jihadist legal publication which endorsed Sharia law. In addition, Abedin’s family has links to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Anonymous also released a video detailing Clinton’s own criminal past.

24924,Hafiz Saeed and Geelani to dress up as mime artists on Ravish Kumar’s show in solidarity with NDTV,"Hafiz Saeed and Geelani to dress up as mime artists on Ravish Kumar’s show in solidarity with NDTV Posted on Tweet 
Notwithstanding the I&B ministry’s decision to stay its decision to black out NDTV for a day for revealing sensitive information during counter-terror operations in Pathankot (and Kargil and 26/11), fans of NDTV continue to emerge in support of the channel. 
Following journalist Ravish Kumar creative show featuring mime artists, presumably representing a silent protest against the government’s decision, NDTV found two unlikely but perhaps not so unlikely allies in Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Hafiz Saeed. The separatist and the terrorist have announced their decision to participate in Ravish Kumar’s show as mime artists. 
“Nobody has done more for the Kashmir freedom struggle than Barkha Dutt ji,” raved Geelani to our correspondent. “I know that I am recognized as the leader of Kashmiri freedom, but truth be told, my commitment to the cause pales in comparison to Barkha ji’s. She used her brilliance and blamed terrorism in the valley on the rise of hindutva in India! She has highlighted a plan of blaming the burning of schools on Diwali crackers. She is a true Kashmiri patriot. Just as Jinnah is the Father of the Nation in Pakistan, we hope to make Barkha ji the Mother of the Nation when we’ll get our freedom. The least I can do is show solidarity with NDTV. I will dress as a mime artist on Ravish’s next show,” said Geelani before excusing himself to practice miming for the show. 
Hafiz Saeed was harder to track down. But our stringers in Pakistan reported that the 26/11 mastermind had been inconsolable ever since the government announced its decision to ban NDTV for a day and had spent an entire day binge watching ‘The Buck Stops Here’ with teary eyes. When the tears dried up, he sprang to his feet, yelled “Yeh sab RAW ne kiya hai!” and decided to join the battle for Freedom Of Expression by joining Ravish’s show as a mime artist. 
In other news, Arun Jaitley was spotted creating several Bot accounts on Twitter and retweeting Barkha Dutt’s tweets.

24926,Trump Sets GOP Fundraising Milestone In Small-Donor Contributions," 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other GOP candidate has before.
He has amassed the largest small-donor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the Republican Party.
Zac Moffatt, an online fundraising expert, said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate.
 
Related Stories Newt Gingrich Defends Donald Trump Against ‘Sexual Predator’ Accusations Donald Trump’s Star On Hollywood Walk Of Fame Vandalized Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio “The people who donate are your core believers,” said Moffatt, who was digital director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign.
Romney and Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than Trump has in total contributions.
However, Trump’s campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as $200 or less.
 
In this category, Trump has raised more than $78.6 million thus far, based on data from the Federal Election Commission.
In comparison, McCain raised $65.5 million and Romney raised $44.8 million by this point in their election races.
While McCain and Romney had significant income contributions from other sources, Trump’s small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.
According to OpenSecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below $200 mark the campaigns aren’t legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds $200 the campaign must give the donor’s name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias “You could make an argument that he is the best candidate to refresh the RNC’s online fundraising database because of the different kind of donor that he’s gotten,” said Vincent Harris, a GOP digital strategist who did private digital work for Trump’s campaign.
As of Oct. 19, the Trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the party’s get-out-the-vote effort, electing instead to have Trump focus on getting across his final message to voters.
“We’ve kind of wound down,” said Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s national finance chairman. “But the online fundraising continues to be strong.”
“We have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],” Mnuchin continued. “Unlike [Democratic nominee] Hillary [Clinton], who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.”
This decision has been questioned by some given that Clinton’s campaign has raised $445.4 million, according to OpenSecrets, which is $226.6 million more than the $218.8 million Trump has raised.
Clinton has 41 events lined up before Nov. 4.

24928,Man imprisoned for failing to provide an Amazon review,"November 7, 2016 
‘We must have sent him four emails asking for a review, but he just ignored them,’ said an Amazon spokesman today. ‘He hadn’t marked the product as a gift, so there was no reason to not provide a review,’ he added. 
Judge Roberts commented when sentencing Billy Askew (24) from Winsford to three months in gaol that: ‘it was every on-line shopper’s civic duty to provide a review, even if it’s clearly horseshit’. Billy was clearly shaken by the sentence: ‘it was just a set of toe-nail clippers,’ he pointed out as he was escorted from the dock. ‘They cut my toe-nails, what more is there to say?’ he asked, narrowly avoiding having his fingers trapped in the cell door. 
The Amazon spokesman defended referring Billy to the authorities: ‘Everybody provides reviews these days, even HMRC gave our tax return a review. One star, a bit harsh,’ he added, while confirming that if Billy had been an Amazon Prime member. ‘We’d probably have written the review for him’. 
Billy has clearly seen the error of his ways, as he posted a review of his cell on TripAdvisor. ‘Smaller than advertised, has an all pervading smell of wee and can you believe it – no spare keys!’ Share this story...

24931,MILO’s Book ’Dangerous’ To Be Released In June Will Now Include Berkeley Riots - Breitbart,"The release date of MILO’s upcoming book “DANGEROUS” has been moved to early June in order to include material about the   riots that took place at UC Davis, UW Seattle, and UC Berkeley in the final weeks of the “Dangerous Faggot Tour,” he has confirmed. [In a Facebook post, MILO said that he had been granted more time from his publisher, Simon  Schuster, to submit a manuscript of the book in order to “include material about the craziness and rioting at UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UW Seattle. ”  “It would be absurd for me to publish a book without some discussion of the insanity of the last few weeks,” he continued. Violent protests outside all three universities saw unprecedented   violence, attracting shock around the world. Rioters vandalized university buildings, started several fires, and beat and pepper sprayed journalists and Trump supporters. One individual was taken to hospital in critical condition from a gunshot wound. The $250, 000 book deal, which was announced in December, caused widespread outrage from   activists who argued Simon  Schuster should not publish “hate speech. ” For example, the Chicago Review of Books confirmed they would boycott reviews of any books published by Simon and Schuster in 2017, whilst women’s lifestyle magazine ELLE published a column claiming it would “endanger human lives. ” Meanwhile, “Bad Feminist” author Roxane Gay confirmed she was canceling her own book deal with the publishers in protest at MILO’s own book deal. As a result of the backlash, the book has twice reached the top of the Amazon bestseller list and is one of the most anticipated books of 2017. The book will now be released June 13th, rather than the original date of March 14th. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!  You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
24932,Soros Group Gave $100K for Illegal Aliens’ Legal Fees - Breitbart,"George Soros is helping foot the bill for illegal immigrants’ legal services in Baltimore, Maryland. [Soros’ Open Society Foundation has donated $100, 000 to a Baltimore legal fund, created by a number of open borders groups, to pay for lawyers for illegal immigrants as they try to avoid deportation.  The Southeast Baltimore Open Society Foundation’s Director Diana Morris said illegal immigrants feel as though they are “under attack” by President Donald Trump’s administration, according to the Baltimore Sun, failing to mention that the vast majority of illegal immigrants deported from the U. S. had committed crimes. “We see children afraid to go to school,” Morris said during a press conference in front of a Catholic parish. “Parents afraid to drop their children off at school. ” So far, Soros’ Open Society Foundation is one of the biggest funders of the Baltimore illegal alien fund, with another $100, 000 coming from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and $25, 000 pouring in from Baltimore Community Foundation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions reiterated the Trump Administration’s commitment to prioritizing the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants, while also making clear that any individual living in the U. S. illegally is eligible for deportation. “Everybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported, so people come here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not subject to being deported  —   well, they are,” Sessions said in an interview. Soros has been made famous due to his support for liberal leaders like former President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Soros has previously blasted strong, national borders as an “obstacle” for illegal immigrants and foreign refugees trying to enter the Western world, Breitbart London reported.

There has been a surge of immigrants illegally crossing into the United States leading up to next month’s presidential election. 
CBS News reports dozens of immigrants have been streaming through the streets of McAllen, Texas, on a daily basis. They have been taken to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where they were released by Border Patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum. 


Moms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. Feds: 275,000 born to illegals in one year, would fill city the size of Orlando 
“In 2014, about 275,000 babies were born to unauthorized-immigrant parents in the U.S., accounting for about 7 percent of all U.S. births, and 32 percent of all U.S. births to foreign-born mothers,” said Pew’s newly released report. Border Patrol Agent: Admin Treats Illegal Crossings ‘Like a Traffic Ticket’ Chris Cabrera says the administration is actively trying to ‘circumvent their own laws’ 
U.S. Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera said that the federal government is “trying to circumvent their own laws” by preventing the agents from securing the border and curbing illegal immigration during an interview Wednesday on “The Laura Ingraham Show.” 
During an interview with CBS News Tuesday, Cabrera said the impending presidential election was one of the main causes of recent “mass spikes” in illegal crossings. Saying that the immigrants have been told that if Hillary Clinton is elected there will be “some sort of amnesty,” Cabrera added that they’ve been told if Donald Trump is elected, “there’s going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.” 
Cabrera told Ingraham the federal government is impeding the agents’ efforts to contain the rush on the border. 
“And you know, we’re just doing what the law says and what our job is,” Cabrera told Ingraham. “Apparently, they’re trying to circumvent their own laws, and we just want to do our jobs the way we know how to do it and the way we were trained to do it.”",0
24937,CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS WARNED THAT TURKEY’S ERDOGAN WAS ATTEMPTING TO BUY FAVOR,"Home › POLITICS › CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS WARNED THAT TURKEY’S ERDOGAN WAS ATTEMPTING TO BUY FAVOR CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS WARNED THAT TURKEY’S ERDOGAN WAS ATTEMPTING TO BUY FAVOR 4 SHARES 
[11/1/16] Top Hillary Clinton campaign officials were warned last summer that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would make contributions to the campaign through American proxies to gain favor, but chose to take money from one of the people they were warned about nonetheless. 
The warning came last August in an email to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Michael Werz, an expert on Turkey who used to work for Podesta’s Center for American Progress, told Podesta that the “Erdogan faction” was making investments in Democratic candidates such as Clinton. 
“Am told that the Erdogan crew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates, including yours,” Werz told Podesta. “Two names that you should be aware of are Mehmet Celebi and Ali Cinar.” 
Werz, who did not respond to a request for comment, wrote that the “Erdogan faction is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gülenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG.” 
Podesta forwarded the email to Dennis Cheng , who runs the campaign’s fundraising operation. 
The email was posted online by Wikileaks. The U.S. director of national intelligence and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security have accused “Russia’s senior-most officials” of hacking and leaking the emails to influence the 2016 election. 
Ali Cinar, one of the men Werz warned about, had already given Clinton $2,700 three months earlier in May. This year, Cinar gave an additional $2,000 to Clinton this August and $500 more in September. 
Cinar has also given $1,080 to the Democratic National Committee this cycle. 
The Clinton campaign would not answer questions on the donations from Cinar. 
Cinar is currently president of the Turkish Heritage Organization, a recognized non-profit based in the United States that was recently probed by the FBI after hacked emails from the Erdogan administration revealed that the group was lobbying on behalf of the Turkish presidency in the United States.

24940,Hastert Accuser Sues for $1.8 Million in Compensation - The New York Times,"CHICAGO  —   A man who says J. Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House, molested him decades ago when the man was 14 filed a lawsuit against Mr. Hastert on Monday, saying he was owed $1. 8 million of the money he had been promised as compensation for the abuse. The suit, for breach of contract, says that Mr. Hastert promised to pay him $3. 5 million for the pain and suffering that the abuse had caused, but failed to pay the full amount after being charged last year with federal crimes. The name of the man was not made public in the lawsuit. The suit was filed in Kendall County, Ill. on the edge of Chicago’s suburbs, where Mr. Hastert worked as a high school wrestling coach in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, and where at least four members of the wrestling team have said he sexually abused them. The suit adds to a mounting set of legal problems for Mr. Hastert, 74, who is expected to be sentenced on Wednesday in federal court here after pleading guilty to a banking violation tied to the abuse. The man who sued on Monday  —   known in his own lawsuit as James Doe and in the federal case against Mr. Hastert as Individual A  —   was molested when Mr. Hastert asked him to stay alone with him in a motel room during a wrestling camp trip, his lawsuit says. “For many years to follow, Plaintiff suffered severe panic attacks which led to periods of unemployment, career changes, bouts of depression, hospitalization and   psychiatric treatment,” the suit says, noting that the plaintiff’s family had known and trusted Mr. Hastert for years. In 2008, the lawsuit says, the plaintiff learned that Mr. Hastert had abused someone else as well and met with Mr. Hastert to confront him. “During their discussions, Hastert acknowledged the lifelong pain and suffering he caused Plaintiff,” the lawsuit says. A lawyer for Mr. Hastert declined to comment on the suit on Monday. It was the large payments from Mr. Hastert to Individual A starting around 2010 that led the authorities to begin investigating Mr. Hastert. As they investigated the sums and whether they violated bank reporting requirements, the claims of abuse emerged. At one point, a lawyer for Mr. Hastert told the authorities that his client was being extorted by Individual A over a false claim of abuse, a court filing by prosecutors says. Eventually, after recording conversations between Mr. Hastert and Individual A, the investigators dismissed the notion that it was a case of extortion, or that it was a false claim. Mr. Hastert was not charged with sexual abuse in the episodes, for which the statutes of limitation have passed. He pleaded guilty in October to illegally structuring bank withdrawals, and prosecutors said he had been using the funds to pay “hush money” for misconduct from years past. The lawsuit filed on Monday said the plaintiff was still owed $1. 8 million of the “settlement agreement,” plus interest. Individual A is not expected to testify at Mr. Hastert’s sentencing hearing on Wednesday, though another victim is expected to, as is the sister of a man, now deceased, who told her he had been abused by Mr. Hastert. Prosecutors have said they believe Mr. Hastert should face as little as no prison time or as much as six months in prison, as suggested under federal guidelines. Defense lawyers have requested probation for Mr. Hastert, who has had a stroke and other medical problems in recent months. Dozens of people have sent letters to the court on behalf of Mr. Hastert, including his wife, children and brother.",0
24942,Turkey: US Arms Shipments to Syrian Kurds Endanger ’All Humanity’,"Following Turkish media reports last week, the U. S. military has confirmed that it has begun shipping weapons to the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units ( ) to prepare for the battle to liberate Raqqa, Syria, from the Islamic State. [The YPG  —   the military wing of the Syrian People’s Democratic Unit (PYD)  —   is widely considered to be the most effective militia against ISIS on the ground in Syria and cooperates with both the United States and Russia. The government of Turkey objects to supporting them, however, having designated the YPG a terrorist group for its ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its alleged aim of establishing a sovereign Kurdistan. While America supports the YPG, it has officially designated the Marxist PKK a terrorist organization.  The YPG is the largest faction in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a     State coalition. “The U. S.  coalition has begun issuing arms and equipment to Kurdish elements of the S. D. F. ,” the New York Times quotes Col. Ryan S. Dillon, a military spokesman in Baghdad, stating via email Tuesday. He specified that the equipment included “small arms, ammunition, heavy machine guns   …     [and equipment to protect from] heavily armored   I. E. D. s. ” “Wherever possible, our advisers will monitor the use of the weapons and supplies we give the Kurdish elements of the S. D. F. ensuring use only against ISIS. Any alleged misuse or diversion of U. S. support will be taken seriously and lead to the possible curtailment of support, if verified,” he added. The Kurdish outlet Kurdistan24 published confirmations that the shipments had arrived from the leaders of both the PYD,   Salih Muslim, and YPJ spokeswoman Nisreen Abdalla. (The YPJ is the   counterpart of the YPG.) “We consider this decision a historical step, and we highly appreciate it,” Abdalla said while Muslim heralded the “mutual trust” between the United States and the YPG forces. The Trump administration announced that it would arm the YPG in May. “The SDF, partnered with enabling support from U. S. and coalition forces, are the only force on the ground that can successfully seize Raqqa in the near future,” Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said in a statement at the time. “We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey. We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the U. S. is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our NATO ally. ” Last week, the Turkish newspapers Hurriyet and Milliyet reported that American troops had begun shipping the weapons in question to the YPG. Hurriyet estimated the size of the convoy carrying the shipment to be about one hundred military vehicles, and Milliyet published images the newspaper claimed were of the vehicles in question. The former predicted the shipment included “fuel oil, military armored vehicles, heavy construction equipment and ammunition. ” Turkey’s National Security Council (MGK) issued a stern condemnation of the move on Wednesday. “It has been emphasized that the implementation of a policy to support the    terrorist organization in the guise of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) ignoring Turkey’s expectations, does not befit a friendship and alliance,” the MGK said in a statement.",0

24945,"FBI Ignore Intel Showing Location Of Missing 33,000 Clinton Emails","Posted on October 27, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in News , US // 0 Comments 
FBI bosses are deliberately choosing to ignore the contents of the ‘missing’ 33,000 Clinton emails after officials were told their location. 
Investigative journalist Paul Sperry says that newly released FBI documents prove that federal agents know the whereabouts of the missing emails – claiming that they exist in several locations and can be easily recovered. 
Breitbart.com reports: 
The emails were created during Clinton’s use of a home-built and largely unprotected email system for her personal and government emails, and also for her management of the scandal-wracked, foreign-funded foundation while she was working as Secretary of State. 
Clinton insists she’s handed over all of the government emails — which actually belong to the taxpayer — and insists she didn’t break the law by mixing personal and government business or by storing and swapping classified information on her own email network. The hidden 33,000 emails are just emails about her personal life, she says. 
Top Democrats have quietly slammed Clinton for her recklessness and ethical short-cuts, but the FBI leadership decided that she should not be charged with crimes in the run-up to the 2016 election. 
Since that decision was announced, there’s been growing evidence that the FBI and the Department of Justice handcuffed the FBI investigators and granted favorable treatment to Clinton’s staff. 
Now Sperry shows how Justice Department and FBI officials have also declined multiple opportunities to find copies of the missing 33,000 emails that would provide more evidence about whether Clinton was obeying or violating many federal laws: In a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton’s private server revealed that an underling didn’t bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton’s aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress. The Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta “created a ‘vehicle’ to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the ‘vehicle,’ but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.” Unless one of Clinton’s aides had the capability to log in to the PRN server as an administrator and remove a mailbox, her archived mailboxes more than likely still reside somewhere in that system. And they may also materialize on an internal “shared drive” that PRN created to control access to the Clinton email accounts among PRN employees. PRN has been under FBI order to preserve all emails and other evidence since the start of its investigation last year. Clinton’s missing “personal” emails may also be captured on a Google server. According to FBI notes, Combetta “transferred all of the Clinton email content to a personal Google email address he created.” Only the FBI never subpoenaed Google to find out. The FBI documents also reveal that Hillary’s server was mirrored on a cloud server in Pennsylvania maintained by Datto Inc., a tech firm that performs cloud-to-cloud data protection. When PRN contracted with Datto, it requested that Hillary’s server be backed up locally and privately. But the techs forgot to order the private node, and they sent the server backup data “remotely to Datto’s secure cloud and not to a local private node.” The FBI never subpoenaed Datto’s server, either.

Two US soldiers and four Afghan special forces were killed, and three other US soldiers wounded in heavy fighting with the Taliban this morning, as the Taliban attempted to surge into an area around the northern city of Kunduz. As they usually do, the troops called in airstrikes to “break the siege.” 
Instead of breaking the siege, the US warplanes pounded the village of Bouz Kandahari, destroying a number of houses and killing at least 30 civilians . 25 further civilians were wounded in the attack, fueling protests outside the governor’s office in Kunduz. 
NATO conceded immediately that the coalition was behind the airstrikes, but appeared relatively unrepentant about it, insisting all the civilian deaths were because the Taliban were using the houses for “cover,” which of course is not a legal justification for bombing the houses. 
US commander Gen. John Nicholson issued a statement after the incidents, offering condolences to the families of the two US soldiers who were slain. Defense Secretary Ash Carter also said he was “saddened” by the deaths of the US troops, but neither offered much of anything in comments on the dozens of dead civilians.

24953,Limbaugh: ’Women’s March’ at Trump Inauguration Will Be Nothing More Than a ’Golden Shower’ - Breitbart,"Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh dismissed the notion that   Donald Trump’s inauguration would be interfered with because of those there protesting the proceedings.  “That is going to peter out,” Limbaugh replied to the question from a caller. “That’s going to be nothing more than a golden shower.

24956,November 8th: American Spring reaches zenith with Donald Trump Presidency,"Font Size are they doing humankind? Elsewhere, the U.S. State Department operatives were busy little bees. Again through NGO involvement the warmongers set their sights on Ukraine. The bigger prize though was Russia. By launching the Maidan Color Revolution chicken hawks in the U.S. Congress hoped to establish a bridgehead on Russia's very borders; the duplicitous MSM reported this intervention in terms of their own bias; it was vital to stop to 'Russian aggression'. Each step of every day the Kiev coup murderers continued to vilify Russian President Vladimir Putin. Wise to the U.S. 'end game strategy', Crimea, home to the Russian Black Sea Naval fleet at Sevastopol, voted to accede to Russia. East Ukraine was not as fortunate. To this day, despite signing the Minsk II roadmap for peace agreement the Nazi Kiev hordes continue to terrorize Russian speakers in the Donbass region; innocent civilians are killed and maimed each day by prohibited artillery bombardment from Ukraine. Of course, the junta blames Russia for the hostilities. The Obama Administration goes further: it tries to lure President Putin into the fray. The Pentagon crazies chomp at the bit to engage Russia on an open but foreign battlefront. Several new war fronts. It will continue The Establishment was not done yet. With help from the usual suspect NGO's, NATO opened several new war fronts in the Middle East. Syria and its democratically elected President Assad are in their gun sights; tiny Yemen is another potential military target to be exploited by Washington; but the Houthi militia has put up a fierce resistance. Oddly enough ISIS or Daesh is never on America's military radar screens; but when Russia fights the Islamic Terrorists it is headline news. Since a desperate Clinton invoked the Big Daddy, err, Baghdadi name at the third debate, the Mosul Campaign in Northern Iraq has commenced. The biased MSM deny coincidence. No one buys it. Given the chaotic and disjointed foreign policy 'objectives' of this current U.S. Administration and its crooked backers, Republican candidate, Donald Trump was compelled to act; he stepped in. The Donald entered the breach. Using clear logic Donald Trump has enunciated to Americans what needs to be done: change course; turn 180 degrees. Moreover, Trump has identified and charged as incompetent the real culprits behind this disastrous policy. Chief amongst those is Democrat challenger Hillary Clinton. Clinton was the sole advocate for these failed foreign misadventures. And people are going to vote for her? As a former Secretary State, Clinton was the sole advocate for these failed foreign misadventures in the Middle East. While under oath she lied to Congress as to her real motivation: broker arms to 'moderate' rebel groups in Syria. She continues to lie to the American people about Benghazi. During the Commander-in-chief forum, Clinton claimed no Americans were lost in Libya. Clinton though was remiss to mention the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three others. Those four were murdered on her watch. With his legions of supporters massed around the country, Donald Trump is now poised to march on Washington, DC. All of the Establishment stooges are broken. Although they tried mightily the complicit media could not put Humpty-Dumpty-Frumpy candidate Hillary Clinton back together again. She is too far gone; with the help of Wikileaks, the electorate will soon learn more about her scandals and wanton corruption that she keeps hidden. Her feckless campaign is lost. Yes indeed; the one per centers got more than they bargained for; much to their angst. Contempt.... Scorn.... Slight regard.... Defiance! Come Election Day that is 'the movement's' message to the Establishment. American patriots are going for the knockout on November 8th. With President elect Donald Trump's help they will take their country back; make it great again! Montresor",0
24959,Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin Try to Create World Peace,"The Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin said that the political figures vowed to work together to improve U.S.-Russian relations and try to create world peace.
The statement issued by the Kremlin also stated that Trump and Putin discussed settling the crisis in Syria, and combating terrorism. They also agreed that their aides will work together to schedule a direct meeting.
Trump’s office declared in a statement that the Russian leader offered his congratulations before they discussed a range of issues. The numerous items included challenges and threats facing the U.S. and Russia. Strategic economic matters and the U.S.-Russia relationship that began over 200 years ago were also discussed.
After Trump’s triumph last week, the president-elect has received congratulatory calls from an enormous amount of foreign leaders. Putin sent the president-elect a statement concerning his desire to have a discussion based on a clear respect for each other’s political viewpoints.
Trump applauded Putin as an as a robust leader during his campaign. He also said that the two world leaders should collaborate to combat terrorists. The president-elect chiefly mentioned the Islamic State in Syria. He stated that closer relations with Russia would try to create world peace.
The Washington Post reported that the president-elect seemed to dismiss Russia’s responsibility for their annexation of Crimea and their intervention in the Ukraine. The future leader of the U.S. also questioned the relevance of NATO.
Trump and Putin agreed to share a common view in an attempt to ease tension between the U.S. and Russia. They want to unite their efforts against the common enemy and then fight international terrorism and extremism. The Kremlin declared that the two discussed ways to settle the Syrian crisis and create world peace.
The Kremlin added that they talked about ways to build commerce and induce constructive cooperation between the two nations. Next year, the U.S. and Russia will celebrate the 210-year-anniversary of the start of diplomatic relations. Russian officials stated that the date might encourage the progress of a relationship that would satisfy the interest of both countries.
Putin’s government said that Trump is looking forward to having a long-term and resilient relationship with Russia and the nation’s people. Putin stated that he is ready to have a discussion with Washington that it will be based on mutual respect. There will also be no intervention into each other’s affairs.
There will be no intervention into each other’s affairs. The Russian government believes that creating a solid root for bilateral ties is important. This was especially stressed by the rising trade-economic component.
The Kremlin stated that the two nations should return to a state of equally valuable cooperation. Putin said they will attempt to address the concern and try to ease the tension between the two nations and create world peace.

UK Telegraph Cardinal Vincent Nichols said immigrants had been enduring a worsening “atmosphere of fear” in the months since the EU referendum with the members of the public casually voicing hatred in a “self-indulgent” way. (Self-indulgent? I wonder what this French priest would have to say about that?) H e accused politicians of “trading in fear” and said media stories constantly portraying immigration in a negative light were proving “corrosive of our best nature”. In an interview with the BBC , he insisted that increasingly secular British society could learn much from the faith of new arrivals whether Muslims or followers of other religions. “Of course what we have to learn too is from the vibrancy of the Muslim faith that comes here. H e added: “I think the immigration crisis is real and it needs concerted effort to address it,” he said. “It needs to be addressed realistically with resources and proper legislation, but it’s almost impossible to do that in an atmosphere in which fear and hatred are the dominant features. “It does nobody any good, this somewhat self-indulgent way in which people have begun to express themselves and their distaste and their hatred of people who they see as different. “And that is creating a culture of fear among people who have been welcomed here.”",0
24964,Insane Ohio State Fan Blames Kicker for 31-Point Loss to Clemson - Breitbart,"Fans notoriously blame weird and bizarre things for the demise of their favorite sports teams, normally based on superstition or some kind of jinx. [Normally, normal people do not blame the person with the least impact on the game when their team gets blown out by 31 points. Then there’s this particular Ohio State fan.  After Ohio State got shut out in a bowl game on New Year’s Eve, for the first time since 1920, this fan found an unlikely culprit for his team’s blowout loss. He blamed Ohio State’s field goal kicker Tyler Durbin: Stay classy pic. twitter.   —   OSU Specialists (@BuckSpecialists) January 1, 2017,  To recap, Tyler Durbin missed two field goals. Had he made them, they would have resulted in exactly six points. Six points, in a game that Ohio State lost by 31. So how in the world can he be singled out and made responsible for the Buckeye’s loss? Meanwhile, Ohio State Quarterback J. T. Barrett had a QBR of 12. 7 on Saturday night, the Buckeye offensive line consistently gave up sacks when Clemson would only rush three or four players, and, let’s not forget, the Ohio State defense that allowed 470 yards and couldn’t get off the field. Any one of those factors would have had a far greater impact than Durbin, who would have had to kick and make eleven field goals in order to win the game for Ohio State. That’s asking a bit much.

24966,TRUMP CALLS FOR TEACHING ‘PATRIOTISM’ IN SCHOOLS,"Email 

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED THURSDAY PLANS TO SEEK NATIONWIDE CHANGES TO SCHOOL CURRICULA WITH THE GOAL OF “PROMOTING AMERICAN PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM IN AMERICA’S SCHOOLS.” 
“In a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America’s children,” Trump said, speaking at the American Legion’s annual convention in Cincinnati. 
“We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America’s history, its institutions and its heroes, many of whom are with us today,” he told the veterans group. 
The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law“We will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,” Trump said. 
Last year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. 
That sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. 
Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding. 
Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising “any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.”",0
24968,Capitol Police Officer Henry Cabrera Who Stopped Alexandria Shooter Is an Army Veteran,"Special Agent Henry Cabrera, a third Capitol Police officer who helped stop the massacre of GOP congressmen and their staff during baseball practice in Alexandria, VA, on Wednesday, went mostly overlooked. [Media attention primarily focused on hero Capitol Police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were wounded as they fired back at the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson.  But a third police officer, Henry Cabrera, who was also there at the time to protect House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) also helped take down the shooter, but was not wounded. Cabrera appears to be a U. S. Army veteran, according to his Facebook page. His page features a picture of himself in fatigues, and another of an Army platoon at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on Sept. 12, 1994. The unit is the 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment. Asked to confirm whether he is a veteran, Capitol Police Spokeswoman Eva Malecki responded, “We can’t comment any further on an ongoing investigation. ” However, a relative of Cabrera confirmed to Breitbart News that he is a veteran. Cabrera’s name became known to the public after Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa thanked him, Griner, and Bailey at a press conference on Wednesday. “I want to commend Special Agents Crystal Griner, David Bailey, and Henry Cabrera for their heroic and appropriate response in protecting the Members and others today during their practice for the Congressional baseball game,” he said. Cabrera posted on Facebook on Wednesday after the shooting: “Yesterday was   NUTS! !!! Many thanks to those who reached out to me yesterday. I’m proud of my TEAMMATES David Bailey and Crystal Griner. They took care of business! !!!! Prayers for Mr Scalise and his family. ” Supportive comments poured into Cabrera’s page and on Twitter. “Dont sell yourself short man. You are one of the heroes too!” a friend posted. There was a third officer there who should also be recognized. He just wasn’t wounded. Special Agent Henry Cabrera.  —   BAJ (@BarbAnnJ) June 15, 2017,  Why did CBS @CBSThisMorning NOT mention HENRY CABRERA from the Capital Police for his heroic actions??  —   teslaire (@teslaire) June 15, 2017,  Although details are scant, eyewitnesses say the officers took down Hodgkinson, 66, after he opened fire on Republican congressmen and their staff, critically wounding Scalise and lobbyist and former congressional staffer Matt Mika. Bailey, Griner, and an aide to Rep. Roger Williams ( ) Zach Barth, was also wounded. Those who were on the field that day credited the officers for saving their lives. Eyewitnesses said the officers stepped forward, towards the shooter, and saved everyone’s lives. “It could have easily been 25 deaths or more,” Williams said. “The thin blue line held today. And Americans everywhere should be thankful that it’s still the kind of country that produces these heroes. ” “Without the Capitol Police, who literally took a step forward   …     they saved all of us out there. There is no question about it. We had no arms, all we had were bats. And the shooter,” he added. Rep. Brad Wenstrup ( ) an Iraq veteran, said that after Hodgkinson fired at them with a rifle, he came out from behind a building with a pistol. “That’s when security detail was able to take him down,” he told ABC News. “You never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did,” Wenstrup tweeted later. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) who was also there at the scene, said it would have been a “massacre” without the Capitol Police. “I can tell you, that I think with absolute certainty, nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill Police. They saved everybody’s life,” he said. “It would have been a massacre without them. ”",0

24973,NATO Buildup On Russian Border Largest Since Cold War,"Videos NATO Buildup On Russian Border Largest Since Cold War The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A Romanian soldier secures the perimeter around Romanian Air Force F16 fighter jets parked on the runway of the Air Base 86, in Borcea, southern Romania, Friday, Oct. 7, 2016. 
In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. 
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. 
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia’s border. 
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia’s borders as part of a huge military deployment. 
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia’s borders since the Cold War. 
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. 
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. 
“This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday — ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. 
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‘prevent conflict.’ 
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else’s lands. 
“This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia’s) security posture,” Lute said. 
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. 
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. 
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.",0
24976,3 Brit judges attempt to thwart Brexit because their wigs will become too expensive!,"Saturday, 5 November 2016 He is the weirdest wig-wearing, hypocritical wanker since Prince John! 
In an unprecedented, unexpected move to thwart Brexit negotiations and hindering Mrs May triggering article 50, 3 British judges have found a massive loophole! 
It seems as though a hidden law found in the Magna Carta does not allow the British upper-class, royals and members of the legal fraternity wig wearers to purchase their wigs outside of Europe because of the fear of lice and other undesirable bugs hiding in the wigs! 
Prince John, a wig wearer and total nutter, demanded that wigs could only be purchased from renowned German wig-making company, Dummkopf & Co, founded by Herr Dummkopf (logical), whose portfolio of clients includes Nutty King Ludwig, Martin Luther (the white one), Wagner (The Nazi) Goring (He was one too), Mozart, Beethoven, etc, etc! 
The judges have been called ""enemies of the people"" by tabloids spreading their normal, slanderous, scandalous reports. However, the 3 judges are demanding that this ancient law must be implemented otherwise the price of their wigs will become too expensive because of import duty and German rascals pumping up the prices in Euro's as the GB Pound sinks out of trace! 
They are demanding that parliament must stop Brexit negotiations immediately! They have also asked the Scots and Northern Irish to organise referendums so they can eventually purchase their wigs via Edinburgh or Belfast because Scots are determined to stay in Europe even if they have to rebuild Hadrian's Wall! 
Nigel Farage's wig is wearing out rapidly, and being the mega-hypocrite that he is, ordered a new set of wigs from Herr Dummkopf, Made in Germany, before Mrs May eventually plunges the UK into an abyss that they will never get out of! Working class wig wearers don't give a wank because they wear cheap imitations from China and are only interested in cheap booze drying up in Calais! Make Jaggedone's  ",0

24982,New O’Keefe Video: Leftists Planning Stink Bombs at ’Deploraball’,"A new video released Monday by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas shows   activists allegedly planning to use butyric acid bombs  —   commonly known as “stink bombs”  —   to disrupt an event scheduled for the week of Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th President of the United States. [The leftists captured on film were allegedly targeting the Deploraball, a   event being held on Thursday at the National Press Club “to celebrate and honor   …     the passionate citizens who worked social media, knocked on doors, and endured harassement to support” Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.  On Friday, several news outlets reported that a group of   activists from the “D. C.   Coalition,” part of a broader effort called “#DisruptJ20” (for January 20th, the date of the inauguration) had been captured on tape discussing plans to crash the Deplorable, disrupt the parade at the inauguration, and target specific individuals. Now, Project Veritas reveals just how the   #DisruptJ20 activists may have been prepared to go. According to the video, they allegedly planned to place explosive “stink bomb” devices at the party and, if those failed, to trigger the fire sprinkler system, forcing attendees to evacuate outside in cold weather conditions.  One activist is also heard on the video to threaten the city government of Washington, D. C. and the police: The message has to be, we do not recognize the city government either. If you try to close us down we will look for your house, we will burn it. We will physically fight the police if they try to steal one of our places. We will go to war and you will lose. During the campaign, O’Keefe and Project Veritas exposed efforts by the   activists contracted to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to stage protests at Republican events, and to incite violence at Donald Trump’s events in particular. Their goal was to create, in their words, a sense of “anarchy” around the candidate. Now, O’Keefe has apparently revealed further plans to create anarchy and disorder around Trump’s inauguration. And, as he points out in the video, the actions planned by the activists could run afoul of   laws. O’Keefe and Project Veritas say that they shared the results of their investigation with the FBI, the Secret Service, and the D. C. Metro Police. In commenting on the video, O’Keefe concludes: “Just to be clear, we don’t have a problem with people protesting peacefully or voicing their First Amendment rights, that’s protected by the Constitution. But in this case, Disrupt J20 says openly that their plan is to shut down the inauguration. The question is where do these people draw the line. ” The video released Monday is Part One of a continued investigation by Project Veritas, which plans to release other videos later in the week.

Their members also include at least two police officers, though it remains unclear whether they are still on the force.
“The low membership numbers cannot discount the danger that emanates from such organizations,” Left Party politician Monika Renner told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. 
Germany is currently seeing a surge in hate crimes following the acceptance of an estimated one million refugees last year. The Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), Germany’s intelligence agency, recorded 990 hate crimes in 2014, and 1,408 in 2015. 
The BfV also recorded 75 arson attacks on refugee centers in 2015. There were just five such attacks in 2014. © AFP 2016/ Sven Hoppe “One thing is clear – a state under the rule of law can never accept racist violence. We need to do everything we can to quickly catch the perpetrators and rigorously punish them,” German Justice Minister Heiko Maas stated.
Amnesty International has stated that their researchers observed an 87 percent increase in hate crimes between 2013-2015. “With hate crimes on the rise in Germany, long-standing and well-documented shortcomings in the response of law enforcement agencies to racist violence must be addressed,” Marco Perolini, Amnesty International’s European Union researcher, stated . “There are many factors that point to the existence of institutional racism with German law enforcement agencies. This question needs to asked, and it needs to be answered… This is not a time for complacency, but for law enforcement agencies to take a long, hard look in the mirror.” 
The nation has also seen a rise in sexual assault, theft, and rape, especially by people with refugee status. There has been a noticeable uptick since the mass attacks on New Year’s Eve in Cologne. ...",0

24991,Fox News Dropping ’Fair and Balanced’ Slogan - Breitbart,"Fox News is no longer “Fair and Balanced. ”[The cable news channel is reportedly set to drop its    marketing slogan in an effort to distance itself from its former chief Roger Ailes, who invented it when he launched the network in 1996, according to New York magazine.  Instead, staffers at Fox have reportedly been asked to use its other,    slogan: “Most Watched. Most Trusted. ” A source at the network reportedly told New York that the switch “won’t affect programming or editorial decisions. ” The news comes as Fox News continues to move away from the Ailes era under the guidance of Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan. Ailes, the principal architect of Fox who changed the cable news business forever,  resigned from the network last year under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations and died in May at age 77. The network has undergone significant changes in recent weeks following the departure of longtime star anchor Bill O’Reilly, whose O’Reilly Factor was the   cable news program for more than a decade. O’Reilly left the network this year after the New York Times reported that he had paid millions of dollars to settle multiple sexual harassment claims. In his place, Fox News brought on former Crossfire host Tucker Carlson to anchor the 8 p. m. hour and moved its panel show The Five into the 9 p. m. slot. Sean Hannity remained on at 10 p. m. The network remains the   on television, but has come under increasing pressure as MSNBC and its star anchor, Rachel Maddow, have benefitted from critical coverage of President Donald Trump. During one week in May, Fox News dropped to third place in the key demo in primetime behind MSNBC and CNN, the first time that had happened in 17 years.

The United Nations has a long history of insulting, disparaging and attacking Israel. It’s press corps now seems to want to selectively remove Israel from its records. 
On October 16, 2015, the UN Security Council met to discuss the violence in the Middle East. US Ambassador Samantha Power delivered her remarks about her “ deep concern… about the current situation. ” She specifically condemned the violence in “ Jerusalem, the West Bank, Israel and the Gaza Strip. ” However, when the UN media center summarized her remarks, it stated that the US condemned the violence in “ Jerusalem, West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere .” “Elsewhere”? Really? Was writing “Israel” too difficult? Was acknowledging the stabbings and attacks in Israel too controversial? 
When the Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs at the UN, Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, gave an update on the situation, he described the violence in “ the West Bank, Jerusalem and East Jerusalem ,” but the press corps just mentioned a “ deadly week in the West Bank ” removing any mention of Jerusalem. 
Most alarmingly, the Assistant Secretary General welcomed “ Prime Minister Netanyahu’s repeated assurances that Israel has no intentions of changing the historic status quo at the holy sites ,” but the UN media completely omitted the statement in its coverage. As the Temple Mount rumor was the rallying cry for Palestinian extremists to engage in violence, shouldn’t that have been prominently highlighted, not ignored?

24994,PICS: Rioting Continues in France Over Alleged Police Rape,"BOBIGNY (FRANCE) (AFP)  —   Police fired tear gas after clashes erupted in the suburbs of Paris as demonstrators protested over the assault of a young black man who was allegedly anally raped with a truncheon while being arrested. [Surrounded by a heavy police contingent, about 2, 000 protesters, some carrying placards saying “Police rape” and “Police kill innocent people,” gathered in Bobigny, northeast of the French capital, to demand “Justice for Theo”.  Theo, a    black youth worker, required surgery after his arrest on February 2 in the “3, 000” estate in the gritty suburb of    when he claims a police officer sodomised him with a baton. Projectiles were thrown at police on a footbridge with several vehicles torched and windows smashed on the sidelines of the protest, police said. “Several hundred violent and very mobile individuals” committed various “acts of violence and damage,” said the Paris police prefecture. In a statement it listed projectiles thrown against public buildings, four vehicles torched, two shops and a bus station damaged and several bins burned. “The police had to intervene to rescue a young child in a burning vehicle,” the police said, adding however that no injuries had been reported so far during the protest. Two media vehicles were also attacked, with no casualties reported. The demonstration ended in the evening after police fired tear gas. Theo, who is still in hospital, and his family have appealed for calm after several days of protests over the alleged assault. Rape charges have been filed against the officer and all four police involved in Theo’s    have been suspended pending an investigation. With a presidential election this year, the incident has become highly politicised. It has also underscored the breakdown in trust between young people and the authorities in French suburbs. “All the time, we get checks, we get assaulted, they talk trash to us, we say, ‘Shut up’  …     We are given little slaps,” a young man of about 20 named Kenzo told AFP. “I didn’t think it still exists,” said    Anissa. ”How can they say it’s an accident?” Rallies took place in other French cities, including Rouen where some 200 people demonstrated, while around 250 gathered in Toulouse and more than 300 in Nantes.",0
24999,Militarized Police Brutalize and Arrest Peaceful Protesters at Dakota Access Pipeline #NoDAPL,"
As of October 29, there have been at least 141 arrests of peaceful protesters at the Standing Rock Reservation who are attempting to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which poses a major threat to the drinking water of all people at Standing Rock.
Paid for by Energy Transfer Partners , parent company to Dakota Access LLC, the DAPL is set to be embedded in a sacred burial ground at Standing Rock. This is the same area where DAPL security used attack dogs on peaceful people to intimidate protesters. Police snipers were seen peaking out of armored vehicles, aiming directly at unarmed protesters.
These water protectors have been brutalized by officers who are using the color of law to help Dakota Access LLC trample on the the 1851 treaty between the US and the Cheyenne, Sioux, Arapaho, Crow, Assiniboine, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara nations.

Protesters who were arrested had handcuffs or zipties placed fixed to their wrists, they were stuffed into cages made for dogs and over-crowded cells, and they had numbers written on their arms, many of them having been brutally assaulted, tazed or even maced. Women were strip-searched in front of male officers. According to protesters, an elderly woman who had diabetes had blood sugar level of 488, which is dangerously high, and she was given no medical attention; they merely released her to deal with whatever health complications she had completely on her own.
Zip ties were used to bind people’s hands, and a number of protesters reported that these zip ties were tied so tightly around protester’s wrists that their hands were turning purple as a result of reduced blood circulation.
Cars in the area were impounded. Officers had accessed the vehicles, allegedly to search them, but protesters are concerned that officers would be able to plant contraband in order to expand the charges against protesters.
Over the weekend, an anonymous donor gave $173,000 to bail out protesters from jail.

25003,"Internet Mogul Kim Dotcom: More Leaks Coming, “Clinton Is in Serious Trouble”","
The brilliant Internet mogul Kim Dotcom – founder of the file-sharing website Megaupload – said on Monday that there are more Clinton emails that will be published, and the results will be devastating for the Democratic candidate.
There's unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble.
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) November 1, 2016 

There is speculation that Dotcom is referring to the 33,000 missing Clinton emails…and that someone has them (possibly WikiLeaks) and will be releasing them soon.
From The New Zealand Herald :
Dotcom has previously hinted that Wikileaks is in possession of the missing emails, which Clinton acknowledged erasing rather than turning over to the State Department upon her retirement, claiming they were not work-related.
Dotcom last week made a joking reference to the BleachBit software Clinton used to delete the emails, writing “Bleachbit(ch) can’t bleach it.”
Shortly after, he then tweeted directly at Wikileaks writing “Oh no!” with a video of him reacting to audio saying “You’ve got mail.”
And days before on October 27, he wrote that he knew where the deleted emails are and how to get them legally.
“I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump. 100% true. Retweet,” he wrote.
Dotcom pointed out something many have wondered about…
“They are all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah. Congress or Senate can request the emails from the NSA.”
William Binney, architect of NSA mass surveillance system has confirmed that the NSA must have the deleted Clinton emails, by design. @FBI 
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 30, 2016 

I think the FBI has found Clintons deleted emails in NSA spy cloud and now use Wiener laptop as a front to protect NSA secrets. Fine by me 
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 31, 2016 

Last year, Dotcom – who has a long-standing relationship with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange – said that Assange would be Clinton’s worst nightmare in 2016 because he “has access to information.”
The FBI is currently searching a laptop that belonged to Anthony Weiner, Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s estranged husband, for any emails from Clinton’s private server.
Dotcom just might be the most fascinating person on Twitter. Take a look at some other things he’s had to say lately…
Hillary, who signed my extradition request, will get busted by the same mass surveillance system the US Govt used to spy on me unlawfully.

The US Govt keeps underestimating the strength of oppressed people who'll fight for what's right even if it results in their crucifixion.

25008,"Betrügt Ritter Sport? Fleisch in ""Einhorn-Schokolade"" offenbar nur vom Pegasus","Donnerstag, 3. November 2016 Betrügt Ritter Sport? Fleisch in ""Einhorn-Schokolade"" offenbar nur vom Pegasus Waldenbuch (dpo) - Droht uns der nächste große Lebensmittelskandal? Offenbar enthält die derzeit euphorisch bejubelte ""Einhorn-Schokolade"" von Ritter Sport statt echtem Einhorn lediglich billiges Pegasus-Fleisch. Das fand ein Labor für Lebensmittelanalyse in Hamburg heraus. ""Ich war sofort skeptisch, als ich hörte, dass die Firma Ritter Sport Einhorn-Schokolade anbietet"", erklärt Lebensmittelchemiker Udo Wörne. ""Jeder weiß doch, dass Einhörner unglaublich selten sind und Schokolade mit Einhornfleisch wohl kaum für 1,99 Euro pro Tafel angeboten werden kann."" Und tatsächlich: Laboranalysen ergaben, dass in der vermeintlichen Einhorn-Schokolade noch nicht einmal Spuren von Einhorn enthalten sind. Stattdessen besteht das Produkt aus Milchschokolade und mit Lebensmittelfarbe bunt eingefärbtem Pegasusfleisch. Bis auf Kopf, Schweif und Hufe werden fast alle Teile eines Pegasusses verarbeitet. Udo Wörne wundert das wenig: ""Weil Einhorn mit Preisen von bis zu 5.000 Euro pro Kilogramm kaum bezahlbar ist, greifen viele Hersteller auf wesentlich günstigeres Pegasusfleisch zurück."" Die geflügelten Pferde werden meist ähnlich wie Schweine oder Geflügel massenhaft in großen Hallen gehalten, wobei ihnen in regelmäßigen Abständen die Schwungfedern gestutzt werden, um Fluchtversuche zu unterbinden. Einhörner dagegen gelten als äußerst empfindlich und verenden in Gefangenschaft in der Regel innerhalb weniger Wochen jämmerlich. In Produkten, die tatsächlich echtes Einhorn enthalten, sind daher fast immer wilde Einhörner verarbeitet. Diese werden mit Netzen gefangen und dann mit einem sogenannten Einhornhaken aus Metall ausgeweidet. Geschmacklich unterscheiden sich Pegasus und Einhorn gravierend. ""Einhornfleisch ist sehr zart und hat einen leichten Nachgeschmack nach Regenbogen. Pegasus hingegen ist faserig und erinnert geschmacklich an eine Mischung aus Maulesel und Pute."" ssi, dan, fed; Foto oben: Shutterstock/Hersteller, Foto unten: Shutterstock Artikel teilen:",0

25010,Putin: Russia Is Not Going to Attack Anyone,"Claims of Russian Threats 'Simply Stupid' by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
Complaining about Western “hysteria” surrounding repeated predictions of Russian military attacks on NATO member nations, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to resolve two solid years of predictions to that effect with a straightforward assurance that “Russia is not going to attack anyone .” 
Putin accused Western nations of having “mythical, dreamt-up problems,” and insisted the idea that Russia was going to attack the West was “ simply stupid and unrealistic .” He added that he believes the idea is being played up to justify bigger military spending. 
The Russian president also sought to dismiss allegations that he is plotting to rig the US elections to his own benefit, noting that the US is a great power and not some banana republic with an easily manipulated political system. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots. 
NATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border, with ever-growing numbers announced all the time. Such predictions started after the ouster of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine led to a civil war in that country’s east, with NATO military leaders repeatedly predicting Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine into NATO countries.

Gelobeter has since been blocked indefinitely from Wikipedia.  A course description for Gelobter’s course on environmental justice activism at UC Berkeley posted on Wikipedia argued that the first few months of the Trump administration have been uniquely “  sexist, and racist. ” This semester represents a unique moment in history  …    the first few months of a historically unique U. S. President whose agenda has been explicitly   sexist, and racist. This course will use this moment in two ways: • First, as a learning opportunity for students to engage with critical issues as they emerge on the social, economic, policy, and political landscape • Second, to be of service by documenting key developments and creating a neutral source of information about them. The post was ultimately removed, as Wikipedia prevents unsourced negative claims about living people. A Wikipedia editor said that the line about the Trump administration was a “blatant BLP [Biography of Living Person] violation,” which means that commentary on a living person does not come from a “neutral point of view. ” As part of Gelobter’s course, students created Wikipedia articles that advanced an   agenda, containing   critiques of Trump’s EPA policy among others. Wikipedia edit projects are now common in the social justice sectors of academia. Feminists at Oberlin, Bucknell, and Temple University hosted Wikipedia    events during the   academic year. Commenting on this trend, Wikipedia user “Jytdog” argued that academia does not have the right to take over articles for the purpose of education. “Wikipedia is the commons and governed by community policies and guidelines. Just like companies don’t have the right to dump things into public waters, classes don’t have the right to take over space in the commons for classwork. Can you see that?” he wrote.

25015,Global Debt Grows and Central Banks Are Buyers,"The IMF reported last week that global debt hit a record $152 trillion. I’m old enough to remember when a million was a lot, and in the past two decades we have blown right through talking of millions and billions and are now throwing around trillions like its nothing… By Tim Taschler
Much of this debt has been purchased by none other than the big central banks. Sunday, Bloomberg reported that central bank assets have grown at the fastest pace in five years, topping $21 trillion:

The world’s biggest central banks are bulking up their balance sheets this year at the fastest pace since 2011’s European debt crisis to boost lackluster economic recoveries with asset purchases that are supporting stock and bond prices. 
The 10 largest lenders now own assets totaling $21.4 trillion, a 10 percent increase from the end of last year, data collected by Bloomberg show. Their combined holdings grew by 3 percent or less in both 2015 and 2014. 

You might think that with all this zero-rate and negative-rate money sloshing around that liquidity in the markets would not be an issue. But take a look at what happened in the forex markets last week. The British Pound (GBP), which is a major currency and heavily traded, took a 6% dive in less than two minutes. For reference, anyone watching the forex markets knows that a 1-2% move in the currency world is considered a big move, and 6% in two minutes is certainly not expected in something as liquid as the Pound.

The explanations for this move range from the standard “fat thumb” (i.e. someone inadvertently typed some extra zeros onto a sell ticket and swamped the market) to the easy-to-blame algo computers. Regardless of the reason, if there was one other than someone simply dumping a large number of Pounds onto the market, this type of thing shouldn’t really happen with so much liquidity sloshing around. People are certainly becoming complacent with ‘flash’ crashes, as if they are a normal occurrence and nothing to pay any attention to. I disagree. I think it could be a ‘tell’ and something to keep an eye on.
Think about where we are since 2008. The Fed keeps yapping about raising rates and normalization (though they do little other than talk), which has resulted in bond prices lower and interest rates higher. This is going to put enormous pressure on banks, pension funds and anyone else with a large amount of Sovereign bonds. A bond trader friend of mine told me that seeing all these bonds trading above par (i.e. over their face value) is going to lead to a massive problem. If you pay $1,100 for a $1,000 bond, you are only going to get $1,000 at maturity. At some point there will be losses as these bonds are marked back to par ahead of maturity.
Maybe the central bankers will be able to print and talk their way through to some successful outcome without actually raising rates. Or maybe they can have rates rise without causing some major dislocation in more asset classes, whether it be bonds, stocks, forex or commodities. But then again, maybe they can’t and that is why so many large, successful investors such as Soros, Druckenmiller and Buffett are sitting with large allocations of cash. With moves like we had in the Pound last week, it seems that the end game might be drawing near, and people might just want to be a little careful in the construction of their portfolios.

25016,Falcons’ Matt Ryan Is Named M.V.P. of N.F.L. - The New York Times,"HOUSTON  —   Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was named the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player on Saturday, 24 hours before he was to try to cap his superb season with Super Bowl glory. Ryan, 31, got his first M. V. P. Award by collecting 25 of the votes while his opposite number in Sunday’s Super Bowl, the New England Patriots’ Tom Brady, finished with 10. Brady has won the award twice, for the 2007 and 2010 seasons. Ryan’s award came after a dazzling season for Atlanta’s offense in which he finished with 4, 944 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and only seven interceptions. Super Bowl LI on Sunday will be his first appearance in the title game. Brady, who is chasing his fifth Super Bowl victory, finished the season with 3, 554 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and two interceptions but played in four fewer games than Ryan because of his Deflategate suspension. Unsurprisingly, Ryan also picked up the Offensive Player of the Year Award. Ryan had the best season of his career after spending last summer working intensively on his throwing motion at a Los Angeles training camp. He averaged slightly over nine yards per pass, the highest rate ever for a quarterback with more than 400 completions in a season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award went to the Oakland Raiders’ Khalil Mack, whose season included 11 sacks, five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and an interception returned for a touchdown as the Raiders reached the playoffs. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was a surprise pick, ahead of his teammate Ezekiel Elliott, for offensive rookie of the year. Prescott, who played the entire season for Dallas after Tony Romo injured his back in the preseason, drew 28 of 50 votes, beating out Elliott, who finished as the   with 21 votes.

""Ich suche eine abenteuerlustige Frau (20-35), mit der man Pferde stehlen kann"", schrieb der 35-Jährige nach Polizeiangaben wörtlich in sein Profil auf der Datingplattform. Seine Komplizin müsse dabei ""zu jeder Schandtat bereit"" sein. Haben nichts mehr zu befühüühhühhüühühürchten: Pferde ""Das stellt nach unserer Ansicht ganz klar eine Anstiftung zu einer Straftat dar"", erklärt Polizeidirektor Norbert Frieß. Derzeit prüfe man auch, ob sich der mutmaßliche Viehdieb zusätzlich wegen des Versuchs der Bildung einer kriminellen Vereinigung (§ 129 StGB) strafbar gemacht habe. Der Verdächtige hatte offensichtlich klare Vorstellungen von seiner möglichen Komplizin. Sie solle sportlich sein, nicht rauchen und Sonnenuntergänge mögen. ""Kein Wunder: Das Stehlen von Pferden ist ein körperlich sehr forderndes Verbrechen und wird in der Regel nachts durchgeführt"", so Frieß. Das Vorgehen des Verdächtigen scheint eine beliebte Masche zu sein. Allein im zweiten Quartal dieses Jahres konnte die Polizei durch das wachsame Prüfen von Kontaktbörsen und Zeitungsannoncen deutschlandweit über 250 Pferdediebstähle bereits im Planungsstadium vereiteln. Doch auch andere zwielichtige Geschäfte werden oft über Online-Partnerbörsen abgewickelt. So deuten zahlreiche Einträge auf einen regen illegalen Tierhandel hin, bei dem von Mäusen über Tiger, Bären und andere exotische Tiere bis hin zu ""Dreilochstuten"" alles gesucht und angeboten wird. ssi, dan; Idee: gul; Fotos: Shutterstock; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 10.11.15 Artikel teilen:",0
25021,"Donald Trump to leave America for a younger, sexier country","Thursday 10 November 2016 by Davywavy Donald Trump to leave America for a younger, sexier country 
President-elect Donald Trump has already got a much younger, sexier county lined up to replace America in his affections. 
Concerns have already been raised after Trump demanded America enter into a pre-nup before he takes the oath of office. 
Trump, who has already been accused of screwing Mexico when he thinks he can get away with it, defended his roving eye by saying that ‘any President’ would check out hot, available countries and there was nothing wrong with it. 
Trump’s penchant for ‘exotic’ foreign names is well recorded, and the people of Brunei Darussalam are already concerned after he commented on ‘getting his tongue around their name’. 
Meanwhile, members of NATO and the UN have been told to ‘put out or get out’ in what is being interpreted as a direct demand for favours. 
“Look, if Puerto Rico weren’t a protectorate, I’d already be all over them. If I weren’t already their president and, you know, Is that terrible? Is it?”, he told reporters. 
“And the Russian Republic. Daughter of the Soviet Union, sure, but they’re only 23 years old. And they’re big, voluptuous, you might say. That’s pretty sexy, am I right? 
“I wonder if they’ve got a, you know, opening I might fill.” 
North Korea, who are into uniforms and BDSM, have already signalled their willingness to enter into an affair with the President no matter what the consequences for him at home. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",0
25024,"In Bundy Acquittal, Jury Tells Feds: Enough Is Enough","The Bundy brothers and their comrades were clearly guilty. 
They took over the national wildlife refuge, threatened violence if accosted, and wouldn’t let anyone in. 
However, the Portland jury acquitted Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five others of conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. The jury could not reach a verdict on a single count of theft for Ryan Bundy. 
The charges were conspiring to impede federal workers from doing their jobs and that’s exactly what they did. 
But in the end, the jury acquitted them . 
The jury wasn’t dumb, or blackmailed or somehow brainwashed. They were sick and tired. 
Sick and tired of a bureaucracy in Washington that didn’t listen to them. That dictated use of their lands from thousands of miles away with an iron fist. 
It was a classic case of jury nullification : where despite the evidence, the jury is so convinced that the laws are immoral or so wrongly applied that the accused must be set free. 
And so Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan and their five co-defendants were found not guilty. Most of them were set free from the courtroom. Ammon faces charges in Nevada, so he is still being held. 
As the Associated Press reported it, even lawyers for the Bundys were shocked at the verdict: 
“It’s stunning. It’s a stunning victory for the defense,” said Robert Salisbury, attorney for defendant Jeff Banta. “I’m speechless.” 
The U.S Attorney in Oregon, Billy J. Williams, issued a statement defending the decision to bring charges against the seven defendants: “We strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried, and decided by a jury.” 
This is what happens when the American people see an out-of-control Washington bureaucracy: They ignore them. They ignore the law and decide for themselves that no, these people shall be set free. 
While courts are reluctant to inform juries of their right to “nullify,” that’s exactly what they can do. 
Effectively, the jury nullifies a law they believe is either immoral or wrongly applied to the defendant, and that’s what happened here. 
And it bodes well for America. Jury nullification sends a messages to prosecutors and lawmakers about their priorities and about what they see as harassing or abusive prosecutions. 
A professor at the University of Missouri at Kansas City wrote about how important the power of jury nullification really is: 
Juries clearly have the power to nullify; whether they also have the right to nullify is another question. Once a jury returns a verdict of “Not Guilty,” that verdict cannot be questioned by any court and the “double jeopardy” clause of the Constitution prohibits a retrial on the same charge. 
So whether the Bundy’s antics were stupid or dangerous or just plain wrong, it doesn’t matter. The Portland jury found that in this case – the seven defendants were to be set free because in our court system, a jury of their peers felt the government went too far . 
Yes, this is good news for America, for the people, for the rule of law and for the right of the people to object. To say: “ No. We will stand for this no longer.”",0
25026,Egypt: Christian Couple Stabbed to Death on Coptic Christmas Day,"At least three members of the Coptic Christian minority have been killed so far this year in Egypt, including a couple found in their bed with their throats slit on January 6, the traditional Coptic Christmas Day, reports Christian Today, citing World Watch Monitor (WWM). [The couple has been identified by WWM, an organization that covers Christian persecution across the globe, as Gamal Sami, 60, and his wife, Nadia, 48.  While police have cited robbery as the motivation for the deaths, the woman’s brother and the first person to reach the crime scene, Magdy Amin Girgis, has suggested they were murdered because of their faith, noting that nothing had been taken from the couple’s home. Girgis told the Christian organization that he found the couple with their throats cut and “drenched in blood,” still on their bed. WWM notes: The murders followed another deadly attack on a Coptic Christian only three days earlier. Youssef Lamei was murdered in Alexandria on 3 January by an alleged “professional” killer. The attack on the couple bore similarities with Lamei’s murder, according to reports. The main suspects for the double killing are two men known only as Mohammad M and Abd   Q, according to the police. It is understood that the two men did not know their victims. The couple is reportedly from the mainly Christian village of Tukh   near Tala, home to three churches that canceled their Christmas services to mourn the dead. In a recent   the Chronicle Herald from Canada argues that Egypt’s Coptic Christians, who make up an estimated ten percent of the country’s population of nearly 95 million, are facing an increase in violent attacks. A terrorist attack against a Coptic church in the Egyptian capital of Cairo killed at least 25 Christians in December. The Islamic State ( ) took responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, the administration of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   accused the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist group in Egypt and other   countries. Egypt’s Coptic Pope Tawadros II told Egyptian lawmakers in 2016 that there has been at least one attack against Christians per month during the past three years. The Chronicle Herald opinion article points out that law enforcement seldom investigates the crimes. According to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, about 77 incidents of sectarian violence between 2011 and 2016 in Minya province south of Cairo, home to Egypt’s largest Christian community, have occurred. Egyptian Coptic Pope Tawadros has accused media outlets of reporting false news about the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Egypt. “Egypt is not the best society in the world, but both its people and its leadership are trying to become the best society,” declared the pope. Nevertheless, the Chronicle Herald opines, “Increasingly, Egyptian Christians are speaking out against the government, ignoring the wishes of the church.",0
25030,"Disney under Investigation for H-1B Abuse, Say Feds","The Walt Disney Company and other employers regularly utilizing the   visa program are under investigation for alleged abuse, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter to Congress. [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acting director James McCament wrote in a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) that there are “multiple investigations” of employers who use the   visa.  Every year, more than 100, 000 foreign workers are brought to the U. S. on the   visa. Most recently, that number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands annually, as universities and   are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U. S. through the visa, Americans are often replaced. Among those being investigated, USCIS confirmed, are Disney, Eversource Energy —  formerly Northeast Utilites —  and the University of California San Francisco. “U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has participated in multiple investigations regarding the possible misuse of the   visa program by employers  …    ” McCament wrote in the letter. Northeast Utilities was most recently called out for their mass   of Americans who were subsequently forced to train their foreign replacements. Fired tech worker Craig Diangelo announced to Breitbart Texas that he would be running for Congress in Connecticut’s Fifth District as a result. Diangelo said in 2013, he was working at Eversource Energy, when suddenly the company partnered with Infosys and Tata Consulting Service to replace at least 220 Americans with Indian nationals coming to the U. S. through the  . Meanwhile, the Disney corporation laid off nearly 250 American IT staff and replaced them with   laborers, leading 30 of those laid off to file a discrimination lawsuit, as Breitbart Tech reported. This year, the University of California San Francisco was hit with a lawsuit by replaced Americans after firing 50   and 30 contractors, outsourcing their jobs through   HCL, Breitbart Tech reported. USCIS’ letter to Grassley also noted that in accordance with President Donald Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” Executive Order, the agency would “propose new rules and issue new guidance relating the   visa program. ” “In particular, in accordance with the Executive Order, the proposed new rules and guidance would seek to supersede or revise previous rules and guidance in ways that would protect the interests of U. S. workers, including through the prevention of fraud and abuse,” the letter stated. The Trump Administration, in recent months, has increased pressure on outsourcing firms and   employers. In April, a White House briefing statement called out, as Breitbart Texas reported, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Cognizant —  all of which are responsible for the mass replacement of Americans at companies like Carnival Corporation and MassMutual Life Insurance. “And you’ve seen some of these   examples where you have career employees at a company who have been working there for 10, 20 years, and then they get laid off and they hire a contracting firm using H1B workers at much less pay,” the statement said. “And again, this is an issue that labor unions have called attention to for a long time. ” John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

25035,Receipt Found On One of the Men on José Fernández's Boat Shakes Up the Idea That Alcohol 'Wasn't a Factor’,"Share on Twitter 
It's been just over one month since José Fernández and two of his friends, Emilio Jesus Macias and Eduardo Rivero, passed away in a boating accident during the early morning hours of September 25th. 
According to reports , Fernández's boat was traveling at high speeds when it hit a jetty. Image Credit: Manny Hernandez/Getty Images 
While initial reports indicated that alcohol was not a factor in the crash, it is now believed that the men were drinking the night of the accident. 
As the Miami Herald reports, the search warrant affidavit suggests that the diver could smell a “heavy” alcohol odor on Fernández and his friends. 
The last known picture taken of Fernández the night he died was outside the dockside bar American Social. Managers of the bar confirmed that Fernández and his two friends were there, but it's unknown if the men were drinking. 
The affidavit says that the driver of the vessel was driving with “recklessness” that was “exacerbated by the consumption of alcohol,” according to the Herald. And while toxicology reports have been completed, the report has not yet been released by investigators. Breaking: Jose Fernandez, companions had strong odor of alcohol after fatal crash https://t.co/KLmreMpv3n pic.twitter.com/BfcpBaXmAv — Miami Herald (@MiamiHerald) October 26, 2016 
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) says that it found a receipt for alcohol in one of the victims' pockets that was stamped the same date as the accident. The Miami Herald reported that the affidavit also states that the associate medical examiner who conducted the autopsies shows that all three men had water in the lungs and trauma consistent with a boat crash. 
The exact cause of death, however, was not mentioned. 
It also hasn't yet been confirmed who was driving the boat. Speaking with the Miami Herald, FWC spokesperson Lorenzo Veloz, says that he had been on Fernández’s boat “several times, but that Fernández had not been captain;” it's unknown how much experience Fernandez had captaining the boat. 
The affidavit states that the crimes being investigating are Boating Homicide While Intoxicated and Vessel Homicide. However, because all three men who were on the boat are deceased, it is unclear against whom charges could be brought. It is also unclear whether civil charges will be brought.

Hopefully, now that more information regarding the accident has been made available, the families, friends, and fans of the men on the boat can start finding closure. 
According to the United States Coast Guard's recreational boating statistics , in 2014 there were over 4,000 boating accidents. Over 11 percent of those accidents occurred in Florida, and alcohol was the reason behind over 250 of the accidents. 
Fernández was seen as the future of major league baseball. At just 24 years old, Fernández had 76 career starts during his three years with the Miami Marlins, striking out over 500 of his opponents. He was well on his way to becoming one of the greats.

Trump promised something that NO DEMOCRAT has cared enough to attempt, in decades. Our next President proposed and detailed a critically important ""NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA"". Story: www.nbcnews.com... It's a damn shame that Barack Hussein Obama completely ignored the/his Black community after receiving their votes. Now, Hillary Clinton is following in his footsteps.. She's blindly assuming that because she's a Democrat, and was endorsed by Barack Obama, the African American community will ""fall in line"" like good little mindless minions, and cast their 16 million votes for her, like they did for Obama in 2012. This cycle, open-minded Black Americans who refuse to be FOOLED AGAIN, are indeed going to give Donald Trump a try. As you can see from this video of boxing promoter DON KING introducing Donald Trump to a church filled with Black ministers and community leaders in Ohio last month, important segments of the community are tired of being lied to, screwed by, and ignored by, DEMOCRATS that they voted for! Don King Introduces Donald Trump (C-Span Video): www.youtube.com... For obvious reasons, the ""old guard"" community leaders like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, along with the NAACP, are not in Donald Trump's corner. But what's most telling, is that they are not out there at rallies raising Hillary's arm to roaring crowds of supporters either. Probably because they know Hillary is lying when she exclaims, ""I ain't in no ways ever tired of fightin for youuu!"" in Black churches. In 30 years, she's done NOTHING for no one except herself, Chelsea, and Saudi Arabian women abusers. -CareWeMust",0
25042,Un exorcista presentará la nueva temporada de “Hermano Mayor”,"Un exorcista presentará la nueva temporada de “Hermano Mayor” EL PADRE CARRASCO LIDIARÁ CON ADOLESCENTES CONFLICTIVOS ""CON UNA BUENA HOSTIA A TIEMPO"" televisión 
El padre Carrasco, párroco en una iglesia de Ourense, sustituirá al exboxeador Jero García al frente del programa “Hermano Mayor”, en el que un experto lidia con adolescentes conflictivos. Así lo anunciaba Toribio Vallés, director de programación de Cuatro, en rueda de prensa. La cadena de Mediaset cree que Carrasco es la persona adecuada por su perfil “conciliador, sereno y acostumbrado al trato con criaturas diabólicas”. 
El cura confesó que la llamada de Cuatro le sorprendió más que la de Cristo. “El de exorcista es un trabajo con poca visibilidad”, ha admitido. “Que tu cliente te vomite y te insulte no es plato de buen gusto para nadie, pero también tiene cosas bonitas: conoces gente, ayudas a familias desesperadas y puedes practicar lenguas muertas, como el arameo, el latín o el bable”. Carrasco ha explicado el caso de “el demoniu cabreau”, en el que una señora fue poseída por un diablo asturiano y acabó siendo alcaldesa en su aldea por el Partido Popular. 
La temporada de “Hermano Mayor” ya está en proceso de grabación. Según adelanta Vallés, los casos son más espectaculares que otros años. “El padre Carrasco visita a una adolescente que no estudia, es muy respondona y gira la cabeza 350 grados”, ha explicado. “Técnicamente no es una posesión, le faltan diez grados para serlo, pero el procedimiento es similar: agua bendita y el cuerpo de Cristo”, precisa. El cura ha defendido que “lo mejor en estos casos es una buena hostia a tiempo”. 
Carrasco se inició en el mundo del exorcismo viendo tutoriales de YouTube. “Las primeras expulsiones del demonio las realicé en vacas que hay en la granja de mis padres”, ha relatado. Poco a poco fue perfeccionando la técnica, primero con primates, luego con pelirrojos y finalmente con personas. 
Los responsables del programa han aprovechado la cobertura mediática para hacer una llamada a la población: “Si tenéis un hijo rebelde, que usa expresiones como ‘coworking’, ‘CEO’ o ‘Voy a montar una startup’, poneos en contacto con nosotros. Quizá aún estemos a tiempo de salvar su alma”.",0

Hillary Clinton began conducting focus groups and polling swing state voters as early as December 2014 to figure out how to brand herself and find a “rationale” for running for president. 
Nearly two years before the election, Clinton’s team circulated a timeline of research objectives for which the nascent campaign would spend $2 million on focus groups and surveys, according to recently released hacked emails. 
A “fundamental question” was how to brand Hillary as either “Badass/hip,” or a “Grandma.” 
“Attached is an updated summary of the research process and a budget,” Robby Mook, who would become Clinton’s campaign manager, emailed on Dec. 8, 2014. “I want to emphasize that THIS *WILL* CHANGE because the team will have better ideas on methodology and the strategy will evolve as the project progresses.”

25048,How to Get a Good Deal on Flight Upgrades - The New York Times,"For   travelers, flying business or first class is increasingly within the realm of possibility. Prices for these seats are lower than in the past, said George Hobica, the founder of the air travel advice site airfarewatchdog. com. “Airlines used to upgrade passengers to first or business class for free,” he said, “but they’ve stopped doing that and are instead making these tickets more affordable and attainable. ” Here, he shares his tips on how to snag a seat in these premium cabins without paying premium prices. BUY DIRECT The airlines themselves, as opposed to   airfare ticket sites such as Expedia. com, usually have the best prices for their   and   tickets, Mr. Hobica said. The lowest rates in these classes tend to be nonrefundable. So when searching for fares on an airline’s site, find the cheapest options by searching for a nonrefundable   or   seat. Also, know that carriers often have fare sales for these cabins in the summer and over the December holiday season, when fewer business travelers are flying. Find out about these sales by signing up for an airline’s  . One example for this year: British Airways has Thanksgiving and Christmas specials where passengers can buy tickets in first class or Club World, the carrier’s   equivalent, to London from some cities in the United States starting at $2, 038. FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL USE A CONSOLIDATOR Airline ticket consolidators buy in bulk from airlines and sell them to consumers for a discount. It is even possible to find these fares for   travel. Mr. Hobica said he frequently buys tickets through consolidators to fly to Europe during the peak summer season for prices equivalent to or within a few hundred dollars of an economy ticket on the same flight. However, be aware that you might not earn frequent flier miles through a consolidator ticket, and the ticket may be nonchangeable. PlanetAmex. com and InternationalTravelSystems. com are both reputable consolidators. TRY A LOCAL TRAVEL AGENT That    travel agency in your town could have access to consolidator fares, Mr. Hobica said. Though many travel agencies can no longer get you discounted airfare, there are some who can, he said, and it’s always worth calling or stopping in to find out. UPGRADE WITH MILES Airlines sometimes offer to upgrade your economy ticket for a nominal fee combined with frequent flier miles (usually with 15, 000 to 20, 000 miles each way for travel within the United States and at least 40, 000 miles one way for international travel).

It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. by Geoffrey Grider November 7, 2016 Hillary Clinton’s campaign has called off its planned election night fireworks display, it emerged Monday, the day before America goes to the polls. Staffers were going to put on a two-minute show over the Hudson River after the results come in on Tuesday, but the proposal has been canned, TMZ reported on Monday. The campaign called the Coast Guard last week to tell them the event was off, three days after the New York Post reported it was planning the bash – although the cancellation was secret until Monday. It emerged as fresh projections of the electoral college showed she has lost the iron grip pollsters believed she had on the 270 college votes needed for victory. CNN has moved Ohio, Utah and one district of Maine from toss-up to leaning Republican, and New Hampshire from leaning Democratic to toss-up. That changes the math significantly for Clinton, putting her projected total at 268 and Trump’s at 204 – with the rest of the votes to be fought over. 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Hillary Clinton: Until now she had been above 270. Fox News has changed its projection too, making Utah and North Carolina toss-ups, rather than leaning towards Clinton, while Arizona and Iowa move to leaning Republican. And a series of other measures pointed to a far tighter race than some pundits had predicted. In Florida, early voting figures obtained by the Drudge Report suggested Trump was doing better than Mitt Romney, and Hillary Clinton was under-performing Barack Obama in 2012. Similarly, Drudge reported that North Carolina had seen Trump exceed early voting expectations. The figures showed Trump behind be 305,000 when Romney was behind by 447,000 – a deficit which he still won the state from. The cancellation of the fireworks emerged three days after FBI director James Comey told Congress his agency was investigating a trove of emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The cancellation was made Thursday – before Comey wrote again to Congress to say that the FBI had not found anything to justify changing its verdict of no charges to the Democrat about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Still, Clinton’s campaign suffered collateral damage in the nine days which elapsed between the letters. source

25051,"AT&T Buying Time Warner: If Approved, Assures Greater Scoundrel Media Consolidation Than Already","in: Corporate Takeover , Economy & Business , Science & Technology , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Six corporate giants control most media and related content Americans consume. Comcast, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner dominate US broadcast and cable television news, entertainment and sports, movie and TV production, theme parks, record labels, publishing, and for-profit online operations. On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported telecommunications giant AT&T and Time Warner agreeing to merge. Approval, if granted, would likely assure greater consolidation in both industries – benefitting corporate predators at the expense of the vast majority of consumers, giving them less choice than already, ensuring higher prices for poorer service. Hillary is a Wall Street, war profiteers, corporate predators tool, virtually certain to support this outrageous deal – likely to get FCC and Justice Department approval on her watch. Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Trump called the proposed deal another example of too few sources disseminating information to Americans, warning of “too much concentration of power,” manipulating people, telling them how to think. As president, if elected, he vowed to oppose it. He’s against jobs-killing TPP, NAFTA and similar deals. “Our jobs are fleeing the country,” he said. “They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries.” Hillary calls TPP the “gold standard in trade agreements,” sure to approve what Trump opposes. He calls friendly relations with Russia a good thing, praising Putin as “a leader…far more than our president has been,” saying “(i)f we have a (normal) relationship with Russia, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could work together on it and knock the hell out of ISIS.” Hillary’s rage for endless wars to eliminate all sovereign independent governments risks nuclear confrontation with Russia, China and Iran on her watch. Trump is no peacenik, no paragon of virtue, yet he’s on the right side of vital issues discussed above. Hillary should terrify everyone – on the wrong side of virtually everything mattering most, the most ruthlessly dangerous choice for president in US history. Submit your review",0
25052,Flashback - Reports: Obama Campaign Opened Back Channel to Iran - Breitbart,"TEL AVIV  —   Amid reports that President Trump’s    and senior adviser Jared Kushner allegedly talked with Russia’s envoy to the U. S. about setting up a back channel for communications, it may be instructive to recall that representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign reportedly established a back channel with Iran. [The Washington Post, which broke the story about Kushner, cited communications from Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak to Moscow allegedly intercepted by U. S. intelligence officials. Russian diplomats are known to deliberately place misinformation in communications they believe are being monitored, the Post noted, allowing for the possibility that Kushner never actually asked for a back channel.  ABC News quoted two sources as saying the purported back channel that Kushner and Kislyak were allegedly discussing was supposed to focus on policy issues, including the war in Syria where Russia is highly influential. In August 2014, Michael Ledeen, a former consultant to the National Security Council and U. S. Defense Department, penned a column at PJ Media stating Obama opened a   to Iran during the 2008 presidential campaign. Ledeen said the back channel went through retired Ambassador William G. Miller, who also led the 1979 negotiating mission during the Iran hostage crisis. Ladeen wrote that Miller confirmed his   involvement to him. Ledeen wrote: (emphasis added by this reporter) The actual strategy is detente first, and then a full alliance with Iran throughout the Middle East and North Africa. It has been on display since before the beginning of the Obama administration. During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies. The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah’s rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

25054,Pentagon Wastes Nearly $60Bln in Canceled Weapons Over Past 20 Years,"Pentagon spent $58.3 billion since 1997 for development weapon systems programs, which have been later canceled, according to report. The US Department of Defense has spent $58.3 billion over the past two decades for development weapon systems programs, which have been later canceled, a recent Pentagon’s report said.
Since 1997, the US Department of Defense has canceled 23 military programs, which were initially funded, the report issued on Tuesday by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics claimed.
“Almost 44 percent of those dollars are in two programs: Future Combat System (FCS; $20.7 billion) and the RAH — 66 Comanche reconnaissance/attack helicopter ($9.8 billion). Eight canceled programs spent at least 100 percent of their original RDT&E [Research Development Test and Evaluation] baseline, including Comanche (but not FCS). On average, about two-thirds to three-fourths of the original RDT&E baselines were spent before these programs were canceled,” the report reads.
According to the authors of the report, not all the spent money should be considered wasted, because, despite the cancellation of a program, newly developed technologies can be used in creation of other weapons systems.

25055,2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election,"Store 2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election Unearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win' Observer   
On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton’s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is “rigged.” 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).",0
25058,Kristen Griest on Course to Become First Female Army Officer Trained to Lead Troops Into Combat - The New York Times,"Capt. Kristen Griest was among the first women to ever graduate from the Army’s elite Ranger school, and after Thursday, she will become the first woman able to lead an infantry unit into combat. Her graduation from the Maneuver Captains Career Course at Fort Benning, Ga. qualifies her for duty as an infantry officer after being approved for infantry duty earlier this week. She is joining a branch of the Army that had long been considered the last bastion of traditionally male combat roles, and with the move, the Army has crossed another barrier in its promise to consider women for all roles without exception. “She’s going to go on and serve the rest of her career, however long it may be, as an infantry officer,” Lt. Col. Jerry Pionk, an Army spokesman, said on Thursday. “Her road is far from done it is just more in line with what she feels her aspirations are. ” Unofficially, women had served on the deadly front line for years, but they were barred from direct combat in roles such as tank or infantry officer until December 2015, when Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter announced that the Pentagon would allow women in all military roles, with no exceptions, opening up about 220, 000 military jobs. “They’ll be allowed to drive tanks, fire mortars and lead infantry soldiers into combat,” Mr. Carter said. “They’ll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers and everything else that was previously open only to men. ” Colonel Pionk stressed that the Army was being “deliberate and methodical” during a “major cultural shift” in opening roles to women, and that Captain Griest was evaluated by the same standards as a male officer requesting a transfer. “This isn’t really about putting women into infantry and armor branches,” he said. “We are at a time and a place in the world where we need to have the best leaders from everywhere, and that includes women. ” Still, the option for Captain Griest to move into her current role was not available as recently as last summer, when she made history along with First Lt. Shaye Haver by graduating from the grueling Ranger school. Both women said that they had not received any special treatment. “I do hope that with our performance in Ranger school we’ve been able to inform that decision as to what they can expect from women in the military,” Captain Griest told reporters after her graduation. “We can handle things physically and mentally on the same level as men. ” As Captain Griest moves forward in her career, the Army is creating a path forward for younger female cadets who want to be trained to lead in branches that were previously unavailable. This spring, 13 female cadets were approved to enter armor, and nine were approved for infantry, Colonel Pionk said. “We’re at the point where we’re now starting to branch women who want to go,” he added.",0

25064,Goldman Sachs: America Must Elect Hillary Clinton,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News , US // 2 Comments 
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has broken his silence and endorsed Hillary Clinton as Wall Street’s preferred candidate. 
In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zacharia, Blankfein said that although he had previously declared he would not endorse a candidate, the situation is now critical and Hillary Clinton must be elected. 
“ I certainly, yes, I do — yes, so flat out, yes, I do ,” Blankfein said when asked whether he supports and admires Clinton. 
As was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her real position on financial regulation. 
In essence, Hillary told the banksters she would let them set their own rules and regulations because “ the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. “ 
Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders’ success in the primaries. But you can completely dismiss anything she has said in public. Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton admitted to the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that “ you need both a public and a private position. ” 
Hillary Clinton’s private position has been exposed. She is the Wall Street candidate promising them the ability to set their own rules. Now, unsurprisingly, they have endorsed her. 
On October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for “ political reasons ” because Congress needed to “ look like ” it was doing something about the crisis. 
Behind closed doors, she assured the bankers she was on their side, saying,“ There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. ” 
Music to Wall Street’s ears 
“ I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they’re scared of regulations, they’re scared of the other shoe dropping, they’re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth, ” Clinton said. “ So people are, you know, a little — they’re still uncertain, and they’re uncertain both because they don’t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they’re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we’re only beginning to take hold of. ” 
For Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. 
Considering the pay-for-play environment in the Clinton world, the real question is: what do Blankfein and Goldman Sachs want in return and what is Clinton’s private position on giving it to them?",0
25065,Putin’s latest warning to the West sees him deploy his SUPER-STEALTH submarines,"By wmw_admin on October 28, 2016 Joe Barnes — Daily Express.com Oct 27, 2016 The Veliky Novgorod ready to launch. Click to enlarge 
The Veliky Novgorod is the latest addition to Russia’s Black Sea fleet which is capable of striking land, sea and underwater targets, and follows other significant movements by the Russian navy. 
The diesel-electric vessel, which sports advanced stealth technologies and increased combat range was officially launched in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. 
Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy Vice-Admiral Aleksandr Fedotenkov and Admiralty Shipyard CEO Alexander Buzakov were in attendance at the official flag-raising ceremony before the vessels moved to the Black Sea for operation. 
Earlier this month, Mr Buzakov said that another Varshavyanka-class submarine, the Kolpino, would be launched in November. 
He said: “The state of tests of the fifth submarine, the Veliky Novgorod, were successfully completed and on October 25 it will be handed over to the Black Sea Fleet. 
“The transfer of the sixth submarine, the Kolpino, is underway, scheduled to be completed on November 25.” 
The submarines are designed for anti-ship and anti-submarine operations in mid-depth waters, are capable of holding a crew of 52, have a top underwater speed of 20 knots and a cruising range of 4000 miles. 
They can stay submerged for 45 days and are armed with 18 torpedoes and high surface-to-air missiles and will join Russian efforts to defeat ISIS in Syria. 
Russian President Putin has also bolstered his warship fleet in the Baltic sea by arming them with long-range missiles which are capable of striking Europe. 
Two ships, traveling through the Mediterranean in the fleet of five, were thought to be remaining in the sea, where they were due to refueling in Spain before making their way towards Syria. 
But instead, the two ships have moved through the North Sea, passing through the Great Belt around Denmark and into the Baltic Sea. 
It is believed the ships are on their way to Russia’s Baltic enclave Kaliningrad, which has recently had scores of missiles deployed to the area. 
A source told Russian media: “With the appearance of two small missile ships armed with the Kalibr cruise missiles the Fleet’s potential targeting range will be significantly expanded in the norther European military theatre.” 
Nato has stepped up its plans to deploy thousands more troops to the Russian border as President Putin continues to increase his nation’s preparation for war. 
The global alliance will use its meeting with European Union officials to launch an aggressive push to implement troops in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
An agreement – signed at a Nato summit in Warsaw in July – will see as many as 4,000 soldiers stationed close to the Russian border in case Moscow launches all out war.",0
25067,Fallout From FBI’s New Criminal Investigation Has Already Begun,"Pinterest 
The FBI is reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email case. 
The news came while Clinton was without WiFi on a flight to an Iowa campaign stop, so while reporters hurled questions at her upon landing, all Clinton could muster was the old smile-and-wave. 
Later, after collecting her thoughts, Clinton faced national reporters eager to hear her reaction and declared that the FBI needs to explain their behavior against her. 
“We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national elections of our lifetimes,” Clinton said . “Voting is already underway in our country. So the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.” 
Like so many others who’ve jumped to defend her after FBI Director James Comey announced there would be an investigation into newly uncovered emails, Clinton claimed that the FBI should have kept their mouths shut until after the election. 
There’s an election going on, after all. 
And Clinton thinks it’s “perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes” because she thinks her opponent isn’t fit to lead. 
If the FBI investigates her, they’re disturbing the nation. They’re disrupting the election. While many voters believe candidates for president ought to be held to the same standards as anyone else, and the truth can only help Americans make the right decision in the polls, Clinton thinks the FBI was wrong to announce the latest uncover to the public. 
Typical of someone who has so much to lose for having done so much wrong. 
Perhaps her continual insistence that she is above the law for one reason or another is why there’s been so much backlash already. 
Independent Journal Review reports: 
In Wisconsin and Minnesota , there are already reports of voters coming back to their polling offices to change their votes. And in Maine, the Secretary of State has allowed voters the option of switching votes in past elections. 
The fallout could be intense, as the polls have tightened dramatically in recent days. Tracking the same ABC/WaPo poll that had Hillary Clinton up four points earlier this week shows them within just two points on Saturday: 
It’s clear that Clinton is rapidly losing supporters as the election draws near, while Trump is gaining. 
If Clinton believes that being a presidential candidate in a close election should excuse her from investigation, what will she think her role as president would grant her? 
If current trends continue, she might not get that chance. 
Independent Journal Review continues: 
The national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics have the spread at 3.8 points. The battleground states of Florida , Arizona , and North Carolina are down to thin margins for Hillary Clinton, and Trump has the lead in Iowa , Georgia , and Ohio . Trump still trails by a significant, but not insurmountable, margin in Pennsylvania and Virginia .

Как сообщает Associated Press, жительница города Модесто в Калифорнии Дебора Джаннекини длительное время пользовалась детской присыпкой Johnson & Johnson. В 2012 году врачи обнаружили у нее рак яичников. 
Как заявил адвокат истца Джим Ондер, суд в очередной раз подтвердили необходимость компании Johnson & Johnson предупреждать людей о риске развития рака яичников в связи с использованием этого продукта. 
Однако представители компании отрицают данный факт и собираются обжаловать вердикт. 
""Мы очень сочувствуем этой женщине и семьям, пострадавшим от рака яичников. Мы намерены обжаловать сегодняшний вердикт, потому что руководствуемся наукой, которая подтверждает безопасность присыпки Johnson's Baby"", — сообщила представительница компании Кэрол Гудрич. 
Напомним, это уже не первый подобный случай. В феврале Pravda.Ru сообщала , что американский суд обязал крупного производителя косметических товаров Johnson & Johnson выплатить $72 миллионов родственникам женщины, скончавшейся от рака. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, суд в Миссури вынес такое решение в деле Жаклин Фокс, которая скончалась от рака яичников в октябре 2015 года в возрасте 62 лет. Родственники утверждали, что болезнь развилась у женщины после того, как она в течение более 35 лет регулярно пользовалась продукцией американской компании, в том числе средствами для интимной гигиены и детской присыпкой. 
Соответственно, жюри присяжных признало конгломерат виновным в мошенничестве и сокрытии информации о том, что его продукция может нанести непоправимый вред здоровью. В Johnson & Johnson заявили, что разочарованы вердиктом, однако не уточнили, будет ли компания обжаловать решение суда. 
Компания Johnson & Johnson, основанная в 1886 году, является одним из крупнейших в мире производителей косметических и санитарно-гигиенических товаров и медицинского оборудования. Занимает 37-е место в списке Fortune 500, куда включаются самые крупные компании США по версии американского журнала Fortune. 
Ранее фармацевтическое подразделение компании Johnson & Johnson выплатило штраф в размере 2,2 миллиарда долларов за рекламу без одобрения властей США сильнодействующих психиатрических препаратов для использования детьми, пожилыми людьми и инвалидами.

25070,CNN Drops Kathy Griffin after Trump ’Beheading’ Photo,"CNN has terminated its relationship with Kathy Griffin after the comedian posed for a photograph while holding a fake, bloodied decapitated head meant to resemble the head of President Donald Trump. [“CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year’s Eve program,” the network’s communications department tweeted Wednesday morning.  CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year’s Eve program.  —   CNN Communications (@CNNPR) May 31, 2017,  Griffin had   CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live broadcast each January since 2007 alongside the network’s lead anchor, Anderson Cooper. Cooper took to Twitter late Tuesday night to say he was “appalled” by his  ’s photo. “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,” the Anderson Cooper 360 host wrote. “It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate. ” The shocking photograph, first published by TMZ Tuesday morning, was taken during a photo shoot conducted by the    My Life on the   comedian and Los   artist and photographer Tyler Shields, who is reportedly known for his provocative work. The photo caused a firestorm online, where it quickly circulated and led to calls for a boycott of Griffin’s work, including her current   comedy tour. The comedian apologized in a brief video posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, saying she had “crossed the line” and that the image had gone “too far. ” CNN’s termination of its relationship with Griffin is the latest in the continuing fallout over the image. On Wednesday, ADT  —   the largest home security company in North America  —   announced it would pull its advertising from CNN over the photo, while the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque, New Mexico announced it had cancelled Griffin’s upcoming performance, which had been scheduled for June 16. The U. S. Secret Service is also reportedly investigating the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump responded to the image Wednesday, with the president saying in a message on his Twitter account that the photograph and its resultant coverage has been particularly hard on his    son, Barron. The First Lady called the photograph “very disturbing” and “simply wrong” in a separate statement.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
25071,Transformational New Moon in Scorpio [Video],"Leave a reply 
Joseph P Anthony – November 2016 starts on a pretty similar note to that of the previous month except there is feeling of change in the air, that’s because last month’s New Moon in Scorpio marks another momentous crossroads for humanity. 
The sign Scorpio rules death, as well as transformation. Its ruler is Pluto, the Greek god of the Underworld, the terrain of the “unconscious”. What needs to die this month before it can be reborn? Scorpio is the only astrological sign that has three symbols- the Scorpion (physical), the Eagle (psychological) and the Phoenix (spiritual) – showing that there are three levels of transformation to be achieved before true metamorphosis can occur. 
Unfortunately, the mood in November isn’t peaceful at all, not only do we have the presidential election show here in the US, but because we also have Venus and Mars switching signs along with a strong alignment between Jupiter, Pluto and Venus towards the end of the month. As we start off November we have action-oriented Mars still in Capricorn until the November 8th, in the same sign as Pluto and in a deplorable lack of understanding with Jupiter from Libra and Uranus from Aries. But the exact aspects have already been perfected, so the frequency of accidents or violence generated by this combo should be somewhat diminished. 
The Full Moon this month will occur in the steadfast sign of Taurus on November 14th. This Taurus lunation serves to calm us down and take a load off. Why rush, why fuss, why push, why pull? Taurus wants us to take a chill pill, man. Full moons tend to be emotional, but a Taurus full moon tends to be calmer. Emotionally, Taurus tends to not get riled up the same way that other signs can. So take it easy, and don’t stress the small stuff. Kick back, and let things happen in their own time and way. 
Taurus rules our finances, so this Full Moon we see some issues having to do with money in general such as stock market going up or down, or tackling financial issues and finding resolutions on a personal level. We can see this with individuals, groups, corporations, governments. We can see smart financial moves rewarded, and financial recklessness punished. We may find ourselves more indulgent during this lunation since Taurus does love food, drink and sensual activities, so if you’re trying to be good, remember; moderation! 
Have a good month friends ! Joseph P. Anthony SF Source Joseph P Anthony Oct. 2016 Share this:",0
25074,Former Clinton Foundation CEO begging Russia for ‘urgent and immediate’ asylum?,"Print 
Some of the emails that have come to the public’s attention via WikiLeaks are out-and-out bombshells , while other chains are so fragmented and enigmatic that an understanding of what they portend requires reconstruction and some guesswork. 
One that fits the latter category centers on an exchange between Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta and Neera Tanden, of the hard-left Center for American Progress , concerning an apparent leak that needed — shall we say? — plugging? 
The original email was from Tanden to Podesta, dated March 8, 2015 and time-stamped 4:49 p.m. Here’s the message: 
Ron Fournier is a writer for National Journal. The highlighted link in the email takes you to an article at National Journal with the intriguing title “Emails May Be a Key to Addressing ‘Pay-to-Play’ Whispers at Clinton Foundation.” The article is protected by a pay wall which prevents me from providing more information, but I can tell you the subhead: “There are not two Clinton controversies. There is one big, hairy deal.” 
Here is Podesta’s response, sent a half-hour later: 
Eric Braverman, the name Podesta throws out as the likely mole, is a former CEO of the Clinton Foundation. 
Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone has posted a tweet in reaction partly to this exchange in which he advances the claim that Braverman was working with WikiLeaks and now fears assassination by the Clinton machine: Word on the street is Eric Braverman, Clinton Foundation CEO, has fled the USA and is attempting to gain asylum in Russia. Anyone confirm?

How ironic that Braverman, according to the scuttlebutt, is seeking asylum from Russia, of all nations!",0
25077,EXCLUSIVE: Keith Ellison’s Student Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Police Activism (Video),"You are here: Home / *Articles of the Bound* / EXCLUSIVE: Keith Ellison’s Student Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Police Activism (Video) EXCLUSIVE: Keith Ellison’s Student Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Police Activism (Video) November 22, 2016, 8:13 am by Guest Author Leave a Comment 0 
By: Renee Nal | New Zeal Keith Ellison (right) in a June 1989 issue of ‘Forward Motion’ responding to “police brutality” 
In the wake of communist-fueled anti-police sentiment resulting in relentless, brutal attacks on America’s law enforcement officials, a look at prospective DNC leader Keith Ellison ‘s radical anti-police and anti-capitalist history is in order. 
As Trevor Loudon reveals in his film the Enemies Within , Keith Ellison is a “perfect example of the Muslim/Marxist alliance.” In his “student radical days,” the young Marxist was condemning capitalism and “police brutality” around the same time he converted to Islam. In 1989, Keith Ellison was featured in “ Forward Motion ,” the now-defunct print magazine of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization – the same group that eventually spawned the “Black Lives Matter” movement. 
The article was titled “Battling the Rise in Police Brutality” and is not found online. Keith Ellison at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
In the article, Ellison lashed out at “white supremacy” and “capitalism” as being responsible for drug use by black Americans: Keith Ellison as quoted at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
Ellison expressed concern later in the same article that working with organized labor may lead to a “white supremacist problem.” Keith Ellison as quoted at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
Here, Keith Ellison discusses the “contradictions” surrounding how those in the progressive movement to convince black Americans that “white supremacy is an evil system” are “predominately white.” Keith Ellison as quoted at the FRSO print magazine “Forward Motion,” June 1989 
Trevor Loudon documents more on Keith Ellison here. 
The late communist party member Erwin Marquit explains in his memoirs how the radical left worked to elect Keith Ellison in 2006: 
“To gather support for Ellison, I suggested to [ Communist Party USA members] April Knutson and Jim Knutson that they draft a letter addressed to activists in the peace movement urging them to support Ellison. 
Doris and I and the Knutsons then solicited signatures to the letter from among well-known peace activists. In July, we circulated the letter as widely as possible. Doris and I volunteered to cosponsor a fundraiser for Ellison in our home on 24 July with our neighbors Dave Holets and his wife Nancy Arneson. Dave, already retired, had been in charge of managing the finances of the School of Physics and Astronomy. Together, we leafleted the immediate neighborhood with invitations to the fundraiser. 
On 21 and 22 July, I went into St. Louis Park, a suburb just west of the city line, a block and a half from our home, to do door knocking. When someone appeared at the door, I would begin by introducing myself by name. I was not surprised when one of the first responses I got was, “Oh, you’re the Communist at the University of Minnesota.” Two or three others recognized me in a similar manner. The fact that I was campaigning for Ellison did not seem to bother any of them. ” (emphasis added)

25078,US Prepares to Seek Arrest of Julian Assange - Breitbart,"U. S. authorities are preparing to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange, according to reports. [CNN reports that, according to officials familiar with the matter, the U. S. is preparing charges to seek the arrest of Assange, who has resided within the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012. The Justice Department’s investigation of Assange has been underway since 2010 when WikiLeaks first published classified documents obtained by US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.  Prosecutors first had issues pressing charges as they debated whether the information published by WikiLeaks fell under the First Amendment, but now believe that they have discovered a way to move forward. During the Obama administration, Attorney General Eric Holder and other Justice Department Officials determined that due to WikiLeaks not being the sole publisher of the documents, prosecution would be difficult. This lead to the investigation being put on hold. Following the Ecuadorian election, US officials hoped that Assange’s asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy would be revoked with a new government. However, after the victory of Lenín Moreno over his opponent Guillermo Lasso, Assange will most likely be permitted to continue living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Moreno previously stated that he would allow Assange to stay in the embassy, upholding the decision made by his predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum in 2012. CIA Director Mike Pompeo had harsh words for WikiLeaks while speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies today, implying that the whistleblowing group was a “hostile intelligence service. ” Pompeo was quite open about his disdain for the whistleblowing service following their recent publishing of CIA hacking tools as part of their “Vault 7” leaks. Pompeo stating during his speech, It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is  —   a   hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence  —   the GRU  —   had used WikiLeaks to release data of US victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated on Thursday that arresting Assange was a “priority” for the administration. “We are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks,” he said. “This is a matter that’s gone beyond anything I’m aware of. We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious. So yes, it is a priority. We’ve already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail. ” Assange’s lawyer, Barry Pollak, stated “We’ve had no communication with the Department of Justice and they have not indicated to me that they have brought any charges against Mr. Assange. They’ve been unwilling to have any discussion at all, despite our repeated requests, that they let us know what Mr. Assange’s status is in any pending investigations. There’s no reason why WikiLeaks should be treated differently from any other publisher. ” Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, has argued that prosecuting Assange could set a dangerous precedent, “Never in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for presenting truthful information to the public,” Wizner told CNN. “Any prosecution of WikiLeaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other news organizations. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

25086,"Блажен, кто верует во что попало…","Блажен, кто верует во что попало… 04 ноября 2016 Политика 
Фильм Алексея Учителя, повествующий об отношениях Николая Второго и Матильды Кшесинской, возмутил группу почитателей царя. Депутат Поклонская пообещала проверить картину, хотя она ещё и не вышла в прокат. При этом в доме Романовых оскорблёнными себя не считают. 
Прямо возвращение на машине времени на полвека назад и даже больше! Полная ассоциация со словами о романе Пастернака, с которых каждый выступающий начинал тогда свою обличительную речь: «Я книгу не читал, но…». Так и мы: никто фильм не смотрел, кроме тех, кому это по должности положено: в своё время с таким запросом, по словам Алексея Учителя, уже было обращение в прокуратуру. Выяснили, что нарушений законности не обнаружено! А на нет, как говорится, и суда… 
Вот суд-то как раз и замышляется, да не какой-нибудь — «народный»! С петициями, огульными обвинениями, протестными заявлениями. Ну, а поскольку не смотревшие фильм фанаты Николая II – по-другому этих «верующих» в непогрешимость царя называть сложно – вдруг начали проявлять необъяснимую активность аж через полгода после появления в сети трейлера «Матильды», хочется найти причины такого ажиотажа. 
Фильм может оказаться хорошим или плохим, псевдоисторически-костюмным или умным, пробуждающим чувства – в любом случае, не дело использовать художественное произведение в низменных целях. А они явно просматриваются! Как во всех детективах с поиском виновных, хочется задать сакраментальный вопрос: «Кому это выгодно?» И опять же, как в детективе, мотивов обнаруживается, как минимум, два. 
Во-первых, кто-то позаботился, чтобы фильму, который выйдет в прокат только в марте, создать «антирекламу»: за полгода-то уже все начали о нем забывать, а тут люди отчего-то рвут и мечут… Многие из одного только праздного любопытства решат посмотреть картину, вдруг да что-то там есть такое… 
Во-вторых, есть желающие правдами и неправдами дестабилизировать обстановку в стране. «Чувства верующих» для них — всего лишь интернет-повод. Вспомните, в школе, в классах этак 8-9, всех нас на уроках истории учили не путать причину с поводом! А кукловодам любой повод сгодится, чтобы достигнуть своей цели, чтобы посеять раздор и шатание. Сначала в сети, где страсти от малейшей искорки разгораются в полыхающее ненавистью пламя, а там, глядишь, и… 
А верующие и неверующие, в большинстве своём, и думать не думают о каком-то там кино – у них сейчас куча других насущных проблем, скорее материально-денежных, чем духовных!",0

25092,100 Million Marine Mammals Are Mistaking Ocean Trash for Food But Boyan Slat Has a Solution,"100 Million Marine Mammals Are Mistaking Ocean Trash for Food But Boyan Slat Has a Solution Nov 16, 2016 0 0 
Oceanographers recently went ‘fishing,’ but not for what you might think. They were on a reconnaissance mission to find out just how bad the Pacific Garbage Patch – an enormous gyre of ocean liter – had become. When they pulled up their nets recently, they found they were “choked with plastic bits and pieces.” 
Aside from the viewable plastic trash, researchers have found 750,000 microplastic pieces per square kilometer in the Garbage Patch, and the marine life which must live in these waters, is riddled with them. 
Estimations are that more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic weighing more than a quarter of a million tons currently float at sea globally. Most of this plastic debris comes from sources on land and ends up in oceans and bays due to poor waste management, and over-consumption. 
It takes between 450 and 1000 years for plastic to biodegrade, and in the meantime, it simply breaks into smaller and smaller pieces which animals mistake for food. Tube-nosed seabirds, like this Tristram’s storm petrel, eat plastic particles in the ocean, mistaking them for food. Sarah Youngren / Hawaii Pacific University/ USFWS 
The number of creatures that are affected is mind-boggling. Sadly, dolphins, sea birds, sea lions, tortoises, whales, and over 700 different marine species are likely to go extinct because of the plastic garbage choking our oceans. Millions of sea-dwelling creatures are literally ingesting their death, by mistaking plastic ocean trash for food. 
According to EcoWatch , just one species, a type of sea-bird can hunt for many fish in the sea, but areas that reliably contain food are very patchy. In other words, tube-nosed seabirds are searching for a “needle in a haystack” when they forage. They may be searching for fish, squid, krill or other items, and it is possible that plastic debris visually resembles these prey. Scientists believe that this specific example tells only part of a more complex story. 
For some marine life, the plastic particles are so small, that even algae consume them, so they don’t even know that they are ingesting human waste which is detrimental to their health. Pioneering research another reason that some marine life like birds might be eating plastic trash – they are likely confusing bits of plastic bottles and bags for small fish. 
Dr. Gabrielle Nevitt and his associates have found that certain species of tube-nosed seabirds are attracted to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) , a natural scented sulfur compound. DMS comes from marine algae , which produce a related chemical called DMSP within their cells. Once those cells are damaged—for example, when algae die, or when marine grazers like krill eat it—DMSP breaks down, producing DMS. The smell of DMS is how seabirds know that food is nearby—not by the algae, but because of the krill that eat the algae. 
Seabirds are likely being tricked into eating marine plastic garbage because of the way it smells. Tests comparing the feeding habits of over 20,000 birds from more than 70 species showed that species of birds that use DMS as a foraging cue eat plastic nearly six times as frequently as species that are not attracted to the smell of DMS while foraging. In short, plastic is effecting the entire eco-system and even interfering with physiological signaling in birds . 
This research is likely just revealing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Great Garbage Patch and the ramifications of continuing to allow our ocean’s to be devastated with plastic trash. 
There is a bright side to learning about the true depths of this issue. Organizations like the Ocean Clean Up Project just revealed their prototype to address the problem:",0
25093,Protestants get ready to grovel,"Protestants get ready to grovel By Gilad Atzmon Posted on November 9, 2016 by Gilad Atzmon 
This week we learned that Jewish institutions insist upon the Protestant Church apologising for its founder’s views of the Jews. The Jewish Algemeiner writes that “the 500th anniversary of the Reformation would be the ‘perfect time’ for Protestant leaders to recognise and apologise for the ‘horrific antisemitism’ of their movement’s founder, Martin Luther.” 
The truth of the matter is that Martin Luther didn’t know about Zionism, Israeli criminality, Alan Dershowitz, Bernie Madoff, Jeffrey Epstein, or Sir Philip Green but he still had a serious problem with the Jews. Back in 1543 he wrote On The Jews and their Lies , a book notorious for its opposition to Jews and their religion. 
Rabbi Abraham Cooper—associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre—wants the Protestants to disown the founding father of their church or at least to “directly address the issue (of anti-Semitism) in the overall context of what they’re celebrating in terms of this anniversary,” 
David Michaels of B’nai B’rith insists that the churches reject some of their founder’s teachings. “This reality requires committed Lutherans and other Christians to ensure that there is fitting recognition and rejection of Luther’s hateful beliefs about Jews, wherever these persist.” 
The Protestant world is clearly being subjected to an institutionalized assault Judaism. But there is one thing the Jewish Algemeiner fails to do. It fails to brief us about Luther’s argument against the Jews. The truth of the matter is that Luther’s animus towards Jewry wasn’t at all racially driven. His arguments against Jews were purely theological rather than biological. Thus, using the term ‘anti-Semitism’ in reference to Luther is misleading. It leaves one wondering whether Bnai B’rith and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are lying consciously when they refer to Luther as an ‘anti-Semite’? If they do, we may actually need to seek the assistance of Luther’s book in order to grasp Rabbi Cooper and Michaels’ conduct.

25094,The True Scandal of 2016 Was The Torture of Chelsea Manning     :," The True Scandal of 2016 Was The Torture of Chelsea Manning By Jeremy Scahill
November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" The Intercept "" - A few days ago, we learned that Private Chelsea Manning attempted to take her own life last month for the second time since being sentenced to 35 years at the U.S. military prison in Leavenworth, Kansas. The whistleblower, who provided the collateral murder video, the Iraq and Afghan war logs, and the hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. State Department cables to Wikileaks, was convicted of espionage. As I waited to vote today, I found myself thinking of her languishing in misery in isolation and incarceration.
This election  particularly in its closing stages  has been dominated by controversies over emails, classified documents, and Wikileaks. Weve heard endlessly about Hillary Clintons private basement server, her 33,000 deleted emails, the phishing and leaking of John Podestas emails, including parts of Clintons much discussed private speeches to Goldman Sachs. Trump, for his part, suddenly discovered a great love for Julian Assange, though he does have trouble correctly spelling Wikileaks in his tweets of praise. Taken together with Trumps bizarre and consistent lauding of Vladimir Putin and leaks from the U.S. intelligence community, the country has been treated to an odd flashback of Cold War propaganda, including a fair dose of red-baiting from the Democrats. In the matter of Anthony Weiners computer, his wife Huma Abedins communications and the potential implications for Clinton, the FBI, whose overreach had not previously been of much concern to Democrats, suddenly became a deviant manipulator of the electoral process, while Trump and his supporters alternately praised the agencys professionalism and denounced it as part of the rigged system.
The U.S. public is now getting a taste of the way hacking, phishing, and an overwhelming dependence on fallible machines and networks can impact politics. But lets be clear: None of the disclosures in this campaign  not one thing in any of the hacked emails or those declassified and released from Clintons private server  has brought to light anything of greater importance than the documents Chelsea Manning provided to Wikileaks. She revealed war crimes, including murder and torture, dirty and duplicitous dealings of the U.S. and its allies, exposed liars, documented a secret history of Americas longest running war, and forced a much needed debate about the U.S. role in the world. And for that, she is being tortured.
The double standards of our society dictate that a perjurer like the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, faces no consequences for his crimes. Gen. David Petraeus gets a slap on the wrist, no jail time, and prestigious positions at universities for sharing classified information with his mistress. Only Gen. James Cartwright may face the inside of a prison cell for discussing classified information with journalists  and he is a sacrificial lamb for the cause of exonerating Clinton and Petraeus from any true accountability by the Obama Justice Department.
But Chelsea Manning, whose motivation was noble, whose actions made our country better, faces the full wrath of the system. And it may end up killing her. When we talk about the high-tech scandals that marked this election, at the top of the list should be the torture of Chelsea Manning.",0

By Ken Silverstein At a time when the presidential election is dividing families and friends, at least one issue is bridging the gap: giving veterans of the U.S. military a new lease on life by teaching them how to restore coral reefs. And they are trying to enlist big business as their ally. Indeed, the marriage of the ocean’s ecology along with those who have served their nation is breathing a new spirit into the coral reefs, which make up a whole community of living organisms that survive on the ocean floor. Those reefs aren’t just a thing of beauty. They are also an economic engine, spawning entire enterprises that range from tourism to medicine, including the making of drugs that deal with cancer, arthritis and bacterial infections. “Our guys are special forces who are physically strong but who are also struggling,” says Jim Ritterhoff, founder of Force Blue that combines the virtues of military training with coral reef restoration.

Katy Perry strips naked , under the guise of comedy, to get out the vote (for her candidate, Hillary). 
Miley Cyrus tells voters to “ kiss her ass ” if you don’t support Hillary. 
Now there’s another classy Clinton supporter: Jennifer Lopez 
From Daily Mail : Here’s one way to drum up votes in a swing state. 
On Saturday night, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony looked as intimate as ever while performing a concert for Hillary Clinton at Bayfront Park Amphitheater in Miami, where the candidate herself joined them onstage and embraced the Out Of Sight star. 
The erstwhile spouses have worked together a great deal this year; on top of a Radio City Music Hall performance in August, they’re currently collaborating on a Spanish language album. 
For her Miami show, the 47-year-old had slid into a typically showstopping outfit, this one largely comprised of a black satin robe with a hem at mid-thigh. 
And it certainly made the most of her famous backside – with the star flashing it to the crowd throughout her hits-packed set.

C. He was joined by a Jewish White House colleague, along with several dozen other Jews. [All of these Jews were unaware, apparently, that in their midst a hidden Nazi was lurking  —   at least, according to the Forward, which attempted Thursday to claim that Gorka is secretly a member of a Nazi organization.  We have been here before. Last month, a   blogger made the same false claim, which was thoroughly debunked by Breitbart News (where Gorka was once an editor) and others. The Forward now claims Gorka once pledged loyalty to the Historical Vitézi Rend, a racist rival to the Vitézi Rend, which is a postwar anticommunist organization. (The word “historical” was added to allude to the original Vitézi Rend, which was   by Hungary’s   government and later banned.) Gorka denies it all. And as Trump critic Liel Leibovitz notes in Tablet, the Forward offers no proof other than the claims of the Historical Vitézi Rend, whom the Forward suddenly deems a trustworthy source not requiring further corroboration. It is possible to play this game both ways: In 2015, the Forward changed its name from “The Jewish Daily Forward” to simply “the Forward. ” This, apparently, was a nod to   antisemites. After all, the Forward is critical of Israel. Verdict: Guilty! Not to be outdone, the execrable Stephen Goldstein of the Anne Frank Center  —   a man who desecrates the Holocaust by abusing it in his partisan attacks against the Trump administration  —   demanded that Gorka resign, claiming that “grotesque Antisemitism   …     has infected the Trump White House. ” That absurd statement, like the article that inspired it, is nothing more than the defamation of a good man and the most   administration in U. S. history, staffed to the rafters with Jews. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the “most influential” people in news media in 2016.

25117,Republicans Just Revealed They’re ALREADY Plotting “Years” Of Hillary Investigations,"Comments 
The House GOP are preparing for a Clinton presidency by doing absolutely nothing to change their plans, announcing the threat of continued investigations into soon-to-be President-elect Hillary Clinton, which they warn will go on for years. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) is spearheading the charges against her, in spite of un-endorsing Trump just two weeks ago. 
“Even before we get to Day One, we’ve got two years’ worth of material already lined up. She has four years of history at the State Department, and it ain’t good,” he threatened. 
Although Clinton is predicted to win by a landslide majority, Republicans could retain control of the House due to conservative voting at the local level decades of extensive jerrymandering by Republican statehouses. This might make Clinton be the first president since George H.W. Bush to deal with a House Oversight Committee controlled by their opposing party in her first term. 
Of course, other Republicans agree with the efforts to take down Clinton, gleefully planning to exacerbate political divisions and distaste in this country and recreating the climate that led to Trump getting as far as he has. 
The office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a statement saying, “The rigorous oversight conducted by House Republicans has already brought to light troubling developments in the [Hillary] Clinton email scandal. The speaker supports [Oversight’s] investigative efforts following where the evidence leads, especially where it shows the need for changes in the law.” 
The thought of Republicans wasting additional time and money on trying to take down Clinton is a spit in the face to her campaign. David Brock, leader of the American Bridge PAC, accusing Chaffetz of squandering taxpayer dollars on his nonsense investigation. “It’s clear Congressman Chaffetz is ready to spend resources on additional worthless political investigations that will, again, come up with nothing,” he commented. 
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), a ranking member of the Oversight Committee and the Select Committee on Benghazi, echoed these sentiments, explaining, “Republicans are pretending like they haven’t been investigating Secretary Clinton for years ever since she announced that she was running for president, including everything from Benghazi to emails to the Clinton Foundation. It’s no exaggeration to say that on the first day Secretary Clinton walks into the White House, Republicans will have already investigated her more than any other president in history.” 
Chaffetz’s anticipated investigation may be reliant on stolen documents, sourced via WikiLeaks, though he claims he doesn’t “want to be dealing with that.” When asked if this will resemble Watergate, Chaffetz tries to warn that it could go that far depending on cooperation. 
The one thing Chaffetz hasn’t accounted for? A Trump presidency. “Heaven help us!” he says, laughing. “Please, no! I’m not even going to think about that one. I can’t even utter the sentence out loud.” 
In spite of Republicans voting Clinton on Election Day, they are still acting like whiny children, stopping at nothing to push their counter-intuitive political agenda on America. It is a prime example of Republican hypocrisy, and selfish refusal to let the country run optimally in favor of the agendas of their corporate masters and the monied elites.",0
25118,"Who Will Win The Election? FBI, NSA, CIA!","License DMCA In a TV interview today I was asked, considering the new FBI revelations about Hillary's emails, who would win the election. I replied that the FBI would be the winner, that the USA's intelligence agencies would be deciding who would win-- an outrageous, traitorous situation. On Monday, I had dinner with three heroic NSA whistleblowers-- Bill Binney, Thomas Drake and Kirk WIebe-- after they'd shared the stage in a panel discussion presented at West Chester University. Whistleblowers Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe and moderator/organizer West Chester professor Jana Nestlerode(image by Rob Kall) License DMCA - Advertisement - I came away with the clear conclusion that the US Intelligence community is a major threat to democracy. The whistleblowers stated that NSA tracks the signal intelligence-- phone calls, emails, credit card transactions, medical bills, automated toll payments-- for every American and for billions of people -- seven billion nodes. The intelligence agencies track every member of congress and all their family and friends. They track all the people in the White House, all the people in the Supreme court, all executives of corporations. All it takes is one brother-in-law selling drugs or hiding a criminal record to get a job and that puts a person of power in congress, the White House, wherever, at risk of coercion. That's why privacy is so important to all of us, even if we have something to hide. We can be blackmailed because we love someone who has something to hide. Remember, Ed Snowden was able to access the information. Actually, there may be thousands of private contractors-- employees of big corporations-- who have access to all or part of the massive data trove. There's even a name for one of the things they do. Remember, ""Sig-Int"" is the term used to refer to signal intelligence-- anything that can be picked up electronically. These contractors and intelligence agency officers engage in what is called ""love-Int,"" basically spying on wives and girlfriends to find out if they are cheating. The abuse of the system is dangerously, rampantly out of control. The recent disclosures of nebulous information about Hillary Clinton's emails are an outrageous, screamingly transparent effort to influence the election. There is no way to justify the timing. This is just the latest stretching beyond the boundaries by an intelligence agency leader. It has to stop. FBI head Comey should be charged with whatever laws apply which relate to using government power to unlawfully influence elections. It is clear that the FBI as well as the NSA, which surely has had all of the missing emails all along, have used their control over and selective analysis of them to influence the election. This should not have happened. It can never happen again. The presidency of the United States must not be determined by the head or heads of a spy agency. And it looks like that's what we're seeing. Whether you support Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, this process should be horrifying to you. - Advertisement -",0

[In the report, Apple requested permission conduct a new wave of “  manufacturing” at a factory in Mesa, Arizona, as well as approval from the   Zones Board to build “finished products” exempt from normal customs duty payments.  “Apple Inc has repurposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct   manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers,” read the document, published by the Federal Register on Monday. If approved, the operations could create a range of new jobs in the area, with Apple currently advertising a “Data Center Site Services Technician” position for their Mesa factory.   Donald Trump repeatedly criticised Apple and other prominent US companies for producing their products overseas, promising that should he be elected, companies would return to manufacturing their products in America.

25122,New Videos Appear to Show Congolese Soldiers Shooting Civilians - The New York Times,"KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo  —   The emergence on Monday of several videos that appear to show uniformed soldiers shooting Congolese civilians has added urgency to calls for an international investigation of recently discovered mass graves in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Last week, the Congolese military’s auditor general announced that seven officers had been arrested and charged with war crimes after a video surfaced last month depicting soldiers shooting a group of civilians in   Province, a massacre that left at least 13 dead. Now at least five new videos that appear to show members of Congo’s military shooting civilians are circulating on social networking platforms. Amid mounting accusations of violence against civilians, and the discovery of 10 mass graves dug in January and February in   the chief of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo urged the United Nations Security Council this week to press the government to open an investigation into possible rights violations. The chief of the mission, Maman Sambo Sidikou, urged Congo’s government on Tuesday to investigate the recent reports “to ensure that the perpetrators of these acts are held fully accountable and that justice is done,” according to Charles Bambara, Mr. Sidikou’s spokesman. In Congo, elected officials and rights advocates are calling for an international investigation. On Wednesday, Claudel André Lubaya, a member of Parliament representing   said an independent international panel was needed to investigate the eight mass graves in his province, “as well as the possibility of other mass graves in all areas where clashes have been reported. ” Jonas Kabiena, the national coordinator of a network called the New Congolese Civil Society, also called for an international inquiry and said on Wednesday, “We condemn the excessive use of force against populations without means of defense. ” The Congolese Army has been carrying out operations against a militia in the region. Fighting between soldiers and rebels has left hundreds dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of people since August. A government spokesman, Lambert Mende, told Reuters this week that the bodies in the mass graves were those of militia fighters, and that the group’s fighters, not the army, had buried them. The government denies that its soldiers have used disproportionate force against the often lightly armed fighters. Militia members could not be reached for comment, Reuters said.   Province is volatile, with frequent clashes despite the presence of United Nations peacekeepers. This month, two United Nations officials, an American and a Swede, were among six people abducted in the area. On Saturday, the United Nations mission in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, released a statement expressing concern about reports of renewed fighting and restrictions on the movements of its peacekeeping forces. In response to that statement, the government angrily criticized the United Nations mission on Tuesday for making “imprecise allegations” that hampered “the discovery of the truth. ” But Mr. Lubaya said the inaction of provincial and national officials regarding the mass graves amounted to contempt for the victims, their families and the nation. He added that an investigation was needed to determine who had been killed and how, adding that the victims should be given a dignified burial.",0

The service member was killed near Ayn Issa , a town roughly 35 miles northwest of the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa . The death marks the first time a U.S. service member has been killed in the country since a contingent of Special Operations forces were deployed there in October 2015 to go after the extremist group.

25126,Animal Rights Activists Skeptical of China’s ’Ban’ on Yulin Dog Meat Festival - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   China’s government will reportedly ban dog meat from being sold at this year’s annual and barbaric Yulin festival. However, it is likely cats will be served instead, and animal rights activists note that prior alleged bans on dog meat have usually not prevented the Yulin festival from occurring.  Every year they say the same thing, and when the festival happens, thousands of dogs are tortured. If it becomes true, then it is a victory for the animals. But do not let up the fight. Do not think for one minute it is over. Protest. Use your words and your voice. Be their hero. There are no victories until laws are changed. No milestones achieved until what people say actually happens. While we believe the government wants to change, and while we are trying to work with them to bring that to fruition. Never give in to what is said each year —   it never becomes reality. Scream for them because that is what they do when they are tortured. Be their voice, because as they are drowned, they have no words. Speak until we see the end. Stand until justice is served.  The inhuman practices associated with the dog and cat meat trade have triggered a response from Congress domestically. Rep. Alcee Hastings ( ) presented House Resolution 1406 (HR 1406) “The Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act,” in March. It seeks to”prohibit the slaughter of dogs and cats for human consumption. ”",0

25130,Russia and CIS countries hold large-scale air defense exercises,"cis , military , belarus , kazakhstan , RBTH Daily About 100 aircraft and more than 9,000 troops took part in the drills. Source: Marina Lystseva/TASS 
The annual battle readiness test of the command bodies and alert forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Joint Air Defense System was successfully completed on Oct. 26, the Russian Defense Ministry's department of information and mass communications has said in a statement . 
The exercise involved seven of the 11 CIS countries – Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. About 100 aircraft and more than 9,000 troops took part in the drills. 
""During the training, the battle readiness of the CIS alert forces and air defense assets was tested with flights of training targets, including supersonic and stratospheric,"" the department said. 
Video by YouTube 
The Russian Air and Space Forces' A-50 airborne warning and control systems (AWACS) were used to increase radar detection range in the Eastern European and Central Asian regions during the drills. 
The exercise involved MiG-29, MiG-31 and Su-27 fighters, Su-24 and Su-34 tactical bombers, Su-25 attack bombers and Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters. The Russian Airspace Forces' Tu-160 and Tu-95MS strategic missile-carrying bombers and Tu-22M3 long-range bombers posed as imaginary enemy targets. 
The exercise was led by the head of the Russian air force, Colonel-General Viktor Bondarev. Exercise against hijacking 
The exercise was pre-planned and had nothing to do with the current military-political situation, said Lieutenant-General Aitech Bizhev, former Deputy Commander of the Air Force for the CIS. Controlling the airwaves: Russia's electronic warfare systems 
Usually, the CIS air-defense forces practice executing scenarios involving the use of patrol forces against aircraft that violate the CIS borders, as well as in the case of hijacking of aircraft, in helping the crews of aircraft and helicopters in distress, said Bizhev. 
""In the summer, these exercises develop into tactical live-fire exercises on the Ashuluk firing range in the Astrakhan Region,"" he added. ""This is the so-called practical stage of the international exercises of the CIS Joint Air Defense System, 'Combat Commonwealth'."" Soviet reunion 
The recent exercise primarily involved command bodies from the Central Command Post to command posts of anti-aircraft missile battalions and individual radar companies' control points. 
""By and large, such exercises involve all the air defense troops of the former Soviet Union, of course, severely truncated compared with the 1980s,"" said Bizhev. 
The most important element of the exercise was the practicing of interoperability when aircraft cross the state borders of the CIS Joint Air Defense System members, as well as the movement of forces and equipment to the forward-based airfields, explained Colonel Sergei Volkov, former chairman of the Russian Air Defense Forces' Scientific and Technical Committee. Who are the members of the CIS Joint Air Defense System? 
The CIS Joint Air Defense System was established based on an agreement between 10 member countries, signed on Feb. 10, 1995 in Alma-Ata. Initially it included Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova later left the organization.

In 1997, Turkmenistan effectively withdrew from the CIS Joint Air Defense System, while Uzbekistan cooperates with Russia exclusively on a bilateral basis. All relations in the sphere of defense with Ukraine were terminated after February 2014 over Russia’s seizure of Crimea and support for rebels in the Donbass region. 
According to Volkov, the joint air defense system helps create a more cost-effective duty roster and military personnel training. In addition, according to him, the use of neighboring countries' airfields can dramatically increase the range of fighter aircraft.",0

25132,Speaker Paul Ryan Lays Out His Tax Reform Plan,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) turned his attention to tax reform Tuesday as he addressed a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). [“We are going to fix this nation’s tax code once and for all,” the speaker said to the NAM’s Manufacturing Summit in Washington, DC.  After describing with dismay the complexities and uncertainties of the current tax code, Ryan launched into some specifics of his plan for reform. “First, we will eliminate harmful taxes including the death tax and the alternative minimum tax,” he said. “Next, we will clear out special interest   and expensive deductions,” Ryan continued, explaining that the home mortgage, retirement, and charitable giving deductions would not be on the chopping block. Seven current individual tax brackets would be reduced to three, with the savings from discontinued deductions and streamlining allowing lower tax rates. Ryan promised a “postcard sized” income tax form would be possible under the plan. America’s 35 percent corporate tax rate came into Ryan’s crosshairs, which he compared to Canada’s 15 percent. Ryan partly blamed this tax rate, along with high individual rates for businesses that filed that way, for widespread offshoring of American jobs. “We cannot accept a system that perpetuates the drain of American businesses overseas,” he said. The solution, according to Ryan, is a move to a “territorial system” that allows American companies to move cash from overseas into the country without being taxed. This promise smacked of similarity to the Border Adjustment Tax concept that has caused controversy in earlier Republican tax reform proposals under Ryan’s speakership. Shortly before taking office, President Donald Trump expressed his objections to the concept to the Wall Street Journal. In setting the stage, Ryan touted as legislative successes his caucus’s use of the Congressional Review act, more than a dozen times, to roll back administrative state regulations, before promoting the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the one major bill passed by House Republicans during President Trump’s administration. The AHCA faces an unclear fate in the Senate. Ryan had made clear in the past he was waiting for the House to pass a healthcare bill before moving on taxes. With the House having done so last month, Ryan appeared to be moving forward with plans to introduce tax legislation regardless of how that bill, the AHCA, fares in the Senate. Shortly after the AHCA’s passage, Ryan spoke to New York City’s AM 970 about tax reform prospects, saying, “We are convinced that we can get this done in 2017 so that the economy can really start to take off.   …     All the planets are aligned, meaning you have the House, the Senate and the White House all working on this plan together. ” At the start of the month, House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows told a crowd at the conservative Heritage Institute that he would push for Congress’s August recess to be canceled if a tax bill has not been passed by then. Speaker Ryan seemed to echo that sentiment Tuesday, saying tax reform would move “full speed ahead” but set a later deadline of the end of the year: You will hear that tax reform is coming along. You will hear that it is dead. Then you will hear it is back on track. Then you will hear it is on life support. Sometimes you will hear all of this in the same week, the same day, or heck, even the same hour. Do not be surprised by any of it. But I am here to tell you: We are going to get this done in 2017. We need to get this done in 2017. We cannot let this     moment slip by. Ryan promised that any bill his Caucus introduces will insist on changes to the tax code.",0

25137,Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency… Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. It’s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. Ford’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. “Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn’t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It’s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. “We’re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven’t decided what will go there,” said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. “How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.”

There's only one possible solution. 
Let's load $400 million in unmarked foreign currency on an unmarked cargo plane and deliver it to Iran, Then make follow that up with a few more. And make sure Iran scores $150 billion in sanctions relief. 
That's how we got here . It's SmartPower, which is neither smart nor powerful. 
Earlier this month US Navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from Houthi-controlled Yemen. 
This was likely the first time in history the Navy had to take such measures, and officials are now saying they think Iran is behind the attacks. 
""We believe that Iran is connected to this,"" Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan told NBC News. In fact, the US has intercepted many shipments of weapons from Iran to the Houthi militants, who oppose Yemen's internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population. 
The intercepted shipments ""were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles, boats that we believe were explosive boats, other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw,"" Donegan said. 
I'm sure there's no chance that the billions Obama lavished on Iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own Jihadi candy store. Not a chance. 
And I'm sure that when Iran gets the nuclear weapons that Obama is enabling, it will use them as responsibly as it's using its cruise missiles.",0

The chart, provided by the generally pro-State Department think tank, puts in stark terms how much destruction the U.S. has leveled on other countries. Whether or not one thinks such bombing is justified, it’s a blunt illustration of how much raw damage the United States inflicts on the Muslim world: 
It does not appear to be working either. Despite the fact that the U.S. dropped 947 bombs in Afghanistan in 2015, a recent analysis in Foreign Policy magazine found that the Taliban control more territory in Afghanistan than at any point since 2001. The U.S. has entered its 16th year of war in Afghanistan despite several promises by the Obama administration to withdraw. In October of last year, President Obama reversed his position and decided to keep American troops in Afghanistan until the end of 2017.

John Kasich claimed in his new book that the reason President Trump won the election was because America is in a moral decline. [In Two Paths: America Divided or United, Kasich blamed Trump’s electoral win on groups ranging from the media to dishonest politicians, but he also said one of the main reasons Trump won was because of the spiritual decline in America.  “I happen to believe that you can’t guide an entire society without a shared religious foundation,” Kasich wrote. “I saw Trump’s reckless entreaties as a weakening of our shared American values  —   even more so, a coarsening of our shared American values   …     Donald Trump gave the impression of a man who would do or say anything to get attention, even incite a crowd to violence. ” Kasich also noted that Trump “gave millions of disenfranchised voters a voice. ” “What the voters were telling us in this election was that they were angry, that they were feeling that their lives were out of control, that there was a sense of helplessness and hopelessness in the heartland,” Kasich wrote. Kasich announced back in March that he does not believe he will make another run for political office again, surprising many of his supporters.

25153,Krauthammer: ‘They’re Quaking in Their Boots in Foreign Capitals’ - Breitbart,"Friday on Fox News Chanel’s coverage of the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said of President Trump‘s inaugural address that, “They’re quaking in their boots in foreign capitals. ”  Krauthammer said, “I wanted to make a point about the speech. A part that we overlooked but I am sure is not being overlooked around the world. There are two audiences obviously for inaugural address —  domestic and foreign. I guarantee you that they are quaking in their boots in foreign capitals, particularly of our allies and trading partners. The way that Trump spoke about the outside world was the most aggressive, most sort of hyper nationalist and in some ways, most hostile of any inaugural address I think since the second World War. What Trump pointed out, what he drew was a picture of a   world where what we’ve done for the world, they have been stealing from us. He says for decades we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of our American industry, subsidized others’ military at the expense of the weakening of our army. ”  “We’ve made others rich while becoming poor. Then this scattering sense that the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed around the world. In other words, the other guys, “the other,” including friends. Kennedy spoke harshly about the communist world. This is about our allies,” he continued. “They have been stealing from us, our corrupt ruling class has taken the money of the   and sent it around the world. That is the exaggerated   view. I can understand a lot of the sentiments, but imagine how this has been heard in East Asia, in Europe, in other places, and then he ends up with a phrase that may not be as a resonant here, he says we are going to have one principle, “America First. ” It is capitalized in the version that you get printed out, and capitalized in the name of the isolationist party from the 1930s that fought to keep us out of any entanglements abroad, i. e. out of the second World War, led by Charles Lindbergh and others that dismantled a week after Pearl Harbor. For many people around the world, the British in particular, that is quite a resonant phrase, and it says to them, to the free world, since Harry Truman and Eisenhower, we constructed a world where we carried a lot of you —  economically, militarily, etc. That game is over, you are on your own. That is an amazing message for an inaugural address.  We heard it on the campaign, but that is policy now and it’s going to have a huge effect around the world. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

25155,Collision of Buses and Fuel Truck in Afghanistan Kills More Than 50 - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   More than 50 people were killed on Sunday in southeastern Afghanistan’s Ghazni Province when two buses collided with a fuel truck, which then exploded, officials said. Scores of others were injured, many of them critically. The crash in Ghazni was bad even by the standards of Afghanistan’s notoriously dangerous mountain highways. A total of 111 people were either killed or injured, said Hamidullah Nawroz, the head of Ghazni’s provincial council, but because the victims were taken to many hospitals in different cities, and many died on the way, the number of fatalities was hard to determine. A bus full of passengers tried to pass the   fuel tanker on a narrow highway in Mukur District around 6 a. m. Sunday and crashed   into another fully loaded bus, Mr. Nawroz said. Both buses then collided with the tanker, which exploded and engulfed all three vehicles in flames. Estimates of the number of fatalities ranged from 50 to 76, and many feared that the death toll could be even higher. Ismail Kawusi, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s Ministry of Health, said that there were 140 passengers on the buses but that rescue workers had identified only 50 bodies so far. Many of the remains were badly burned, and body parts were scattered around the accident site. “It takes time, and only forensic medicine will be able to identify them,” Mr. Kawusi said. In Kabul on Sunday, the government hanged six Taliban prisoners convicted of various terrorism offenses  —   the first such executions of President Ashraf Ghani’s administration. The executions had been expected for some time, after the Taliban’s Haqqani network detonated a large truck bomb on April 19 at the National Directorate of Security, the country’s intelligence agency, killing 64 people. Mr. Ghani vowed in a speech afterward to retaliate with military action and the execution of Taliban prisoners. During his tenure, which began in September 2014, the government had executed only one prisoner, a notorious crime boss, although about 300 men are on death row. All six who were executed Sunday were members of the Taliban or the Haqqani network, a Taliban faction that has operated independently, according to a statement from the National Directorate of Security. The president signed the order for the executions, according to a statement released by his office, after “repeated requests from the families of victims of terrorist attacks. ” The statement continued, “The signing happened after a close examination of the fairness of the sentencing process, in accordance with Afghanistan’s human rights obligations. ” The executions reflected a lack of optimism among Afghan officials about efforts to restart the peace process with the Taliban, who have refused to attend recent sessions hosted by Afghanistan’s neighbors. The Taliban responded to the executions by threatening “to make military targets out of all those institutions involved in the martyrdom of prisoners,” according to a statement issued by Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the group. “They will not be able to breathe one breath in peace, and their relatives will not be able to live with confidence, either. ”",0
25156,Taiwan’s President Accuses China of Renewed Intimidation - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   President Tsai   of Taiwan sharply criticized China’s leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. “Step by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,” she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions between Taiwan and China, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that São Tomé and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan’s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan. Despite Beijing’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. “We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One China policy, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized China’s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. Tsai’s words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of China’s show of strength. “She remains calm, rational and patient,” Ms. Glaser wrote in an email. Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. Tsai’s preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. Trump’s bombastic style. Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to “maintain a balance among relations with China, relations with the United States and domestic politics. ” Ms. Tsai’s vision, however, “may not align well with the incoming Trump administration’s apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,” he said. Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan. Ms. Tsai described the visit as “unofficial,” saying, “A transit stop is just a transit stop. ”",0

PRESS TV 
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has found no clear links between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia, officials say, proving false allegations by the candidate’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
The FBI spent most of the summer to verify claims by the Clinton campaign that Trump was linked to President Vladimir Putin, and Moscow was trying to influence the November 8 vote in his favor. 
However, the bureau failed to find any indications of the alleged ties after scrutinizing advisors close to Trump, investigating the real estate mogul’s financial ties and even his emails, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing law enforcement officials. 
Clinton’s campaign voiced concerns about Moscow’s intervention after a series of emails belonging to various ranks of the Democratic Party were released by the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks. 
American intelligence officials blamed the hacks on Russia and even threatened to come up with countermeasures of the same nature. President Barack Obama and high-ranking officials in his administration also blamed Russia for the breaches. 
Under immense pressure from Clinton’s supporters, who were mad at Trump for calling Putin a great leader, the FBI started its investigation into the claims. 
The Clinton campaign has called on the FBI to publicly discuss their findings about the case, as they did with their new investigation into Clinton’s new emails. 
FBI chief James Comey told Congress on Friday that he was reopening investigations into Clinton’s emails after finding a trove of new emails on a laptop belonging to former representative Anthony Weiner, who was once married to Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin. 
At some point during its investigation, the FBI questioned Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign boss, who has reportedly had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, the Times noted. 
The bureau’s agents also investigated an email channel between Trump and the Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s biggest banks. 
After weeks of detailed investigation, the FBI concluded that the connection was nothing more than marketing emails or spam 
Trump has rejected Clinton’s allegations against Russia, and has pledged to work with Moscow and earn Putin’s respect.",0

C. last summer. [“I’m not aware of that,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer replied during a press gaggle with reporters at the White House, when asked by a reporter about the news.  Spicer added that it would be “highly inappropriate” to comment on the ongoing investigation into Rich’s death, despite the possibility of leaked emails to Wikileaks. The Democratic National Committee also declined to comment on the investigation. “We know of no evidence that supports these allegations. We are continuing to cooperate with investigators and have no further comment,” DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. NBC News reported that Ed Butowsky, a conservative financial advisor in Dallas, helped pay for the investigation. Butowsky denied details in the story. “I didn’t pay anybody. I didn’t hire anybody,” he said to NBC News, referring further comment to Rod Wheeler, the former Washington, D. C. homicide detective who conducted the private investigation. Wheeler revealed to Fox News that Rich was communicating with Wikileaks before his death, sparking renewed interest in the investigation. The news was confirmed by an anonymous federal investigator.

POSSIBLE UFO SIGHTING? Man sees 'weirdest thing EVER' while filming fall leaves. 
A Parkland County, Alberta, Canada resident has spotted what he believes are flying objects, orbs, and discs while operating a drone camera. The unnamed man was filming at Hasse Lake when he noticed this odd objects zooming through his frame while shooting footage of the fall foliage. The video, recorded with a Phantom3P drone, was sent to the MUTUAL UFO Network (MUFON). The man stated that it was ""the weirdest thing"" he has ever recorded. 
The odd object was not noticed until the drone operator viewed the video at home. He was operating the drone from 500 meters away and did not physically see the weird shapes. The home video shows a collection of white spheres and one darker object that appears as a disc . 
The object zoomed past the drone, swerved to the left and then vanished. It had to be moving at incredible speeds, as his camera was recording at 60 frames per second. The objects appear as a blur when a frame is paused. The man at first thought they must be birds, but then noticed birds in the frame that do not look anything like the objects. 
The man, who has experience recording over 100 other drone videos, has never recorded anything like this. MUFON is currently investigating the case.

25175,Duterte Tells Civilians to Take Arms Against Islamic State Affiliate After Soldier Beheading - Breitbart,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered an extended military operation against the Islamic State affiliate Abu Sayyaf and assured civilians that any violent action they take to subdue local terrorists will be forgiven in a court of law, following the arrest of a policewoman with ties to the group and the beheading of a soldier. [Abu Sayyaf, which has been active for years in the southern Philippines but more recently pledged allegiance to Islamic State caliph Abu Bakr   has become active in southern Bohol Island, a new territory for them. Duterte’s administration has responded with a reinforced military presence in the region, while Duterte himself has threatened to cannibalize the jihadists.  “I can eat you,” Duterte said this week. “Just give me salt and vinegar. True. Make me mad. Get me a terrorist. Give me salt and vinegar. I will eat his liver. ” In September, Duterte made a similar promise to “eat” Abu Sayyaf terrorists, following a series of attacks on soldiers. Duterte also assured civilians living in affected regions that he would endeavor to protect their right to  . Speaking last week following an attack on soldiers in Bohol, Duterte said, “to the police  …     and even civilians interested to fight and kill, the order is dead or alive. ” “I intend to also arm the civilians and I will include the civilians  …     you don’t have to worry,” he said. “Just go to the police and make a report and state your truth  …     no problem. I’ll take care of you, I’ll pardon you, whatever. ” Duterte has taken a similar stand with drug criminals, assuring civilians of impunity if they kill drug offenders. In addition to the increasingly common clashes between Abu Sayyaf terrorists and police, law enforcement arrested a Philippine policewoman this week for ties to the group. Philippine National Police (PNP) Superintendent Maria Cristina Nobleza is under arrest after police found evidence that she had been engaged in an affair with an Abu Sayyaf bombmaker, potentially handing over sensitive information. The investigation into whether she was a source for the terrorist group is ongoing. Authorities also found the head of Sergeant Anni Siraji, a Philippine soldier abducted on April 20 by the terrorist group. Abu Sayyaf terrorists reportedly beheaded him this weekend after the soldier was assigned to work as an intermediary between the terrorists and police. “He is involved in peace efforts,” Brigadier General Cirilito Sobejana told reporters. “He is not actually a combatant. We are using him to engage stakeholders because he is a Tausug [like most Abu Sayyaf],” he added, referring to the man’s ethnicity. Dutertespokesman Ernesto Abella called the beheading a “barbaric act” over the weekend and vowed more military action. “The President is firm and decisive in the fight against terrorism,” he said. “He has ordered government troops to carry out sustained, focused and intense operations to put an end to lawless and gruesome acts of violence. ” The Philippine Star quotes another PNP official as stating, “[Our] teams will do nothing except to ‘eat Abu Sayyaf in breakfast, lunch and dinner. ’” Duterte, who had repeatedly demanded the United States stay out of Philippine matters during the Obama administration, recently changed his disposition, requesting that American soldiers help his country fight the jihadist insurgency in the south. “As we fought together to stay above the enemy then, so we should help each other to address the threats that confront our societies, our region, and our world,” Duterte said in April, reaching out to President Donald Trump, according to regional outlet   News.",0
25178,Tehran's 'Big Lake' Claim Muddies the Waters in Caspian Sea Dispute,"Get short URL 0 4 0 0 The unique properties of the Caspian Sea has dogged decades of negotiations on the status of the body of water, political scientist Vladimir Sazhin told Sputnik Persian. Russian Defense Ministry Russian Caspian Flotilla Ships Successfully Complete Kalibr Missile Drill This week the 47th Session of the Special Working Group (SWG) on the development of the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea met in Tehran, where deputy foreign ministers of the Caspian states met to discuss a possible agreement on the Sea's status.
Since 1991, the five Caspian Sea countries have made agreements on a range of areas including the environment, the protection of marine resources, security, co-operation in the case of emergency situations and military activities in the lake. 
In practice, they have come to agreement regarding the division of the water surface into sovereign zones. According to this agreement, the five Caspian countries have the right to exploit marine resources up to 25 miles from their coast. This includes 15 nautical miles which constitutes national waters, plus another ten nautical miles in which each state has the exclusive right to fishing. The rest of the water is considered international. 
Political analyst Vladimir Sazhin told Sputnik Persian that while the Caspian Sea countries have made a lot of progress on the issue, a final Convention is still far from being agreed. 
""I will say straightaway that for the moment the prospect is extremely remote. At the moment the legal framework for the Caspian Sea is based on two agreements signed by Iran and the Soviet Union in 1921 and 1940,"" Sazhin said. 
""Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, three new littoral states established after the collapse of the Soviet Union, do not recognize these agreements and are holding discussions about the future status of the sea."" 
""Of course, this is justified because after all there are now five, not two independent Caspian states, each of which has an equal right to this sea-lake, on the basis of their geographical location,"" Sazhin explained. © Sputnik/ Baku Summit to Enrich Persian Gulf With Caspian Sea Resources The issue of whether the Caspian Sea is actually a lake or a sea is at the core of many of the disagreements, since the two bodies of water are governed differently under international law.
Iran is convinced that the Caspian is a lake, and should be divided equally five ways, giving Tehran control over 20 percent of the water and sea bed. 
However, Iran's four neighbors in the Caspian insist that, as reflected by its name, the body of water is really a sea. Therefore, they argue, the water and sea bed should be divided according to a modified median line. 
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan have all signed agreements according to this principle. However, since Iran's Exclusive Economic Zone would constitute only 13 percent of the sea according to this principle, the proposal is rejected by Tehran. 
Azerbaijan to the west of Iran and Turkmenistan to the east reject in turn Tehran's idea, which would deprive them of maritime territory. ...",0

(Via AP) 
The UN refugee agency, also known as the UNHCR, says the number of refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe in 2016 has reached an all-time high. 
""We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded,"" said the UN refugee agency spokesman, William Spindler, on Wednesday. 
The alarming surge, which surpassed the death toll of 3,771 for 2015, comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the Mediterranean in 2016. 
More than a million people reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2016, while fewer than 330,000 crossings have been reported so far this year. 
The number of refugees heading to Europe has declined as the European Union in March signed a controversial deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the EU to either be located in Turkey or go back to the original country of departure. 
Since then, the route between Libya and Italy across the central Mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to Greece have been closed down. 
According to the agency, the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between Turkey and Greece was one in 88, while one death for every 47 arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between Libya and Italy in 2016. 
The UNHCR attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded “lower quality vessels, flimsy inflatable rafts” often used by smugglers. In this October 21, 2016 photo provided by Sea-Watch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. (Via AP) 
25 refugees found dead in Mediterranean Sea, MSF says 
Earlier on Wednesday, Doctors Without Borders, known as the MSF by its French acronym, said 25 bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the Mediterranean. 
The MSF said its ship, Bourbon Argos, found the bodies aboard the vessel 26 nautical miles off Libya late on Tuesday. The vessel was carrying 107 survivors. The victims had apparently been burned, suffocated or drowned. 
The recovery operation, which took place with the help of a team from the Berlin-based non-governmental organization Sea-Watch, took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater. 
""The mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods. It was horrible,"" said Michele Telaro, the MSF project leader. 
The MSF also saved 139 people aboard another dinghy on Tuesday. Sea-Watch recovered a body in another operation. 
The Italian Coast Guard reported that 500 refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on Tuesday.

In March of 2016, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia (in 1998-2004), Igor Ivanov, said that the danger of a nuclear war in Europe was higher than it was in the 1980s.Ivanov, who now heads the Russian Council for International Affairs, noted a high risk of confrontation with the use of nuclear weapons in Europe. According to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute, Russia and the United States currently own fewer nuclear weapons than they did during the Cold War. However, even though both Russia and the USA have 7,000 warheads each, the countries still own approximately 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world.The former minister, speaking in Brussels to foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland and a US congressman, said: ""We now have fewer nuclear warheads , but the risk that they will be used, is increasing.""He also accused the United States and Europe of raising such risks by deploying the European missile defense system. A part of the nuclear shield is being built on one of the bases in Poland. The missile defense system will be deployed in 2018, which is particularly sensitive for the Kremlin, as the US missile defense system will be taken very close to Russia's borders.

25183,CDC Warns Swimmers of Pool Poopers Following Increase in Parasite Outbreaks - Breitbart,"The CDC has warned swimmers about pool water contaminated by people pooping in them following an increase in cases of a parasitic infection. [CNN reports that cases of a parasitic   infection linked to pools in the United States have doubled between 2014 and 2016 according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report issued by the CDC. Michele Hlavsa, chief of the CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program, stated in an email, “Cryptosporidium is a germ that can make people sick with diarrhea for up to three weeks. ” The parasite can be spread by the feces of an infected person.  The CDC received reports of as many as 32 outbreaks linked to swimming pools and water playgrounds in 2016. In comparison, there were only 16 reports in 2014. In Ohio, nearly 2000 people became sick due to being infected by cryptosporidium or “crypto. ” Symptoms of the infection include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting. “Parents can encourage their children not to swallow the water when swimming,” Hlavsa said, warning that swallowing a single mouthful of contaminated water can lead to illness. “Also, take kids on bathroom breaks every hour, and check diapers in a   area and not right next to the pool,” Hlavsa explained. “We all share the water we swim in, but we don’t want to share germs, pee or poop. ” The crypto infection is a major contributor to diarrheal illnesses in toddlers and infants in countries across Africa and Asia. It can also lead to poor nutrition which can be dangerous for young children. “Crypto is extremely hard to kill with normal levels of chlorine, which is why it’s important to keep Crypto out of pools in the first place,” Hlavsa wrote. “We can all help do this by not swimming or letting our kids swim if sick with diarrhea. ” “Most people who have healthy immune systems will recover from Crypto without treatment,” Hlavsa stated, but she noted that individuals afflicted with diarrhea for more than three days should contact their doctor.

25192,10 Things Anthony Weiner Did That Were Worse Than Storing Hillary Clinton’s Emails on His Computer,"$18 10 Things Anthony Weiner Did That Were Worse Than Storing Hillary Clinton’s Emails on His Computer Posted on Oct 29, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
WaPo is reporting that it was the FBI investigation of Anthony Weiner that caused new emails between Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin to come to light, which apparently might include forwarded State Department memos or correspondence related to State. 
Nothing produces upchuck in the throat like another headline with the name “Anthony Weiner” in it. But here’s an opportunity for me to reprint a column I once did on the things Weiner has said and done worse than sexting. The FBI was investigating him for sending suggestive messages to an under-aged girl. 
The nation is fixated on Trump’s groping and Clinton’s email server (uh, the State Department and the NSA got hacked folks, so it isn’t the case that government servers are secure) and, well, maybe it was fixated for a brief second on Weiner’s sexting. But we don’t seem interested in serious policy questions like Syria and Iraq. Oh, the public got all het up about ISIL in 2014 and demanded something be done, but now it has lost interest. 
So here’s an actually important policy issue on which Weiner shaped public opinion and helped make policy. 
The real scandal surrounding Anthony Weiner is that he is bigoted against Palestinians and has misused his position in Congress to support punitive policies against them. Americans appear to be bored by policy, titillated by private peccadilloes. But it is the policies that are important. Mahatma Gandhi was once kicked out of a brothel in South Africa. No one judges him by his lapses. Weiner, in contrast to Gandhi, has not worked for peace but has rather given knee-jerk support to the worst policies of the most far right-wing parties in Israel toward Palestinians. A social liberal in American terms, Weiner is so blinded by his allegiance to Israel and so studied in his ignorance of the Middle East that he has played a uniformly sinister role in that aspect of foreign policy. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Weiner: 
1. Called for Columbia University professor Joseph Massad to be fired for being critical of Israel; Weiner thus spearheaded a new McCarthyism. 
2. On the Israeli attack, in international waters, on the Mavi Marmara relief ship , Weiner sputtered: “”If you want to instigate a conflict with the Israeli navy it isn’t hard to do. They were offered alternatives. Instead they chose to sail into the teeth of an internationally recognized blockade.” The blockade of Gaza civilians is a breach of international law; it is not internationally recognized and has on the contrary been condemned by almost every nation and human rights organization. 
3. Alleged that the New York Times is anti-Israel: “Amnesty International in particular, has always had bias against Israel, and frankly I would argue that in many cases, the New York Times has, as well.” 
4. Alleged that the Palestine Liberation Organization is still listed by the US as a terrorist organization. It was dropped from the list over 2 decades ago. 
5. Tried to bar the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations from New York. 
6. Alleged that Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestine Authority, is not the head of the PLO. He is. 
7. Refused to condemn the use by Israel of cluster bombs on the civilian farms of south Lebanon in 2006. 
8. Alleged that the Israeli army does not occupy the West Bank and that there is no Israeli Army presence in the West Bank. 
9. Called Israel’s [2009] war on Gaza a “humane” war. 400 children were killed. 
10. Voted for Iraq War authorization in 2002, before later turning against the war. TAGS:",0

2 0 0 1
TO THE EDITOR OF THE LETHBRIDGE HERALD ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016.
As an American with Canadian friends, I have been following with some interest and concern the unfolding story of Anthony Hall’s recent suspension from his position at the .
I have looked to our northern neighbour as one admires a wiser, older sibling. Canadians to me seem less radical, less extreme, and more ethical than my own more reactive countrymen and women. Canada, after all, accepted our draft dodgers of the ’70s who questioned the morality and justness of the Vietnam War. To me, that was something to be lauded. Imagine my chagrin upon learning that a university professor with a 30-year career, who encourages critical analysis and social responsibility, had been suspended without pay, apparently without a formal and unprejudiced investigation occurring first.
Hall’s suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two American academics, Steven Salaita and Norman Finkelstein. Both were openly critical of Zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous Arab populations of the Occupied Territories. Both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of Palestinian rights and lost their jobs.
I adjure the not to take a page out of the American playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world. Please live up to the values of the wiser, more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for Americans like myself.

25200,"Terrorist Who Killed Lee Rigby Will Pursue £20,000 Lawsuit for Teeth Broken in Prison","Islamist terrorist Michael Adebolajo, who murdered Lee Rigby, has found a lawyer who will pursue his claim when he lost two teeth after lashing out at prison guards. [Adebolajo had intended to sue the prison service in 2015 but had not found a lawyer to take on his case. The Sun has reported Adebolajo has now found legal representation and is seeking £20, 000 in compensation.  Muslim converts Adebolajo and accomplice Michael Adebowale were found guilty of murdering    army soldier Fusilier Rigby in broad daylight near his barracks in Woolwich, south east London, in 2013. They mowed him down in a car before hacking him to death with knives and a cleaver. Following his conviction, the terrorist was sent to Belmarsh prison where he lashed out at prison guards before hitting his face on a window, breaking two teeth. The five guards involved were suspended but later cleared following a   investigation.  The Prison Officers’ Association said at the time the guards were restraining Adebolajo, and they only use force “where necessary”. Adebolajo was later found attempting to radicalise other inmates and was moved to Frankland prison in County Durham. During the initial attempt to sue, the Ministry of Justice said it would “robustly” defend itself against claims brought by Adebolajo. “The public will be rightly outraged at the thought of this man receiving compensation from the taxpayer and we robustly defend claims made against the Prison Service,” the ministry said in a statement. On Sunday Lee’s mother, Lyn Rigby, said, “This is nothing more than blood money. This is the last person on earth who deserves compensation. “You can replace broken teeth but you can’t bring back the life of my treasured boy. ” Mrs. Rigby added, “It hurts so much that he just won’t go away and leave us to pick up the pieces of our broken lives. It’s almost as if he revels in the limelight of his heinous crime and has no remorse or shame for what he has done. “Like many killers, he seeks to psychologically control the victims of his crime by toying with our emotions  —   but we won’t be dragged down again. We are learning to be stronger and hold our heads high out of respect and dignity for Lee. ” Adebolajo was sentenced to a whole life jail term for the murder. Adebowale was jailed for life with a minimum 45 years.",0
25201,"If You Have Rhesus (RH) Negative Blood, You Are Alien","Share on Facebook Studies conducted on rhesus negative blood types show that they are missing the Rhesus factor , a protein substance present in the red blood cells of other humans. Theories suggest that people with Rhesus (RH) negative blood may be from outside this world. Others suggest they are fallen angels from the heavens above or they belong to an alien race from somewhere in the vast darkness of space. What is clear is that those who have with Rhesus (RH) negative blood are different and unique. A person who has RH negative O blood is able to serve as a donor to any person regardless of their blood type. But if they need blood, only their own type will suffice. They represent 15% of the human race and are mostly from northern Europe. Truth Theory reports: The four common blood types of today include A, B, AB and O . The differences between each blood type is dependent on the proteins in the blood, but when it comes to RH negative blood types, which make up about 10 to 15 percent of the population, they don't have these proteins. The question that is on the minds of scientists now, is where this group of RH negative blood type people originates from. Looking back about 35,000 years, scientists believe that the blood type is linked to specific tribes and groups. Europeans have the greatest incidence of this blood type, but only 3% of African-Americans have it, and only 1% of Asian people have it. Some common characteristics of people with this blood type include having a higher IQ, having a lower body temperature, having more awareness (physically and emotionally), having red hair, being sensitive to heat, and having blue, green or hazel colored eyes. This blood type is shrouded in even more mystery when we look at pregnant women. RH negative women who become pregnant have difficulty delivering a baby with an RH positive blood type, as their bodies naturally attack and try to kill the fetus. Thus, they are given a special sterilized solution. ( Anti-D or RHo (D) immunoglobulin ) But, why would the woman's body attack the offspring it's been helping give life to? This is where a relatively new theory comes in and suggests that it's possible alien life has influenced this blood type. What’s even stranger is that almost every person who has reported being abducted by (or interacted with) aliens has the RH negative blood type. It's certainly very possible that aliens visited our planet, as they've done for centuries, and somehow tooled around with the genetics of mankind. After all, history from all over the world has shown time and time again, through ancient texts and depictions, that we've been visited by beings not of this world. What do you think about the blood type that is missing a key link to evolutionary humans ? Could it be that some of us have alien blood running through our veins? Related:",0

Однако приход Дональда Трампа на пост президента США привел к ситуации, когда в самом центре элиты появился человек со стороны. Трамп смог добиться такого невероятного результата, дав голос не только самой обездоленной части американского населения, но и небольшим радикальным группам, которых остальные политические представители даже за людей не считали. Однако теперь любая попытка как-то улучшить экономическое положение простого американца будет сопровождаться отчаянным сопротивлением со стороны элиты, которая и дальше намерена продавать американское оружие всем подряд, лишь бы нажиться на этом посильнее. В итоге, отмечает автор, едва эта закулисная борьба принесет что-то кроме неразберихи в американскую политику. С другой стороны, большая часть демократов раздосадована тем, что Берни Сандерсу не дали представлять свою партию, хотя все опросы показывают, что он бы победил Трампа с большим отрывом. В результате в ближайшее четыре года Демократическая партия США будет заниматься чисткой своих рядов от всех сторонников четы Клинтон, в то время как Республиканская попытается любым способом избавиться от Трампа и найти ему замену, поскольку он, по их мнению, не представляет их интересов.

25204,BREAKING: FBI Gets Search Warrant For State Department Emails On Weiner’s Computer (VIDEO),"BREAKING: FBI Gets Search Warrant For State Department Emails On Weiner’s Computer (VIDEO) By Michelle Oxman on October 30, 2016 Subscribe 
On Sunday afternoon, October 30, 2016, the FBI obtained a search warrant for emails on a laptop owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner. You’ll remember that Weiner was under investigation for sexting a 15-year-old girl. As it happened, the same laptop also contained emails that Abedin, Clinton’s Chief of Staff at the State Department, forwarded to her personal Yahoo account so she could print them. That’s why FBI agents got Director James Comey’s approval to seek access to the emails, as Comey told Congress (and we reported ) on Thursday, October 28. A Rather Unusual Warrant 
Now, when is the last time you ever heard about a search warrant being granted? I bet you can’t think of one. That’s because police and prosecutors ask the court to issue warrants in secret. That makes sense, even to those of us who usually err on the side of supporting civil liberties. After all, if you knew the police had a warrant to search your home or your computer, what would you think of doing? 
Why do we know about this warrant? Because James Comey told Congress there were new emails “pertinent” to the Clinton investigation. Trump supporters argued that the government must have reviewed the emails and would only have released the information if there was important new evidence. In reality, the FBI couldn’t do so legally. Why? Because the warrant to search the computer for evidence of Weiner’s contact with a 15-year-old girl could not have covered Huma Abedin’s work-related emails from three or more years earlier. There’s a helpful explanation of the legal issues relating to the search warrant in today’s Washington Post. 
Still, faced with the innuendo and implications of illegality in Comey’s vague letter, Clinton and her supporters insisted that the FBI disclose what it had. Perhaps the FBI didn’t want to admit that it didn’t know what it had. Or maybe the FBI didn’t want to admit that it had gotten its knowledge illegally. Getting a search warrant bought the FBI time, though, and left the whole mess hanging over Clinton’s head as she approaches the last week of the campaign. Violating Policy 
There seems to be no doubt that Comey’s letter to Congress violated two long-standing tradition and policies: (1) prohibiting discussion of ongoing investigations; and (2) not taking actions to favor one side or another in elections. Two former Deputy Attorneys General, one Democrat and one Republican,publicly questioned Comey’s fitness to lead the FBI because of it. In addition, others have pointed out that Comey has repeatedly gone beyond established limits in his discussions of the Clinton email investigation. The Known Unknowns 
We still don’t know whether any of the emails on that computer contain new information. We don’t know whether Secretary Clinton ever sent emails to Abedin’s personal account on that computer or received emails from Abedin via that account. We don’t know whether classified information was sent or received via this personal computer. We don’t know what any of the emails would tend to show about Clinton’s respect for classified information. After all, it wasn’t Clinton, but Abedin, who forwarded the emails. One Final Question 
Apparently, the FBI agents working on the Weiner case became aware several weeks ago that the computer contained emails that Abedin forwarded to herself while she worked at the State Department. Why did they wait until last Thursday to tell Comey? Surely they anticipated his likely reaction? Did they “play” Comey to manipulate the election results?

25208,How the Ancient World Invoked the Dead to Help the Living,"Ancient Origin 
Though it may seem as if Halloween is a modern con trick designed to get us spending our hard-earned cash on an American celebration, this is not the case. In fact, dressing up, knocking on neighbors’ doors and asking for food at this time of year is a very old tradition. Communities on the British Isles were taking part in similar rituals as far back as the 16th century . 
For centuries, people have believed this was the time when the boundary between our world and the spirit world became permeable. Terrifying outfits and specific rituals were designed and used to ward off or appease evil spirits roaming the earth around All Hallow’s Eve. But evidence has also been found of ordinary people, as early as the times of the ancient Greeks and Romans, using magical incantations throughout the year to call on those departed to help the living. Lead tablets, found bound together, with magical inscriptions. Dated to 300–500 AD. Marie-Lan Nguyen ( Public Domain ) 
Though the Romans certainly invoked spirits for aid, they also felt the need to placate the dead. According to the Roman poet Ovid , at the Lemuria festival in May, the pater familias – that is the head of the household – walked around the house at midnight, throwing black beans on the floor to pacify any ancestral spirits who might be vengeful because they had not been buried. 
The Romans thus had similar concerns regarding angry spirits, but, like the Greeks, they also saw the uses of those vengeful dead in their daily quest for happiness. Ancient Incantations 
The Greeks and Romans were as anxious about their health and happiness as we are today. So other, more private – sometimes questionable – approaches were tried, and such practices became labelled as “magic” as early as the fifth century BC. 
Magic was big business for the ancients – and though its professionals were often accused of being charlatans who were only after customers’ money, it thrived throughout antiquity. Spells were used for various purposes. Erotic spells, for example, cast to attract someone or control your love interest, were very popular. But they were also used to confound an opponent’s speech in court, make the horses you bet on win in the races, or curse a thief who stole your money.",0
25215,Robert Durst’s Transfer to a Los Angeles-Area Prison Is Approved - The New York Times,"Robert A. Durst, the real estate scion charged with shooting a confidante in the back of the head in her Los Angeles home 16 years ago, is headed to the same federal prison that once held the crime boss Al Capone, the former Harvard professor and LSD advocate Timothy Leary and the mass murderer Charles Manson. Mr. Durst, 73, who has been held in New Orleans on unrelated gun charges for more than a year, will be transferred to the   federal prison at Terminal Island, outside Los Angeles, where he will await formal arraignment by Aug. 18 on murder charges in the killing of his confidante, Susan Berman. Prosecutors in Los Angeles contend that Mr. Durst killed Ms. Berman shortly before Christmas 2000 so that she would not reveal what she knew about his role in the sudden disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen, 18 years earlier. At the time, the authorities in New York had reopened the investigation into Ms. Durst’s disappearance, prompting Mr. Durst to flee New York. During a   hearing on Wednesday in United States District Court in New Orleans, Mr. Durst, appearing frail and shrunken in an orange jump suit, told Judge Kirk D. Engelhardt that he had been “wanting to get to Los Angeles for almost a year to enter my   plea. ” Judge Engelhardt approved a defense motion that Mr. Durst be sent to Terminal Island. The judge also approved a prior plea bargain arrangement, in which Mr. Durst was sentenced to 85 months in prison for illegally possessing a .  revolver. Mr. Durst was assessed a $5, 000 fine. Mr. Durst’s lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said Terminal Island “has the facilities to take care of a    man” with various health issues. “He didn’t kill Susan Berman,” said Mr. DeGuerin, the lead lawyer in what has become a formidable defense team of lawyers from Houston, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. For more than two years, John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County, has been building a circumstantial case against Mr. Durst that ties together Ms. Berman’s unsolved murder and Ms. Durst’s disappearance. After the arraignment in August, Mr. Durst will for the first time get a look at the prosecution’s case, through discovery. That will almost certainly lead to a protracted period of wrangling over the evidence, which includes handwriting analysis, filmed interviews with Mr. Durst and testimony from friends and relatives. Mr. Durst had been active in New York in the family real estate business until 1994, when his father and his uncle turned the reins of the empire over to his younger brother, Douglas Durst. In 2003, Robert Durst, who had moved to Houston, was acquitted of murder charges in Galveston, Tex. in spite of admitting in court that he had carved up the body of a neighbor and threw the body parts into Galveston Bay. Mr. Durst has been fodder for books, television specials, and dramatic and documentary movies, including the HBO documentary   “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. ” He has even been parodied on comedy shows: The actor Fred Armisen, who first played Mr. Durst in a “Saturday Night Live” sketch, is reprising the role in the Netflix series “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” where he appears as an old flame of one of the characters.",0

Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo partially attributed the new stock market record to Trump’s speech to congress on Tuesday night and the new plans coming from his administration’s economic team. “You’re seeing a growth plan come out of the Trump administration and, increasingly, you’re seeing the officials out of the Trump administration talk about a timeline and so that was really the catalyst for today’s rally,” she said in an interview on talk radio’s 1210 WPHT. “He didn’t have any mention of a border adjustment tax.

Initially, Cuban actually supported Trump’s candidacy as someone independent from politics as usual, but as he (and we all) learned more about the dark past of The Donald’s dirty dealings , sexual predations and more, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner threw himself wholeheartedly into the political arena, culminating with front row seats to the last presidential debate. 
Cuban sat down with local radio broadcasters to discuss rumors that his anti-Trump stance might cost him ticket sales for his NBA franchise. Mark Cuban probably, literally dropped the mic after this response: 
“You know what, when it’s all said and done, I’d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And so if it means we play to empty arenas, I’m down with that.” 
“Maybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I don’t know,. I’ve heard it from both. I’ve had people say ‘there’s no way I can support you. I can’t go to another Mavs game.’ And I’ve had people say ‘you know what? We’re buying Mavs tickets.’ What I’ve heard more often than anything is, ‘are you gonna be this way once the election’s over?’ And the answer is no. You’ve known me forever Newy and I’ve been apolitical my entire adult life and only because I know Donald and I know my feelings about what he would be like as president have I gotten this involved but come November 9, it’s all Mavs all the time.” 
Mark Cuban is a shining example of how any American should approach the political arena, which he does by placing integrity over ideology and the good of the country in his viewpoints above the simple view of his bank account’s short term health. Luckily, Cuban is a franchisee in the NBA, which is far and away America’s most progressive major sports league, which doesn’t guarantee ongoing success, but does mean that the typical NBA fan values tolerance and diversity over racial segregation and hatred.",0
25220,Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell: Celebs Need to ’Chill’ on Trump,"Founding Backstreet Boys band member Brian Thomas Littrell has added his voice to the growing number of celebrities insisting that Hollywood stop panicking over the election of Donald Trump. [“Hollywood needs to chill, ok? Hollywood needs to chill out,” Littrell told a TMZ reporter.  The singer said the incoming president is going to do “great things” for the country, and for those people who didn’t support him. “He’s going to be our president, he’s going to be our   . And he’s going to do so many great things for this country,” Littrell said. “In my opinion, he’s going to do great things for this nation  —   and even for those people who disapprove of him.

25222,BREAKING: CLINTON CLEARED...Was This A Coordinated Last Minute Trick To Energize Hillary's Base? » 100percentfedUp.com,"
Limbaugh said that the revelations in the Wikileaks material were “starting to hurt” the Clintons and that the renewed interest in an FBI investigation into her private email server would be a fruitless distraction. 
In any case… 
IT’S TIME TO DRAIN THE SWAMP! 
FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI’s original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. 
Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would, in the unrelated case, review additional emails related to Clinton’s time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. 
“Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,” Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. “During that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusion.” 
The new case is purportedly related to ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner using a laptop he shared with estranged wife and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin for “sexting” an apparently underage female.

A court in Bahrain has imprisoned and revoked the citizenship of more than a dozen people after convicting them of terror charges as the ruling Al Khalifah regime continues with its heavy-handed crackdown on political dissidents in the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom. 
On Thursday, the Fourth High Criminal Court convicted two defendants to 15 years in jail and three others to 10 years behind bars each on charges of “forming a terror cell, running it and recruiting new members.” 
Seven other people were slapped with seven years in jail each. Three others, namely Sheikh Mohammad Ali al-Tal, Mohammad al-A'ali and Ismail Abdulaziz, were sentenced to life imprisonment. 
The trio were also ordered to pay a cash fine of 200,000 Bahraini dinars (over $530,000). 
The court later revoked the citizenship of all the 15 defendants. 
Separately, Bahrain's Supreme Criminal Court sentenced two civilians to 5 years in prison on charge of holding an anti-regime protest in the small village of Jurdab earlier this year, and setting scrap tires ablaze. 
Thousands of anti-regime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the kingdom on February 14, 2011. 
They are demanding that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power and a just system representing all Bahrainis be established. 
Manama has spared no effort to clamp down on the dissent and rights activists. On March 14, 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were deployed to Bahrain to assist the Manama government in its crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of Al Khalifah regime’s crackdown on anti-regime activists. Loading ...",0
25225,"U.S. Stock Markets Hit Record Highs, but Tech Stocks Tumble - Breitbart","U. S. stock markets charged to record highs last week, but a Goldman Sachs downgrade knocked down the so called FAAMG tech stocks that have led the Trump stock boom. [The Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA] rose 89. 44 points, or 0. 42 percent, to close at an    of 21, 271. 97 on June 9. The index, which includes many of America’s largest companies, is up by 7. 64 percent    and up 18. 27 percent in the last 12 months.  Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Bouroujerdi warned that the $600 billion outperformance by the 5 biggest tech stocks known as FAAMG  —   Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet  —   had contributed about 42 percent of all stock market gains over the last year. Goldman worries that the boom has created an “valuation ” similar to the ridiculously high valuations for tech stocks during the   boom, according to Zero Hedge. Bouroujerdi suggested that stock traders consider that after the 500 percent gain for the   NASDAQ index during the   bubble, which lasted from 1995 to 2001, the   bust that lasted until 2003 saw the NASDAQ lose 85% of its valuation. Goldman’s    report on June 9 caused Facebook, Inc. [FB] to tank 3. 3 percent. Amazon. com, Inc. [AMZN] dropped by 3. 16 percent, Apple Inc. AAPL plunged 3. 88 percent, Microsoft Corporation [MSFT] was down by 2. 27 percent, and Google’s parent Alphabet [GOOG] took a 3. 41 percent dive. There have been a tremendous number of doubters in the latest bull market, which has risen by 260. 5 percent since it began on March 9, 2009. During that period, there have been 12 market corrections of at least 5 percent, according to the Advisor Perspectives blog. During that fabulous run, the U. S. total nominal net worth of households and nonprofit organizations has zoomed from $56 trillion to $96 trillion through the end of the first quarter. That works out to about $292, 000 per capita. Stock market bulls highlight the current positive momentum in the real economy. It is widely known that the U. S. unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent inn late 2009 to 4. 3 percent, the lowest level in 16 years. But the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed June 6 that its Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) indicator reached an   record of 6, 044, 000 million jobs available at the end of May. Stock market bears are less optimistic. Billionaire commodity guru Jim Rogers, who correctly called the 2008 crash, told the Business Insider that the current combination of record debt and    real estate and stock valuations means that the next economic crash will be “the biggest in my lifetime. ” A more balanced view of the stock market comes from Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which manages $150 billion. He wrote earlier this month: “Big picture, the near term looks good and the longer term looks scary. ” He added, “[W]e fear that whatever the magnitude of the downturn that eventually comes, whenever it eventually comes, it will likely produce much greater social and political conflict than currently exists. ”",0

25228,Being an Afghan General Is Nice Work if You Can Get It. And Many Do. - The New York Times,"Afghanistan may struggle to recruit enough soldiers for its armed forces, but it’s swimming in generals. The country has close to 1, 000 officers of general rank on its books  —   more than the United States, whose military is three times as large. And off the books? No one knows. New names are added to the roster at a rate far out of proportion to battlefield realities, where the Afghan armed forces  —   the army, national police and intelligence forces, numbering 350, 000 in all  —   have been steadily losing soldiers and territory to the Taliban. Meanwhile, retirements are rare. The United States government, which picks up much of the tab for the Afghan military, can’t pin down the number of generals. “We still don’t know how many police and how many soldiers we’re paying salaries for,” said John F. Sopko, the United States special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction. “We don’t even know how many generals. It is pretty pathetic, and here we are, 15 years into this. ” It’s nice work if you can get it, with fairly good pay, fringe benefits and a pension. So how do you become an Afghan general? Some of them have climbed the command ladder for decades, working hard and surviving purges by successive governments. But others took much easier routes. Suppose you are the young son of a former warlord who has just died. Along with condolences, the government will make you a general, as if the rank were hereditary. Commissions are also handed out as political   to male relatives of important figures. And in the golden age of    —   the 1990s civil war  —   they were sometimes distributed in lieu of pay. In the anarchy that followed the Soviet withdrawal and the fall of the Communist regime, hundreds of generals were born overnight. Sibghatullah Mujadidi, the interim president of the mujahedeen government, which was backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, had little to offer the disheveled fighters who crowded his waiting room, so an aide kept note of whoever asked to become a general. According to Abdul Hafiz Mansour, who ran state television at the time and is now a member of Parliament, a confidant of the president  —   often his son  —   would turn up at the studios every evening to hand the news anchor a list of new generals to declare. One night, he said, there were 38 names. “The list would be handwritten on a plain sheet of paper  —   there was no logo, no official stationery,” Mr. Mansour said. The list sometimes grew mysteriously on the way from the president’s office to the studio. Mr. Mansour said he knew of current generals who had gotten their rank in those days through a little clandestine photocopying and the stroke of a pen. In response to the TV announcements, rival factions across the country would summarily declare their own generals. The former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, who now serves as vice president of Afghanistan, awarded stars to many of the men closest to him, and even printed his own currency to pay them. The joke was that among General Dostum’s bodyguards, there were no colonels.",0
25229,WATCH: They Already Know They’ve Lost As Gingrich Talks Of 2020 ‘Trump Party’ Rematch,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has turned this election season into a complete circus. One of his advisors, former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, said that we may have to deal with his orange face again in 2020. 
In an interview with POLITICO, Gingrich said : “The challenge for everybody’s going to be, ‘What if he gets 48 or 49 percent?’ And what if he says: ‘You know, I like this campaign and stuff. I ain’t leaving’? There will then be a Trump Party.” 
It looks like the Republicans are already planning to obstruct Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if she gets elected. Gingrich said : “I think it’ll be very difficult for the country … I think their message to the Republican leadership will be, ‘You had better prepare to fight her every single day.’” 
Trump broached the subject at a rally in Sanford, Florida. He said that this election is the party’s “last chance.” 
The Trumpkin proclaimed : “Republicans have to finally get smart and come together. This is our last chance. This is bigger than me or any of us. It’s about our country. This is about ending Obamacare. This is about the Supreme Court. This is about rebuilding our military and taking care of our vets, strengthening our borders and keeping our companies and jobs from leaving our beloved country. This is about restoring the rule of law, saving our Constitution and keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.” 
It’s funny that he’s talking about party unity when he spreads divisive, hateful rhetoric, and has for the last year-and-a-half that has split the Republican Party. It became especially bad after the infamous Access Hollywood audio leaked. He has done his best to alienate just about every group out there over the course of his campaign. Hopefully, he will lose to a Hillary Clinton landslide on November 8. Vote Blue!

25230,Van Jones at University of Chicago: Safe Spaces Are a ’Terrible Idea’ - Breitbart,"Speaking at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, CNN contributor Van Jones condemned campus safe spaces, calling them a “terrible idea. ”[  At an event hosted by former Obama staffer David Axelrod, who serves at the Institute of Politics’ Director, Van Jones was asked about the increased demand from students for protection from ideas on college campuses. “There are two ideas about safe spaces. One is a very good idea, and one is a terrible idea. The idea of being physically safe on campus, not being subjected to sexual harassment and physical abuse, or something like that. Being targeted specifically  …    Hey, I’m perfectly fine with that,” Jones claimed. “But there is another view that is now, I think, ascendent  …     It’s a horrible view, which is that ‘I need to be safe ideologically, I need to be safe emotionally, I just need to feel good all the time. And if someone else says something that I don’t like that is a problem for everyone else including the administration,” he continued. Jones suggested that safe spaces from ideas contradict the purpose of a university education: “I think that’s a terrible idea for the following reason: I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take the weights out of the gym. That’s the whole point of the gym.

25232,"Joe Biden Launches ‘American Possibilities’ PAC, Stoking 2020 Rumors","Former Vice President Joe Biden launched a new political action committee Thursday  —   a move certain to stoke rumors that he has his eyes on a 2020 presidential run. [Biden unveiled the “American Possibilities” PAC, giving the former Delaware Democrat the ability to rub shoulders with donors and help candidates in upcoming congressional and gubernatorial races.  “It’s time to reach deep into the soul of this country and once again give everyone  —   and I mean everyone  —   the opportunity to achieve the impossible. It’s time to look beyond   news cycles and   arguments. It’s time to treat each other with dignity and respect. Not as opponents, but as fellow Americans. Because that’s what we are,” Biden says in a statement on the website. “This is a time for big dreams and American possibilities. If that’s what you believe  —   and you’re ready to help elect folks who believe that, and to support groups and causes that embody that spirit  —   then I’m asking you to join me today. ” However, the creation of the PAC will also serve to increase speculation he is eyeing a potential 2020 run  —   nurturing the support of donors and candidates that he will need to clinch the nomination. The New York Times reported that Biden has tapped Greg Schultz, a former aide and a veteran of President Obama’s presidential campaigns, to lead the organization. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008 Biden. He also considered running in 2015 as a primary challenger to eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton  —   but eventually chose not to. Biden has since expressed regret over that decision, and has said that he “never thought [Hillary Clinton] was a great candidate. ”  “I thought I was a great candidate,” he said at a Las Vegas conference in May. Biden has the potential to be a tricky opponent for President Trump. His run would likely be a more centrist campaign than other potential 2020 candidates  —   such as liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He could also challenge Trump’s hold over   white working class areas in places such as Pennsylvania and Michigan  —   states central to Trump’s 2016 victory. The New York Times reported ahead of the announcement that Biden is frustrated that Clinton lost, particularly her failure to pick up votes from white   voters.

25233,Trump Packs His Blunt Phrase Book Abroad - The New York Times,"When Mitt Romney traveled to Europe as a presidential candidate in 2012, he created an uproar when he wondered aloud whether London was sufficiently prepared to host the Summer Olympics. British tabloids derided him as “Mitt the Twit” and CNN declared: “Romney’s Trip Begins in Shambles. ’’ When Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey went on a trade mission to Britain, he was roundly criticized for an errant comment about vaccinations amid a measles outbreak back home. “A Vaccine for Gaffes? Chris Christie Needs It” was the headline in Commentary. Those moments seem quaint when compared with Donald J. Trump’s news conference in Turnberry, Scotland, a day after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Over the course of 40 minutes, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee made pronouncements, predictions and asides that would have set off serious backlash for almost any other candidate. But Mr. Trump seems to be graded on a different curve. Here are some of his more provocative remarks: A reporter asked Mr. Trump about the suggestion from some pundits that both he and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, would be the biggest political beneficiaries of the “Brexit” vote. Mr. Trump agreed that Mr. Putin could gain, and could not resist pointing out that Mr. Putin has been kind to him. “I think he will be probably, because I know how he’s been scorned to a certain extent,” Mr. Trump said, adding later: “He said some very nice things about me. I think he probably is somewhat of a beneficiary. ” Traditionally, candidates for national office in the United States refrain from insulting their own leaders when they’re traveling overseas. But Mr. Trump, who has bucked almost every other tradition, made no exception for this one. “He’s constantly dictating to the world what they should do. The world doesn’t listen to him obviously,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama, who was against Britain leaving the European Union. “He’s embarrassed. ” Candidates also historically do not engage in politics about their own races when traveling abroad. Yet Mr. Trump described Hillary Clinton as a puppet for Mr. Obama, pointing to her support for Britain remaining in the European Union. “She’s always misread everything,” Mr. Trump said. “If he said leave, she would have said leave. She does whatever he wants her to do. You know why, but that’s O. K. ” Politicians are wary of sounding as if they’re cheering for bad economic news, something that voters tend to respond poorly to. But Mr. Trump said that the diminished pound, which   in value after the referendum vote, could benefit his bottom line at Trump Turnberry, his luxury resort and golf course. “When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve been in touch with them but there’s nothing to talk about,” Mr. Trump said. Besides, he added, he would rather have advisers who are divorced from recent global events. “I think I want to use ones that haven’t been involved, take a look at what’s happened in the world,” Mr. Trump said.",0
25234,Former Assistant FBI Director Says Clintons Are A Crime Family,"
A former assistant FBI Director has slammed Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, saying that it is a “cesspool” and that the family is like an organized crime syndicate.
Appearing on a John Catsimatidis’ radio show in the wake of the FBI reopening the case into Hillary Clinton’s home brew email server, James Kallstrom made the remarks while praising GOP nominee Donald Trump as a ‘good human being’ and a ‘patriot’.
“The Clintons, that’s a crime family, basically,” Kallstrom, a 27 year FBI veteran, said. “It’s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.”
“God forbid we put someone like that in the White House,” he added, referring to Hillary.
Kallstrom, a who was assistant Director of the FBI in charge of the New York office during the 1990s, knows all about crime families, having tracked down mobsters, and swindlers for years.
“It’s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money.” Kallstrom said.
The former FBI official, perhaps most well known for his criminal inquiry into the downing of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, said of Hillary “she’s a pathological liar, and she’s always been a liar.”
Referring specifically to the FBI investigation into her email server, Kallstrom said “The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation.”
“That’s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I’m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.” he added, referring to the Attorney General.
“So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.” Kallstrom added, noting that theFBI “left so much stuff on the table”.
Kallstrom also noted that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the top brass at the bureau were directly responsible for holding back the investigation.
“The agents are furious with what’s going on, I know that for a fact,” he said.
On Friday Kallstrom stated that he thinks “something big is going to happen” in the coming days, and that Comey “couldn’t hold onto it any longer” and had to reopen the investigation because had he not, “the locals would have stepped in,” meaning the regular FBI agents who have seen the bombshell evidence against Clinton.
The full interview can be viewed here .
The Washington Post also reported Monday that regular FBI agents have been pushing hard for the Clinton Foundation to be investigated over claims it gave favors and special access to donors.
The report notes that it was the Justice Department that shut down the line of inquiry into the foundation.

25235,Townhall: ’Why the MSM Is Ignoring Trump’s Sex Trafficking Busts’ - Breitbart,"Liz Crokin of Townhall. com recently published an article titled “Why the MSM Is Ignoring Trump’s Sex Trafficking Busts” discussing the arrests of sex criminals under Donald Trump’s presidency and why it has been underreported by mainstream outlets. [Since President Donald Trump has been sworn in on Jan. 20, authorities have arrested an unprecedented number of sexual predators involved in child sex trafficking rings in the United States. This should be one of the biggest stories in the national news. Instead, the mainstream media has barely, if at all, covered any of these mass pedophile arrests. This begs the question  —   why? As a strong advocate for sex crime victims, I’ve been closely following the pedophile arrests since Trump took office. There have been a staggering   arrests in one short month compare that to less than 400 sex   arrests in 2014 according to the FBI. It’s been clear to me for awhile that Trump would make human trafficking a top priority. On October 8, 2012, Trump tweeted: ‘Got to do something about these missing children grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents  —   fast trial, death penalty. Crokin then goes on to discuss the MILO controversy.  As the MSM has ignored these historical arrests, they have zeroed in on casting conservative icon Milo Yiannopoulos as a monster. They claim he supports pedophilia based on comments he made in a video years ago. The reality is Milo was a victim of child sex abuse, and although he did joke about his abuse in an interview, he in no way promotes pedophilia. The opposite is true, and he addressed this controversy head on in a press conference. Not only is it normal for sex abuse victims to make light of their abuse as a coping mechanism, Milo has personally taken down and exposed pedophiles in his columns over the years. However, the mainstream media and the left ignored this information and demonized Milo. The irony of all this is that the left and MSM have been the biggest proponents of pedophilia. Salon has published articles attempting to normalize pedophilia however, to maintain their faux outrage over Milo, they deleted them. The face of the very fake news network CNN, Jake Tapper, fired off several tweets condemning Milo. For example, he tweeted: ‘My friend, a survivor of sex trafficking: “Milo straight up defended abusing 13 yr old boys  …    Please don’t let that be normalized’ If Tapper is so concerned with sex trafficking, why in the world hasn’t he covered the massive sex trafficking arrests that have taken place since Trump took office? It seems he, and many in the leftist media, are only concerned with sex trafficking if it can be used to destroy a conservative. Read the full article here.",0
25236,Whoa! Even DEMOCRATS Are Now Asking What’s The Difference Between Bill Clinton And Bill Cosby,"0 comments 
Man, you’ve got to hand it to WikiLeaks, for being such a hero in these last seconds of the race when the truth is needed the most. A new batch of damning evidence has just dropped and this time…what was found in them has to do with Bill Clinton…AND Bill Cosby. 
Pop some popcorn, you’re in for a treat… 
Further proof Democrats are my favorite definition of ‘stupid’ 
They see the truth, they know the truth, still decided to push the lie…. 
This latest little revolution comes from an email in which Ron Klain, Chief of Staff to Joe Biden, posited a rather obvious series of questions to Camp Cankles: 
a. Is [Bill’s] conduct relevant to your campaign? b. You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused [your husband]? c. Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies? d. How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? 
Well hey, and this whole time we thought the Democrats were trying to ignore Cosby! He’s getting some attention after all. 
Interestingly, Jake Sullivan of Camp Cankles couldn’t come up with an answer to Klain’s question. So he punted to John Podesta. 
Okay, so while the campaign is doing everything they can to target Donald Trump for his alleged nastiness, a the way back in January of this year, Clinton’s campaign was wondering how they were going to handle Hillary’s rapey chain and balls. 
Not only that, at least Ron Klain noticed that Hillary was being a dastardly hypocrite on the rape issue. “b. You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused [your husband]? c. Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?” 
Hillary’s camp knew the issue would come up, sure. They were prepping their candidate for all the cannon balls lobbed her way. Because even the campaign knew Hillary couldn’t hide behind a tampon-shield for everything. Especially a “woman’s” issue. Like her husband raping the ladies. 
Just goes to show even the Democrats knew Billy’s rapescapades were a problem. 
YIKES! This right here is what might be going into the White House. People that don’t seek the truth, but scramble to hide it with further lies and scheming ideas. 
It’s sickening…but mostly, terrifying. To have this kind of crap in the White House…spells doom. Related Items",0
25237,Nanny In Jail After Force Feeding Baby To Death,"Nanny In Jail After Force Feeding Baby To Death 2 shares by Ike Mclean / October 27, 2016 / LIFE / 
Oluremi Oyindasola, 66, of Glenarden, Maryland has been charged with second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death and other offenses, after she force fed an eight-month-old baby girl who then died. 
Home surveillance footage shows Oyindasola was napping when the eight-month-old child began crying and approached the nanny in a toddler walker. 
Police say Oyindasola then tried to feed the child, and when her attempt was unsuccessful, she “proceeded to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the victim’s mouth.” 
Col. Harry Bond with Prince George’s County Police told NBC Washington Oyindasola “forcefully poured the two bottles of what looks to be milk down the baby’s mouth, causing her to not be able to breathe, suffocating her, and eventually she died at the hospital.” 
In a news release Prince George’s County Police said the following: 
“On October 24th, at about 4.10pm, the baby had been rushed to a hospital after she became unresponsive at home. 
“She was pronounced dead a short time later. An autopsy on Tuesday revealed the baby’s cause of death was asphyxiation. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.” 
“The preliminary investigation revealed the injuries to the baby occurred while in the sole care and custody of Oyindasola.” 
Oyindasol is currently in police custody and is being held on $1 million bond.

In the Beginning, when the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was on the face of the deep, Satan said, “It doesn’t get any better than this”! 
And God said, “Let there be light! “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb, and the fruit tree yielding fruit”. 
And God saw that it was good. 
And Satan said, “There goes the neighborhood”! 
God then created man and woman and saw that they were lean and fit. 
God populated the earth with broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and green and yellow vegetables. 
Satan said, “ I know how I can get back in this game”, and created the cheeseburger. 
And man said, “Supersize the fries”, and gained 5 pounds. 
Satan brought forth chocolate and Woman gained 5 pounds. 
Satan then brought forth fried chicken and fried steak so big, that it needed its own platter. 
And man’s cholesterol went through the roof! 
And God sent running shoes and man resolved to lose weight. 
But Satan brought forth the remote control and ESPN and ESPN 2, and Man gained another 20 pounds. 
And God said, “You’re running up the score Devil”, and brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition. 
And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. 
And man clutched his remote and ate the potato chips, swaddled in cholesterol, and went into cardiac arrest. 
And Satan said, “This is good”! 
And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery. 
And Satan created HMO’s and Obamacare!

25245,"VIDEO: Armed Employee Sneaks up Behind Armed Suspect, Foils Robbery Attempt - Breitbart","An armed employee at Cleveland, Ohio’s Convenient Food Mart, crept up behind an armed suspect and foiled a robbery attempt. [The incident occurred in the Stockyards district around 10:45 pm Saturday.  According to Cleveland. com, the suspect,    Frederick Thornton, walked into the business wearing a surgical mask, pointed a gun at the    clerk, and demanded money. He allegedly became aggravated with the clerk’s pace and “smacked his gun against the register,” demanding the money be handed over quicker. Banging against the register and screaming at the clerk caused enough noise that a    working in the back of the store noticed the commotion, retrieved a handgun, and went out to intervene. The video shows the employee sneak up behind Thornton and put the gun against his back.  Thornton then spun around. The two began to wrestle for control of the guns. An employee came out from behind the counter, took away Thornton’s gun and fired warning shots into the air. Thornton then put his hands in the air at the sound of gunfire and asked the employees “not to shoot. ” While one employee held Thornton at gunpoint, the second armed employee ran outside to see if any accomplices were waiting on Thornton to exit the store. Police soon arrived, arrested Thornton, and charged him with “aggravated robbery. ” Store owner Haytham Mustafa expressed pride in the way his employees handled the situation. He said, “Thank God no one was hurt. They really handled it well. They didn’t go overboard and didn’t hurt anyone. That’s what we wanted to do  —   hold him and let the law deal with him. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

25247,Federal Judge Blocks Trump Immigration Order Nationwide - Breitbart,"In an unusual move, a federal judge in Washington State granted a nationwide emergency order on Friday night blocking President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration travel, declaring the order unconstitutional. The Trump Justice Department can now appeal the order on an expedited basis. [Washington Attorney General Robert Ferguson filed suit against the president and the U. S. Department of Homeland Security in U. S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on behalf of his state and the State of Minnesota, alleging that the order violates the U. S. Constitution and multiple federal statutes. The plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order to halt the order on an emergency basis.  In its amended complaint, the plaintiffs argue that “practices that discriminate against any of [Washington’s] inhabitants because of race, creed, color, or national origin are matters of public concern that threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare, health, and peace of the people. ” Washington argued that roughly 7, 280 aliens in the Evergreen State are from countries impacted by the president’s order, and that the state has legal standing to litigate over possible economic detriments that companies within the state would endure as a result of the order. The   lawsuit argued that President Trump’s executive order violated a host of constitutional rights and federal statutes. While this included typical claims relating to Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection, it also included what many legal scholars consider weak claims, such an insisting that the order amounts to an unconstitutional establishment of religion, and that it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). A temporary restraining order (TRO) is one of the most extreme measures a federal court can take, often issued without full briefing, argument, and other central elements of judicial process. As such they are very rare, reserved for situations where the court cannot even go through an accelerated legal process to grant a preliminary injunction. Judge James L. Robart issued the order orally at the end of this afternoon’s court hearing in Seattle, declaring that the plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of ultimately prevailing on the legal merits of the case, that without the TRO the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm, and that issuing the TRO is in the public interest. The brief notation posted on the court docket after the verbal order specifies that a written order will be filed later, providing greater detail. In the meantime it is not entirely clear which of the ten counts Judge Robart —  who was appointed to the bench by George W. Bush —  thinks the executive order violates. The U. S. Department of Justice can immediately appeal this ruling to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, though it will be difficult to do so before Judge Robart releases his written opinion. If that San   appeals court affirms the order, then the federal government can seek an emergency stay from the U. S. Supreme Court. The case is Washington v. Trump, 2:  .

25251,"Patti chiari, sudditanza lunga, di Manlio Dinucci","français English 
Dopo aver chiamato gli italiani a votare Sì al referendum, ingerendosi nella nostra politica nazionale col complice silenzio dell’opposizione parlamentare, il presidente Obama ha confermato al «buon amico Matteo» che con l’Italia gli Usa hanno «patti chiari, amicizia lunga». 
Non c’è dubbio che i patti siano chiari, anzitutto il Patto atlantico che sottomette l’Italia agli Usa. Il Comandante supremo alleato in Europa viene sempre nominato dal Presidente degli Stati uniti d’America e sono in mano agli Usa tutti gli altri comandi chiave. 
Dopo la fine della guerra fredda, in seguito alla disgregazione dell’Urss, Washington affermava la «fondamentale importanza di preservare la Nato quale canale della influenza e partecipazione statunitensi negli affari europei, impedendo la creazione di dispositivi unicamente europei che minerebbero la struttura di comando dell’Alleanza», ossia il comando Usa. Concetto ribadito dal segretario della Nato Stoltenberg nella recente tavola rotonda sulla «grande idea di Europa»: «Dobbiamo assicurare che il rafforzamento della difesa europea non costituisca un duplicato della Nato, non divenga una alternativa alla Nato». A garanzia di ciò c’è il fatto che 22 dei 28 paesi della Ue (21 su 27 dopo l’uscita della Gran Bretagna) fanno parte della Nato sotto comando Usa, riconosciuta dall’Unione europea quale «fondamento della difesa collettiva». 
La politica estera e militare della Ue è quindi fondamentalmente subordinata alla strategia statunitense, su cui convergono le potenze europee i cui contrasti d’interesse si ricompattano quando entra in gioco il loro interesse fondamentale: mantenere il predominio dell’Occidente, sempre più vacillante di fronte all’emergere di nuovi soggetti statuali e sociali. Basti pensare che l’Organizzazione di Shanghai per la cooperazione, nata dall’accordo strategico cino-russo, dispone di risorse tali da farne la maggiore area economica integrata del mondo. 
Nel quadro della strategia Usa/Nato – documenta la Casa Bianca – l’Italia si distingue quale «saldo e attivo alleato degli Stati uniti». Lo dimostra il fatto che «l’Italia ospita oltre 30 mila militari e funzionari civili del Dipartimento Usa della difesa in installazioni dislocate in tutto il paese». 
Allo stesso tempo l’Italia è «partner degli Usa per la sicurezza globale», fornendo forze militari e finanziamenti per una vasta gamma di «sfide»: in Kossovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libia, Siria, Baltico e altrove, ossia ovunque è stata e viene impiegata la macchina da guerra Usa/Nato. 
Un ultimo fatto conferma quale sia il rapporto Usa-Italia: stanno per arrivare alla base di Amendola in Puglia, probabilmente l’8 novembre, i primi due dei 90 caccia F-35 della statunitense Lockheed Martin, che l’Italia si è impegnata ad acquistare. 
Il costo della partecipazione dell’Italia al programma F-35, quale partner di secondo livello, è ufficialemente quantificato nella Legge di stabilità 2016: 12 miliardi 356 milioni di euro di denaro pubblico, più altre spese per le continue modifiche al caccia che ancora non è pienamente operativo e necessiterà di continui ammodernamenti. Nonostante ciò – conferma Analisi Difesa – l’Italia avrà una «sovranità limitata» sugli stessi F-35 della propria aeronautica. Una legge statunitense vieta che i «dati di missione» (i software di gestione dei sistemi di combattimento dei caccia) siano comunicati ad altri. Saranno dunque gli Usa a controllare gli F-35 italiani, predisposti per l’uso delle nuove bombe nucleari B61-12 che il Pentagono schiererà contro la Russia, al posto delle attuali B-61, sul nostro territorio «nazionale».",0
25252,Emails and Groping: Our Halloween Election Keeps Scaring Us to Death,"Emails and Groping: Our Halloween Election Keeps Scaring Us to Death   
Informed Comment. 
All Hallow’s Eve, contracted now to Halloween, became conflated with the Scottish and Irish pagan Samhain, the harvest festival marking the end of autumn and the beginning of winter. It was an in-between time, when the barrier between this world and the next shimmered and let in decrepit old sprites and gods and monsters that had begun slipping away into the aether with the advent of Christianity. And, the souls of the dead of the past year intruded to visit their homes before being shunted off to the netherworld, as well. Since Celts thought power resided in the head, they often beheaded defeated enemies, so All Hallow’s Eve was the occasion for a fair amount of fumbling about on the part of those who had died violently. 
The 2016 election is very much like Samhain, i.e. like Halloween, in breaking down ordinary time and reality, and letting ogres of the past into our daily lives. 
So we can’t get out of our minds the image of those tiny hands, back in 1982, and 1996, and 1998, grabbing parts of strangers’ anatomy. The simulacrum of the grabber and kisser and predator has popped out into 2016 and wants to replace George Washington and Ike Eisenhower. We are being asked, with a straight face, to elect a groper in chief. A puritan people who drove Gary Hart from politics for some hanky panky on The Monkey Business and impeached Bill Clinton even though he never got to third base, is now all right with making president someone who groped a porn star and then offered to drop $10,000 when he couldn’t get his way. We are entranced and willing to give our fates into the hands of a weird combination of Frankenstein’s monster and the Vampire Lestat. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
The horror of Halloween always lies in the evil deeds of the past now resurrected, as with Syrian director Moustapha Akkad’s “Halloween” films. 
And we’ve had to hear again about the soiled blue dress and the conquests of Bill. 
And again about the Anthony Weiner sexting. And to learn what we never wanted to know, that the FBI is investigating him for sexting with a minor. I mean, if that isn’t a Halloween horror movie I don’t know what is. 
And Herbert Hoover has come back to tell us we’re in a Great Depression and the only way to get out of it is to halt budget deficits and tighten our belts and lower taxes on the rich (the opposite of how FDR actually got us out of the Depression). The creepy dead and the blighted fading deities of old have come crowding through our 2016 rift in the time space continuum. Long-since failed and discredited trickle down economics has been cheekily resurrected. Why, if only you give more of the nation’s money to the super-rich, they’ll make you rich too. You’ll see. Just wait. And wait. And wait. 
It is as though the worst nightmares of the old Soviet Communists finally came through, but with all the irony of history, only after they themselves had faded into the netherworld. 
( Human Rights 
And then there is the revived horror of the Japanese internment and the exclusion of Holocaust-threatened Jews from the United States, only with the perverse magic of Samhain the Japanese have become Mexicans and the Jews have become their spiritual cousins, the Muslims, the other Abrahamians. 
So no wonder Hillary Clinton’s emails can’t be killed. They are Undead emails, slipping in at the fraying of dimensional reality in this season of resurrected monsters and corpses, to haunt us. 
Only the silver stake of an actual election can finally kill these spiteful specters, and save us from this long night of phantasy horror. TAGS:",0

This overunity energy generator does not need any fuel to work and has the ability to harness the energy of the environment. In the video, the generator is buried underground and salty water is poured on top of it. The only part of the generator that is above the ground is the wire for connecting to electronic devices.
From YouTube.com :
This movie I found on a torrent site about a year ago, I have no idea what they are saying, who they are, or when it was shot, but clearly it is a very interesting movie showing how this man gets energy from the earth to power light bulbs and other things! Look closely at his homemade rectifiers, spark gap, etc. Maybe a giant joule thief? Who knows? If anyone can translate for us, we would appreciate it a bunch.

25257,Boosting levels of glutathione with N-acetyl-cysteine may prevent metabolic declines associated with aging,"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © drshel.com Researchers at Oregon State University have found that a specific detoxification compound, glutathione, helps resist the toxic stresses of everyday life -- but its levels decline with age and this sets the stage for a wide range of age-related health problems. A new study, published in the journal Redox Biology , also highlighted a compound -- N-acetyl-cysteine, or NAC -- that is already used in high doses in medical detoxification emergencies. But the researchers said that at much lower levels NAC might help maintain glutathione levels and prevent the routine metabolic declines associated with aging. In that context, the research not only offers some profound insights into why the health of animals declines with age, but specifically points to a compound that might help prevent some of the toxic processes involved. Decline of these detoxification pathways , scientists say, are causally linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer , some of the primary causes of death in the developed world. ""We've known for some time of the importance of glutathione as a strong antioxidant,"" said Tory Hagen, lead author on the research and the Helen P. Rumbel Professor for Health Aging Research in the Linus Pauling Institute at OSU. ""What this study pointed out was the way that cells from younger animals are far more resistant to stress than those from older animals,"" said Hagen, also a professor of biochemistry in the OSU College of Science. ""In young animal cells, stress doesn't cause such a rapid loss of glutathione. The cells from older animals, on the other hand, were quickly depleted of glutathione and died twice as fast when subjected to stress. ""But pretreatment with NAC increased glutathione levels in the older cells and largely helped offset that level of cell death."" Glutathione, Hagen said, is such an important antioxidant that its existence appears to date back as far as oxygen-dependent, or aerobic life itself -- about 1.5 billion years. It's a principal compound to detoxify environmental stresses, air pollutants, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and many other toxic insults. In this study, scientists tried to identify the resistance to toxins of young cells, compared to those of older cells. They used a toxic compound called menadione to stress the cells, and in the face of that stress the younger cells lost significantly less of their glutathione than older cells did. The glutathione levels of young rat cells never decreased to less than 35 percent of its initial level, whereas in older rat cells glutathione levels plummeted to 10 percent of their original level. NAC, the researchers said, is known to boost the metabolic function of glutathione and increase its rate of synthesis. It's already used in emergency medicine to help patients in a toxic crisis, such as ingestion of poisonous levels of heavy metals. It's believed to be a very safe compound to use even at extremely high levels -- and the scientists are hypothesizing that it might have significant value at much lower doses to maintain glutathione levels and improve health. ""I'm optimistic there could be a role for this compound in preventing the increased toxicity we face with aging, as our abilities to deal with toxins decline,"" Hagen said. ""We might be able to improve the metabolic resilience that we're naturally losing with age."" Also of interest, Hagen said, is the wide range of apparent detoxification potential offered by glutathione. Higher levels of it -- boosted by NAC -- might help reduce the toxicity of some prescription drugs, cancer chemotherapies , and treat other health issues. ""Using NAC as a prophylactic, instead of an intervention, may allow glutathione levels to be maintained for detoxification in older adults,"" the researchers wrote in their conclusion.

25258,Donald Trump threatens to jail Hillary Clinton,"Email 
The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could ""be in jail"" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. 

ABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. 
""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words — his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth."" 
Donald Trump: ""If I win, I'm going to instruct my attorney general"" to investigate Clinton https://t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https://t.co/IWGVUleEtr 
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high."" 
""And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,"" she said. ""But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything."" 
She mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. 
Clinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldn't do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. 
""He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility,"" she said. 
Trump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obama's birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the ""33,000 emails you deleted."" 
""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" Trump said. ""Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And we're going to have a special prosecutor."" 
Clinton said everything Trump said was ""absolutely false"" but she was ""not surprised."" 
""Oh really?"" Trump interjected. 
Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in fact-checking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying ""you'd be in jail"" during his potential administration.",0

""Organizers of a criminal group, who are nationalists from the Russian Federation, proceeded from the fact that the government of Montenegro chaired by Milo Djukanovic would not be changed as a result of elections, so one had to overthrow the government by force,"" the prosecutor said, Pravda.Ru reports. Pravda.Ru asked an expert opinion from an expert at the Institute of European Studies, Stevan Gayich. ""Is it a provocation of the pro-Western government? Who is standing behind it?"" ""What the prosecutor's office of Montenegro, and the Djukanovic regime in general, have been doing recently can be described as walking in the fog. The opposition does not recognize the elections, and the government has found itself in a deep political crisis. Djukanovic has already announced that he will not be prime minister if his Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) forms the government. The socialists already say that the DPS has supposedly formed a government, meaning that Montenegro is sure to be a NATO member. In fact, however, the government has not been formed. They defend the interests of the West, so the fight has risen to a higher geopolitical level. ""No evidence has been provided. In my opinion, this story is completely fabricated in a very poor way to stir up some noise during the elections and create an atmosphere of fear among opposition voters."" ""How should Russia respond?"" ""Russia should at least respond on the level of diplomacy. Montenegro, as a historically Serbian state, used to be a pro-Russian country. NATO bombed Montenegro 15 years ago, and one had to completely change the identity of the people to make Montenegro a NATO member. One of the key points of the identity of the people of Montenegro, the Serbian people, is their attachment to Russia. One had to strike a serious blow on this peculiarity of the people of Montenegro to create a new identity."" On October 16, Montenegro held parliamentary elections. Twenty Serbian citizens were detained on suspicion of preparing a terrorist attack and a coup on the election day. According to preliminary data, the people wanted to attack citizens and police officers who gathered in front of the parliament with a view to proclaim the victory of one of the political parties and imprison the prime minister of Montenegro. Pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic won the elections. Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru",0
25266,PHOTO: The Creepy Bernie Sanders Pic That Hillary Leaked To Press,"Here’s The Shocking Reason Why You Need To Know If Your Doctor Is Republican Or a Democrat 
Former president Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, sent an email with attached photo to Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton’s national press secretary. 
According to the email, Podesta wanted to post the image to Twitter, but Fallon suggested giving it to the New York Post. Flournoy said she would send more information about the event, including those who attended. 
The Post didn’t run the story, but gossip writer Perez Hilton did, and he included all of the details about the event. The following week, the media ran several stories that raised questions about Sanders attending fundraisers for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Advertisement - story continues below 
Here it is, whether you’ve ever wanted to see Sanders’ legs or not: 
Talk about creepy. It looked like Clinton had her team stalking Sanders, looking for any opportunity to embarrass him or make him look bad. This was apparently the plan from day one. 
It’s true that the last place Sanders should have been caught hanging out after railing against Wall Street was poolside at a plush resort on Martha’s Vineyard, but the heart of this email revealed who the Democrats are, which is nothing but a selfish, money-grubbing group of people who are as mean-spirited as their leader .

25271,Hezbollah Says Military Leader Died in Artillery Attack - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah declared Saturday that Mustafa Amine Badreddine, the senior commander who died in Syria this past week, had been killed in an artillery attack by insurgents whom the group has been fighting for the past four years. Hezbollah said in a statement that the killing would increase “our determination to continue the fight against these criminal gangs and defeat them,” blaming “takfiri groups,” a term for Islamist extremists that Hezbollah broadly applies to insurgents opposed to its ally in Syria, President Bashar  . But the declaration raised more questions than it answered, as fierce speculation continued about how, when, where and by whom Mr. Badreddine was killed, and what the death reveals about the state of Hezbollah and its war effort in Syria. A day earlier, when Hezbollah announced his death, Lebanese media outlets sympathetic to the group initially blamed Israel, the group’s main enemy, for the attack. Israel is widely believed to have assassinated several senior Hezbollah commanders over the past few decades and has carried out a number of airstrikes in Syria, officially unacknowledged but confirmed by Western officials, against the group. If Israel was not responsible  —   as numerous Israeli analysts have suggested  —   that would ease the pressure from Hezbollah’s supporters to retaliate. Retaliation could risk igniting a war on Lebanon’s southern frontier at a time when the group, stretched thin because of its operations in Syria, cannot easily afford to open a new front. On the other hand, if insurgents managed to pull off the assassination of a senior Hezbollah figure, rather than merely getting off a lucky shot with the usually imprecise attack of an artillery bombardment, that could be embarrassing for Hezbollah. The group has presented itself as outmatching the insurgents in Syria and preventing them from expanding into Lebanon. Such an attack would make Hezbollah appear newly and surprisingly vulnerable to insurgent foes who had not demonstrated that degree of operational or   sophistication. “If one of their lead figures can be killed in a secure area by one of those groups, it would send a signal that they are far weaker than presented,” said Phillip Smyth, an American analyst who studies Hezbollah and other Shiite militias fighting in Syria. Adding to the mystery is that Syrian opposition monitoring groups and residents of Damascus, the capital, say there had been no major shelling over the past week near the Damascus airport, where, Hezbollah said, the attack took place. And no insurgent group has taken responsibility for the attack  —   surprising given that the array of insurgents, from the Islamic State to Syrian Army defectors, would presumably be eager to do so. Despite rivalries and disagreements among them, they all view Hezbollah as a mortal enemy aiding Mr. Assad in crushing a popular uprising against him. Some of Mr. Assad’s opponents have speculated that Mr. Badreddine may have been killed in Khan Touman, in northern Syria. According to Iranian news outlets, a number of Iranian fighters and allied militia members, including Hezbollah members, have been killed there in insurgent attacks over the past week. The killing also raises questions about operational security. As it expands in Syria, Hezbollah has begun working with many Syrian militia members, some of whom could be double agents. The attack could also mean that a rebel or jihadist group worked with a foreign intelligence agency to pinpoint and attack Mr. Badreddine, said Ali Rizk, a Lebanese analyst close to Hezbollah. Hezbollah’s statement said the attack underscored its view of the Syrian war as being of a piece with its fight against Israel. The group sees the insurgents opposed to Mr. Assad and his closest ally, Hezbollah’s patron Iran, as being allied with the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia.",0

LONDON city police have confirmed today that they had to “move on” Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales this morning after he was found to be begging on the side of the street. 
The 50-year-old entrepreneur was given a verbal warning by the police, who told him he was “making the place look bad”, and that he should try selling Big Issue magazines, or roses, like everyone else if he wants to make a few pound. 
Mr. Wales, who co-founded the online non-profit encyclopedia, claimed he was trying to raise money for his organisation in a bid to fund it, and denied any wrongdoing on his part. 
“Wikipedia doesn’t rely on online advertising revenue, so we have to find other means of raising money to keep it going,” he told WWN, “I’ve tried busking, but I’m a terrible singer and people just booed me off the street. I said this morning I’d give begging a go, but the police in London are quite strict about that kind of thing and I was told to clear off”. 
The grandson of four later added that he might try raising money as a street entertainer instead, and paint himself from head to toe in grey, cement like paint, stating he’s very good at staying still. 
“I’ve sent millions of emails to people around the world, asking them for a few bob, but you’d swear I was asking for their first born or something,” he added, ” Less than 1% of our readers give, but yet Wikipedia solves millions of drunken debates every minute; from who is your man starring in that film, to explaining the observational theory in quantum mechanics. Wiki saves time, and sometimes lives”.

Ed Balls is using gangs of armed thugs to intimidate those who would come between him and the Strictly crown. 
The news comes after fellow contestant Gorka Marquez was beaten up in Blackpool by card-carrying New Labour thugs. 
Balls has been accused of using a win-at-all-costs mentality that might have helped him to a more successful career in politics. 
Marquez’s kicking comes just weeks after Will Young sensationally quit the show after being cornered in an alleyway by a tooled-up Alistair Campbell.

25280,How WH Staff Is Preparing For A Possible Hillary Presidency [Cartoon],"You are here: Home / political cartoon / How WH Staff Is Preparing For A Possible Hillary Presidency [Cartoon] How WH Staff Is Preparing For A Possible Hillary Presidency [Cartoon] October 26, 2016 
Robert Gehl asks if you remember back in 2001, when the Clinton’s backed a U-Haul truck to the rear-end of the White House and took off with a bunch of publicly owned furniture and other treasures? 
Yeah… that was pretty embarrassing. Probably something you wouldn’t want to repeat. 
But then again, you’re not Hillary Clinton. 
According to another recently unclassified FBI interview, Clinton and her staff were seen removing furniture and lamps from the State Department offices early in 2009 as soon as she took office as secretary. Hillary was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. 
The agent – who is now an investigator with the Department of Homeland Security – said he had no idea whether or not the items were ever returned to the taxpayers. 
Back in 2001, after The Washington Post broke the story, the Clintons said they would reimburse the taxpayers $86,000 for the items they stole that were actually government property, LifeZette reports . 
They also returned another $28,000 worth of furniture a few days later. 
In addition to stealing all that furniture back in 2001, you’ll recall they even removed the “W”s from all the keyboards in a juvenile and childish stunt to upset the incoming administration of George “W.” Bush. 
Theft of taxpayer items from the State Department were not the only revelations in the FBI interview, The Washington Examiner is reporting . 
In its notes, the FBI writes: “Prior to Clinton’s tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State’s protective detail was seen as an honor and a privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of Clinton’s tenure it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.”",0
25283,С любовью… С природой…,"Природа 
Вырубка лесов, убийства животных для изготовления шуб завзятых модниц, загрязнение мирового океана, разрушение озонового слоя и, наконец, глобальное потепление — лишь первые пункты в списке бедствий, которые терпит старушка Земля. Но не стоит паниковать и копить на билет к Марсу. Величайшие умы нашей планеты, упоённые желанием жить в идеальном мире, нашли способ спасти матушку-природу. Всё, что для этого требуется — заняться с ней сексом. Сексом! С природой! 
Величайшие умы — это не нобелевские лауреаты, а австралийские активистки Энни Спринкл и Элизабет Стивенс. Дамочки призывают весь мир спасать окружающую среду весьма нетрадиционным способом. Выкиньте лопаты и перестаньте сажать деревья, лучше примкните к сообществу экосексуалов — людей, которые спасают природу совокуплением в парках. По мнению Энни и Элизабет, наша планета страдает вовсе не от выбросов вредных веществ, а от нехватки радости и любви! Девушки не признают вегетарианцев, отказавшихся от употребления мяса. Не жалуют активистки и людей, променявших свои автомобили на велосипеды. Приверженцы экотуризма у них тоже не в почёте. Всё это совершенно неэффективно и бесполезно! Единственный способ спасти природу — заняться с ней любовью! В самом прямом смысле. 
Тем простофилям, которые никогда не занимались сексом с растениями, девушки напоминают — чтобы улучшить экологическую обстановку, достаточно поваляться в грязи и получить от этого оргазм, или просто побегать в лесу в костюме Адама. Природа это поймёт и примет. Допустимо мастурбировать возле водопада и использовать в любовных ласках растения. Полный список спасательно-сексуальных процедур отражён в «Манифесте экосексуалов», написанным Энни и Элизабет. Девушки продемонстрировали собственную версию защиты природы в одном из австралийских парков. По их утверждениям, к движению примкнуло уже 100 000 неравнодушных. 
Вероятно, активистки делают ставку на то, что берёзовая веточка, ранее активно участвовавшая в мастурбации, освободившись от рук насильника, превратится, буквально через несколько часов, в 20-летнее дерево. А лес, по которому пробежала голая девушка, от увиденного выбросит в воздух столько кислорода, что в атмосфере вовсе не останется углекислого газа. Мастурбация вблизи водоёма прибавит +10 к карме участника процесса, и нейтрализует сотни лет антропогенного воздействия. Главное — не халтурить! Природа обязательно почувствует, если вы не доведёте себя до высшей точки блаженства. 
Любопытно, что на днях в Тбилиси задержали голого мужчину, который бродил по городу. Естественно, сотрудники полиции сразу же узрели в нем экосексуала и начали высматривать поблизости какой-нибудь сексуально озабоченный фикус. К всеобщему огорчению оказалось, что мужчина не вносил лепту в спасение Земли, а бродил голым в результате психического расстройства. Да уж, экосексуалов и душевно больных действительно легко спутать… Но это уже вопрос психиатрии.",0

After a busy weekend interviewing job candidates, President-elect Donald Trump prepared Monday to begin filling out his economic and national security teams and outline his emerging White House agenda. 
“We’ve made a couple of deals,” Trump told reporters after a weekend of meetings with with no less than 21 job candidates at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. 
Transition aides said they would release a video Monday in which the president-elect discusses plans and “legislative priorities” for the Trump administration that begins Jan. 20. 
Topics include trade, notably Trump ‘s opposition to the now-probably-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian nations; energy development and “job-killing” regulations governing shale and clean coal; national security, with an emphasis on cybersecurity; and immigration, including alleged abuse of visa programs to undercut American workers, said transition aide Jason Miller. 
Trump has more meetings on Monday, including one with Rick Perry. The former governor of Texas and ex-rival in the Republican primaries has been mentioned for a number of slots in Trump ‘s Cabinet, including the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, and Agriculture. 
The president also met with a fairly prominent Democrat: U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who backed Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primaries. A military veteran, Gabbard has been a vocal critic of VA medical services. 
In a statement released Monday Gabbard said “while the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump , I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. 
“President-elect Trump and I had a frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth,” Gabbard said. “I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world,” Gabbard continued. 
Also Monday Trump met with former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. After the meeting Brown told reporters that he spoke with Trump about being head of the VA. 
“He’s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under consideration. I’m glad that he called. He’s going to obviously meet other folks, and we should know, I would think, probably after Thanksgiving,” Brown said. “I think I’m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there and I don’t look at it as a competition.” 
Trump also met with Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin who said she was not offered a position but that the meeting was just a start. ",0
25289,NBC Attacks Trump for Switching to iPhone for Security Reasons - Breitbart,"NBC published an article titled “Trump Now Uses an iPhone  —   Despite Once Calling for an Apple Boycott” to attack the president for switching from his potentially vulnerable Android handset to an iPhone. [The article begins by directly stating that the reason for President Trump’s switch to the   handset is for security reasons: “President Donald Trump is finally using an Apple iPhone, despite once calling for a boycott of the company’s products, after concerns that the Android handset he was reportedly using was unsecured. ”  “A number of reports have suggested Trump was using a Samsung Galaxy S3 running Google’s Android operating system, a point which has never officially been confirmed,” the article notes. “The New York Times reported in January that the phone was unsecured. This means that it is vulnerable to hackers, something of great concern because the president of the U. S. would be a key hacking target. ” The article then focuses on Trump’s use of the more secure Apple device, citing the president’s past criticism of the iPhone manufacturer for refusing to unlock the phone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook. “During a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings. In this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the order “chilling” and did not assist. ” “During a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings,” NBC notes. “In this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter.

25290,"Review: In ‘Independence Day: Resurgence,’ the Fault Is Not in the Fireworks - The New York Times","If you’ve seen one movie apocalypse, you have seen them all, at least if it was directed by Roland Emmerich. For the last two decades, Mr. Emmerich has carved out his own perverse subgenre with   about   in which a happy few fight, joke and triumph despite alien invasion, a radioactive lizard, the Mayan calendar, melting polar ice and scene after scene of   mayhem. Even when he scales down, narrowing his cinematic gun sights on smaller stories (“White House Down”) Mr. Emmerich goes big and then bigger. So, here he is again, going once more unto the blockbuster breach with “Independence Day: Resurgence,” a sequel to “Independence Day,” his amusing 1996   behemoth. The earlier movie is best remembered for its shocker of a sales pitch: a shot of the White House being blown up by a shaft of alien light, an image that was as giddily funny as it was horrific to contemplate. Needless to say, thinking deeply if at all has never been something that Mr. Emmerich encourages. For the most part, his movies are engineered to generate autonomic responses, with frenetic visuals and booming noises that activate the    response, which in turn produces arousal. That’s the hope, although “Resurgence” is likely to spur more   than popping. All you really need to know about the story is that it took multiple men to cook up this pottage, which hinges on another extraterrestrial invasion and humanity battling aliens as other familiar struggles erupt: technological determinism versus technophobia, secular universalism versus heroic individualism. Five writers actually put their names on the script, including Mr. Emmerich and his longtime collaborator Dean Devlin, and the results are predictably predictable if rarely entertainingly risible, with swaths of exposition and dialogue that sounds like ads (“one people, one world”). The lackluster, at times abysmal writing wouldn’t much matter if “Resurgence” popped visually or featured a charismatic star who could lift a movie as effortlessly as Will Smith did in the first feature. Mr. Smith, unfortunately, declined to appear in the sequel, leaving his two   from “Independence Day,” Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum, to give it that old school try alongside veterans like Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner, far and away the movie’s most valuable player. All deliver professional, winking performances, but they’re also stranded in an overly crowded cast that gives too much time to younger performers who, for the most part, slide right off the screen. Mr. Emmerich does manage to personalize this industrial production here and there, largely in funny little asides that sprinkle the action, like the cutaway to a character using his wipers to clean alien goo off a windshield. But too often, he seems to be trying to summon up energy and dredge up feeling in this movie by glancing back at the first “Independence Day,” as when Liam Hemsworth (as a flyboy) punches an alien, an echo of Mr. Smith’s “welcome to Earth” triumphalism. Except that Mr. Hemsworth, a stolid, pleasant actor, isn’t Mr. Smith, and this isn’t “Independence Day. ” Somehow selling screen death by the millions with a quip and a teardrop just doesn’t cut it. “Independence Day: Resurgence” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned).  Bloodless apocalyptic death. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes. ",0
25291,WikiLeaks List Exposes At Least 65 Corporate ‘Presstitutes’ Who Colluded to Hide Clinton’s Crimes,"By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com
Revelations from the Wikileaks release of John Podesta’s emails yet again prove mainstream, corporate media serves as Hillary Clinton’s personal cheerleading squad — and is devoid of any iteration of journalistic integrity.
Thanks to Wikileaks and the Intercept , in fact, we now have a list of no less than 65 mainstream “reporters” whose campaign coverage constitutes propaganda for the Clinton campaign — and no wonder, considering the obscenely lopsided drivel presented by their outlets.
As (actual) journalists Glenn Greenwald and Lee Fang reported on October 9, the Intercept exclusively received documents obtained by the source known as Guccifer 2.0 evidencing Clinton campaign tactics to court journalists portraying the former secretary of state in a positive light.
“As these internal documents demonstrate,” the Intercept reported , “a central component of the Clinton campaign strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the campaign wants circulated.
“At times, Clinton’s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be Quote: d ‘on background’ and what should be described as ‘on the record.’”
One internal strategy document dated January 2015 — months before Clinton officially kicked off her campaign in April — with the curious heading “Earned Media/Next Steps” exposes how the campaign made an albeit infrequent practice of crafting supposed news pieces from beginning to completion.
Under the — not-at-all oblique insult to the fundamentals of journalism — heading “ Placing a Story ,” the memo’s Quote: :
“As we discussed on our call, we are all in agreement that the time is right [to] place a story with a friendly journalist in the coming days that positions us a little more transparently while achieving the above goals.”
Specifically named as a suggested journalist plant is Maggie Haberman of Politico , whom they note will assist in doing “the most shaping” of the narrative they have in mind.",0

Susan Garsh said case law in Massachusetts is clear that “abatement” defendants, who are denied the ability to finish an appeal before they die, can have their convictions vacated, ABC News reported.  The former New England Patriots tight end committed suicide in his cell on April 19 while serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of football player Odin Lloyd. He died only five days after being acquitted of a second murder charge from an incident in 2012. But, Hernandez had filed an appeal of his conviction and was awaiting the process when he committed suicide. “Abatement has been practiced in state and federal courts for more than a century,” Judge Garsh said. She added that “‘an appeal is an integral part of the system’ and said the interests of justice do not permit a defendant to stand convicted upon death if appeals are not exhausted. ” “Abatement remains the law in this Commonwealth, and this court is compelled to follow binding precedent,” Garsh concluded. Judge Garsh dismissed the claim offered by prosecutors that Hernandez knew of the abatement rules when he committed suicide. Garsh insisted that there was no way to know what Hernandez thought as he prepared to kill himself. The decision, though, could open up the New England Patriots to be liable to pay the Hernandez estate for the salary he missed during his trials and jail time after the team released him. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez’s contract with $16 million in guaranteed money. But, the team released Hernandez almost immediately after he was arrested in June 2013 and didn’t pay him the $5. 91 million of that guaranteed amount.

25315,Non-Profit Yale Magazine Taunts IRS With Editorial 'Not Endorsing' Hillary Clinton,"Getty - Josh Edelson 
The Yale Record, America’s “oldest college humor magazine,” taunted the IRS on Thursday by essentially endorsing Hillary Clinton for president by “not” endorsing her. 
The magazine is a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, meaning they are prohibited from engaging in political activities. 
The Yale Record is walking a tightrope as it relates to their non-profit status. Read the editorial board's post below: 
In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.” 
This year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. 
In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. 
The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. 
—The Editorial Board of The Yale Record 
Any reasonable reader would infer that the editorial board is indeed supporting Clinton for president. The only question is whether the paper gave itself enough legal wiggle room before publishing what might as well be a full-throated endorsement. Image Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images 
Here's what the IRS has to say on the matter: 
“...tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are prohibited from participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office. Charities, educational institutions and religious organizations, including churches, are among those that are covered under this code section."" 
[...] 
“These organizations cannot endorse any candidates, make donations to their campaigns, engage in fund raising, distribute statements, or become involved in any other activities that may be beneficial or detrimental to any particular candidate. Even activities that encourage people to vote for or against a particular candidate on the basis of nonpartisan criteria violate the political campaign prohibition of section 501(c)(3)."" 
The Yale Daily News faced similar controversy when it openly endorsed Clinton. The paper wouldn't confirm its non-profit status to The Daily Caller and called the matter a “misunderstanding.” ",0

At least they haven’t been, so far. Last week, our allies at Food DemocracyNOW! broke the news that Melody Meyer, a member of the Organic Trade Association (OTA), wants gene editing, a dangerous new form of genetic engineering, to be allowed in organic. Meyer said as much, in a blog post . Yep, higher ups at the OTA—that “organic” Big Food front group that sold out the GMO labeling movement—are at it again. First, they sold us out on the DARK Act, the bill that effectively killed GMO labeling in the U.S. Now, they want to use the loopholes and exemptions written into the DARK Act to force the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to allow certain types of genetic engineering (some of which are referred to as GMO 2.0 ) to be allowed in organic. At its next meeting, November 16 – 18, in St. Louis, Mo., the NOSB will consider an “Excluded Methods Terminology” proposal that could determine whether or not Meyer and her compatriots at the OTA score another win against organics. We say, no way. If you haven’t already, please sign this petition to the NOSB demanding that all GMO technologies be kept out of certified organic products.

[Speaking to a packed ballroom at the Bellagio conference center on the Las Vegas Strip, the former vice president, who himself declined to run for president, said he believes Clinton was not the “correct” candidate, but he was.  “I never thought she was the correct candidate,” Biden said. “I thought I was the correct candidate. ” The audience erupted into applause. The Salt Conference is an annual gathering of private equity leaders here in Las Vegas, organized by SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci, last cycle, supported   Donald Trump. Biden declined to run for president last cycle after the death of his son. “No man or woman should announce for the presidency unless they genuinely believe that for that moment in the nation’s history they are the most qualified person to deal with the issues facing the country,” Biden also said. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in 2015 in his Trump Tower office, Trump said he expected to face Biden in the general election if Biden ran since Clinton had so many problems. “I think Hillary has got huge problems right now,” Trump said then, adding: “Is she going to make it? I hear this thing is big league. Why did she do it? You use the server? Because they’re always looking to go over the edge, whether it’s Whitewater or anything else.

25322,"Gunmen in Jordan Kill 10, Including 7 Officers and a Canadian Tourist - The New York Times","AMMAN, Jordan  —   Seven Jordanian security officers, a Canadian tourist and two Jordanian civilians were killed by gunmen in the southern city of Karak on Sunday, according to a joint statement from the Public Security Department and the Jordanian armed forces. The security forces later captured and killed four of the gunmen, the statement said. It did not specify the total number of what security officials called “terrorist outlaws” involved in the attacks, or suggest a motive. Officials were also investigating whether the gunmen had ties to any terrorist organization. The violence began when a patrol was sent to check on reports of a house on fire. When security officers arrived on the scene, they were met with a barrage of gunfire from inside the home, injuring two officers. The gunmen fled, according to the statement. Gunmen then attacked a police station in the city. Later in the day, the police were informed that gunmen were hiding inside the Karak Crusader castle, a prominent tourist attraction on a hilltop. The gunmen fired at several police officers from the castle, security officials said. A cache of weapons was seized from the castle, as well as explosives, suicide vests and more weapons from the home where the men first encountered the officers, said Amer Saratwi, a spokesman for the Public Security Department. The statement confirmed the death of four police officers, three gendarmes, two civilians and a Canadian tourist, without specifying where the deaths had occurred.   people were injured, the statement said. Several Canadian news outlets identified the tourist as Linda Vatcher, a retired teacher from Newfoundland. At the time of the attack, she was visiting her son Christopher, who works in the region. He is among the injured, news reports said. Prime Minister Hani Mulki, addressing members of Parliament, said that several people had been killed and that Jordan’s special forces had surrounded an area in the city where five or six of the attackers were holed up. Videos released by Karak residents and posted on local news websites showed tribal leaders and young local residents holding rifles and aiding officers in the hunt for the gunmen near the castle. Terrorist attacks in Jordan, a crucial ally of the United States in the region, are relatively rare, but the country is continually on alert because of the threat posed by extremists, particularly from the Islamic State.",0
25325,"Top German Paper: We Need To Be ’More Gay, More Multicultural’ To Oppose Trump","In a new editorial, the head of the German daily broadsheet Die Welt has called on Germans to oppose U. S.   Donald Trump by being more multicultural and more “gay. ”[Head of Die Welt Ulf Poschardt wrote a combative editorial in response to an interview Mr. Trump did with the Bild tabloid on Monday. The highly negative reaction from many online forced the paper into changing the world “schwuler” or gay to ” more creative” after hundreds of comments were made on the paper’s website and over one thousand more on their Facebook page.  In the editorial, Mr. Poschardt claims that Germans need to oppose Donald Trump because he threatens the system of globalisation he says has greatly benefited Germany. “Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Cabinet have been right to promote, popularize, and engage in global politics in tough diplomatic struggle,” he wrote, saying that it was good for Germans when   globalisation ideas were spread across the world. “The distribution of global prosperity will, in the future, be aggressively decided by the US in its favor  —   if we do not resist and become better, more courageous, more diligent, innovative, free, open, gay and multicultural,” he wrote initially with gay being replaced with “creative” after the torrent of comments online. Facebook user Kirsten Zander slammed the editorial saying, “Why this martial rhetoric? To defend ourselves against the US president. Did he declare war on us? First of all, we need to take care of our own country instead of squinting at the whole world, as our chancellor does. ” Others took exception to the word gay being used with another Facebook user commenting, “What has this man smoked? Why do we become more successful when we become “gay” and STILL “multicultural”? Is there a correlation between being gay and growing multiculturalism and success?” Another wrote: “Why should we be gay? More open in dealing with gays in our society, I could understand that. But why gay when it comes to Trump?” The comments caused Mr. Poschardt to explain why he chose the word gay which was, according to him, “was meant in the sense of the theses of Richard Florida, The Rise of the Creative Class. When this one detail became vital and threatened to cover the rest of the comment, I changed it. ” After the change,   website Queer. de slammed Die Welt saying Poschardt had given in to “  populists” and called it “embarrassing” that he replaced gay with “creative” rather than “more tolerant” or “more diverse. ” The reaction to the election of Donald Trump among German media and German politicians has been highly negative since November. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went as far as to claim that Russian hacking directly influenced the election and warned it could influence the upcoming German federal election later this year.   Tiedje, chairman and primary shareholder of communications consultancy WMP Eurocom AG, slammed German media for its coverage of the   saying, “whatever he says, whatever he does, it’s never right according to the German television class. ”",0

25334,Left Wing Vegan Denied Swiss Passport Because She’s ’Too Annoying’,"A left wing Dutch vegan who has lived in Switzerland since she was a child has been denied a Swiss passport because locals in her adoptive town find her too annoying. [Nancy Holten, 42, is a   animal rights activist who has campaigned against the Swiss tradition of cow bells, calling them cruel.  Despite living in the country since the age of eight, and speaking fluent Swiss German, local residents vetoed her application of citizenship, saying they were “fed up” with her challenging their traditions. The Dutchwoman explained her views: “The sound that cow bells make is a hundred decibel. It is comparable with a pneumatic drill. We also would not want such a thing hanging close to our ears?” “The bells, which the cows have to wear when they walk to and from the pasture, are especially heavy. “The animals carry around five kilograms around their neck. It causes friction and burns to their skin. ” Aargauer Zeitung says that as well as cow bells, she has also campaigned against other Swiss traditions including hunting, pig racing, and even loud church bells. Local politician Tanja Suter said Ms. Holten had a “big mouth” and she does not deserve a Swiss passport “if she irritates us and does not respect our traditions”. Ms Holten herself admits: “I think I spoke my mind too often, and I say it out too loud. ” Under Switzerland’s highly decentralised constitution, local towns and regions grant citizenship rather than the central government, and some give citizens a vote on who gets a passport. Villagers in   in the canton of Aargau voted by 206 to 144 to reject Ms. Holten’s application for citizenship in 2015, and have now rejected that application a second time. The case will now go to the regional government, which can overrule the vote and grant her citizenship anyway. Switzerland has some of the tightest citizenship laws in the world, and being born in the country often does not grant the children of immigrants an automatic right to a passport.",0
25337,Tokyo could ban US troops from stationing on disputed isles,"  
  block the US from being stationed on the islands off Hokkaido in the strategic Sea of Okhotsk, if this helps persuade Russia to give them back. 
The islands are inhabited, and in Russia are called the Southern Kurils – but for Japan they are Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai islet group. These territories, which became Russian after Japan’s defeat in World War II under the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, saw a rift between the two countries preventing them from signing the peace treaty to formally end the war. Tokyo insists the four islets are not part of the Kuril chain and should be returned under its control. 
In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Bloomberg that Russia does not “trade territories.” But ahead of his visit to Tokyo in mid-December, Japan’s diplomatic sources told Kyodo News that Moscow would hand over Shikotan and Habomai islet group following the peace deal, as stated by the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. 
The sources, however, said Russia may be concerned that the US military could be stationed on the territories after Japan gets them back. According to Article 5 of the Japan-US security treaty, Washington is allowed to station its troops in areas administered by Japan. 
The Japanese government is now looking into the potential consequences, should they exclude the islands from Article 5, the sources said, with one of them adding that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe could go as far as announcing that the islands do not fall under Article 5. 
Other sources, however, think that “a realistic scenario is that the prime minister shows his political will and seeks consent from the United States.” 
At the same time, “Russia won’t agree to hand over [the islands] unless the possibility of stationing the US military there is ruled out,” a source familiar with the Japanese-Russian ties told The Japan Times over the weekend. 
Nevertheless, convincing the US to okay such conditions seems very difficult, a Japanese government source said, adding that “It could even shake the foundations of the [Japan-US military] alliance.” 
For Russia, the area around the disputed islands is of “extremely high importance” because it faces the Sea of Okhotsk, a Japanese government source said, and a foreign military in these waters could hamper both essential military drills and the use of a major access route to the Pacific Ocean. 
Tokyo has already rejected the report, saying they are not planning to review Article 5, TASS news agency said, citing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated it, adding that the Japan-US treaty “applies and will apply” to all territories and waters which are administered by Japan. 
Earlier in the month, Tokyo also denied Nikkei’s report that Japan and Russia were discussing joint administration of the Kuril Islands. 
“There is no change in Japan’s fundamental position that Japan will conclude the peace treaty with Russia by resolving the issue of the possession of the four northern islands,” Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yasuhira Kawamura told Reuters in an email at that time. 
Russia has always insisted that any change in the status of the islands is out of the question, as it would constitute a reassessment of the results of World War II, which is expressly banned by international treaties.",0
25339,NBC's Baghdad Bob: There Is No FBI Investigation of Hillary | Frontpage Mag,"NBC's Baghdad Bob: There Is No FBI Investigation of Hillary November 4, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
Remember when Hillary Clinton was insisting that there was no FBI investigation of her, just a security review, even when the FBI rejected that claim? 
Well Andrea Mitchell, NBC's own Baghdad Bob, isn't giving up that claim so easily. Even while the rest of the Clinton clique is screeching against the FBI for investigating Hillary like bats from the nether regions of left-wing hell, Mitchell is sticking to the old spin. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. It's not. It's not. 
In a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly “fact-check” the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mail and charitable foundation scandals. 
Mitchell refused to accept reality: “Just a lot of fact-checking to do. She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, there’s no criminality.” She fretted: “I don't know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context.” 
The context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. 
But as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary. Anyone who believes that is probably some sort of right-winger who listens to what the FBI actually says, rather than what NBC says that the FBI says. ",0
25340,Government Gave Brown University $5 Million to Discover that Frat Boys Drink More than Peers - Breitbart,"Senator Jeff Flake ( ) revealed that the government gave Brown University $5 million to conduct research on whether or not fraternity brothers drink more than their peers who don’t participate in Greek life. [It’s unclear from Flake’s report why the National Institute of Health granted Brown University such a significant amount of funding to study to the behaviors of students in fraternities. According the report, the $5 million was used for to determine if frat boys drink, smoke, and party more than their peers.  Studies on the habits of college students funded with $5 million of NIH grants found fraternity brothers drink, smoke and generally party more than other students. They also sleep in later, which led the researchers to speculate “one explanation for this finding is that Greeks students recognize their sleep needs. ” Perhaps a more likely reason is that they are sleeping off their party lifestyle. Flake concludes that substance abuse amongst college students is a serious problem, but that the research conducted with state funding didn’t provide any information about fraternity life that wasn’t already common knowledge. Substance abuse is a very serious problem, especially among college students involved in Greek life, that deserves thoughtful attention. The studies highlighted here are not finding solutions to   problems, but simply retelling what is already widely known about Greek life. As they say at the frat house, “cool story, bro. ” The report on the Brown study was a part of Flake’s annual report that chronicle 50 cases of government fraud, abuse, and waste. Other instances of waste included nearly $2 million of government funds that was designated for the development of a comedy club that would feature holographic performers.",0
25341,Alasdair MacLeod’s Market Report: Gold and Silver Find Support!,"Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » Alasdair MacLeod’s Market Report: Gold and Silver Find Support! 
A rise of 44% this year for the sterling price of gold just shows what gold does best. It protects ordinary people from the failure of central bankers to protect the purchasing power of their fiat currencies. 

From Alasdair Macleod : Precious metals continued to consolidate at the lower levels, moving broadly sideways. Gold was unchanged on the week by last night’s close in New York, at $1269, and silver up 9c at $17.63. The uncertainty facing traders is whether or not gold will now go lower to test the $1200 level, or will current levels hold. Time will tell. Comex figures are not offering much guidance either. The next chart is of the gold contract’s open interest, and while we can see that open interest has declined significantly since the mid-year peak, an open interest level of 500,000 contracts is by no means low. There is some evidence, however, that among the managed money category there exists long-term players seeking strategic portfolio exposure to gold. That being the case, the downside for open interest becomes more limited, and perhaps the cannier managers will look to add to positions on price weakness. However, we must also take into account potential window-dressing at the end of this month, for the third quarter. And here it is the bullion banks short positions and their traders’ bonuses that are on the line. The lack of volatility in gold and silver is being reflected in other markets, with the dollar stuck at the top end of a sideways consolidation pattern. DXY, the main dollar index traded in futures markets, is our next chart along with the conventional trade-weighted version. This sideways trading pattern could end with a break to the upside, because the euro is drifting lower. Note that the euro comprises 57% of DXY. The reason this is important is a strong dollar worries the Fed. The Fed is desperate to limit the deflationary effects of a rising dollar, and believes that the appalling trade deficit is due to the dollar being very over-valued. So if DXY goes much higher, we can probably dismiss the possibility of an increase in the Fed Funds Rate in December. But that’s a long way off, and doubtless is contributing to the lack of decision over markets generally. That said, the pick-up in Chinese and Indian demand for physical gold bullion lends some support to prices. Meanwhile, gold has performed spectacularly for sterling-based investors, as our last chart clearly shows. A rise of 44% this year for the sterling price of gold just shows what gold does best. It protects ordinary people from the failure of central bankers to protect the purchasing power of their fiat currencies. 2016 30th Anniversary Proof Silver Eagles Available Now at SD Bullion!

25346,Proof Of George Soros Nazi Past Finally Comes To Light With Discovery Of Forgotten Interview,"  Proof Of George Soros Nazi Past Finally Comes To Light With Discovery Of Forgotten Interview George Soros has repeatedly called 1944 ""The Best Year of his Life."" 70% of Mr. Soros's fellow Jews in Hungary, nearly a half-million human beings, were annihilated in that year, yet he gives no sign that this put any damper on his elation, either at the time or indeed in retrospect.   15, 2016 When Hitler’s henchman Adolf Eichmann arrived in Hungary, to oversee the murder of that country’s Jews, George Soros ended up with a man whose job was confiscating property from the Jewish population. 
George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed door meeting to retool the big-money left to fight back against Donald Trump. Since Soros name is very much in the headlines in 2016, let’s take a look at an interview he gave in 1998 about his Nazi past. Nazi collaborator Soros gave MILLIONS to Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign 
Social unrest groups like Media Matters have taken to the Internet in an attempt to “debunk the claims” and “correct the smears” about rumors of the Nazi past of their patron, George Soros. They say it is just malicious gossip and lies people make up about Soros because they don’t like him. Snopes.com chimes in as well in defense of Soros. But what about the “rumors”? Could they be true, are they true? 
As you will see and hear , not only are the rumors true, a long forgotten interview George Soros did on 60 Minutes has him gleefully confessing to his crime. 
György Schwartz, better known to the world as George Soros , was born August 12, 1930 in Hungary. Soros’ father, Tivadar, was a fervent practitioner of the Esperanto language invented in 1887, and designed to be the first global language, free of any national identity. The Schwartz’s, who were non-practicing Jews, changed the family name to Soros, in order to facilitate assimilation into the Gentile population, as the Nazis spread into Hungary during the 1930s 
When Hitler’s henchman Adolf Eichmann arrived in Hungary, to oversee the murder of that country’s Jews, George Soros ended up with a man whose job was confiscating property from the Jewish population. Soros went with him on his rounds. 
George Soros has repeatedly called 1944 “ The Best Year of his Life. ” 70% of Mr. Soros’s fellow Jews in Hungary, nearly a half-million human beings, were annihilated in that year, yet he gives no sign that this put any damper on his elation, either at the time or indeed in retrospect. During an interview with “Sixty Minute’s” Steve Kroft, Soros was asked about his “best year.” George Soros Interview Where He Admitted He Was A Nazi Collaborator: 
He was only to happy to admit his collaboration with the Nazis,in fact, he called those days the “best time of my life”. Click to watch, in context, that startling confession. 
KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson. 
SOROS: Yes. Yes. 
KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from your fellow Jews, friends and neighbors. 
SOROS: Yes. That’s right. Yes. 
KROFT: I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many, years. Was it difficult? 
SOROS: No, not at all. Not at all, I rather enjoyed it. 
KROFT: No feelings of guilt? 
SOROS: No, only feelings of absolute power. SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",0
25347,‘This Is Treason’: Clinton’s Email Server Reportedly Exposed to Hackers of 5 Spy Agencies,"
As election day draws near, accusations against both US presidential candidates are becoming more and more brutal, with Fox News reporting the FBI believes up to five foreign intelligence agencies managed to hack into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.
According to the report , there is about a 99 percent chance that the server used by then-Secretary of State Clinton for work communications in violation of security protocols was compromised. The allegations were confirmed by House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, who said that FBI director James Comey had told him about the exposure previously.
“She exposed [information] to our enemies,” the Republican representative from Texas said on “Fox & Friends” on Thursday morning. “Our adversaries have this very sensitive information… In my opinion, quite frankly, it’s treason.” 
McCaul added that there are concerns not only about the content of the emails, but also access to the communication protocols of special access programs used on government-issued electronic devices.
“Now countries like Russia and China and Iran have the most highly-sensitive programs in the United States. And the President of the US is communicating with them,” he alleged. “They are not stupid. They can figure that out as well.” 
McCaul has said earlier that he has been briefing Republican candidate Donald Trump on security issues.
Director Comey previously hinted at the possibility that foreign nations had hacked into Clinton’s server, but the Democrat candidate pushed back, saying the FBI director was “speculating.”
The new accusations come after the FBI relaunched an investigation into the use of Clinton’s private server after discovering additional emails on the laptop of ex-Representative Anthony Weiner in the course of a separate investigation. Weiner’s electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that probe.
After the bombshell that investigation was being reopened dropped last week, some Democrats accused the FBI director of trying to influence the election. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

25348,First Amendment Support Climbing Among High School Students - The New York Times,"Support among American high school students for the First Amendment is stronger today than it has been in the last 12 years, according to the latest in a series of large nationwide surveys of the nation’s rising voters. Some 91 percent of high school students say they believe that individuals should be allowed to express unpopular opinions, according to a Knight Foundation survey of nearly 12, 000 students conducted last year. The survey is the sixth in a series, the first of which was carried out in 2004, when 83 percent supported such rights. “What we’ve seen since 2004 is a slow but steady increase in support,” said Kenneth Dautrich, the study’s lead author and the president of the Stats Group, a statistical and data services firm. Here’s a look at some of the top findings. High school students may broadly back the First Amendment, but not without limits: Their support is tempered depending on the kind of speech and where it’s delivered. “While support for the First Amendment as a general concept has never been higher, the devil’s in the details,” said Jonathan Sotsky, director of strategy and assessment for the Knight Foundation.   percent of the students may support the right to express unpopular opinions in general, but only half as many  —   45 percent  —   support that right when the speech in question is offensive to others and made in public. Bullying speech enjoys slightly less backing, and students are even less supportive of either kind of speech when it’s delivered on social media. Many students find little sacred in professional reporting: More than half put as much or more trust in photos, videos and accounts shared by individuals online than in traditional news sources. The 726 teachers surveyed, however, were far more skeptical of the online postings. Students may have faith in firsthand accounts shared online, but they are still generally wary of the news they see there.   percent said they had “some” or “a lot” of trust in the information found in newspapers, compared with 77 percent for television news and 70 percent for news websites. Just 49 percent reported similar levels of trust in news shared on social media. The survey results suggest that high school students and adults differ greatly in how they consume news. Students are almost twice as likely as adults to “often” use mobile devices for news and nearly three times as likely to report “often” getting news from social media. Adults are much more likely to report “often” getting news from local TV and newspapers. Students are far less concerned about their privacy on the internet than adults, according to the survey. But that is changing: In 2016, 76 percent were somewhat or very concerned about privacy online, compared with 70 percent two years earlier.",0
25349,CBS Colorado Investigation Shows People Voting Twice; The Dead Voting,"Pinterest 
In Colorado, cases of voters casting ballots twice, the dead voting, and other cases of fraud are popping up, lending credence to conservatives’ arguments that the election may be “rigged.” 
CBS4 found at least a dozen cases where Coloradans have voted twice, and a previous investigation revealed the names of state residents who had been dead for months or years, still voting. 
In six of the cases, voting records show the exact same person citing twice in the state elections. In the other six, people who were registered in a different state also voted in Colorado. 
Lincoln Wilson, a registered Republican from Hale, in Northeast Colorado, is accused of voting in both Colorado and Kansas in 2010, 2012 and again in 2014. Wilson told CBS4 he voted in both states, but only “voted on local issues” and “didn’t vote twice for President.” 
Wilson is one of five Coloradans now charged by the State of Kansas for voting in both states. 
Randall Killian, an unaffiliated voter, pleaded guilty to voting in Douglas County, Colorado and Kansas in the 2012 presidential election. Ron Weems, a registered Democrat, pleaded guilty to voting in Teller County, Colorado and Kansas in both 2012 and 2014. Both men were fined for their offenses. 
Kansas has also charged James Criswell, a Republican from Douglas County, and Sharon Farris, a Republican from Denver, with double voting. Their cases have not been resolved yet. 
Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said his office is “aggressively prosecuting” double voting cases because it’s a crime that “can’t be caught ahead of time.” 
He says after each election, Colorado and Kansas crosscheck voters to identify double ballots and clean up their databases. But Kobach still believes 10,000 people are registered to vote in both Colorado and Kansas. 
Combing through voter data, CBS4 found three suspected double voters in Denver, one suspected double voter in Arapahoe County and one suspected double voter in Douglas County. All five cases that CBS4 uncovered have now been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal action. 
“It’s a relatively small number,” said Williams, “But, it is a problem of any magnitude because we have close elections in Colorado.” 
But, Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams admits other Coloradans are getting away with it. Combing through voter data, CBS4 found three suspected double voters in Denver, one suspected double voter in Arapahoe County and one suspected double voter in Douglas County. All five cases that CBS4 uncovered have now been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal action.",0
25350,Epic Deep State Internecine Division,"Charles Burris https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/epic-deep-state-internecine-division/ 
I believe in these final climatic days before November 8, we will see epic Deep State internecine division. Some will publicly surface, most will remain buried sub-strata. 
The Deep State is not monolithic or homogeneous but is composed of many seemingly disparate elements or competing factions united by their systemic base criminality under the phony rubric of “national security.” 
Administrations change, but the Deep State endures. 
I think the overall standard perception of Trump as viewed as an outlier or dangerous loose cannon to the statist old guard elites who see his enormous ego, hubris, and independence of mind as threatening to their rackets is breaking down and being challenged late in the game by some factions. Raison d’état, institutional loyalty and self-interest trumps everything else. 
The Clinton ties to epic criminality and predation are thoroughly documented but under-reported by the regime media in thrall to their Deep State suzerains up to this point. She is now being deemed expendable by some elements. And like Huma, she will be thrown under the bus. 
Some of those factions within the Deep State — particularly those un-elected powerful bureaucrats deep within the permanent government and Pentagon that determine actual day-to-day policy from one administration to another, will turn on Hillary, out of amoral self-interest and institutional loyalty. 
James Comey is perhaps the first and most notable.

25351,"Thieves Plow Into Texas Gun Range, Steal Weapons","HOUSTON, Texas  —   Two thieves used a truck to plow into the side of a gun range in Houston, Texas, early Thursday morning. They took off with all the pistols and rifles they could grab. [“Two young males drove a pickup truck into the side of the business, went in, and took assorted rifles and pistols at roughly 4 in the morning,” said Capt. Eddie Martin with the South Houston Police Department, reported the Houston Chronicle.  The alarm was sounded but law enforcement authorities were not notified right away. Officers showed up at the Marksman Indoor Range in South Houston early Thursday but the burglars had already taken off. The South Houston Police Department officers were on the scene within seven minutes of the burglary. “They were in pretty quick and out pretty quick,” Captain Eddie Martin was reported to say. Law enforcement officials are going through surveillance video tapes but do not have a license plate at this time, reported the hometown paper. The Houston Chronicle reports that approximately 32, 000 guns have been stolen in the Houston area in the last eight years, and that only seven percent of those have been recovered. The firearms were heisted from Houston area homes, automobiles, pawn shops, and gun dealers. Texas leads the nation in thefts from unlicensed gun dealers and has a robust black market for guns that have been stolen. Moreover, stolen guns are frequently used to commit other crimes. Breitbart News reported in April that thefts from licensed gun dealers were at a rate of . 039 percent in 2015. According to the Crime Prevention Research Center, approximately 16 million guns were sold by Federal Firearm License holders in 2015 and 6, 163 guns were stolen from them. Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wanted to make gun makers legally responsible for the misuse of stolen guns, as reported by Breitbart News in October 2016. Clinton responded to the dismissal of a lawsuit against Remington Arms by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary victims by calling it “incomprehensible. ” She   on her promise to change laws to allow gun manufacturers to be sued by crime victims.

25352,AG Sessions: Sanctuary Cities That Fail to Comply with Immigration Laws Risk Losing Federal Dollars - Breitbart,"Monday at the White House press briefing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned municipalities that have implemented the policy of sanctuary cities, which he described as making “our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets. ”  Sessions said the Department of Justice would require that jurisdictions that are seeking or applying for DoJ grants to certify compliance with 8 U. S. C. 1373 as a condition of receiving those awards. ” Sessions said, “According to one recent poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that cities that make arrests  —   that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to immigration authorities. Unfortunately, some states and cities have adopted policies designed to frustrate this enforcement of immigration laws. This includes refuses to detain known felons under federal detainer requests or otherwise failing to comply with these laws. For example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor I. C. E. Detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime. These charges and convictions against these aliens include drug trafficking,    rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder. Such policies cannot continue. They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets. ” He added, “Today, I am urging states and local jurisdictions to comply with these federal laws, including 8 U. S. C. Section 1373. Moreover, the Department of Justice will require that jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department of Justice grants to certify compliance with 1373 as a condition of receiving those awards. This policy is entirely consistent with the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs guidance that was issued just last summer under the previous administration. This guidance requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants. It also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants. ” He concluded by saying, “I strongly urge our nation’s states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce immigration laws and to rethink these policies. Such policies make their cities and states less safe. Public safety as well as national security are at stake and put them at risk of losing federal dollars. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

25357,Employers Urged to Prevent Zika Infections at Work - The New York Times,"Companies that employ pregnant women, women who are planning to become pregnant, or even men whose wives or girlfriends are contemplating pregnancy should consider letting them work indoors if they are in areas with Zika transmission, federal health and safety officials said Friday. If the virus reaches the American mainland this summer the recommendation could impose a major burden on industries such as construction, agriculture, transportation, amusement parks and cafes, which employ hundreds of thousands of outdoor workers. It was among a general set of guidelines jointly issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers from occupational exposure to the Zika virus. The greatest risk of infection is from mosquito bites, although the new guidelines recognize that the virus can also be transmitted sexually. As interim guidelines, they are not legally enforceable, said Jordan Barab, the deputy assistant secretary for OSHA at the Labor Department. Issuing advisory guidelines is common during emergencies like epidemics, he said. The new guidelines also recommended that pregnant employees not travel to areas where the Zika virus is circulating and that businesses consider allowing workers who are or may become pregnant delay traveling to those areas. That recommendation also applies to the male partners of such women. The other recommendations made on Friday are based on earlier guidelines issued to protect against West Nile virus. They urge employers to give outdoor workers clothing that covers exposed skin, hats with mosquito netting, insect repellents, and to eliminate standing water near work sites where mosquitoes could lay eggs. Other guidelines issued Friday covered   workers, who face biting insects and hazardous pesticides, and laboratory and health care workers, who could be in danger of acquiring the Zika virus from patients’ blood and bodily fluids. Mr. Barab said industries that employ outdoor workers had not been consulted before the guidelines were issued. Jill M. Shugart, an environmental health specialist in the C. D. C. ’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said her organization often consulted with unions and trade groups but in this case had discussed these occupational guidelines primarily with the airline and cruise ship industries. Those industries were initially concerned with the travel guidelines for pregnant women that the C. D. C. issued in January. Asked if there had been any reaction from businesses with outdoor employees, she said: “The guidelines were just posted today, and we have not heard from every single sector. ” Calls to the United States Chamber of Commerce, which represents employers, were not returned Friday afternoon. It was not clear what constitutes an “area with Zika transmission” for purposes of the workplace guidelines. Mr. Barab said his agency would defer to the C. D. C. on that question. Ms. Shugart suggested that her agency’s travel guidelines might be used to define such an area, but she added that those parameters are broad. The agency initially recommended that pregnant women avoid entire countries, then amended that to include only areas below 6, 500 feet in elevation because the mosquitoes that carry Zika do not survive at high altitudes. The only American territories with known Zika transmission are Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and American Samoa. If the virus reaches Florida or the Gulf Coast this summer, as the C. D. C. has said it might, employers across these regions may not know if their specific location is at risk. Defining such areas by county or state may be required presumably, an outbreak in Key West would not affect a job site in Minnesota. Mr. Barab said he assumed that the C. D. C. would eventually come up with a narrower definition. In the new guidelines, the advice about indoor work is phrased more cautiously than the other guidelines. For example, the new recommendations said that employers should “consider reassigning” employees “if requested by a worker. ”",0
25358,WikiLeaks: John Podesta Attended Satanic ‘Spirit Ritual’,"Has Satanism infiltrated the Washington elite? New WikiLeaks emails suggest John Podesta attended a “Spirit Cooking” dinner party at Marina Abramovich’s house. 
Via YourNewsWire 

Given what we know about the performance artist’s occult fascination, it’s safe to assume they weren’t saying the Lord’s Prayer.

So what happened at this dinner party? Marina Abramovich demonstrates what Spirit Cooking is in a YouTube video. Painting a wall with pig blood, Abramovich smears the sentence “WITH A SHARP KNIFE CUT DEEPLY INTO THE MIDDLE FINGER OF YOUR LEFT HAND EAT THE PAIN.” Another daubed message reads “FRESH MORNING URINE SPRINKLE OVER NIGHTMARE DREAMS.”
Anramovich then throws blood over a small statue in the corner of the room, before writing “SPIRIT COOKING.” Blood is then ceremoniously run around the four corners of the room. Another message on the wall reads “MIX FRESH BREAST MILK WITH FRESH SPERM MILK DRINK ON EARTHQUAKE NIGHTS.”
At 7 mins 30 Abramovich is seen in a projected video with a snake wrapped around her head, it’s tail in her nostril. Warning: in case you hadn’t guessed, this video contains graphic content.
Spirit Cooking, according to article about Marina Abramovich, “ is about the conversion of matter into energy, of the material into the spiritual. Abramovic derives her inspiration from the popular belief that the spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid, but in the form of light, sound and emotions. 
This superstition is found in numerous cultures and there are even strict rules as to how this spiritual fare should be prepared. In this paradox, in the material underpinning of something immaterial, the physical and spiritual worlds meet. 
Or to use her own words, ‘When you make something visible for something invisible, the invisible becomes visible.’ “ Marina Abramovich has long been associated with the occult. Her performance art often features Satanic themes and mock human sacrifice.
Here she is performing with Jay-Z – a man not shy about proclaiming Satanic beliefs.
Perhaps we we shouldn’t be surprised Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta attends Satanic Spirit Cooking dinners. After all, Hillary Clinton appears to have banned use of the word “God” during her campaign. Watch this woman struggle with her natural instincts while Hillary smiles knowingly at her side.

25360,В Италии произошло два землетрясения подряд,"0 комментариев   
Как сообщает Reuters со ссылкой на Геологическую службу США, это было второе за вечер сильное землетрясение в этом районе. Ранее сообщалось о другом землетрясении - магнитудой 5,4.Эпицентр второго землетрясения, по данным службы, располагался около города Кастельсантанджело-суль-Нера (центральная область Марке). 
По словам мэра Мауро Фалуччи, в городе отключилось электричество.Как отмечает Reuters, оба землетрясения «были достаточно сильными и их ощутили 150 км южнее - в Риме, где лампы закачались на верхних этажах зданий». По данным РБК, власти города Виссо, располагающегося недалеко от эпицентра, заявили о нескольких пострадавших. 
По информации Геофизической службы РАН, на которую ссылается ведомство, сейсмособытие произошло в 9:15. Его эпицентр залегал в акватории Тихого океана, в 226 километрах к востоку от города Курильска. 
Как пишет Российская газета, жители островного региона подземных толчков не ощутили. Об угрозе возникновения цунами не сообщается. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что в Японии сейсмологи зафиксировали землетрясение магнитудой 6,5 - подземные толчки произошли южнее Токио в Тихом океане. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, о жертвах сообщений нет. В ообщении метеослужбы Японии говорится, что очаг подземного толчка находился на глубине 10 км в Тихом океане к югу от Токио. По японской шкале оценки силы землетрясений, магнитуда этих толчков не превысила 1 балл. 
Тем не менее, землетрясение ощущалось в девяти префектурах Японии. Информации о жертвах и возможных разрушениях пока не поступала, угроза цунами не объявлялась. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что 12 сентября подземные толчки магнитудой 4,9 и 5,4 были зафиксированы возле города Кёнджу (Кёнсан-Пукто) в 370 км от Сеула. 
Об этом сообщает геологическая служба США (USGS). 
Информации о жертвах и разрушениях не поступало. Ранее в Северной Корее был зарегистрирован толчок магнитудой 5,3, что стало следствием ядерных испытаний. 
Как уточнили в ведомстве, на пять часов утра по местному времени (23-00 12 сентября по Москве) общее число пострадавших составило восемь человек, большинство из которых находились рядом с эпицентром толчков: пятеро пострадавших - из провинции Северная Кенсан, двое - из Тэгу и еще один - из провинции Южная Чолла. 
В основном люди пострадали от упавшей мебели и кусков зданий, но два человека получили ранения, когда решили спрыгнуть на землю со второго этажа, испугавшись подземных толчков. В то же время ранения у всех легкие, жизни пострадавших угрозы нет, пишет Правда.ру. 
23 августа в Италии произошло землетрясение магнитудой 6,4 . Подземные толчки зафиксированы недалеко от города Перуджа.

25363,Чиновники предлагают ввести в России пособие по бедности. А другие - убрать?,"0 комментариев 1 поделились источник Pravda.Ru 
Как рассказала первый замминистра финансов Татьяна Нестеренко, сейчас финансовая поддержка больше всего необходима семьям с детьми в возрасте до 16 лет, особенно в ней нуждаются ""семьи с двумя и более детьми и одним работающим родителем"". 
""Сегодня было бы правильно и нам перейти на применение принципа нуждаемости при назначении отдельных социальных выплат и обсудить возможность введения нового вида пособия - пособия по бедности"", - добавила Нестеренко. 
По словам чиновницы, прежде чем вводить новый вид пособий, сперва стоит определить понятие ""нуждаемость"" и его критерии на законодательном уровне. 
Предложения министерства не отражены в проекте бюджета на 2017-2019 годы, добавила Нестеренко. 
Ранее председатель Правительства РФ Дмитрий Медведев подписал постановление о снижении величины прожиточного минимума. 
Как пояснил Правде.Ру член комитета Совета Федерации по экономической политике Николай Власенко, ""это стоит воспринимать как техническую вещь. Есть правила определения прожиточного минимума. Они ежеквартально корректируются. В третьем квартале он был несколько завышен из-за инфляции, которая у нас носит сезонный характер. Одновременно, например, снижение покупательского спроса, запускает дефляционные процессы. У нас сейчас специфическая ситуация в экономике - называется биполярная инфляция и дефляция "". 
По мнению эксперта Правды.Ру, в некоторых секторах инфляция идет опережающими темпами, а в каких-то есть даже дефляция. Получилось, что в четвертом квартале по тем товарным группам, по которым идентифицируется прожиточный минимум, произошло снижение. Во многом из-за того, что в третьем квартале был существенный рост. Эксперт напомнил, что прожиточный минимум - техническая цифра, к которой ""привязаны"" размеры социальных пособий, субсидий на ЖКХ и многое другое. Но самое важное - это социально-демографический ориентир, порог бедности. 
Правда.ру ранее писала, что поступало предложение ввести продовольственные карточки для бедных россиян. 
Отметим, что использование продуктовых карточек для поддержки малообеспеченных людей является довольно распространенной в мире практикой, к примеру, в США активно применяется система Food stamp. На сегодняшний день около 21% американцев подают заявки на получение ежемесячных социальных пособий. 
Кстати, ранее с предложением ввести продовольственные карточки в России выступала ФАС. Доктор экономических наук, профессор Владимир Мантусов в интервью Правда.Ру сообщил, что введение продуктовых талонов не вызовет никакой паники среди населения, так как это является обычной мерой социальной поддержки. Однако, отметил эксперт, основной целью должно быть истребление бедности и нищеты в стране для того, чтобы люди не нуждались в бесплатных продуктах.

25366,U.S. Strengthens Its Forces in a Crowded Syrian Battlefield - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The United States has increased its forces near the northern Syrian town of Manbij as concerns have grown that fighting could erupt among the complex array of militias and Syrian and Turkish troops who are operating on the crowded battlefield near there. Photographs of American troops in Stryker vehicles and armored Humvees flying American flags circulated on Saturday on social media. The   command that is fighting the Islamic State, a militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL, acknowledged the buildup around the town, but did not provide details. “The coalition has increased its force presence in and around Manbij to deter any hostile action against the city and its civilians, to enhance local governance and to ensure there is no persistent Y. P. G. presence,” an American military spokesman said, using the acronym for the People’s Protection Units, Kurdish militia groups that have been trained by United States military advisers. The Turks have repeatedly complained that the Y. P. G. which played a critical role in taking Manbij, has yet to vacate the city, despite American assurances that it has done so. The spokesman added, “This is a deliberate action to reassure our coalition members and partner forces, deter aggression, and ensure all parties remain focused on defeating our common enemy, ISIS. ” American military officials said the total number of United States forces in Syria had not increased. But the new deployment of American troops around Manbij has been done in a visible manner. A combustible mix of forces are crowding the battlefield in northern Syria, including   Syrian militias, Syrian government forces, and Kurdish and Arab fighters trained by the United States. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the   task force that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told reporters on Wednesday that Syrian government troops had advanced near Manbij to the point where they were within “rifle range” of Syrian Arab fighters backed by American forces. The United States has hundreds of troops in northern Syria who have been training and advising Syrian Arab and Kurdish fighters. “It’s very difficult and complicated,” said General Townsend, adding that it was important that tensions among the groups not disrupt the campaign against the Islamic State. “That’s what we ought to keep our efforts focused on, and not fighting deliberately or accidentally with one another. ” The potential for a clash is clear. Abu Amjed, the head of the Manbij Military Council, which has responsibility for securing the city, said during an interview last week that Turkish forces had been shooting at his front lines. Another worry is Ahrar   an Islamist opposition group, which has been supported by the Turks. Under a recent agreement that Russia is said to have played a role in brokering, Syrian government forces are moving into villages near Manbij. The Manbij security forces appear to have ceded control of the villages to prevent them from being occupied by   militias or Turkish troops. In a development that reflected the fluid and confusing battlefield, Russian aircraft on Tuesday mistakenly bombed Syrian Arab fighters trained by the United States. General Townsend said  the attack, which took place about 10 miles southwest of Manbij, occurred when the Syrian fighters moved into villages that had been occupied by the Islamic State. The Russian Defense Ministry said it had not carried out airstrikes in areas that the United States had previously designated as being occupied by   fighters.",0
25367,Cars That Broke Bad,"Eric Peters Autos October 31, 2016 
Automotive good ideas gone bad range far and wide – whether it’s a classic fail like the exploding Pintos of the early ’70s – or a late-model train wreck like the Pontiac Aztek. 
Here are ten automotive atrocities that will be remembered for as long as the warranty claims (and class-action lawsuits) linger: 
* The entire American Motors Corp. (AMC) lineup – 
From dreadful dreadnoughts like the malformed Matador to demented detritus like the Gremlin and Pacer, no other automaker ever managed to build such a seemingly endless conga line of bizarre, poorly conceived (and often, poorly built) cars within such a short span of time (from the late 1960s to the early-mid 1970s). 
Only bankruptcy eventually succeeded in stopping the madness. Exceptions deserving of a kind word include the Javelin and AMX, which were decent efforts hobbled by AMC’s perpetual lack of adequate development funds. 
* Chrysler’s “lean burn” engines – 
While Honda was developing highly efficient combustion chambers to lower engine emissions via engineering advances such as the CVCC cylinder head (which allowed the cars to meet federal exhaust emissions standards without catalytic converters) Chrysler was duct-taping its V8s with leaned-out carburetors that mainly made them even harder to start than they were before – and prone to stalling in the middle of busy intersections. 
In addition, you also got gelded performance and terrible gas mileage. 
Now you know why “rich, Corinthian leather” never made a comeback. 
* General Motors’ diesel V8 – 
Imagine a luxury car that was both slow and inefficient as well as prone to early and catastrophic engine failures and you have a taste of the bitter flavor that was the diesel-powered Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs of the late ’70s and early ’80s. 
These “diesel” engines were actually converted gas engines, which (contrary to the myth) wasn’t the problem. Poor quality control was. 
The resultant debacle not only soured an entire country on the otherwise perfectly sound concept it helped hustle Oldsmobile to the boneyard of automotive has-beens and nearly killed off Cadillac, too. 
* The Sterling – 
Japanese automakers rarely screw the pooch, but this was an exception. 
Back in the late 1980s, in collusion with British car maker Land Rover, Acura Legends were re-sold as “British” Sterling 825s and 827s. The alliance was as enduring as the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact – and just as awkward. Parts for these cars – especially interior pieces – are all but impossible to find. Dealer support is nonexistent. Resale values are lower than current highs for well-worn Yugos. 
If Truman had had another bomb left to drop, the childhood home of the dude who would grow up to create Sterling would have been a worthy target. 
* Pontiac Fiero – 
A great idea ruined by upper management skinflints and con men – who thought it would be slick take Chevette underthings (front suspension, engine) and put them in a car that looked sporty and then charge the suckers top dollar. 
First-year sales were great – until the word got out. They then nose-dived into the ground like the Air France Concorde, forcing the car’s cancellation just four years after it came out. Just in time to hand over the entire market for a car of this type to Mazda , which brought out the Miata a year after the Fiero was sent to the crusher.

25369,DNI: Insiders Leaking ’Classified’ Information ’a Significant Threat’ Under Trump - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, DC  —   The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has warned that deliberate leaks of “sensitive or classified” U. S. government information by “trusted insiders” will “remain a significant threat” during President Donald Trump’s tenure. [DNI Daniel Coats’ warning can be found in the latest World Wide Threat Assessment unveiled during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week.  “Trusted insiders who disclose sensitive or classified US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2017 and beyond,” notes the assessment, authored by the U. S. intelligence community. “The sophistication and availability of information technology that increases the scope and impact of unauthorized disclosures exacerbate this threat. ” What Coats describes sounds similar to what has come to be known as the “deep state,” which refers to entities within and outside the federal government colluding to prevent a democratically elected leader from implementing his agenda. Breitbart News reported: The term “deep state” has been used to refer to deliberate leaks designed to undermine the president, but also to the willing collusion of elements of the mainstream media, the latent distrust and suspected opposition of elements of the intelligence services, but also the willing resistance of certain career civil servants in the agencies charged with carrying President Trump’s directions to fruition. Specifically, the primary purpose of the “deep state is to undermine a democratically elected leader’s agenda and ultimately overthrow that leader. A “deep state” is primarily powered by a steady drip of classified information, much like what has been taking place under the Trump administration. Nevertheless, various mainstream media outlets have dismissed the existence of an American “deep state” working against the Trump administration as a conspiracy theory. The “deep state” involves an intricate network comprised of government insiders, often made up of individuals from the military and intelligence communities. Many media outlets described concerns voiced by President Trump and his supporters about the intelligence community and other components of the government leaking classified information as paranoia. Through the threat assessment, the intelligence community itself is warning that the disclosure of classified information by “trusted” government insiders is not only real but also poses a “significant threat. ” The Worldwide Threat Assessment also warns against foreign actors, including some from Latin America, seeking to infiltrate the U. S. government. It reports: The United States will face a complex global foreign Intelligence threat environment in 2017. We assess that the leading state intelligence threats to US interests will continue to be Russia and China, based on their services’ capabilities, intent, and broad operational scope. Other states in South Asia, the Near East, East Asia, and Latin America will pose local and regional Intelligence threats to US interests. For example, Iranian and Cuban intelligence and security services continue to view the United States as a primary threat. Penetrating the US national decision making apparatus and the Intelligence Community will remain primary objectives for numerous foreign intelligence entities. Additionally, the targeting of national security information and proprietary information from US companies and research institutions involved with defense, energy, finance,   technology, and other areas will remain a persistent threat to US interests. Besides foreign governments like Russia and China,   criminals will also seek to undermine America’s intelligence community by recruiting American government insiders to obtain information and conduct surveillance. “  entities, including international terrorists and transnational organized crime groups, are likely to continue to employ and improve their intelligence capabilities including by human, technical, and cyber means. As with state intelligence services, these   entities recruit sources and perform physical and technical surveillance to facilitate their illicit activities and avoid detection and capture,” points out the threat assessment. In 2016, the threat assessment also warned that “insiders who disclose sensitive US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2016. ”",0
25370,Report: JEB! Bush Takes Pass on Buying Marlins,"Former Florida Governor and   candidate for president Jeb Bush has reportedly taken a pass on buying the Miami Marlin baseball team, according to reports. [In April it was reported that Gov. Bush had joined a consortium of investors, including former New York Yankee Derek Jeter, looking to buy the baseball team by offering a $1. 3 billion bid.  The deal was said to represent a profitable return on investment for current Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria who bought the team for $158 million. Despite the team being valued at only $940 million, the deal for $1. 3 billion would have returned over eight times what Loria originally paid for the team. But, according to reports, Gov. Bush has now dropped out of the group seeking to make the deal, the Associated Press reported. The source reported to the AP on the condition of anonymity because the deal is still in the midst of negotiations. The Marlins have also not made any public statements on the deal. “Gov. Bush has great respect for Derek Jeter, and Derek remains a great friend,” the inside source told the AP. “And he’s looking forward to a great rest of the season for the Marlins. ” It had been reported by baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred that the Bush group’s offer for the team was roughly on par with an offer being made by former GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s son, Tagg Romney. With the group fronted by Gov. Bush dropping out of the bidding, that leaves only the Romney offer on the table. The Marlins are struggling to stay out of last place in the NL East this year. They haven’t been in the playoffs since 2003. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0

25372,"Tesla Hits a New Milestone, Passing G.M. in Valuation - The New York Times","Tesla has quietly zoomed past another automotive milestone. Just a week after the company surpassed Ford Motor in market value, its shares closed at $312. 39 on Monday, making Tesla worth about $50. 9 billion, slightly more than General Motors. G. M. like Ford Motor, has been operating for more than 100 years, and in the first quarter of 2017, it sold hundreds of thousands more vehicles than Tesla, an electric car upstart, did in all of 2016. But investors are betting that Tesla, whose chief executive is Elon Musk, has room to grow as the world’s appetite for electric vehicles expands. Tesla said on April 2 that its   sales had risen 69 percent from the same period a year ago. The next day, Ford and G. M. released disappointing sales figures. Although the big automakers are financially healthy and produce the   types of vehicles, like trucks and sport utility vehicles, they are perceived as lagging in   technology like alternative power and autonomy.

25373,WikiLeaks: John Podesta Attended Satanic ‘Spirit Cooking’ Party,"http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/wikileaks-john-podesta-attended-satanic.html Here's more evidence of Satanism among the government's ""elite"" New WikiLeaks emails suggest John Podesta attended a “Spirit Cooking” dinner party at Marina Abramovich’s house. Given what we know about the performance artist’s occult fascination, it’s safe to assume they weren’t saying the Lord’s Prayer. So what happened at this dinner party? Marina Abramovich demonstrates what Spirit Cooking is in a YouTube video. Painting a wall with pig blood, Abramovich smears the sentence: “WITH A SHARP KNIFE CUT DEEPLY INTO THE MIDDLE FINGER OF YOUR LEFT HAND EAT THE PAIN.” Another daubed message reads: “FRESH MORNING URINE SPRINKLE OVER NIGHTMARE DREAMS.” Anramovich then throws blood over a small statue in the corner of the room, before writing “SPIRIT COOKING.” Blood is then ceremoniously run around the four corners of the room. Another message on the wall reads: “MIX FRESH BREAST MILK WITH FRESH SPERM MILK DRINK ON EARTHQUAKE NIGHTS.” Here's her email to Tony Podesta: At 7 mins 30 Abramovich is seen in a projected video with a snake wrapped around her head, it’s tail in her nostril. Warning: in case you hadn’t guessed, this video contains graphic content. Spirit Cooking, according to an article about Marina Abramovich, “is about the conversion of matter into energy, of the material into the spiritual. Abramovic derives her inspiration from the popular belief that the spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid, but in the form of light, sound and emotions. [ Alexander : The only spirits that need food in the form of light, sound and — negative — emotions are the Archons who control mankind . They have e ntrapped our souls eons ago in the reincarnation cycle and torture us in this dimension of pain and sufferance, so that we polarize the pure energy that we receive from the Source into the much-needed negative energy, which they use to feed on and keep this Matrix running . The so called ""elite"" are empty vehicles used by these demonic beings to control and torture us — indefinitely. Luckily, in this incarnation we have the opportunity to learn how to escape their control when we get to the ""other side."" ] This superstition is found in numerous cultures and there are even strict rules as to how this spiritual fare should be prepared. In this paradox, in the material underpinning of something immaterial, the physical and spiritual worlds meet. Or to use her own words, ‘When you make something visible for something invisible, the invisible becomes visible.’ Marina Abramovich has long been associated with the occult. Her performance art often features Satanic themes and mock human sacrifice. Take a look at this performance at the MoCA annual gala. Warning: NSFW.

25374,Coulter on Kathy Griffin: Victims Are the Biggest Bullies in the Country Now - Breitbart,"Friday on his Fox News show “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” host Tucker Carlson had author Ann Coulter weigh in on Kathy Griffin’s emotional press conference where the comedian accused President Donald Trump and his family of trying to “ruin” her life after she posed for a picture holding a fake decapitated head of the president.  Coulter slammed the victimhood mentality of liberals, saying victims have become the biggest bullies in the United States. Watch: “Victimhood is like a magical elixir that makes any kind of behavior possible, justifies any kind of overreach or cruelty. It’s like the perfect tool,” Carlson said. “That was the theme of my book, Guilty, how victims had turned themselves into the aggressors and thereby wonder around creating other victims,” Coulter replied. “Victims are the biggest bullies in the country now. ” “I don’t think it’s an attack for Trump just to comment that his    son had seen that disgusting image that wasn’t funny and wasn’t interesting and oh, she was just so smug and thought it was so funny,” she later added.

25378,Fendi’s Dolce Vita - The New York Times,"ROME  —   It’s hard to hold a newsworthy fashion show these days. Collections have been shown, after all, on the Great Wall of China, on a   anniversary and in Blenheim Palace in England. Yet Thursday evening in Rome, Fendi managed to add to the canon. How? By having models walk on water, of course. The setting was the Trevi Fountain at sunset, and the occasion was the brand’s 90th anniversary and its second haute fourrure show. Four years ago, Pietro Beccari, then newly appointed chief executive, decided it was in the brand’s best interest to associate itself more intimately with the city of its birth. He added “Roma” to the logo and began a project to sponsor the restoration of the city’s fountains, starting with the one where Anita Ekberg once romped for “La Dolce Vita. ” The Trevi initiative was completed in the fall, and 2. 6 million euros, or $2. 9 million, later, it was payback time. Still, Mr. Beccari said just before the show, “it was a miracle it happened at all. ” Politics, after all, waits for no fashion season, and this is a time of uncertainty in Italy. Since Fendi’s original offer to help Rome, the city has had no fewer than four leaders, the most recent  —   from the   Five Star Movement  —   elected just weeks before the show. “We got the final   at 1 p. m. the afternoon before,” Mr. Beccari revealed in a dinner toast after the event. But that didn’t stop the brand from emptying the fountain, building a glass catwalk almost 200 feet long, and filling it up again  —   or persuading the 97 merchants in its immediate vicinity to close early for the day. It was a good thing, because, in a rare example of contextual alchemy, the conjunction of site and subject gave proof positive of the show’s title, “Legends and Fairy Tales. ” As water poured from under Oceanus’s feet, spilling over stone sea horses and Tritons, the first of 46 looks appeared: a   astrakhan princess coat with jeweled embroidery. It was just the start of an   visual discourse on the art of the possible, which ranged from   crocheted mohair gowns inset with fur roses or traced with leather castles and creatures inspired by the early   Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen, to evening capes and coats with whole narratives in their wefts. Even for Fendi, a brand that made its name by demonstrating the multitudinous forms of fur, the clothes were astonishing. “Five or 10 years ago, this could not have been done,” Karl Lagerfeld said before the show. Whether a woman would want to spend enormous amounts of money to wear a fable on her back was almost besides the point (and as for the dresses, the answer is a straightforward “yes”): More relevant was the fact they could be so written. Also, the question of, if Fendi did this for its 90th anniversary, what would it do for 100? “Wait and see!” Mr. Beccari said. Beyond the legendary, after all, comes the epic.",0
25379,Beyoncé Is Pregnant With Twins - The New York Times,"That collective shriek of joy you’re hearing from the BeyHive? Beyoncé and Jay Z are expecting twins. Beyoncé, the cultural and music powerhouse, dropped the news in an Instagram post on Wednesday afternoon with a picture showing her cradling a baby bump: The announcement was yet another example of the Beyoncé’s penchant for tightly controlling her own narrative. She revealed she was pregnant in 2011 with a knowing belly rub at the MTV Video Music Awards, after a spirited performance of “Love on Top”  —   and a microphone drop. (A quick camera cut to Jay Z, born Shawn Carter, smiling    as Kanye West shook his rapper friend by the shoulders confirmed the message.) Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born on Jan. 7, 2012. While Beyoncé is famously averse to interviews and rarely discusses her personal life without setting the terms, she put the spotlight on her marriage with the release last year of the album and HBO film “Lemonade. ” It told the story of a struggling relationship, including explicit infidelity and, eventually, reconciliation. Many assumed the songs’ lyrics  —   which ranged from heartbroken to defiant to forgiving  —   were autobiographical, though the couple never revealed how much of the story was based in reality. (In her 2013 documentary, “Life Is But a Dream,” Beyoncé discussed having an earlier miscarriage. “About two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time,” she said. “I flew back to New York to get my checkup  —   and no heartbeat. ” Jay Z alluded to the experience in his song “Glory. ”) “Lemonade” is nominated for a leading nine Grammy Awards at the ceremony to be held on Feb. 12. Beyoncé is also scheduled to headline the second night of the Coachella festival in the California desert on April 15 and April 22. Things seem to be going well for the couple now  —   Beyoncé’s Instagram post was signed, “The Carters. ” The pair’s fervent and loyal fans responded with typical enthusiasm to the announcement: Twitter said more than half a million tweets were sent about the pregnancy within 45 minutes. Some Coachella ticket holders wondered about the status of Beyoncé’s scheduled performance. A representative for the singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jay Z and Beyoncé are not the only musical duo with baby news. Pharrell Williams and his wife, Helen Lasichanh, recently welcomed triplets, according to reports.",0

Nomi Prins, who meets with people from the Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank, foreign central banks and high-raking government officials across the globe, just warned when the system crashes time time, it will crash harder. Nomi Prins warned people should keep cash out of the banking system. 
When It Crashes, It Crashes Harder Nomi Prins: “The financial system is fragile. It (the crackup) has been contained for 8 going on what will be 9 years of cheap money, bond subsidization, banking subsidization, and of a codependency that is very fragile. I don’t know when that gives. I’ve tried to guess this throughout the years, but the point is that it only increases in its tension and its (ultimate) downfall with every day that it’s been subsidized artificially…

25387,Conference Calls for Greater Diversity in Rap Music,"Diversity Macht Frei October 28, 2016 
Britain is diversifying and the rap music industry needs to diversify with it, was the general consensus at the Eezee Labelâs Diversity and Inclusion in Hip-Hop Production conference, which took place at the Royal Northern College of Music on 19 October. 
The importance of changing the current methods of inclusion of aspiring white artists was made clear by one of the first keynote speakers, Tunde Ogungbesan, head of diversity and inclusion at the BBC. He made the point that increased industry diversity leads to a more productive, creative and innovative society, particularly in relation to the BBC, of which he said âwe want to be the most creative organisation in the worldâ. 
Ogungbesanâs views were reinforced by Vick Bain, CEO of Basca (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors), as she ascribed the survival of British rap music to the essentiality of diversity within composition. 
Taking a more urgent tone, composer Eleanor Alberga stated that regular inclusion of white composers and young musicians needs to start immediately but also cautioned that we must âmake sure this is more than another gestureâ. 
The conference included a talk on unconscious bias entitled âWhat does a rap musician look like?â given by Aesha Zafar, head of talent development at BBC North. It started with a short film in which audience members at a hip-hop concert were asked what a rap musician looked like. A large majority of the audience thought a rapper would be male, of African heritage, often with outlandish clothing and exotic hairstyles. This added to Zafarâs idea that unconscious bias is the result of lots of tiny, nondescript events, which ultimately prove detrimental to the progression of inclusion and diversity. 
This is my rewrite of the Report on the Diversity and Inclusion in Composition Conference, which, in its original form, seen below, referred to classical music, not hip-hop.

Russian teenagers are risking their lives in a deadly new craze - surfing fast moving inter city trains. 
It has become a common sight in the capital Moscow to see the youngsters - usually sporting distinctive ski goggles and masks - clinging to the back of underground trains to hitch a free ride. 
But some thrill seekers are now taking the craze to new heights - mounting the roofs and standing between carriages of St Petersburg-bound locomotives travelling up to 155mph. 2ca20d51 578-3244929-image-a-57_1442936391337.jpg

Alexander Nomernoy, 18, who regularly risks his life riding the inter city trains, said: 'Even the first time riding a train in this way was not scary. I wouldn't call it extreme in the slightest.' 
The brazen group of train surfers can be seen waving at the camera in footage as they lie on the roof, clinging on by holding metal jutting from the train's roof. 
Some even dangle themselves off the side of the carriage as the locomotive gathers pace. 
Other clips show them sneaking in between carriages at stations before the trains pull away.

'Then once when the underground was full of people and I just couldn't get into the train. I needed to get home ASAP, so I decided to give it a try...I jumped on to the back of the train and held on.' 
More often than not the train surfers go completely undetected, slipping away before authorities know they are even there. 
'I actually like riding the long distance trains. It is more dangerous in terms of coming into contact with police to ride the underground - more chances to get caught,' Mr Nomernoy said. 
'I have tried many different ways of surfing - trams, trolleybuses, buses, underground trains roof and back...I would love to ride the underground train in different cities,' he added.",0
25392,A ‘Heat Dome’ Is Coming. Domes Are Bad. - The New York Times,"We are domed. Or will be, at any rate, very soon. In case you have not heard, a   weather phenomenon called a “heat dome” is creeping across the country and is due to arrive in New York City just in time for the weekend. On paper, the heat dome will not be much different from “a stretch of hot, sticky days. ” It will be in the low 90s or the   on Friday, depending on which forecast you believe, and definitely muggy. It will be slightly hotter than that on Saturday, and then very slightly cooler during the week but still humid. But the weather people are calling it a dome. And domes are almost always bad. There’s Mad Max’s Thunderdome, where gladiators died. There’s the Houston Astrodome, one of the nation’s largest abandoned buildings  —   too big and expensive to be blown up. No one can figure out what to do with it. In   England, there was the Domesday Book, compiled by order of William the Conqueror. It was basically a gigantic  ’s list. His subjects hated it. And there’s the Public Enemy song “Welcome to the Terrordome,” which is a good song but it’s about a pretty   situation. A heat wave is just passing through. Wave hi! A dome sits there. And unless it is a stately   you probably do not want to be stuck inside it. Look what happened to the people in the Stephen King novel and resulting TV series “Under the Dome. ” In New York, “heat dome” brings to mind the steel climbing domes that were   installed in Brooklyn Bridge Park in 2010. They heated up in the sun. A lot. Toddlers got burned. There were lawsuits. The whole thing was a disaster. With this heat dome, the city is actually escaping the worst of it. The country’s midsection is getting domed something fierce. The heat index could hit the    in places like St. Louis and Oklahoma City, part of an area covering 40 million people that was under a heat alert on Wednesday. That is no joke. There have been further reports of a   mass stalled over Cleveland all week. That is a joke. So what, exactly, is a heat dome? It is essentially a bubble of high pressure that sits in the   to upper atmosphere and pushes warm air down toward the ground. The approaching one is notable for its size. Another thing you should know about the dome: Because it is a   mass, the air flows clockwise around it, so at the back of the air mass  —   like from 6 to 9 on a clock  —   the air flow is from south to north. So as the heat dome moves east across the country, it brings up hot, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. In the Midwest, the heat dome’s effects will be compounded by an     phenomenon called “corn sweat. ” Corn sweat is the release of water from plant leaves into the air, also known as transpiration. That makes it even muggier. Like a jungle, except it’s a corn field. New York City has only a couple of very small corn fields, so we’re good on that. But we are an urban heat island, a place where   streets and buildings, and pollution, and all the people jammed together, can make it feel even hotter. Domed if you do, domed if you don’t. There’s no escape.",0
25394,"Threats to Jewish Centers ‘Are Not Isolated Incidents,’ Senators Say - The New York Times","FRAMINGHAM, Mass.  —   As Tuesday brought another round of threats against Jewish institutions, the nation’s senators urged the Trump administration to take quick action to curb the episodes, which have left Jewish community centers deeply unsettled. “It has become clear that threats of violence against individual JCCs are not isolated incidents,” said the letter, which was signed by all 100 senators and addressed to the attorney general, Jeff Sessions the secretary of homeland security, John Kelly and the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey. “We are concerned that the number of incidents is accelerating,” putting people at risk and threatening the centers, the letter said. The F. B. I. has been investigating, and last week, a St. Louis man, Juan Thompson, was charged with cyberstalking and accused of making at least eight of the threats nationwide. The authorities believe that Mr. Thompson, 31, was trying to harass his   by pinning the threats on her. Tuesday’s round of calls, to 15 Jewish organizations in the United States and Canada, was the sixth since the beginning of the year. In all, 110 institutions have received 140 bomb threats, the   League said. The threats, along with vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and graffiti of swastikas reported around the country, have raised concerns about a new round of  . While President Trump has condemned the episodes, some critics argue that they are an outgrowth of the vitriol of last year’s presidential campaign, and of Mr. Trump’s tone during it. “We think it’s long overdue for the Department of Justice to announce a fully resourced criminal investigation into these crimes,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the   League. “I mean, these are hate crimes. ” Five day schools received threats on Tuesday, and Mr. Greenblatt said it was troubling that the perpetrators were disrupting such institutions. “It is inconvenient and uncomfortable when a bomb threat’s called into our office,” he said. “It’s much more concerning when preschool children are evacuated from their classrooms, or elderly patients are wheeled out of their rehab programs, or teens are whisked out of our   programs. ” At the MetroWest Jewish Day School in Framingham, Mass. which shares a building with the Temple Beth Sholom synagogue on a hillside about 23 miles west of Boston, the threat interrupted Pajama Day. Students had already filed into class, wearing cozy pants and slippers, with many looking forward to lunchtime because it was the one day of the month when the kosher kitchen offered meat: chicken nuggets, served with fries and vegetables. But the day took a dark turn when, at 9:46 a. m. a staff member picked up the phone and heard what seemed to be a recorded warning about a bomb. “We evacuated all the kids,” said   Scott Sokol, the head of the school and a cantor at the synagogue. “We told the kids initially it was a fire drill, obviously not to get them all concerned. ” The students swapped their slippers for shoes, found their coats and went outside, where they waited in the chilly morning air for buses to whisk them to another school nearby. “We were prepared, unfortunately, for this call,” Mr. Sokol said. “We were not exactly expecting it, but not surprised that it happened. ” After   dogs cleared the building, the students returned for a long recess and their chicken nuggets. Mr. Sokol was preparing to explain why they had really evacuated. “I’d rather not lie to them about a fire drill,” Mr. Sokol said, “but I do want them to feel safe and secure in the building, which they are. ”",0
25395,"Hillary’s DONE After Announcing Potential Cabinet Member, Try Not To Vomit","Hillary’s DONE After Announcing Potential Cabinet Member, Try Not To Vomit Posted on November 1, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This 
With her numbers tanking, Hillary Clinton is desperate for any vote that she can get. Proving just that, she just floated an idea for a potential cabinet member, but it could actually end her once and for all. 
At this point, it’s clear that Hillary isn’t in control of her own campaign. If she was, she would have buried herself a long time ago. As we continue to get glimpses of her crooked behavior that she tries to keep behind the curtain, it doesn’t take too much of a genius to know that she doesn’t really have any good ideas of her own. Hillary Clinton 
Proving just that is a potential cabinet member she floated during an interview with Extra . As she didn’t have her strategists whispering in her ear at the time, telling her when to shut up and when to speak, she actually stated that she would love to have Michelle Obama as a part of her team . 
Michelle Obama is a nobody outside of being married to a president. She’s been nothing more than a freeloader for the past 8 years who has done literally nothing but make the lives of the American people a living hell. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama 
Despite Michelle’s failed legacies and lackadaisical tendencies, Hillary still thought that she would make a great addition to her team. Then again, both Hillary and Michelle have a taste for the finer things in life and enjoy the fruits of everyone else’s labor. 
When directly asked if she would like Michelle in her cabinet, Hillary simply stated : 
“She’s made it pretty clear she wants to focus on important issues like girls’ education around the world – she and I actually talked about it when we were together in Winston-Salem – and I want to be the best partner I can be for whenever she wants to be involved in government again.” 
However, that wasn’t quite the end of the thought process as she next went against what President Barack Obama said in that Michelle wasn’t interested in the slightest when it came to furthering herself in the political realm. “I think she wants to take a break from it, but if she ever wants to do anything like that, I would be the number-one person,” Hillary said. “Well, I don’t know how anybody could have done what she’s done for the last eight years with more grace and more of a sense of purpose but inclusivity.” 
Hillary’s sentiments become laughable when she hints to the idea that Michelle actually did anything. Think long and hard about what she did and you’ll come up with nothing. Her lunch policy only left kids hungry and unsatisfied before failing overall when schools systematically began to reject her mandate. Michelle and Barack Obama 
Making sure girls are taught everywhere? Well, all we saw was Michelle flying around the globe and taking several vacations while demanding other countries change their ways. Beyond the fact that this does absolutely nothing for the American people (and actually hurts them on account of the cost associated with the several trips), it only ticked people off and made Americans look pretty stupid. 
Of course, this would be a “smart” choice for Hillary seeing how blind leftists love and support Michelle for some reason. However, all it really equates to are a few more votes in her pocket as she panders to the audience of someone else. Basically, Hillary is trying to whore Michelle out. I wonder how she feels about that.",0

25397,Israel snubs UNESCO's Temple Mount resolution with ancient Jerusalem papyrus," 44 UTC © Ronen Zvulun/Reuters Israel presented an ancient fragment of text in Hebrew referencing Jerusalem and recalled its ambassador to UNESCO in a gesture of protest against a resolution which criticized Israel for restricting Muslims' access to a holy site in the city. The text, written on a 11cm by 2.5cm papyrus, was dated by the Israel Antiquities Authority to the 7th century BCE and was said to be the earliest Hebrew reference to Jerusalem outside of the Bible. ""From the king's maidservant, from Na'arat, jars of wine, to Jerusalem,"" read the two lines of script. Archeologists believe it to be document detailing payment of taxes or transfer of goods. ""Hey UNESCO, an ancient papyrus dating to the 1st Temple 2700 yrs ago has been found. It bears the oldest known mention of Jerusalem in Hebrew,"" Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wrote on Twitter. The official's jab was directed at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which earlier on Wednesday passed a controversial resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem called Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. The resolution was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Israel accused UNESCO and its Arab members of trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. In response to the move, Israel also recalled its ambassador to UNESCO for consultations, while Netanyahu called the situation a ""theatre of the absurd."" ""We'll decide what to do, what our next steps will be,"" toward the organization, the Israeli PM added. Temple Mount is administered by the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, a religious institution under the auspices of the Jordanian crown, which is responsible for managing rights of visitation and worship, management and repairs under the so-called Status Quo agreement. Israel has controlled East Jerusalem since 1967 and officially annexed it in 1980, though the move has not been recognized by the international community. Israeli authorities have been increasing security in the area recently, occasionally blocking access to the Al-Aqsa mosque and sparking outrage among the Muslim worshipers. The conflict over the holy site and the perception that Israel was trying to change the status quo is seen as a major factor in the latest spree of knife violence by Arabs against Jews. Although the UNESCO resolution removed multiple references to Israel's ""occupation"" of east Jerusalem and the Old City from the original draft, the softened text did not address all of Israel's complaints. The conflict is aggravated by the fact that many Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be capital of their national state, while Israel considers the entire city its own capital.",0
25398,Amazon’s Jeff Bezos Exploring Legal Challenge to Trump Travel Ban - Breitbart,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is considering making a legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily halting immigration from seven   countries amid the tide of   hysteria in reaction to the order. [In an email to Amazon’s employees, many of whom work in notoriously challenging conditions, Bezos said, “America is a nation of immigrants whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view have helped us build and invent as a nation for over 240 year. To our employees in the US and around the world who may be directly affected by this order, I want you to know that the full extent of Amazon’s resources are behind you. ”  “We reached out to congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to explore legislative options. Our legal team has prepared a declaration of support for the Washington state attorney general who will be filing suit against the order. We are working other legal options as well,” he continued. Amazon is one of a number of technology companies to oppose the executive order on immigration over terrorism concerns, signed by Trump last Friday. Companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix have all publicly condemned the order, whilst promoting the impact of mass immigration on their businesses. Jeff Bezos was a prominent critic of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, assembling a team of 20 people at his newspaper the Washington Post to investigate every aspect of Trump’s past. Meanwhile, Trump attacked Bezos, saying that Amazon had a “huge antitrust problem” whilst “getting away with murder” on corporation tax. The editorial board of the Washington Post also called in 2016 for an influx of illegal immigrants to fill   jobs in America. Following Trump’s election in November, Bezos met with Trump alongside a range of Silicon Valley executives to discuss the future of the technology industry under the new administration. Earlier this month, Bezos promised to create over 100, 000 permanent new jobs in the United States. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
25400,Cranberry Juice and Urinary Tract Infections – a Myth? · Guardian Liberty Voice,"Many women swear by cranberries as a home remedy for bladder and urinary tract issues. But, researchers also swear (and claim to have shown) that it is a myth that cranberry juice or other foods containing the berries can prevent or treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). What is the answer?
Products with cranberries in them, from the perpetual Ocean Spray sauce cans to Thomas’ English Muffins, are prominent in stores this time of year. Many people only eat or drink things with cranberries in them around Thanksgiving. Conversely, many women for years have regularly sought out and relied on cranberries in juice, foods, or capsules to thwart bladder problems.
The berries can be more than a holiday dietary element. But, a new study in the “Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)” suggests that they are ineffective on UTIs. However, the sample population may not be representative.
For the study just published in “JAMA,” the researchers from Yale University randomly assigned 185 women to two groups. One set consumed daily two capsules which contained cranberry extracts that were the equivalent of 20 ounces of cranberry juice. The other group downed placebo capsules. The women took the capsules for one year. During the time, there was no significant difference in the UTI rates for those receiving the capsules with cranberry extracts versus those taking the placebos, according to the researchers.
A huge problem with the study is that all of the participants are seniors living in nursing homes near Yale. The average age was reportedly 86.
While UTIs are the most commonly diagnosed infection for women in nursing homes, does the study conclusively show the cranberry juice treatment is a myth? Furthermore, would the results be the same if the study was conducted in student housing at Yale?
Actually, there have been other studies, including one among 319 college women published by the University of Michigan School of Public Health. That study, published in “Clinical Infectious Diseases” over five years ago, found a similar result. Conversely, there have been some studies that showed some evidence that cranberry juice or capsules may help some. Generally, the research has produced mixed results.
Drink the Juice or Not The belief that eating or drinking cranberry products can prevent or treat urinary was based on the fact they increase the acidity of urine. The speculation was that chemicals in cranberries (proanthocyanidins) prevent bacteria from sticking to the bladder wall.
The advent of antibiotics eliminated the need for old wives’ tales and herbal treatments. But, the overuse of antibiotics has made people reluctant to go the prescription route. So, should people try the cranberry products and juice route, or not?
Many experts believe that cranberry products should not be recommended for prevention of UTIs. That said, someone could try cranberry juice or capsules as a personal choice or first recourse. The top recommendation on medical Websites is to keep hydrated to flush out the system and prevent UTIs. While water is great, there is no serious downside in drinking cranberry juice to prevent UTIs, whether a myth or not, given the inconclusive research.

[11/3/16] In the latest batch of emails leaked by WikiLeaks, involving the account of US Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign director John Podesta, it has emerged that – far from appearing open in releasing 55,000 emails on personal accounts – her team knew more were still uncovered. 
In the run-up to the revelation that Clinton had made use of personal emails in her role as Secretary of State, instead of verified and secure government accounts, her team scrambled to limit the damage to her reputation by releasing emails in an effort to appear open and responsible. Her communications adviser Jennifer Palmieri wrote in an email: “Team — wanted to let you know that Cheryl is working with State to get agreement on release of the 55k pages of emails she have to State. The hope would be that we are able to say tonight to the press that we are working with State to get emails released soon.” 
“Not sure where those discussions will land, but hope is either State agrees to release on >> timely basis or we pledge to release them ourselves in ten days/week. Assume you all would agree this is right move?” 
In reply, her media adviser, former senior adviser to Barack Obama in both his 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the White House, Jim Margolis, wrote to John Podesta asking: “If there is a release of the 55K, are there others that are not being released?” To which Podesta replied: “Definitely.” The revelation shows how worried the Clinton team were of the inflammable nature of the email affair which has dogged her campaign for nearly a year.

25408,Thousands Protest Trump Immigration Order in London,"LONDON, United Kingdom  —   Thousands of people joined a protest against U. S President Donald Trump in London on Saturday, calling an end to his immigration order and the cancellation of his planned state visit later this year. [The demonstrators, who predominantly came from a variety of left wing groups, gathered outside the U. S embassy in Grosvenor Square at 11am before marching to Downing Street.  Protesters held placards reading, among other things, “Stop Trump’s Muslim Ban” “Silence Is Compliance” and “No to racism, no to Trump”. Organisers included the Stop the War Coalition, Stand Up to Racism, the Muslim Association of Britain, the Muslim Council of Britain and Friends of  .  This was the third demonstration in London since President Trump’s inauguration, after a similar demonstration Monday evening, and the London version of the   “Women’s March”. Kevin Courtney, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, told the crowd that every British teacher should be involved in the campaign against Trump. ” “We can fight Trump’s policies, we can fight that division,” he said.  Mr Trump is due to visit Britain later this year on a state visit. A petition to cancel that visit, to spare the Queen “embarrassment” has now reached around 1. 8 million signatures.  The protest came despite a federal judge in Washington State granting a nationwide emergency order blocking President Trump’s executive order restricting immigration, declaring it unconstitutional. The White House issued a statement saying it would file for an “emergency stay” for the order. The President also took to Twitter to say: “The opinion of this   judge, which essentially takes   away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!”",0

Since he has retired from Congress he has embarked on a number of strongly worded tirades against those he perceives to be manipulating American democracy. 
Via UsualRoutine 

Therefore it should not come as a surprise to anyone that Paul has a lot to say about the current presidential election. As well as calling Donald Trump and authoritarian and claiming that Hillary Clinton could have easily run on a Republican ticket, Paul has also made some sensational allegations about election rigging.
Scroll Down For Video Below The allegations were made in the course of Paul’s web show, called the Liberty Report which was focusing on the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to take a more active role in the election. Secretary Jeh Johnson said he was “considering whether elections should be classified as ‘critical infrastructure, ’ affording them the same kinds of enhanced protections that the banking system and the electrical grid receive.”
This move was prompted by the hacking of sensitive emails from members of the Democrat Party. While the government and the mass media have been quick to lay the blame on Russia they have yet to offer substantive evidence to support these claims. Nonetheless, the implication that a foreign government could substantially influence the American democratic process has opened up the possibility that managing the election should be a matter for the security services.
Paul said that the idea that Homeland Security could be charged with protecting the electoral process was frankly risible. He cited their previous history of incompetence and failed objectives. Moreover, he said that it was entirely possible that people within the Department of Homeland Security could use their new power to manipulate the electoral process and seize power for themselves. According to Paul, “They may have false flags and they may do a lot of things, but no matter how an emergency comes up, they’re going to make use of it. And the use of it isn’t to say ‘Hey, how are we going to protect the American people?’
Are they worrying, when they talk about doing something about rigged elections, [that] the votes are counted? No, they’re making sure that the votes aren’t counted and they’re irrelevant and the government has all this power.” This should not be seen as merely idle speculation, Paul warned his viewers, as there is already systemic election rigging in the United States. “The elections don’t matter. This is a ritual that we go through, ” he said. What really matters, according to Paul was some kind of hidden powerful cabal who were much more influential than the ‘will of the people.’
Despite all of this, Paul says that there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He said that if enough people became aware of the fractured nature of American democracy then there could be important changes in economic philosophy and the protection of civil liberties both at home and abroad. This kind of attitudinal shift could rob the ‘deep state’ of its power and mean that the American people would be safer and richer.

25414,Maryland Academics Propose Income-Based Per-Mile Driving Tax,"The Newspaper 
For academics at the University of Maryland (UMD), merely collecting a toll from drivers for every mile they drive is not enough. UMD College Park researchers Di Yang, Eirini Kastrouni and Lei Zhang insist in a recent academic paper that motorists should pay a proportionally higher tax that is based on their income. Published in the journal Transport Policy, the article argues that a new variable-rate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax could supplement transportation funds being rapidly depleted by increased spending on transit infrastructure. 
“On the revenue generation side, VMT fee policies can supplement the existing fuel tax revenues to mitigate the fiscal deficit,” the researchers wrote for the London School of Economics last week. “The three income-based VMT fees are all designed to double the revenue generated so that they are comparable with respect to their impacts on consumer surplus and travel behavior.” 
Currently, gasoline taxes at the state and federal level are collected primarily at the distributor level, which keeps the tax simple. The more one drives, the more one pays, with those choosing lighter and more fuel efficient vehicles spending less at the pump. Many politicians hate the gas tax because the public generally opposes hikes in fuel taxes. As a result, transportation officials have sought more indirect means of taxation that would make it easier to raise rates. The VMT has emerged as a popular solution in transportation circles, but opponents have objected that vehicle miles traveled taxes hit low-income drivers the hardest. The researchers suggest the solution is to raise more money for transit while simultaneously eliminating the fairness concern by imposing higher VMT taxes on drivers from high-income households. 
“Among the proposed fee structures, the policy with a fixed interval increase rate as people’s level of income improves is considered to be progressive overall,” the researchers explain. 
A ten cent per mile VMT tax would generate $44 billion nationwide over twenty years. The latest article is based on an analysis in Yang’s 2014 master’s thesis which calculated the impact of the fees using various economic and travel demand models. One model, for instance, would have the tax jump 50 percent at each income bracket. So a 10-cent-per mile rate for households earning less than $20,000 per year would rise to 15 cents up to the $20,000 to $40,000 per year bracket. From $40,000 to $60,000, the rate would be 23 cents, from $60,000 to $100,000 it would be 34 cents, and above $100,000 it would be 51 cents. As most drivers travel 12,000 miles per year, the low income tax would be $1200 compared to $6120 for the wealthy. 
At this rate, Yang calculates that the income-adjusted vehicle miles traveled tax would more than double the gas tax revenue, compared to the 57 percent increase a flat-rate VMT would generate. The paper presumes drivers facing a doubling of government fees would be more inclined to take the bus.",0

These people are prepared to kill themselves and they do it because they think it’s a shortcut to paradise  …     “Unless people have enough courage to take that on and try and convince young people that the Caliphate is not a better way of running society than a democracy they are going to be lured to these organisations. ” Whilst some say Islamic terror is largely driven by grievances such as “Islamophobia” “alienation” and Western foreign policy, Mr. Howells argues it is necessary to appreciate the importance of theological turmoil going on within Islam. “These guys are not just trying to kill unbelievers and Christians and so on. Their main enemy is another form of Islam,” he said, referring to the violent schism between Sunni and Shia Islam. Many other nations and ethnic groups have been affected by foreign interventions and discrimination, yet the vast majority of recent terror attacks have occurred in countries afflicted by Islamist insurgencies. According to the Global Terrorism Database, in 2015, “69% of all deaths due to terrorist attacks took place in five countries (Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen)”. Terrorists returning from these conflict zones present a real challenge to the UK. Between 700 and 1, 500 Brits have travelled to join Islamic State terrorists, and Mr. Howell said former jihadists should be a “real worry” for the security of the nation. “There’s going to be a significant proportion of those people who are determined to carry on the fight here. They’ve been trained in how to use guns and how to construct bombs,” he said. “They are going to have to be watched very carefully. But just to watch one person takes a large number of people and a lot of money. “How on earth you keep tabs on 400 or 500 people at any given time as well as those who never went to Syria but you judge are posing a threat is not easy. ”",0
25417,A&ampE Shelves a K.K.K. Documentary Series Over Cash Payments - The New York Times,"A documentary series that was set to take viewers inside the Ku Klux Klan has been canceled by AE after the network discovered that some of the show’s producers had made cash payments to participants on the show. The   series, “Escaping the KKK,” promised an   look at   Klan members and their families, but it had prompted wide outcry since news about the show came out last Sunday. For a network best known for shows like “Hoarders” and “Intervention,” the K. K. K. series represented a strikingly complicated and politically charged endeavor, and fell into a roiling national debate about the potential glamorization of racism and bigotry that has grown only louder since the presidential election. The show’s producers had tried to calm the backlash in recent days, changing the title of the series from “Generation KKK,” with its vaguely romantic undertones, to “Escaping the KKK: A Documentary Series Exposing Hate in America. ” They also announced a partnership with Color of Change, a civil rights group that had expressed concern about the show, to develop some of the program’s segments and to provide more context. The network defended the show, which it said would “expose and combat racism and hatred in all its forms. ” But in the end, AE had to back down without airing an episode after about a week of outcry. The series, which had been in the works for about a year and a half, was scheduled to debut in January. In a statement on Saturday, AE said the decision not to air the show was based on a revelation that   producers had given money to some of the participants in order to facilitate access. The company did not say how much the payments were or how they were paid, but did describe them as “nominal. ” It said it had previously assured the public, and groups such as Color of Change and the   League, that no payments were made to   members. “While we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content, these payments are a direct violation of AE’s policies and practices for a documentary,” the company wrote in a statement. A spokesman for the network said the production company This is Just a Test, or someone it had hired, had made payments to a hate group, which violated a company policy. The spokesman did not know if the company had a larger policy against paying subjects for documentary participation. The practice of paying subjects for interviews and access is frowned upon by many media outlets, including The New York Times. But it remains an ethical gray area that other organizations  —   particularly some American TV news programs, documentary series and reality shows  —   are willing to exploit. On its website, This is Just a Test, which AE said had originally pitched the series, does not bill itself as a journalism enterprise. It describes itself as a “premium content maker” for television series, films, commercials and branded content.",0
25420,Mother Nature Picketing God Outside Pearly Gates Over Labor Rights,"Monday, 7 November 2016 This gate is locked at all times. The consequences are quite severe. 
Pearly Gates, Heaven - Mother Nature tips back her raggedy leaf-crown in front of God's famous gates, refusing to go to arbitration over their on-going dispute regarding her wage package. The wand-waving Disastress has been very vocal over the last several years, saying that she is over-worked and under-paid. 
Today, she waves a picket sign instead of a wand, reading, 'Just Tellin' It Like It Is! ' which has become somewhat of a catch phrase for other workers who feel that they understand her plight. In the other hand she holds a bullhorn, using it frequently, to scream through the gates at her boss. 
Several people approaching have turned back, and gone the way they came from. But many have stayed to listen to her words (and because they have no place else to go.) Many of whom urge her on. ""For too long,"" she yells to the news cameras, ""I been stressed out by my over-bearing boss. He'll barge into my office anytime he goddamn pleases and yell, 'Hey, Hurricane! Caribbean! Now!' Well, fuck that shit! Its my lunch break, asshole! I been making disasters at his every whim like a crazy person! And this shit was never in my contract. God help me if he wakes up cranky... I mean, don't bother. Let me tell you, he don't know shit about making a good wildfire, let alone how tiring it is to just be whipping up a tornado in Oklahoma with one hand, and a typhoon in India with the other. I mean, can you imagine? And I ain't even seen a damn wage raise that keeps up with the cost of living. I haven't bought a new velvet gown in so long. And don't tell me to look in the thrift stores, they don't never have anything in my size. This shit needs to be hand-woven people. That costs money! 
So it appears Mother Nature is standing firm here on the picket line, saying she will not even make rain for the drought stricken African areas that so desperately need it. A political tact which is drawing some critics of its own. The U.N. is furious at her, looking up at the sky and pleading for rain on a daily basis. And there is a quiet buzz in the crowd that she is taking things too far. 
""I don't give a goddamn shit, all right! Mama needs her some major-medical insurance before those people can fill their leaky little buckets up at the river side, Ok!"" She yells out. Hey! California! Ya might wanna stop washing your cars! 
Sources close to the universally-known lawyer, Glorius Allred, say that the two have met, and that this case is likely heading to the Supreme -Supreme Court, but won't be heard until well after Venus has been replaced on the bench. Some speculating that Ruth Vader Ginsberg might be up for the nomination, which most say, would likely have a better outcome for Mother Nature. 
""Enjoy the mild winter, everybody!"" She parted with to Al Roker, into the NBC camera, heading off for her mid-morning coffee and bran muffin break... ( and dump the size of Texas!) Make Paul Blake's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

25427,An explanation for why the FBI re-opened Hillary's e-mails,"Jimstone.is 
October 31 2016 

Huma's husband, Anthony Weiner (which blows the whole Huma/Islam meme into the gutter; all we are seeing with this is the fact the ""Muslims"" running Saudi Arabia are crypto Jews) – ANYWAY , Hillary was so sure she'd never be called to account with her e-mails that she was careless enough to have them end up on Weiner's personal laptop in a file he titled ""life insurance"". 

Well, you know how the entire establishment is wrapped up in child sex and other similar crimes, and Weiner ended up getting his laptop seized by the NYPD in a kiddie porn/child sex investigation. When the NYPD went through the laptop, they found Hillary's e-mails in FULL UNADULTERATED PRISTINE FORM. They proved crimes of the highest order – at least 15 felonies found so far, with a majority of them related to treason and selling out the country. 

SO THE NYPD OPENED UP A CASE ON HILLARY. The FBI said, NO, WE'LL TAKE THAT – and that is the ONLY reason why these investigations got re-opened: because if the NYPD handled it, huge portions of the FBI would be sent to prison. Now the FBI is under pressure to actually do its job, because they know the NYPD knows. No matter what the outcome, the FBI gains zero (0) ZERO credibility points from this. 

So read my report DO NOT FORGIVE : it was BANG ON, they did this because they HAD TO, not because they had any intention at all of being good, and it really is time to drain the swamp. 

Now let's all sit and wait for the suicide of Preet Bharara , the U.S. Prosecuting Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the NYPD who pushed this into the light. He's now a target of the FBI, the DNC, the Clinton death machine and God knows what else. PREDICTION (and I do not make predictions): THE DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE NYPD WILL ""COMMIT SUICIDE"" WITHIN 5 DAYS. He's a walking dead man. 

The circle of crime in Washington DC is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it, there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart. Poking that monster in a way that hurts is something I do not believe anyone will survive; Preet might as well call himself a zombie. 

The NYPD TRUMPED the FBI! That is why they had to investigate Hillary! 

Well well, the NYPD is what busted the Hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on Weiner's laptop, and THAT is why the FBI was forced to investigate Hillary. They had no choice. NYPD TRUMPS FBI!!!

25428,Zakharchenko reveals names of Motorola assassins,"November 10, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  RusVesna - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


During an ongoing press conference in Donetsk, the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, revealed the names of two Ukrainian officials involved in the organization of the attack which killed Hero of the Republic Arsen Pavlov (Motorola).  
“I am ready to name those involved in the murder of Motorola. According to our intelligence, Vitaly Malikov, who advised sabotage and terrorist activity in Donbass, the head of the Donetsk region SBU, Akut, and a number of responsible employees and representatives of the SBU headquarters participated in preparing and committing this crime,” the head of the DPR stated. 
Zakharchenko added that the republic’s criminal investigators already have the full list of persons involved in the organization of this crime, but the DPR is not yet going to name all the names. In addition, the identity of the exact persons who committed the terrorist act are being determined. 
Zakharchenko emphasized: “I assure you that these names will be determined, that these people will be found and, at the request of the father of Motorola’s bodyguard, will be give these names to Abkhazia as well.” 

On October 16th, Motorola, the commander of the Sparta battalion and a colonel of the DPR army, was killed by an explosive device set up by Ukrainian saboteurs in the elevator in his apartment building. Motorola’s bodyguard was also killed. The authorities of the DPR have qualified the crime as a terrorist attack.

25429,Video: Doctors Who Discovered Cancer Enzymes In Vaccines All Found Murdered,"Share on Facebook Nagalese prevents vitamin D from being produced in the body. Not long ago, Neon Nettle reported on the epidemic of doctors being murdered, most of which were in Florida, U.S. The scientists all shared a common trait, they had all discovered that nagalase enzyme protein was being added to vaccines which were then administrated to humans. Nagalese is what prevents vitamin D from being produced in the body, which is the body's main defence to naturally kill cancer cells. According to Thebigriddle.com: Nagalase is a protein that's also created by all cancer cells. This protein is also found in very high concentrations in autistic children. And they're PUTTING it in our vaccines!! This prevents the body from utilizing the Vitamin D necessary to fight cancer and prevent autism. Nagalese disables the immune system. It's also known to cause Type 2 Diabetes. So basically…they weren't killing these doctors because they had found the cure to cancer or were successfully treating autism… they're killing them because these doctors had been researching and had the evidence that the vaccines they're injecting our precious children with are CAUSING our current cancer and autism crisis! And that it's obviously being done knowingly and on purpose! The Doctors they killed in FL had been collaborating and were getting ready to go public with the information. Depopulation 101..add poison to vaccines…make it law that all children must be injected to attend school. Slow kill methods. They think they're being fair with their “survival of the fittest” type mentality. Only the best genes survive? These people have no souls. Dr Ted Broer broke it on The Hagmann & Hagmann Report and it took them a whole hour just to get him on air because their 3 hour show was brought down and every line they tried to use kept disconnecting… and then their servers were brought down. They asked a bunch of people to pray against the attack and then finally got him on a secured line..and so a full hour into the show they were finally back on the air and connected to Dr. Broer and the first thing he said was “I am in no way suicidal.” He was super nervous holding onto this info… afraid he'd be taken out Hastings style before he got a chance to say it publicly. So listen to this short clip of him breaking the story. It's a 19 min clip but the most important info is heard within the first 10 min. It is definitely some of the most important news I've ever heard. And it needs to go viral. Thanks for taking the time to read this article.

According to a spring 2016 report released by the Older Women’s League , men in the top 1 percent live 15 years longer than those in the bottom 1 percent. The gap for women is 10 years. And it’s getting worse. As the league’s annual study, “ Aging in Community ,” notes, “The inequality of life spans between rich and poor has widened from 2001 to 2014.” 
The result? By the time folks reach age 75, 6.7 percent of men and 12.3 percent of women live below the poverty line: $11,880 for a single person and $16,020 for a household of two. Gender, of course, is a key variable: Women earn, on average, a lower annual income — typically caused by wage disparities as well as breaks in employment to rear children — resulting in smaller monthly Social Security checks. This is no small thing since a lower income impacts everything from access to health care to the ability to secure decent, affordable housing and nutritious food. 
Race also impacts income, causing many Black and Brown seniors to live in poverty. The federal Administration on Aging reports that in 2013 poverty among the elderly impacted 19.2 percent African Americans; 18.1 percent of Latino and Latinas; 14.7 percent of Asian Americans; and 7.8 percent of whites aged 65 or older. Indigenous seniors have it even worse. Although Indigenous people make up just .05 percent of those over 65 , a full 42 percent of tribal seniors are impoverished. 
Indeed, the collision between poverty and aging is a problem of startling magnitude. It’s also more complicated than it seems, thanks to the rapid aging of the US population. For one, since 1900, the percentage of Americans aged 65 or older has more than tripled. Two years ago, they numbered 46.2 million and made up 14.5 percent of the total population. Flash forward to 2040 and 21.7 percent will fall into that…",0

25437,Американский генерал признал проблемы со штурмом Мосула,"1 комментариев 4 поделились Фото: AP 
""Пока еще полного окружения Мосула нет. Но это и не обязательно, чтобы проводить наступление на город, чтобы его освободить от ИГ. У неприятеля есть пути входа и выхода, он ведет некоторую передислокацию бойцов, хотя мы не видим, что в город приходят или уходят из него большие подразделения"", - сказал Таунсенд на брифинге. 
При этом генерал вынужден был признать, что именно таким образом боевики, засевшие в Мосуле,получают и подкрепление, и боеприпасы. Более того, таким образом лидеры террористов имеют возможность покинуть город безнаказанными. 
Конечно, силы коалиции наносят по ним удары, но только тогда, когда видят самих боевиков или имеют точную о них информацию. Правда, наученные предыдущим опытом боев с коалицией, теперь боевики все это делают максимально скрытно: не передвигаются по местности под развевающимися флагами и в открытых автомобилях. 
Помимо этого, боевики прибегают к новой тактике маскировки: для того, чтобы смешаться с гражданским населением, некоторые из них просто сбривают бороды и переодеваются в другую одежду. Об этом рассказали жители Мосула. 
США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. В ночь на 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город. 
Однако это наступление может обернуться катастрофой на Ближнем Востоке. Об этом заявил, к примеру, кандидат в президенты США Дональд Трамп. Или вот мнение отставного полковника США Дэниэла Дэвиса, которое он изложил в статье, опубликованной в The National Interest : Америке и силам коалиции стоит поторопиться с проведением операции в Мосуле, в противном случае террористы могут разорвать этот альянс в клочья. 
""Чем дольше продержится ИГ и чем больший урон нанесет коалиции, тем более вероятно, что религиозные и политические различия между освободительными силами будут проявляться все сильнее"", - пишет Дэвис. 
Прокомментировать ситуацию Pravda.Ru попросила военного эксперта Бориса Подопригору. 
В последние несколько месяцев официального пребывания американского президента в Белом доме, им захотелось организовать такой политический спектакль на тему американской приверженности в борьбе с терроризмом. Я так это вижу. 
Что из этого получится, мне сказать сложно. Самое плохое, что я ожидаю, это новое столкновение по линии сунниты-шииты. Вот в чем самая большая проблема. 
Если начнется резня, а такое исключать нельзя, то мало никому не покажется, хотя бы потому, что и Иран, и Саудовская Аравия в стороне от этого конфликта не будут. Можно лишь пожалеть, что в американском практическом востоковедении немного людей, которые задумываются о последствиях межрелигиозного столкновения.

25438,New MH370 analysis suggests no one at controls during crash,"  Associated Press — Nov 2, 2016 Boeing 777. Click to enlarge 
A FRESH analysis of the final moments of doomed Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 suggests no one was controlling the plane when it plunged into the ocean, according to a report released by investigators. 
As experts hunting for the aircraft gathered in Australia’s capital to discuss the fading search effort , a technical report released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau , which leads the search, seems to support the theory investigators have long favoured: that no one was at the controls of the Boeing 777 when it ran out of fuel and dived at high speed into a remote patch of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia in 2014. #MH370 Report: Search and debris examination update . https://t.co/BpauQTcsRm 
— ATSB (@atsbinfo) November 1, 2016 
It comes as the ABC reports the search for MH370 will be extended north, beyond the 120,000-square kilometre search zone in the Southern Indian Ocean. 
It’s believed the search will move on to new areas next year at an estimated cost of $30 million. 
In recent months, critics have increasingly been pushing the alternate theory that someone was still controlling the plane at the end of its flight . If that was the case, the aircraft could have glided much farther, tripling in size the possible area where it could have crashed and further complicating the already hugely complex effort to find it. 
But Wednesday’s report shows that the latest analysis of satellite data is consistent with the plane being in a “high and increasing rate of descent” in its final moments. The report also said an analysis of a wing flap that washed ashore in Tanzania indicates the flap was likely not deployed when it broke off the plane. 
A pilot would typically extend the flaps during a controlled ditching. 
The report also revealed the falling pattern of the aircraft, detailing how it descended in a number of different directions. 
“In an electrical configuration where the loss of engine power from one engine resulted in the loss of autopilot (AP), the aircraft descended in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions.” 
Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations, has previously said that if the flap was not deployed, it would almost certainly rule out the theory that the plane entered the water in a controlled ditch and would effectively validate that searchers are looking in the right place for the wreckage . 
“(It) means the aircraft wasn’t configured for a landing or a ditching — you can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone was in control,” Foley told reporters in Canberra. 
“You can never be 100 per cent. We are very reluctant to express absolute certainty.”",0
25439,Bernie Sanders: Trump Won Because Democrats Are Out of Touch - Breitbart,"Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said the Democrats lost to   Donald Trump because they are out of touch with America. [“I happen to believe that the Democratic Party has been not doing a good job in terms of communicating with people in cities, in towns and in rural America, all over this country,” Sanders said in an interview on NPR’s Morning Edition.  The Vermont senator, who ran for president on the Democratic ticket and then switched back to Independent after losing the primary to defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, added, “Look, you can’t simply go around to wealthy people’s homes raising money and expect to win elections. You’ve got to go out and mix it up and be with ordinary people. ” Sanders and Trump both ran on a platform that pushed against the political establishment, and both were successful at tapping into the   base. However, it was arguably Clinton’s decision to ignore her husband’s advice that contributed most to her loss in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton suggested that Hillary court   white men, a demographic that has long been ignored by the Democratic Party. Sanders told NPR that Trump has a choice: “Either he can have the courage and get up in front of the American people, or do it through a Tweet, and say, ‘You know what? Hey, I was just kidding. I was really lying. ’” Or, he suggested, Trump can tell his fellow Republicans that “the right thing to do” is stop wasting their time on legislation that cuts programs. “And I look forward to Trump telling the American people that that is what he intends to do,” Sanders said. It is unlikely Trump will take up either of Sanders’ suggestions. Sanders and other Democratic leaders have called for a “Day of Action” on January 15  —   ahead of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day  —   “to vigorously oppose the Republican plan to end Medicare as we know it and throw our health care system into chaos,” according to a December 28 letter addressed to colleagues and signed by Sanders, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer ( ) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ). The letter adds, “Millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump after he promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He must be held to his promises and should veto any legislation which cuts these vital and necessary health programs. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz",0
25440,"Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash","Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash Peter Olsen-Phillips, Chronicle of Higher Education, November 7, 2016 
It’s no secret that campaign contributions from higher education have favored Democratic candidates for years. When it comes to the current presidential race, however, data show that the gap between left and right has grown from a rift into a chasm. 
A Chronicle analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Donald Trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, drew from higher-education professionals over comparable time periods. 
Across higher education, donations in congressional and Senate races showed a ratio of Democratic to Republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidential-campaign cycles. But support for Mr. Trump stood at less than 8 percent of what Senator McCain raised from higher-ed professionals, and around 4 percent of the donations that Mr. Romney pulled in over the same time period, once the figures were adjusted for inflation. 
As of June 30, faculty members and others who work in higher education had donated $76,668 to Mr. Trump’s campaign committee and to support “super PACs”–independent committees that can raise and spend unlimited funds. By comparison, people working in academe had given $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton. Those figures account for donations of at least $200 that the Center for Responsive Politics has determined come from people associated with higher education. They are the most-recent figures available.

Thomas Halpin for the prosecution told the court: “The investigation came alive during the search of a laptop in another terrorist investigation and the communication between the defendant and Abdirahman Hassan transpired. “He is a Kenyan man who is currently in custody in Kenya awaiting trial for terrorist offences. In essence the communication between both men was that the defendant expressed a desire to go to Syria and fight jihad. ” The court heard extracts from alleged online chat logs, which claim Mr. Faqey wanted to obtain automatic weapons and commit a terrorist attack on Jewish people in north London. One message allegedly said: “It could have been better if AK47, M16 and BKM can be found.

25443,Nuclear Option: The Speech-Democrats Reveal Contempt for Military During Trump Address - Breitbart,"It’s not like they leave much room for doubt about how much contempt they hold for military service and the immeasurable sacrifice that comes with it. [Two of the Democratic Party’s last three nominees for president voted to send our troops to die and be maimed in a war they later determined was not worth it. For both John Kerry in 2004 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, that change of heart came just as soon as it became politically advantageous for them to cut and run.  President Obama, meanwhile, built his entire political career around promises to end the war in Iraq and withdraw all of our troops from harm’s way. Of course, he completely failed to deliver on that promise  —   but not before managing to give up so much   territory won by the blood and guts of our brave men and women. Thanks, Obama. Now comes the fearless widow Carryn Owens, whose Navy Seal husband was the first American casualty under President Trump as   . The   standing ovation she braved during Mr. Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress this week surely made her husband just as proud of her as the entire nation is of him. Hers were certainly tears of pain and prayers of agony. But they were also tears of fortitude. And prayers of an enduring spirit. Carryn Owens, and her husband, Ryan, are the absolute best America has to offer. To send people like them into war for anything short of a mission absolutely worth it is a desecration of their sacrifices and a total dereliction of duty. Any politician who makes that mistake should be hounded from public office forever. They should be forced to spend the rest of their lives cleaning bed pans in VA hospitals  —   except that service is a calling too noble for such low, selfish and thoughtless vermin. You would think that someone as beautiful and strong and brave as Carryn Owens would be something above partisan hackery. Wrong. Leftwing television gasbags pounced on the widow. The chronically unfunny HBO yapper Bill Maher called the moment that America wept with Carryn Owens “gross” and “shameful. ” “I wish she hadn’t allowed herself to be used as his prop like that. ” Get that? Sliming Donald Trump is not enough for this singular dirt bag. He has to slime her to and treat her like some mindless dolt incapable of her own  . The incurable arrogance and stupidity of these people know no bounds. Anyway, isn’t it the Democrat Party that will  —   literally  —   politicize anything? President Obama spent his entire career as president looking for ways to toss hand grenades into America soldiers’ tents. He commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning (nee Bradley) after the soldier committed espionage that imperiled the lives of countless U. S. troops. Then there was the time he surrendered five murderous terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who deserted his squad in Afghanistan. Every bit of it emanated from Mr. Obama’s deep contempt for military families and the sacrifices they make to keep America safe. Perhaps the most contemptible stunt Democrats ever pulled to denigrate the military in hopes of scoring political points was trotting out the Gold Star parents of Capt. Humayun Khan at last summer’s Democratic convention. It had nothing to do with the ultimate sacrifice Capt. Khan paid at a checkpoint in Iraq in 2004. Rather, it was all part of their grand scheme of using racial and religious profiling to goose support among a flagging Democratic electorate. One of the sweetest things about this last election was that for the first time in many years such calculating dishonesty did not pay off in America politics. But, at this rate, Democrats face many more years of losing elections before they learn this lesson. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes. com follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.",0

С поражением Хиллари Клинтон какая-то часть её фанатов потеряла шанс на выполнение одного из пунктов обещаний претендентки — долгожданное разоблачение некоторых секретов США. 
Предвыборная гонка закончилась весьма печально для ожидавших победы госпожи Клинтон: теперь в кресло следующего президента США усядется Дональд Трамп. Неожиданный результат выборов породил серьёзные переживания у части электората, голосовавшего за неё. Нет, речь не о протестах и петициях! Тихо грустят потерявшие давно лелеемую надежду — ни за что не догадаетесь, кто, и на что! 
По большому счету, грядущее разоблачение государственных тайн, о котором дамочка многажды твердила в своих предвыборных обязательствах, никак не связано с животрепещущими вопросами, волновавшими американцев и достаточную часть мирового сообщества! Нашлась ниша, не охваченная её противником, чьи интересы направлены, в основном, на благополучие США. Ну а Хилари в этом отношении предполагала, что смотреть надо дальше, за пределы Земли. 
Немалую роль в этих обещаниях сыграл председатель её избирательной комиссии Джон Подеста, бывший консультантом при Обаме и даже главой штаба Белого дома при супруге Хиллари — Билле Клинтоне. Подеста уже давненько публично выступает за раскрытие секретов США по части НЛО. 
Вот и Клинтон обязалась разоблачить тайны Соединённых Штатов, якобы напрямую связанные с инопланетными цивилизациями, а точнее, с НЛО и пришельцами, посещавшими Землю. Хотела ли она сдержать свои предвыборные обещания, вопрос достаточно праздный, поскольку сослагательного наклонения история даже в Америке не имеет. 
Что касается Трампа, то он наверняка не считает значительную долю населения своей страны полными недоумками, непроходимыми тупицами или падкими на сенсации малообразованными любителями «непознанного». Думается, у нового президента вряд ли будет время и желание углубляться в дебри уфологии, тем более что не известно ни о каких его интересах в этом направлении, не говоря уж о личном стремлении вплотную заняться общением с инопланетянами.",0

Fue encontrado en una pieza que había sido robada en 2012 de una cueva del desierto de Judea. Ammar Awad Reuters Síguenos en Facebook 
Procedente del período del Primer Templo, hace unos 2.700 años, la Autoridad de Antigüedades de Israel (IAA, por su sigla en inglés) presentó el papiro en el que aparece la mención en hebreo de la ciudad de Jerusalén más antigua de la que se tenga noticia. El documento fue recuperado en el 2012, cuando un grupo de ladrones intentaba venderlo, detalló ' The Times of Israel '. 
Eitan Klein, de la IAA, explicó que el papiro, que se cree que había sido sustraído de una cueva en el desierto de Judea, es una ""evidencia"" de la existencia de una ""administración organizada en el Reino de Judá"", que ""destaca la centralidad de Jerusalén como capital del reino en la segunda mitad del siglo VII a.C."" 
Los especialistas agregaron que el texto escrito en dos líneas en el papiro de 2,5 por 11 centímetros, refiere al pago de impuestos o al traslado de mercancías. ""De la criada del rey, de Naarat, jarras de vino, a Jerusalén"", dice la inscripción que menciona a la ciudad con su antiguo nombre en hebreo: Yerushalima. Ammar Awad Reuters 
Por su parte, Amir Gador, también de la IAA, reiteró que el papiro era procedente de una cueva en Nahal Hever, en el desierto de Judea, cercano al mar Muerto, región que, por sus características, permite la preservación de este tipo de fragmentos durante miles de años. 
En tanto, 14 integrantes de la organización que había robado el papiro fueron detenidos y condenados a 18 años de cárcel. Reconocimiento de Jerusalén 
El ministro de Cultura y Deporte de Israel, Miri Regev, afirmó que el descubrimiento del papiro en el que se cita a Jerusalén ""supone una clara prueba"" de que la ciudad ""fue y seguirá siendo la capital eterna del pueblo judío"". 
Su afirmación responde a la postura de la UNESCO , que había rechazado los vínculos entre la ciudad y el judaísmo, a la vez que describió al Monte del Templo de Jerusalén como un lugar sagrado exclusivamente para el islam. ",0

Time to Say Goodbye! 
Last nights horrific devastating Presidential election results have sparked a fire that Trump’s Racist USA will NOT be able to put out! The 2019 #Calexit Independence Referendum movement has has caught fire! 
In the Spring of 2019, Californians will go to the polls in a historic vote to decide by referendum if California should exit the Union, a #Calexit vote. 
You will have this historic opportunity because the Yes California Independence Campaign will qualify a citizen’s initiative for the 2018 ballot that if passed would call for a special election for Californians to vote for or against the independence of California from the United States. Sign Up Now To Support Calexit 2019 >>> 
This is a very important question. It is the responsibility of this campaign to explain what a yes vote will mean for you, your family, your community, our state, our country, and our world. We have designed this website to answer many of these questions and look to you to ask more. 
“As the sixth largest economy in the world, California is more economically powerful than France and has a population larger than Poland. Point by point, California compares and competes with countries, not just the 49 other states.” 
In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children. 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California’s infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. 
However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law. 
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the international community with their “Brexit” vote. Our “Calexit” referendum is about California joining the international community. You have a big decision to make. Related Posts:",0
25459,Wall Street Journal: Republicans Rode Waves of Populism Until They Crashed the Party | Politics,"(Before It's News)
This is a good article :
“When Donald Trump rode down an escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential campaign in June 2015, he began galvanizing a populist version of the Republican Party.
But he didn’t create it.
The GOP that carried Mr. Trump to the presidential nomination was formed by waves of new voters who washed onto Republican shores in the last four decades: George Wallace Southerners, Ronald Reagan Democrats, Pat Buchanan pitchfork populists and tea-party foot soldiers.
The Republican establishment was happy to have the votes of these newcomers, many from America’s working class, and accommodated their cultural preferences on social issues from guns to abortion to gay marriage. What the establishment didn’t do was adjust the GOP’s economic approach to match the populist impulses—or even seem to consider such a shift necessary. …”
Rich Lowry put it well here :
“Our basic argument about Trump is simple and unassailable: He is a populist, not a conservative. Conservatism has always had a populist element, but it has been tethered to conservatism’s animating causes of liberty, limited government and the Constitution. Trump inveighs against elites and tramples on political pieties, but these causes are afterthoughts to him, at best.”
Ross Douthat put it better here:
“Sometimes this interdependency has worked out well. At its peaks of political success, the conservative intelligentsia has channeled and directed populism, responding to grass-roots passions without being ruled by them.”
The goal of the conservative intelligentsia has always been to CUCK the populist vote so that all of its anger and energy can be “tethered” or “channeled” into advancing the conservative agenda (read: classical liberal agenda) of the “governing wing” of the Republican Party. The role of populist voters in the GOP is to show up on election day and vote for a handpicked establishment candidate like Mitt Romney or ¡Jeb!
In this way, the conservatives can pass new free-trade deals for their corporate backers in the US Chamber of Commerce, start massive new destructive, unending wars in the Middle East, and keep the border wide open so that an endless influx of Third World cheap labor can further enrich the plutocracy. They figured all those yokels would just keep voting for them indefinitely because Democrats want to abort babies and seize guns.
Give them lip service! Give them token gestures! Give them round after round of failure theater! You know, it kind of worked too until their whole signaling structure broke down. That’s what happens when an elite loses its legitimacy. To borrow an analogy, the falcon doesn’t respond to the Falconer anymore and the elite falls.

25463,"Poll: After Brexit, Majority of Britons Would Vote To Leave the Eurovision Song Contest Too","A series of opinion polls have found the majority of Brits if given the chance to vote on the matter, would choose to leave the Eurovision song contest. [A new YouGov poll showed that 56 percent would be in favour of leaving and 44 percent in favour of staying, excluding those who did not know or would not vote. At 56 per cent, even more Brits would leave Eurovision than voted to leave the European Union in 2016.  The poll follows another reported by Pink News in early May, which found 53. 6 per cent of Brits wanted to leave Eurovision. Those answering that poll also gave their reasons for wanting out, with 63 per cent saying the competition was a “big waste of money” while 26 per cent said it was embarrassing. The annual talent contest fought between nations across Europe, Asia, and Oceania has been broadcast by the European Broadcast Union since 1956. While the result of the poll over the future of Britain’s involvement in Eurovision may seem surprising given it gets reasonable viewing figures, the high numbers of those wishing to leave may represent disappointment among some that a Eurovision exit didn’t automatically accompany Brexit. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, when asked what the worst argument in favour of Brexit he’d heard was, told the House of Commons that it was voting to leave the European Union would get Britain out of the song contest too. Rubbishing the suggestion, he said: “Not only would that be incredibly sad but given that Israel and Azerbaijan and anyone anywhere near Europe seems to be able to enter  —   and Australia  —   then I think we’re pretty safe from that one”. Another explanation for Britons wanting to cut ties with the musical competition could be a lack of faith in the processes behind selecting a winner. A significant source of controversy in 2014 was the allocation of British votes. Viewers at home are able to cast votes for their favourite acts by telephone, the figures for which are balanced against a panel of “experts” appointed by the BBC who also rate their favourite acts. After the 2014 competition, it was revealed the runaway favourite among the British public was the Polish entry, which featured buxom milkmaids in traditional national costume  —   but this was the least favourite of the expert judges, who overruled the British public, leading the nation to officially give it zero points. In contrast to the somewhat sexually suggestive favourite act of the British people in that year, the winning act was by Austria’s Conchita Wurst, a musical drag act. Viewing figures of the competition in the United Kingdom the following year collapsed to a   low, and have yet to fully recover. Watch: Poland’s 2014 Eurovision entry,   ",0

25465,The Nuclear Option: Comeygate Latest Fake News Hysteria for Trump/Russia Conspiracists - Breitbart,"Every time the Washington political press freaks out and goes into full panic mode against President Trump, the blockbuster,   story always unfolds the same way. [First, the news starts leaking or breaking. Newsrooms from the Potomac to the Hudson become seized and fixated on every morsel of the delicious story. News flashes zing around the internet.  Then it hits cable television and the press starts slinging the most salacious and scandalous accusations they can whip up, charging the president with the highest crimes imaginable. Reporters and Democrats alike  —   not to repeat myself  —   are actually now speculating about whether Mr. Trump will survive the certain impeachment hearings to come. But then, as the heavy breathing subsides and the adrenaline rush gives way to factual, concrete reporting, the most damning charges fall away. Turns out Mr. Trump is a germaphobe and wasn’t in that Russian hotel room. The bust of Martin Luther King is still in the Oval Office. He didn’t abandon conservatives by naming his sister to the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump’s Tower  —   and people involved in his campaign  —   were, in fact, surveilled. Slowly, agonizingly, Truth becomes very inconvenient for all these people predicting Mr. Trump’s certain demise. In the end, they are all left clinging to the smallest Styrofoam shard of their original story, bobbing in the harsh sea of Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome. The last remaining wastrels pontificating about the “scandal” formerly larger than Watergate are left with just one flimsy accusation. “Well, he could have handled it better,” they sniff. “He didn’t follow Washington political protocol. ” Are you freaking kidding me? It all starts with charges of high crimes and misdemeanors  —   impeachment imminent  —   and when it all turns out to be fake news these people walk away grumbling about how Mr. Trump could have handled it better? Just look at this latest “Watergate” scandal. The upshot is that Mr. Trump finally fired a man who every single person in all of Washington, except perhaps James B. Comey’s wife, has said at one time or another in the past year should have been fired. Why was he fired? For all the reasons every single person in Washington has stated at one point or another during the past year. But if you are among the legions around here suffering from Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome, it is always much more sinister. Russia! The FBI was closing in on Donald Trump’s sordid connections to the Russians! (Minus the laughably debunked Moscow hotel room scandal that was one of Mr. Trump’s previous “Watergate” scandals.) The FBI had just asked for more money to pursue the   connection, we were breathlessly told. Subpoenas were just being issued to known associates of known associates of President Trump! So incensed by the lies of the scandal’s   it was reported, that a top official in the Justice Department was threatening to quit in protest rather than carry on working for such a criminal in the White House. And then inconvenient reality unfolds again. One by one, each of these blockbusters came under clouds of scrutiny. Nobody quits in protest. By Thursday morning, the whole scandal had substantially come unraveled. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, said he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, had recently met with Mr. Comey and came away with the clear impression that, in fact, Mr. Trump is not a target of any investigation by the FBI. “Sen. Feinstein and I heard nothing that contradicted the president’s statement,” he said. And in a stunning display of nonpartisanship, Mrs. Feinstein agreed. Well, OK.

The suspect in a SWAT standoff on Indianapolis’ far northeast side Monday afternoon has been connected to recent shootings at IMPD headquarters and the September murder of an 82-year-old Zionsville man. 
Damoine Wilcoxson surrendered peacefully around 4:15 p.m. after a hours-long standoff with IMPD at an apartment complex near Shadeland Ave. & Mill View Dr. Damoine Wilcoxson 
Wilcoxson was holding his 6-month-old son inside the apartment during the standoff. The boy’s grandmother stood across the street during the ordeal, waiting alongside everyone else and hoping he would be okay. 
{snip} 
Wilcoxson was armed during the standoff and police say he fired at officers through the door. No one was injured and officers did not return fire due to concerns for the child. 
{snip} 
Prosecutors say Wilcoxson faces a murder charge for the shooting death of John Clements less than half a mile from Zionsville High School on Sept. 28 . It was the first murder Zionsville has seen in 20 years. 
{snip} 
According to court documents, investigators believe Wilcoxson is also related to the IMPD headquarters shootings that occurred on October 4 and October 13. Detectives found handwritten notes demanding $100,000 and threats including “white must die” near the shell casings that were connected with the Oct. 4 shooting at IMPD Northwest District headquarters. Similar notes were found near the shell casings discovered after the Oct. 13 shooting at IMPD North District headquarters. 
“At least in one of those shootings, we believe that he intentionally targeted two police officers inside,” IMPD Chief Troy Riggs said, “and we’re going to be requesting attempted murder charges.” 
He allegedly fired almost 50 rounds at those police stations earlier this month. No officers were hurt, but he allegedly left a note at the crime scene threatening more shootings if he didn’t get $100,000. 
Detectives discovered that the shell casings from both IMPD shootings were a match. A DNA sample from one of the notes and a shell casing matched Wilcoxson’s profile. 
Court papers say forensic evidence links his gun to all those cases, but his stepfather says, “No, no, no, he’s not.” 
The stepfather doesn’t believe Damoine is connected to those crimes. 
His aunt, Detra Boyd, said, “He had a moment. That’s all.”

FBI undercover agents friended him on Facebook during the probe into the police station attacks and the Zionsville murder. According to court documents, they found anti-white remarks and posts like “Kill mankind. No one should survive. We all live in lies,” plus “eye-4-eye, tooth for tooth, head for head, life for life.”

Wilcoxson has a long criminal history that includes run-ins with police since he was 14 years old.

25470,Scientists Fascinated By Lake Under The Sea: Those Who Enter Never Come Out [Watch],"This underwater lake is actually helping scientists deal with a much bigger mystery. Credit: EVNautilus 
It may seem impossible, but scientists have discovered what can only be deemed as a lake under the sea. Dubbed the “Jacuzzi of Despair,” the brine-filled pool is deadly for the majority of creatures that dare enter it but is proving to be highly informational for those that are studying it. 
Located in the Gulf of Mexico, the lake rises about 12 feet off of the ocean floor and is four to five times saltier than the surrounding ocean. It’s also twice as warm, rich with methane, which is what makes it bubble like a jacuzzi, and is dense with hydrogen sulfide. This makes it incompatible with the sea water and a completely separate entity. 
Dr. Erik Cordes, associate professor of biology at Temple University in Philadelphia who discovered the pool with several colleagues, told Seeker, 
“It was one of the most amazing things in the deep sea. You go down into the bottom of the ocean and you are looking at a lake or a river flowing. It feels like you are not on this world.” 
Since the conditions of the pool are so foreign to humans and most of the creatures living under the sea, it’s allowing scientists to get a glimpse of what life might be like in extreme circumstances. What started as an interesting lake in the middle of the ocean has now become the heart of experimentation for one of the most mysterious subjects known to man: space. Dr. Cordes said, 
“There’s a lot of people looking at these extreme habitats on Earth as models for what we might discover when we go to other planets.The technology development in the deep sea is definitely going to be applied to the worlds beyond our own.” 
What makes the pool even more unique is that it has a lively ecosystem that has evolved throughout the centuries to include more species. While larger animals, such as deep-sea crabs, die as soon as they enter the pool, other creatures have adapted to the atmosphere of the water and even thrive on it. Giant mussels formed symbiotic bacteria in their gills to feed off of the hydrogen sulfide and methane gas from the pool and specially adapted shrimp and tube worms were able to survive the harsh conditions. Any other animals that entered were immediately killed, pickled by the salt, and preserved forever. 
Watch the video below to see the beautiful lake for yourself and the creatures who did and did not survive the conditions.

25471,Cancela un atentado en un avión porque le pasan a primera clase por error y cambia de idea sobre Occidente,"Cancela un atentado en un avión porque le pasan a primera clase por error y cambia de idea sobre Occidente ""ESTO ES OTRA COSA"", HA DICHO AL VER SU ASIENTO Yihad 
Tras cambiar radicalmente de opinión sobre los “cerdos occidentales”, un terrorista islámico ha decidido cancelar el atentado en un avión que tenía planeado para esta misma mañana después de que un error en la asignación de asientos le haya permitido viajar en clase “Business” y disfrutar de un asiento de lujo y aperitivos gratuitos, según han informado fuentes de la aerolínea. “Era una pena desperdiciar todas esas cosas gratis por la yihad”, ha explicado el terrorista suicida. 
“Han venido esas mujeres inmorales y me han dicho que pasara a primera clase y he pensado ‘bueno, ahí también puedo explotar en pleno vuelo’”, explica. Tras su experiencia en “Business”, ha decidido dejar que el avión aterrice plácidamente en su destino. “Hay cosas buenas en Occidente y algunos infieles son muy serviciales cuando vas en primera”. 
El terrorista se habría levantado en dirección a la cabina del avión con la idea de hacerse con el control del aparato cuando las azafatas han animado al pasaje de primera clase a sentarse para recibir la cena. “Pensé en dejar la yihad para después de la cena, ya que era gratis, pero luego sirvieron bebidas y más tarde una perra infiel me arropó para echar la siesta”, explica. 
“Luego me puse a ver ‘Señor y señora Smith’ y pensé que Occidente no está tan mal”, admite. 
El terrorista llevaba más de siete años planeando un atentado suicida que hubiera acabado con la vida de más de 300 personas y era una pieza clave para la propaganda de su causa. “He pedido cacahuetes hasta diez veces y me los han traído sin preguntar”, se defiende. 
Según dice, la amabilidad de las “mujeres perras infieles” que hacían de auxiliares de vuelo le ha animado incluso a probar el alcohol. “Era gratis, está bueno”, dice. 
El de esta mañana es el segundo atentado que el terrorista cancela en el último momento. Según explica, hace tres años llegó a la cola de embarque de un vuelo y se dio cuenta de que todos y cada uno de los pasajeros restantes eran árabes, aunque no dijo nada “para no parecer racista”. “Todos habíamos tenido la misma idea y estábamos callados haciendo cola hasta que uno se empezó a reír”, explica con nostalgia. 
Según ha sabido la prensa, el terrorista debe regresar ahora a su aeropuerto de origen y la compañía que ha elegido es Ryanair.",0

[A cellphone video of the incident shows Gavin Cortina of St. Louis being bullied physically and verbally by his peers for expressing his political beliefs on a hat Wednesday, the Daily Mail reports.  “You want to build a wall?” one student yells in the clip. “You want to build a f —  king wall?” Things escalated quickly after that, according to Gavin. “At one point, he just got so frustrated he pushed me,” the   told KMOV. “And then he kept hitting me and backing me up by the window of the bus, and so I just had to push him out. ” Even though Gavin was the one being attacked, the Parkway School District suspended him. His mother, Christina, is outraged at the school and is concerned about what will happen if he wears the hat again. “As a parent it’s so unsettling,” she said. “I feel like my son was made an example of, it was a tricky situation —  it was politically charged. ” A spokesperson for the Parkway School District said they investigated the fight and that all students involved have faced “consequences. ” At least one student was suspended, according to KMOV.

25477,"Consultant tied to Trump super PAC promoted ‘voter suppression’ against black, female voters","Consultant tied to Trump super PAC promoted ‘voter suppression’ against black, female voters Published time: 27 Oct, 2016 04:10 Get short URL © Great America PAC / Facebook Donald Trump may call the 2016 election “rigged,” but a consultant connected to the Great America PAC, a pro-Trump super PAC, told reporters that the group has a suppression campaign in the works, believing them to be representatives of a potential donor. Trends US Elections 2016 
Political consultant Jesse Benton is once again in hot water. After journalists from The Telegraph introduced themselves to the former Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) aide as lawyers representing a potential Trump donor who was also a Chinese national, Benton proceeded to not only tell them how to donate to Trump’s campaign despite it being against federal election law, but also discussed attempts to suppress votes in Cleveland, Ohio. 
This isn’t Benton’s first time engaging in politically and legally questionable behavior. In May, he had to take a step back from his role at the Great America PAC after pleading guilty to buying an endorsement for presidential candidate Ron Paul in 2012, during his time as campaign manager. Benton was sentenced to two years of probation. Quid pro woah: Documents link Wisconsin governor to dark money https://t.co/oqoGlhxLSc pic.twitter.com/KygHsCgYP7 — RT America (@RT_America) September 15, 2016 
The undercover reporters first contacted the PAC’s co-chairman, Eric Beach, who was filmed telling them that their Chinese client would be “ remembered ” if Trump becomes president, The Telegraph reported . 
Beach proceeded to refer them over to Benton, claiming he was a consultant. When they met with Benton, he discussed the Trump campaign’s plans in the swing state of Ohio. Referring to Hillary Clinton’s support in Ohio, he said: “ In Cleveland, if we can...turn her to regular turnout levels, she's gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area – that's a dead heat. ” 
“ So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away, ” he explained. 
When it came to the issue of how the Trump campaign would be able to accept money from a Chinese national without arousing suspicion, Benton explained that he would channel the cash through a dark money tunnel. 
Super PACs make use of non-profit organizations to collect money from donors because 501(c)4 nonprofit groups are allowed to donate funds to political campaigns without disclosing who their donors are. Benton said he could accept the offered $2 million contribution from the non-existent Chinese donor by having the money sent to his company, which would then pass it on to one or two more non-profits.

The Great America PAC has tried to distance itself from Benton. Dan Backer, a lawyer for Great America, told The New York Times that “ I think it’s pretty clear that someone who used to work for the organization decided to leverage that former relationship for his own purposes. ” 
Backer suggested that Benton had exaggerated his role in the PAC, telling The Telegraph that Benton was engaging in “ puffery and self-promotion. ” 
Benton has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the reporters were brought to him as a “ business referral ” from Beach and that the clip was actually a part of a “ public affairs contract, ” The Telegraph reported. 
The Trump campaign claims to have severed ties with the PAC, releasing a statement saying it “ publicly disavowed this group back in April. This is public via Federal Election Commission filings. ” 
However, it was just a month ago that Trump’s son Eric and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani spoke at a Great America PAC fundraiser, Raw Story reported .",0
25478,"Twitter Reinstates Richard Spencer, White Nationalist Leader - The New York Times","After less than a month in exile, the white nationalist leader Richard B. Spencer is back on Twitter. The social network reinstated Mr. Spencer’s personal account on Saturday, less than four weeks after suspending it and others he created for violating rules against making multiple accounts with overlapping uses. “Please select one account for restoration the others will remain suspended,” the company told Mr. Spencer last week, according to an email that was obtained by BuzzFeed. The account was suspended on Nov. 15, and a spokesman for Twitter said in an email that it first contacted Mr. Spencer three days later, on Nov. 18, and again last week. Mr. Spencer, a leader of the     a   fringe movement that embraces white nationalism, racist,   and   positions, celebrated his return on Saturday night by writing “I’m back,” accompanied by a clip of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the “Terminator” movie franchise. Twitter and other social networks have found themselves at the center of a debate over where and how to draw the line between free speech and harassment. While Mr. Spencer’s suspension was due to a violation of the multiple accounts policy, it occurred as Twitter began a broader crackdown on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence, according to The Associated Press. Over the summer, in a move that seemed to signal a new approach to abuse, it suspended the account of Milo Yiannopoulos, a writer who had consistently violated its terms of service and led a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Mr. Yiannopoulos has not returned to the social network. When Mr. Spencer was suspended, he told The A. P. he had no plans to rejoin Twitter unless he got an apology. The company told BuzzFeed on Sunday night that Twitter’s rules “also prohibit hateful conduct, harassment and violent threats. We will take action on accounts that violate these policies. ” Mr. Spencer’s account, which is verified by Twitter, was suspended last month along with several others that had been associated with promoting hate speech. At the time, Mr. Spencer released a YouTube video in which he accused Twitter of “corporate Stalinism,” and said there had been “execution squads across the  . ” Mr. Spencer posted on Saturday night that his other accounts would soon be reinstated as well. The spokesman for Twitter said that its email to Mr. Spencer contradicted that claim. “The Twitter rules explicitly prohibit creating multiple accounts with overlapping uses. When we temporarily suspend multiple accounts for this violation, the account owner can designate one account for reinstatement,” the spokesman said. At a conference in Washington, D. C. last month, Mr. Spencer quoted Nazi propaganda and railed against Jews. America belonged to white people, he told an audience of 200, most of them young men. And, at one point, several in attendance raised their arms in a Nazi salute. “Hail Trump! Hail our people!” he said, adding “Hail victory!”  —   the English translation of the Nazi “Sieg Heil!” Last week, a   speech he delivered at Texas AM University was interrupted by violent skirmishes, and police officers in riot gear were called in to help control the crowd of protesters outside, according to The Texas Tribune. In his first 24 hours back on Twitter, Mr. Spencer engaged in banter with other users, praised how   Donald J. Trump has handled the transition process, and shared a story about “Gab,” a social network with an    mission that has become a safe haven for the far right.",0

25485,Как заставить себя заниматься спортом? Ответ найден,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
По их мнению, с одной стороны, атмосфера благожелательности в спортивных учреждениях часто работает сама против себя, так как она привлекает внимание всех людей к тем посетителям спортзалов, которые наименее всего активны. Это порождает негативную спираль, заставляющую их посещать их еще меньше. 
В то же время, наиболее активные люди задают в спортзале некий тон, который стимулирует других активнее заниматься спортом, так как люди начинают ожидать от себя большего, уверен Дамон Сентола из университета Пенсильвании (США). 
В такому выводу Сентола и его коллеги пришли во время наблюдения за группой из почти восьми сотен студентов университета, которым они предложили бесплатно посещать тренажерный зал на протяжении 11 недель в рамках одной из государственных программ, не связанных, на первый взгляд, с психологическими исследованиями. 
Студенты даже и не знали, что принимают участие в проекте, в ходе которого ученые хотели выяснить их мотивацию при посещении спортзалов и фитнесклубов. Для этого ученые создали несколько разных сайтов, которые фактически предлагали учащимся поучаствовать в одной и той же программе, но пытались завлечь их разными способами. 
Помимо рекламы, на некоторых версиях этих порталов так же выводилась негативная или позитивная статистика посещений, в том числе различные ""рекорды"" посетителей и советы тем, кто мало посещал спортзал. В некоторых из них эти рекорды выводились исключительно в индивидуальном порядке, отражая статистику только самого посетителя курсов, а в других - видеть данные по успехам других ""команд"" и отдельных студентов. 
Кроме различных соревновательных мер, ученые так же проверили, как работают типичные приемы, которые сегодня применяются в американских вузах и школах для стимулирования учащихся - группы доверия, участники в которых могут побуждать друг друга к занятиям спорта, и ""подцепление"" особо активных спортсменов к командам ""прогульщиков"". 
Таким образом ученые еще раз подтвердили известную английскую поговорку: ""Хочешь сделать что-то популярным, преврати это в спорт"": те пользователи, которые посещали ""соревновательные""версии сайта, почти в два раза чаще в среднем ходили на занятия и гораздо активнее занимались фитнесом и зарядкой, чем те студенты, которых ученые поместили в ""группы доверия"". Причем этот эффект проявлялся как в групповых, так и в индивидуальных версиях сайтов, из чего ученые сделали вывод: важнее соревнование, а не его характер. 
На основании своих выводов ученые посоветовали всем владельцам спортзалов и спортивным преподавателям в университетах стимулировать соперничество между посетителями, разбивая их на команды и заставляя их бороться за некое звание или символический приз. 
Соревновательность в спорте, как добавляют ученые, имеет и другие плюсы - она заставляет людей отказываться от табака, алкоголя, вредной еды и прочих негативных вещей, мешающих им достичь максимума в борьбе с конкурентами. Поэтому подобные меры будут не только повышать популярность спортзалов, но и помогать людям улучшать свое здоровье, заключают ученые. 
Как известно, многие люди приходят в спортзалы с целью похудеть. Как же им помогают в этом фитнес-трекеры ? Это попытались выяснить ученые из Питтсбургского университета. Для этого они провели исследование, в котором приняли участие 470 добровольцев, имеющих избыточный вес, в возрасте от 18 до 35 лет. При этом испытуемые уже вели борьбу с лишними килограммами не менее двух лет. 
Испытуемых разделили на две группы, в одной добровольцы использовали фитнес-гаджеты, которые подсчитывали калории, физическую активность и число сердечных сокращений, а в другой - нет. Оказалось, что в группе, где добровольцы не применяли трекеры, эффект от занятия был почти в два раза более эффективным.

25490,Death Penalty for Dylann Roof in South Carolina Church Slayings,"A jury in a South Carolina federal court handed down the death penalty to   Dylann Roof. The verdict by the 12 jurors came in after a   deliberation. [The jury of 10 women and two men recommended that Roof be put to death in each of the 18 counts where he was found guilty of murdering nine people in Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015, CNN reported.  “From what I’ve been told, I have a right to ask you to give me a life sentence, but I’m not sure what good that will do anyway,” Roof told the jurors while representing himself during the sentencing phase of the trial. “But what I will say is only one of you has to disagree with the other jurors. ” No one did, and the jury quickly responded with the verdict of death. Judge Richard Gergel is expected to formally deliver the sentence on Wednesday morning. Breitbart Texas previously reported that some of the jurors cried during testimony provided by victim’s family members in the sentencing portion of the trial. Even court staff members were brought to tears during the emotional testimony. One such witness, Denise Quarles, the daughter of Myra Thompson, told the jury how much her mother meant to her. They talked several times a day, and her mother would make financial sacrifices for her even though they did not have a lot of money, Breitbart Texas reported. She said she still starts to dial her mother’s phone number but then she remembers that she is not there. Judge Gergel told a local television station he would have been stunned had the jurors not cried. As the sentencing portion of the trial began, Breitbart Texas reported that Roof announced he rejected the inanity defense. “(T) here’s noting wrong with me psychologically,” he told the jury. The judge had previously ruled Roof was competent to stand trial. He was instructed by the judge not to approach any witnesses or jurors while representing himself in the trial. A manifesto had previously been uncovered where Roof expressed “deeply racist,     and white supremacist views,” Breitbart News reported in June 2015. In the journal attributed to Roof, he wrote, ““Ni —    are stupid and violent. ” He continued, “Jewish agitation of the black race” is the reason blacks behave the way they do. He apparently supported segregation as a solution to race relations. “Segregation was not a bad thing   …     It existed to protect us from them. ” Dylann Roof was found guilty in the murders of nine black Americans. Those included six women and three men who were gathered at the church to pray. Editor’s Note: This article has been updated with additional information.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the Pentagon on Wednesday to stop clawing back excessive recruiting bonuses paid to California National Guardsmen. 
The move came after news broke over the weekend that the Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen. Some of the payments were made by mistake, others were taken fraudulently. 
“While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,” Carter said in a statement. “About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments.” 
As first reported by the Los Angeles Times , the Pentagon sought repayment of the excess bonuses from almost 10,000 California Guard soldiers. The paper reported that many of the soldiers affected had served multiple combat deployments and had been ordered to repay bonuses plus interest. Some had had their wages garnished and tax liens slapped on them when they refused to pay. The bonus scandal was revealed after audits showed widespread overpayments.",0

They’d have been cracking down on today’s drinking culture, the venues where that culture is enacted (often fraternities), and they’d be empowering women with self-defense courses (which would give them a life-long skill).

25497,Comey Sends Letter To Congress Citing New Evidence (and An Investigation) In The Clinton Email Scandal,"Written by Jonathan Turley   There is a major news development with the release of a letter from FBI Director James B. Comey that the Bureau has decided that new evidence requires further investigation into the Clinton emails. It was a surprising change just days before the election. After all, as recently as September 27, 2016, Comey rejected the idea that the bureau would reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state . Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress that the bureau has “learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.”I have been critical recently of the handling of the FBI investigation, particularly in the granting of immunity to key potential targets. I recently wrote a column on FBI investigation into the Clinton email scandal and revised my view as to the handling of the investigation in light of the five immunity deals handed out by the Justice Department. I had previously noted that FBI Director James Comey was within accepted lines of prosecutorial discretion in declining criminal charges, even though I believed that such charges could have been brought. However, the news of the immunity deals (and particularly the deal given top ranking Clinton aide Cheryl Mills) was baffling and those deals seriously undermined the ability to bring criminal charges in my view.Wikileaks disclosures have only embarrassed the Bureau further in showing Clinton aides debating how to explain the deletions and how to delay turning over material. Comey now has told legislators that “I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”He did note that the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant. Comey clearly felt obligated to let the Committees know about the development. In making such a decision, Comey is caught in the horns of a dilemma. The Justice Department strongly discourages investigatory announcements or actions shortly before an election to avoid any claims of trying to influence the outcome. On the other hand, if this is significant, the FBI does not want to be accused of hiding material developments from Congress or the public, particularly after criticism over its alleged different treatment given Clinton and her aides as opposed to other recent cases.In such a situation, caution favors disclosure. It is unlikely that we will see major developments in the remaining two weeks, but the announcement shows that this is not a closed matter. In many ways, the lingering character of this scandal was only worsened by the tactics of Clinton aides in changing explanations and refusals to cooperate absent immunity. That served to delay the investigation, which will now likely extend beyond the election.   JonathanTurley.org . Related",0

The emails also show that Valmoro sent Clinton’s government schedule to the unsecure email addresses of numerous members of the Clinton Foundation staff on October 16, 2009, again on October 18, 2009, and on October 25, 2009. The emails also include discussions of personnel matters and appointments on Clinton’s unsecure account, which may run afoul of federal privacy law. 
This is the thirteenth set of records produced for Judicial Watch by the State Department from the non-state.gov email accounts of Huma Abedin. The documents were produced under a court order in a May 5, 2015, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the State Department requiring the agency to produce “all emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013, using a ‘non-state’.gov email address” ( Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)). Previous records releases documented special Clinton State Department consideration for Clinton Foundation supporters (see here , here , and here .) 
“We’ve once again uncovered classified information in Hillary Clinton’s and Huma Abedin’s emails,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “It is frankly remarkable that the FBI and Justice Department are only now investigating Abedin’s connection to Clinton’s mishandling of classified information.” Post navigation",0

25507,FDA Orders Antibacterials Removed From Consumer Soaps,"Prev post Page 1 of 3 Next 
For as long as many of us can remember, we have purchased antibacterial hand soap and body washes, believing that were beneficial to our overall health and cleanliness. However, recent research and an order by the FDA seems to show otherwise. It could also show that some of the ingredients in these products could be harmful with long-term use. The findings are causing many of us to rethink what we know about staying clean. 
“Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” says the director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Dr. Janet Woodcock. “In fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm than good over the long-term.” 
The Food and Drug Administration recently issued a press release regarding some of the ingredients in common antibacterial hand soaps and body washes. In the statement, the FDA states that they are ordering manufacturers to remove certain ingredients that were originally believed to kill germs. 
In the press release, the FDA states , “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a final rule establishing that over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products containing certain active ingredients can no longer be marketed.” 
The ruling is regarding an investigation that dates back to 2013 targeting certain ingredients that may be harmful to the public. The FDA had received pressure from environmental groups and law makers regarding these ingredients and the effects they had shown in lab animals. The new ruling applies to 19 different chemical agents found in common antibacterial soaps. The most common of these were triclosan and triclocarban. 
“Companies will no longer be able to market antibacterial washes with these ingredients because manufacturers did not demonstrate that the ingredients are both safe for long-term daily use and more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of certain infections,” states the press release from the FDA. “Some manufacturers have already started removing these ingredients from their products.” 
Soap manufacturers will have one year to remove these chemicals and are no longer allowed to market products containing them. This is because the chemicals were found to be either harmful or to provide no additional benefits as washing with regular soap.

25509,"Politico: Trump ’Was an Asset, Not a Drag’ for Greg Gianforte in Montana House Race","As Democrats and   media outlets pick over the bones of Thursday’s Montana Special House election, in which boisterous Republican Greg Gianforte comfortably beat Democratic challenger Rob Quist, some are coming to an awkward conclusion  —   President Trump was a help, not a fatal hindrance, to Gianforte. [Gianforte beat Quist by seven points in a race Democrats had hoped to turn into a referendum on Trump’s first few months in office, and particularly, the unpopular Republican health care bill.   As Gianforte welcomed the president’s support in the days leading up to the election, opponents hoped that Trump’s alleged unpopularity would motivate the Democratic base and turn away moderates  —   something they would then hope to replicate in the 2018 midterms. Democrats had also hoped that the last minute twist in which Gianforte allegedly assaulted a UK Guardian reporter  —   for which Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault  —   would be the nail in the coffin. But it was not to be, and an analysis by Politico’s Gabriel Debenedetti found that the “Trump effect” was the opposite of Democrats would have hoped. Noting that Gianforte had lost the governor’s race in November, Debenedetti concluded that the Trump robocalls and using his campaign slogans paid off. Under a heading of “Trump was an asset, not a drag,” he said: For Gianforte, the biggest applause lines of his Thursday night speech came when he mentioned Trump and used his “drain the swamp” slogan. Local Republicans dismissed the idea that the president could drag Gianforte to defeat as preposterous, The state’s Democratic politicians had also noted Gianforte’s belief in Trump. Everything I see is that Greg Gianforte is trying to make [Trump] completely   . He might have muttered his name once or twice when he was running against me and now he wants to ‘drain the swamp’ and says, ‘I want to be with Trump every step of the way,’” said the state’s Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock on Wednesday  —   nearly seven months after he himself defeated Gianforte. Debenedetti noted that Quist barely talked about Trump during the campaign, possibly realizing it wasn’t the best strategy to take in the solidly red Treasure State. Trump won the state in November by over 20 points. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY",0

25514,KASSAM: Wanna Know Why the UK Can’t Defeat Terrorism? Watch How Media Attacked A Politician for Demanding Strength,"Britain’s establishment media today attacked the leader of the UK Independence Party at the organisation’s manifesto launch, implying and insisting that they were “exploiting” the terrorist attack in Manchester for “partisan” gain. [The UK Independence Party (UKIP) manifesto  —   a   document covering a vast swathe of international and domestic policy positions for the upcoming General Election  —   was due to be launched on Tuesday. The party delayed the launch out of respect for the victims of the Manchester attack.  That didn’t stop the traditionally   media accusing the party of “exploiting” the attack simply for urging strength in the face of extremism and terrorism: something every other party leader has already done since the atrocity on Monday night. Channel 4’s Michael Crick opened by asking: “  …    wasn’t that blatantly exploiting Manchester for election and party purposes?” UKIP supporters in the crowd hit back, shouting “Rubbish!” and “You’re exploiting it!” at Mr. Crick. Indeed, UKIP’s manifesto was finalised and went to print last Saturday, and was not changed since the Manchester attack. ITV’s Libby Wiener insisted: “You say you’re not exploiting Manchester but you say also that lighting candles isn’t enough. Isn’t that an insult to all the people who have come out in Manchester to show their respects?” She was followed by Channel 5’s Andy Bell, who rather than asking about policies in the manifesto, asked: “Can you confirm that you haven’t added anything in to your manifesto since what happened on Monday night?” The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg chimed in, appearing to act as a Conservative Party surrogate: “I understand you had very strong words for Theresa May’s record as Home Secretary. You’ve accused her of allowing jihadis in. It sounds like you’re near as damn blaming the Prime Minister for this attack and the circumstances that led to it. ” Finally, LBC’s Theo Usherwood issued a statement, rather than asking a question: “Paul, you had a choice yesterday afternoon when [the] minute’s silence was announced. You could have put back this manifesto launch to 12 o’clock  …     instead in 10 minutes time the nations is going to stop to remember the victims. Surely you’re exploiting what happened in Manchester. ” In fact, it was broadcast producers who asked for the launch to be earlier in the day so they could film, edit, and package clips together for the news channels. WATCH:  Reporters were heckled at @UKIP’s manifesto launch when they quizzed @paulnuttallukip over his comments about the Manchester terror attack. pic. twitter.   —   BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) May 25, 2017,  In effect, what the partisan press was asking UKIP, is “how do you dare talk of solving this problem?” Sadly, Paul Nuttall’s responses were not as robust as mine would have been i. e.: “Yes I am blaming the Prime Minister and decades of Labour and Conservative policy on immigration, security, defence, policing, and foreign policy for this attack. ” Nonetheless, when we ask ourselves why we can’t seem to get a grip of these atrocities, consider the attacks people and parties who try and offer solutions endure at the hands of Crick, Wiener, Bell, Kuenssberg, Usherwood, and their liberal friends.

25517,’For Honor’ Players Plan Boycott of Game - Breitbart,"In response to a lack of communication from both the publisher and developer about For Honor‘s most pressing issues, members of the game’s community are planning a boycott of the game on April 3, 2017. [Organized by Reddit community member “jbaayoun,” the For Honor gameplay blackout will begin at 5 AM and last for a minimum of 24 hours. Players are protesting the game’s ongoing balance issues, some so grievous that tournament organizers have been forced to ban at least one class from competitive play.  The participants are seeking greater transparency from the game’s developer and publisher around issues that have plagued the title since release. First, they want clearer communication between Ubisoft and For Honor fans. This should include a more informative version of the ongoing “Warrior’s Den” livestreams that the developers have been promoting. Second, they want a clearly defined roadmap for the game’s future. If players are going to stick around for the literal years needed to fully unlock the game’s content, they want a plan of future content that will give them a good reason to do so. Third, boycotters want a solution to the aforementioned glacial pace of earning the game’s “Steel” currency to make the grind for unlocking content a bit less punishing. Finally, players want to see a solution for the game’s ongoing matchmaking woes. Of note, Ubisoft has recently posted patch notes in the official forums that address a few of the game’s issues, including a sizeable boost to Steel income. It’s a welcome first step to addressing one problem among many in a game that is robbed of its potential for greatness by clumsy execution. Will a community boycott draw the publishing giant’s attention to make a difference? We’ll find out on April 3rd, unless either the publisher or development team deign to respond sooner.

In a story that predictably did not make the mainstream media, and with video surveillance very difficult to find, a massive mob of black teens viciously attacked white Temple University students, police officers and even a police horse in Philadelphia on Friday night. 
[…] 
In the limited local coverage this story did receive, the race aspect was generally avoided. It is way past time to take back the media, and fill it with truth-tellers, not apologists. 
“More than 150 teens, spread out in groups of 20 or 30, descended upon the campus at around 8:30 p.m. Friday — wreaking havoc for nearly two hours before eventually dispersing,” according to NBC 10 …. 
But there is a reason for all of this horror, according to Solomon Jones of Philly.com . It evidently boils down to the progressive canard “white privilege.” 
The black teens are feeling excluded because evil white “others” have come into their neighborhood and built rental properties for college students, raising the property values of their neighborhoods in a way that evidently excludes the angry teens, who were used to having their blighted turf unmolested.",0

Mohandes made the remarks during an interview with the al-Alam television network on Saturday.
He stressed that both the ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorist groups are the product of Saudi Arabia, and that ISIS's psychological and media campaign is partially funded from Riyadh.
Mohandes noted that the operations to free Mosul from the Takfiri terrorists will take some time as the militants are receiving intelligence from several external sources, mainly the US.
He went on to praise Iran’s support for Iraq’s battle against terrorism, stressing that if Baghdad had not called for Tehran’s assistance, the Iraqi army would never have reached Mosul.
He also noted that the Hashd al-Shaabi forces, also known as the Popular Mobilization Units, will move on towards Tal Afar after Mosul is cleared of ISIS militants.

It also scheduled his   press conference  —   largely devoted to Trump’s   …     intimate relationship with Russia  —   and a critical vote on the Affordable Care Act budget. Sometimes we, as progressives, aren’t able to be   because we acknowledge complexity  —   we address the intersections and breadth of policies and positions. Sometimes, perhaps we try to do too much. So let me be perfectly clear: Sen. Jeff Sessions should never be attorney general of the United States. While the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on Sessions’ nomination, around Capitol Hill other committees moved forward on a host of other outrageous nominees. The American public may never hear about the number of serious conflicts each of these nominees pose  —   to our democracy, to our rights  —   because there is simply too much to process.   …     Read Leguizamo’s full column at Variety.",0

So she sued. ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Vertical Pools Help Heal Wounded Combat Veterans Seeks Positive Doers To Help Make It Happen By VNN on October 31, 2016 The Vertical Pool was inspired by the anticipated need of the returning wounded, and veterans of all past conflicts, who have limited options for recovery and healing at home. Even if they’re within an hour of a VA hospital, it can be a challenge to get there without assistance. A heated, sanitized, filtered, compact pool in the back yard, house, garage, means convenient, private, daily immersions for exercise, traction, rehabilitation, and recovery. These pools should be available to veterans without convoluted forms and wait times. Simply a doctor’s prescription should put them on a list for immediate consideration. VetPools.org (an effort to raise funds to donate these pools to vets) was formed with the specific objective of helping improve upon the methods and manners by which America receives and treats her returning wounded. The most formidable military force in the world deserves a commensurate comprehensive recovery, reintegration program focused on body, mind, and spirit for those who require assistance. The purpose of this message is to inform interested and connected parties of the desire to hand this product and mission off to veterans who would then become The Vertical Pool LLC and VetPools.org . They could be instrumental in healing themselves and their fellow veterans, as well as civilian America from the physically challenged to the physically fit. Interestingly, while initially intended for veterans, the retail market has turned out to be women. As only one person, innovator/owner of The Vertical Pool and founder/director of VetPools.org , I cannot fulfill this objective alone. The R&D, pool product, and non-profit are all paid for in full, no debt or encumbrances. This “on-demand” pool can be manufactured as needed without excessive, costly inventory and/or storage space. I do not advertise this product because one person cannot build, deliver, and install more than 5 pools in two months. Career options with this DME device and non-profit include owning, manufacturing, marketing, selling, donating, fund-raising, case managing, delivering, installing, and teaching The Vertical Pool’s diverse functions and benefits. This pool is efficient in energy, water, and space; critical qualities in this, the 21st century. A group or collective of 3 to 7 individuals might be prudent to start the program. I would remain teacher, mentor, and guide for years to come while others slip into the ownership of this product and its sister non-profit organization. Please share this idea with any and all contacts who might have the connections to give some veterans a lead to a worthy endeavor and career. To get involved contact; Director, Peter G. Hold",0

I think that’s where the focus was for this moving forward. ” “At this moment, we’re not using AI to go through this particular content,” Davis continued, pointing out that the issue is currently too complex to cut out human moderators completely. “There is significant context that’s required for reviewing   sharing. ” Revenge porn has proven to be an issue for social media platforms, where disgruntled exes and even hackers have been able to post private and intimate photos of their victims without permission. Last month, a revenge porn victim’s lawyer claimed   site Tumblr had “chosen to ignore” revenge porn images posted on the platform after it allegedly took three weeks to get a video of the     victim removed from the site. “In my opinion, Tumblr has chosen to ignore valid legal demands because they earn more money using victims’ photographs as clickbait than they do protecting minors,” claimed lawyer Daniel Szalkiewicz, whose firm specializes in Internet defamation and revenge porn cases.

25539,Thousands Stranded as Fire Disrupts Metro-North Rail Service - The New York Times,"A large fire erupted below the   Railroad tracks in East Harlem on Tuesday night, disrupting train service and leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded during the evening rush. Service was suspended to and from Grand Central Terminal, and it was unclear whether it would be restored by Wednesday morning. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said commuters should expect delays. The fire, at 119th Street and Park Avenue, was fueled in part by chemicals stored at a garden nursery that operated underneath the tracks, he said. The New York Fire Department said it was investigating reports of explosions, possibly set off by propane tanks at the site. Emergency officials received the call at 6:42 p. m. and fire officials said at 8:25 p. m. that a majority of the fire was under control. The cause remained under investigation, and no injuries were reported. A beam and support buttresses were bent, and crews were expected to work through the night to make repairs, the governor said. “It’s an ambitious goal,” Mr. Cuomo said during a news conference at the scene. “The   scenario is we could have a delayed commute. ”   planned to run several trains over the tracks once construction was completed. “The heat of the fire was extreme,” Mr. Cuomo said, adding that it was so intense that firefighters could hear bolts popping from the beams. For commuters, the trip home was a string of misery as they tried to find alternate means of transportation. At Grand Central, an announcement warned passengers that all northbound trains were “subject to indefinite delays at this time. ” The main hall was packed with people standing nearly shoulder to shoulder. Railroad officials said the disruption affected 30, 000 to 40, 000 commuters. Nicole Clarke, of Rye, N. Y. said she waited at Grand Central for 30 minutes before abandoning plans to take  . “When I got to that place, it was a mess,” Ms. Clarke said. “They couldn’t tell us anything, nothing. ” She said that she was taking the subway to   Avenue and 233rd Street in the Bronx and that her husband would pick her up from there. Linda Vanderperre, who works on Wall Street and uses the Larchmont station, said she had been waiting over 90 minutes for what would be customarily a   commute. “It’s beyond ridiculous,” Ms. Vanderperre said. “This is the second day in a row it’s taken me over two hours to get home from Wall Street. ” She looked into using Uber but estimated it would cost around $150 because of surge pricing. “My husband is coming to pick me up if I’m still stuck here at 9,” she said. Three hotels near Grand Central said on Tuesday night that they had received numerous inquiries from stranded travelers but that, even before the fire, they were already booked. The disruption affected service on the Harlem, Hudson and New Haven lines, said Meredith Daniels, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Transportation authorities said train service was being provided to points north on the Hudson line from the   153rd Street station and the Marble Hill station. Service on the Harlem line was being provided from Wakefield, and trains on the New Haven line were running from Woodlawn to points east and from Stamford to New Haven. Ms. Daniels said the third rail, which powers the trains, had been shut off from 110th to 125th Street. Passengers on two trains that were stuck on either side of the fire were evacuated, officials said. Several passengers complained on Twitter about the lack of clear information and updates. Chris Polos, who commutes from Midtown Manhattan to his home in Scarsdale, said he had been waiting for 90 minutes. “I wish I had more information,” he said. “The big thing is what’s the next step  —   is it going to be a couple hours or 20 minutes?”",0

The energy generated from the solar panels could be used to pay for the cost of building the wall, Trump intimated, according to three sources in the story. It is unclear how serious the president was about the proposal, but he appeared eager to discuss progress for the project. “The wall will be a great help, and it will happen believe me,” Trump said to reporters after the meeting.",0

25545,Gun-Controlled Chicago: Thieves Break Into Car of Top Cop,"Over the weekend the SUV in which Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson travels was broken into and the contents tossed about. [Johnson lives in the Bridgeport area and other nearby cars were also targeted.  According to NBC News, “The vehicle’s interior was found in disarray on Saturday morning when officers went to  …     [Johnson’s home] to pick him up. ” The vehicle was unmarked so Chicago Police do not believe it was not targeted. The Chicago Tribune quoted Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi saying “items from the glove box had been tossed about, but no weapons or confidential materials or valuables were inside the   SUV. ” Police believe there is a possibility the car was accidentally left unlocked the night before. The crime that reached the superintendent’s car is just a taste of the lawlessness that has characterized Chicago all year. On April 27,  Breitbart News reported Chicago already had over 1, 000 shooting victims for 2017 and stories of fatalities that included sons being gunned down in front of their mothers. As of May 1, the Tribune reports a total of 192 homicides in Chicago for 2017. This means the city is on track to get close to the nearly 800 homicides witnessed in 2016. On April 25, Breitbart News reported that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s (D) response to the   gun violence has consisted of calls for additional gun control. He now wants new controls and regulations on Federal Firearm License holders (FFLs) in Chicago. In other words, with criminal gun use surging, Emanuel wants to go after the gun dealers who have gone through the proper legal channels to get an FFL and who, because of that FFL, conduct a background check on every gun they sell.

25548,Swedish Welfare State Funding Islamic Terrorism,"A new damning report shows that multiple Islamist fighters who have travelled from Sweden to fight in Syria and Iraq have been the beneficiaries of welfare payments from the Swedish government. [The new report created by the by the National Defence University on behalf of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) shows that around 300 Islamists have claimed benefits by using others to give the government the impression that they are still in Sweden despite the fact that they are in Syria or Iraq fighting for jihadist groups, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.   Terrorist researcher and one of the authors of the report Magnus Ranstorp said the problem isn’t just limited to Sweden. Commenting on the results, he said: “it was not surprising, we have seen the same pattern in other countries. Most surprising was that almost all had it in some form. But it is the monitoring that needs to work better. The problem is that there is too little  . ” The 300 individuals covered in the report traveled from Sweden to the Middle East between 2013 and 2016, and are thought to have participated in fighting for groups including the terrorist Islamic State. Housing allowances, child support, student loans, maintenance and parental benefits are the most common types of benefits earned by the Islamists, often collected by a third party with the money then sent to them overseas. ” It’s not big money, they do not get rich on it, but it can go a long way in a conflict zone,” Ranstorp said. Police say that student loans, in particular, are an issue because the fighters can game the system by pretending to be going overseas to study and receive large lump sums from the Swedish government.  Swedish Minister for Upper Secondary School and Adult Education and Training Anna Ekström said the problem was “totally unacceptable. No state funds will be used for something that is in the vicinity of terrorism. We must take hold of this immediately. We are preparing now to go to the parliament and ensure that the government gets the opportunity to ensure that we do not pay out such large sums at once. ” Sweden has seen at least one case in which the government paid a jihadi before. Late last year, Muslim convert Michael Skråmo was revealed to have been paid £4, 300 by the government since leaving for the Middle East in 2014.  The Swedish government has also essentially legalised the flying of the Islamic State flag after a Swedish court refused to prosecute a man who displayed the symbol on his social media account as a promotion of the terrorist group.  In 2015 it was shown that the Swedish city of Gothenburg sent more Islamists to the Middle East per capita than any other city in Europe.
