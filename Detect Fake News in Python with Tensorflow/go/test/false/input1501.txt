23674,Cressida Dick Will Be First Woman to Lead Scotland Yard - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   When Cressida Dick left Scotland Yard three years ago, she said she hoped that one day a woman would lead Britain’s biggest police force to show that it was “modern and representative. ” On Wednesday, those hopes were realized when Ms. Dick herself was named the first female police commissioner in Scotland Yard’s   history. A onetime beat cop in London’s West End, Ms. Dick, 56, said she was “thrilled and humbled” by the appointment. “This is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity,” she said Wednesday in a statement. “I’m looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London. ” Founded in 1829, Scotland Yard, as the city’s Metropolitan Police Service is known, is the recipient of roughly a quarter of all police spending in England and Wales. (Scotland and Northern Ireland, the other two nations in the United Kingdom, have their own legal systems and police forces.) The daughter of Oxford academics and a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge, Ms. Dick was head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard from 2011 to 2014, overseeing among other things the security operation for the London Olympics in 2012. She left Scotland Yard in 2014 after 31 years to become general secretary at the foreign office. Ms. Dick has held command roles in several counterterrorism operations one operation went terribly wrong in 2005: She was the senior officer in charge when Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, a Brazilian who had been mistakenly identified as an attempted suicide bomber, was fatally shot by officers at a London subway station. A jury cleared her of any wrongdoing, but Ms. Dick has repeatedly expressed regret. “I think about what happened on that terrible day very, very often,” she said in 2014. During the search for a new commissioner, the family of Mr. de Menezes wrote a letter to London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, about Ms. Dick’s potential role. “We have serious concerns about such an appointment and the signal it sends to the people of London,” they wrote. But Mr. Khan and others defended Ms. Dick’s appointment. “This is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as mayor,” he said Wednesday. Amber Rudd, the home secretary who appointed Ms. Dick with Mr. Khan’s counsel, called her an “exceptional leader” and implicitly highlighted her gender as a possible asset in some pressing issues facing Scotland Yard. “The challenges ahead include protecting the most vulnerable, including victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence,” Ms. Rudd said. “Cressida’s skills and insight will ensure the Metropolitan Police adapt to the changing patterns of crime in the 21st century. ” Of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, several have been led by women. But never London. Alex Carlile, a member of the House of Lords, Britain’s upper chamber, who served as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said it was “a very positive thing” that Scotland Yard had women in leadership roles. “But Cressida Dick has not been appointed because she’s a woman,” he said. “She’s been appointed because she was the   person for the job. ” With Ms. Dick’s appointment, three of the most senior figures in British policing are now women, with Lynne Owens heading the National Crime Agency and Sara Thornton, one of Ms. Dick’s rivals for the Scotland Yard job, the chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council.",0

According to the Pew Research Center’s latest numbers, in 2014, 275,000 anchor babies were born in the United States — enough to fill Orlando, Florida. 
The Washington Examiner reported : 
Moms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. 
The report reviews births to unmarried foreign-born and American born women. Those who are foreign born, including illegals, are seeing their birthrate drop, though it is still making up for the decline in births by American women. 
Pew’s recently-released report read: “In 2014, about 275,000 babies were born to unauthorized-immigrant parents in the U.S., accounting for about 7 percent of all U.S. births, and 32 percent of all U.S. births to foreign-born mothers.” The share of new mothers who are teenagers is higher among the U.S. born (6%) than among the foreign born (2%) https://t.co/d6f9C9ALoR pic.twitter.com/ydJpV2NgXh 
— Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) October 26, 2016 
“A third of all births to foreign-born mothers were to unmarried women – down from a peak of 37 percent in 2008. At the same time, the rate has held steady for U.S.-born women and now stands at 42 percent,” the study continued. 
According to Pew, the birthrate among U.S.-born women has declined, so the rise in the birthrate is solely because of immigrant mothers. The growth in annual U.S. births since 1970 has been driven entirely by immigrant moms https://t.co/bhzGRzgimg pic.twitter.com/dozNVXXVgT 
— Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) October 26, 2016 
While the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent years – most markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births nationwide – the trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970. 
This growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014. 
So, do you think that all these people coming here, in many cases illegally, have assimilated to our culture and/or are planning on doing so? Take a look around and it’s easy to see that the answer is no. 
If Hillary Clinton is elected, she plans to greatly increase refugee flows and give amnesty to illegal immigrants who broke our laws. In contrast, Donald Trump has pledged to restore law and order, build a wall, enforce immigration laws, and put the safety and interests of American citizens first. 
Which one sounds better to you at this critical point in our country’s history?",0
23676,"Якутский казус: Почему русских лишили статуса ""коренного народа""","1 комментариев 7 поделились Фото: Fotodom.ru/Коммерсантъ 
Данное постановление Pravda. Ru попросила прокомментировать профессора, доктора политических наук, замдиректора по науке Института этнологии и антропологии РАН, члена Совета при президенте по межнациональным отношениям Владимира Зорина. 
— Как все это понимать? Что означает статус коренного народа, что он дает? 
— В Российской Федерации, с точки зрения науки, понятие коренные народы в доктринальных документах не употребляются. У нас есть термин коренные малочисленные народы севера Сибири и Дальнего Востока. Но якуты к этничности не относятся. Список малочисленных народов утверждается правительством РФ и к ним относятся народы, численность которых менее 50 тысяч человек. 
В России ни в одной республике понятие ""коренные народы"" как права и нормы не присутствуют. Я думаю, что это юридический правовой казус, с которым наши юристы способны спокойно разобраться. 
Кстати, в государственной национальной политике термин коренные и не коренные народы также не используется. Это была согласованная позиция, в том числе всех субъектов Федерации, в обсуждении стратегии принимала участие и Якутия. 
Отметим, постановление Конституционного суда Якутии, прописывающее ""коренное"" право только за якутами, противоречит пункту 1 44-й статьи Конституции Республики Саха (Якутия), гласящему, что ""территория Республики принадлежит ее многонациональному народу"". Оно также входит в противоречие со статьей 46 Конституции, где указано, что русский язык является на территории государственным, наряду с саха (якутским). 
Как сообщает eadaily. com, данное постановление также противоречит с целым блоком Конституции республики, где прописаны права, свободы и обязанности человека и гражданина на территории Республики Саха (Якутия). Разумеется, правовое разделение жителей Якутии на ""коренных"" и ""некоренных"", при котором у одних есть четко сформулированные жизненно важные права, а у других такого нет — это нарушение законов Российской Федерации, Конституции России и международного законодательства о правах и свободах человека и гражданина.

23677,Hillary’s Eight Point Advantage VANISHES In Four Days,"Pinterest 
With only ten days to go, Donald Trump appears to be surging with likely voters across the country. 
Despite an onslaught of negative coverage from all corners of the media, the Republican Presidential candidate has gained on Hillary Clinton in the latest poll from The Washington Post and ABC News. 
Hillary still holds a 48-44 percent edge over Trump, but that is up from 38 percent support for Trump in the last week alone, fueled by support is shoring up among political independents and hard-core Republicans. He has made up ground among white people – with a 30-point advantage among whites without a college degree, up from a 20 point advantage. 
Trump saw his biggest gains among political independents, favoring Trump by a 12-point margin in the latest tracking poll, 49 to 37 percent, after giving Clinton a narrow edge in late last week. Neither candidate has maintained a consistent lead among independent likely voters in Post-ABC polling this fall. 
Despite the surge in Trump’s popularity, still six in ten voters expect Hillary Clinton to win anyway. The same poll found that only 30 percent thought Donald Trump would prevail. This plays into the Trump narrative that the vote is somehow “rigged” in favor of Clinton and no matter how much support he has, Trump would never ascend to the presidency. 
Sizable minorities of likely voters express concerns about fraud and inaccuracy at the ballot box, though worries about both have declined in the past month. Fewer than four in 10 voters now say voter fraud occurs very or somewhat often (37 percent), down from 47 percent in early September. Studies of voter fraud have found that it is very rare. 
In a separate question, the share of voters saying they do not have confidence votes will be counted accurately dipped from 33 to 28 percent, while the percentage saying they are “very confident” rose from 31 to 43 percent. 
Seven in 10 Trump supporters say voter fraud occurs at least somewhat often, including 34 percent who think it happens “very often.” And Trump voters are split on whether votes will be counted accurately across the country, with 50 percent at least somewhat confident and 49 percent “not too” or “not at all” confident. 
While Trump voters’ concerns about fraud and vote counting have not changed significantly since last month, Clinton supporters expressed growing confidence in the election process. The share of Democrats who are “very confident” the vote will be accurately counted has grown from 45 percent last month to 70 percent in the new Post-ABC poll. And while more than 1 in 5 Democrats last month thought voter fraud occurs at least somewhat often, that has fallen to slightly more than 1 in 10 in this week’s poll. 
The poll was conducted with a sampling of 1,775 adults and has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 2.5 percentage points.",0

From how things looked in the video, Clinton shifted just about all of her body weight onto the aide while she hoisted herself up the step. Advertisement - story continues below 
Needing help up one step is not a sign of good health, no matter how you look at it. 
Clintonâs health continues to be a concern among voters. There have been too many videos and images of her needing help up or down stairs to ignore. The nominee has also been plagued with coughing fits for the better part of this year. She has weird issues with her eyes, she has problemsÂ with “ brain fog ,” and her recent apparentÂ memory losses Â aren’t doing her any favors. 
Her reticence about the issue only makes speculation worse . 
The public’s suspicion that something could be wrong with Clinton isn’t helped by the fact that she also has a credibility problem. She has been caught lying more than once, so dishonesty about what ails her would not be surprising; it would be typical. Advertisement - story continues below",0
23682,Miss World Contestant Who Challenged China Is Allowed to Speak Once More - The New York Times,"Anastasia Lin, the Miss World contestant whose advocacy for victims of human right abuses in China has infuriated Beijing, appears to have regained her voice. On Wednesday evening, pageant organizers gave Ms. Lin, a   Canadian, the green light to speak to the news media, ending a   standoff in Washington that had drawn unflattering attention to a storied beauty pageant that has become increasingly dependent on Chinese corporate sponsors. According to friends and relatives of Ms. Lin’s, employees of the   beauty pageant had warned her that she would be ejected from the competition if she spoke publicly about murky,   transplant programs that human rights advocates say rely heavily on the organs of murdered prisoners of conscience. China has denied the allegations, saying that organ donations in the country are voluntary. In a brief phone interview, Ms. Lin, 26, declined to discuss whether she had been silenced and praised the Miss World Organization for allowing her to compete in the finals, which will be televised Sunday night and are expected to draw a global audience of one billion. “To their credit, they did give me this platform, and I’m able to speak freely now,” she said. She also said the pageant’s executive director, Julia Morley, had given her permission to attend the premiere of a feature film, “The Bleeding Edge,” that stars Ms. Lin and seeks to dramatize the cruelties of what human rights advocates describe as Chinese   programs that harvest the organs of prisoners. In an emailed statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Ms. Morley said she had never barred Ms. Lin from the premiere, which is scheduled for Wednesday night in Washington. The event is sponsored by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, an organization with obvious enmity for China’s authoritarian government. Last year, China blocked Ms. Lin from attending the Miss World finals in Sanya, the southern Chinese resort city that has hosted the finals a   times since 2003. She said pageant officials had made little effort to intervene on her behalf, but they allowed her to retain the Miss Canada title for another year, paving the way for her participation in the 2016 finals. Ms. Lin sought to focus the interview on her project, which aims to raise awareness about Beijing’s persecution of Falun Gong, a spiritual movement that is banned in China. Adherents face imprisonment, and those who refuse to renounce the movement are often subjected to torture. Ms. Lin and other critics of the Chinese government say Falun Gong practitioners who die in custody are unwilling providers of organs for the nation’s lucrative transplant industry. “China does not have a viable voluntary transplant system, so someone has to die,” she said. “It’s not like the organs grow on plants. ” She has few illusions that her awareness campaign will make it past China’s strict censors, but she said her appearance in the finals might inspire others willing to stand up to the authorities. During a visit to Taiwan this year, she described running into a tour group from mainland China. She was stunned, she said, when a number of people recognized her and then asked to be photographed by her side. “Despite 60 years of censorship, people don’t believe everything they hear on the news,” she said, referring to Chinese reports over the past year that have sought to demonize her. “I may end up standing in the last row this year, but if they are able to see me, I hope people will be encouraged. ”",0

Физкультминутка – залог продуктивного труда и бодрого настроения. Активные, неунывающие сотрудники – это гордость любого коллектива. Нормальный человек не может постоянно чахнуть под завалами работы. Всем нужен хороший отдых. Кстати, отрываясь от серьёзных дел, нам нужно не кофеёк хлестать под унылую ленту новостей, а прыгать, приседать, разминаться, делать успокоительные вдохи-выдохи! Это же так здорово! После «производственной гимнастики» у любого нытика поднимется работоспособность, появится желание творить и развиваться. Но, оказывается, в наши дни безобидный фитнес на работе может стать поводом для позорного увольнения… 
Талантливая белокурая девушка из Иркутской области Анастасия Мякина, вопреки стереотипу о глупости блондинок, трудилась одновременно в двух серьёзнейших областях. Симпатичная леди занимала пост депутата Думы Шелеховского района и дополнительно подрабатывала директором муниципального предприятия «Бытовые и ритуальные услуги». А кто-то ведь ещё смеет говорить, что чиновники бессовестно воруют! Работают они – в поте лица! 
Несмотря на загруженность и плотный график, барышня не собиралась превращаться в неухоженную начальницу, эдакую «нашу мымру». Современная леди-босс подключилась к участию в интересной онлайн-программе по снижению веса. В задачи спортсменки и просто красавицы ежедневно входила запись видеотчёта о выполненных физических упражнениях. Эх, знала бы наша героиня заранее, что любовь к спорту закончится для неё грандиозным провалом в карьере!.. 
Активная женщина в один прекрасный, не предвещающий беды день во время обеденного перерыва в родном похоронном бюро решила немного подкачать свою «пятую точку» – заодно и снять видеоподтверждение для виртуальных единомышленниц. Ну не весь же день ходить ей среди гробов с поникшим лицом!.. Разрядка сотрудникам домов печали тоже, знаете ли, необходима. 
Включив зажигательную композицию группы «Бандэрос» про красивую жизнь, Анастасия удобно расположилась рядом с венками, крестами, гробами, оградками – и начала отжигать! Улыбка до ушей, эффектные приседания, море оптимизма – просто пример для подражания всем измученным женщинам России. Как в песне поётся: «Нет времени ждать, всё хочется взять… Жизнь удалась – ещё чуть-чуть и прямо в рай. Ла-ла-ла…» 
Истратив калории и попотев, Мякина незамедлительно выложила видео своей физкультминутки в Интернет. Говорящее название ролика звучит весьма оригинально и позитивно – «Горижопинг». У блондинки получилась наглядная творческая видеозарисовка, призывающая всех нас радоваться жизни, активничать, несмотря на печали и утраты. Мол, гори оно всё огнём! И ты, гори скорей, мягкое место! Правда, мэр Иркутска креатив Анастасии не оценил. Несмотря на все оправдания поклонницы здорового образа жизни, девушку без разговоров выгнали поганой метлой сразу с обоих мест работы. 
Бывшая «единоросска» не унывает и не собирается отказываться от любимого фитнеса. Хотя Насте, пожалуй, придётся сейчас нелегко – надо же сначала как-то реанимировать карьеру. Тренировать одновременно и пятую точку, и мозги – непростое дело. Чего доброго, случится полнейший «горижоп» – и на красивой жизни придётся поставить огромный крест.

The information below comes from 4chan. 4chan is a simple image-based bulletin board where anyone can post comments and share images anonymously.

With the threat of a massive blockbuster by Wikileaks and Project Veritas coming this week, get your popcorn ready! Now, Hillary could change her mind, or this could be a hoax also, but if you look at the following messages and the dates and put one and one together, you get some crazy stuff. If you are shaking your head, we had the same reaction. Hillary and her campaign have been on borrowed time and the bell tolls for them. It’s time to come clean and step down if that’s the decision. This country needs a leader, and Donald Trump should step into the White House on January 20, 2017, and take command of a nation that was fundamentally transformed into a liberal hellhole.

23701,WATCH: Senior Abbas Aide - Moving U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem A ’Declaration Of War On All Muslims’,"TEL AVIV  —   If   Donald Trump makes good on his promise to move the U. S. embassy to Jerusalem, it would be considered “a declaration of war” on all Muslims, the Palestinian Authority’s supreme Sharia judge Mahmoud   declared on Friday. [“The new American administration intends to transfer its embassy to Jerusalem. In a simple, calm, and rational manner, in clear words that need no explanation and which are unambiguous: Such a step, for every Muslim, is a declaration of war on all Muslims,” said Habbash in a Friday sermon broadcast on the Palestinian Authority’s official television network.  The speech, which was attended by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, was translated by Israeli watchdog Palestinian Media Watch. “We are no one’s enemies, and we do not want to be. We are not enemies of the US and we do not want to be. However, when something harms our faith and our existence, we cannot stand by and do nothing,” Habbash, who also serves as a senior aide to Abbas, said. “Occupied Jerusalem is our eternal capital, the capital of our existence and the capital of our state. In politics, there can be compromises here and there  …     In politics there can be negotiation. However, in matters of religion, faith, values, ethics, and history, there can be no compromises,” he added. Trump’s team has emphasized that the   is “firmly committed” to transferring the embassy to Israel’s capital as soon as possible. Saeb Erekat,   of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and chief Palestinian negotiator, said that moving the embassy would “destroy” the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians and would cause the region to descend further into “more chaos, lawlessness and extremism. ” Erekat also warned that if Trump were to go ahead with the move, the PLO will revoke its recognition of Israel and the U. S. will be forced to shut down all of its embassies in the Arab world. In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that such a move would cause “an explosion, an absolute explosion in the region, not just in the West Bank, and perhaps even in Israel itself, but throughout the region. ” On Thursday, Jordan released a statement saying an embassy transfer would be a “red line” for the Hashemite Kingdom, warning that it would “inflame the Islamic and Arab streets” and would serve as a “gift to extremists. ” On Friday, Abbas warned Trump not to transfer the embassy, saying it was an “aggressive” move.",0

An investor in Dave’s fund emailed him asking which way Colorado would vote tomorrow. He replied: “Depends on who counts the votes. I don’t believe this is a fair election. I think the Clinton crime machine, with the help of George Soros and a few others, have everything under their control now.” 
After taking the better part of a year to sift through 55,000 emails in analyzing Hillary Clinton’s behavior with regard to conducting classified Government business on her private server – which apparently was accessible to hackers and, surreptitiously, by Anthony Wieners porn laptop – Jim Comey determined in 8 days that 650,000 emails downloaded from Hillary’s private server were not relevant. 
Sorry Jim, that’s impossible to believe. One highly plausible is that operatives in the Deep State shut down the FBI investigation in order to preserve the treasure trove of material that will give it power over Clinton’s Presidency. The SoT was perplexed by this, so we asked John Titus his take on this. His answer was quite compelling: Here’s what I’m reasonably sure of, based on experience. (1) Jim Comey looked sick when, at the conclusion of round one, and having proven beyond all doubt that Hillary violateed 18 U.S.C 793(f), he said no reasonable prosecutor would charge her. He wasn’t acting. Bad acting comes right through camera lens, and that man looked like he was about to vomit when he left that dais; (2) it took the FBI a year to conclude round one of its investigation, which was based on its review of 55,000 emails; (3) Comey had promised to get back to congress should more info arise, and when 650,000 unexpected emails showed up, he made good on his word by letting congress know; and (4) the FBI terminated its investigation LONG before reviewing 650,000 emails. I once reviewed 250,000 documents on a case, Based on the foregoing, SOMEONE got to Comey—somewhere along the line. For all I know, though, the whole thing was scripted from start to finish, and Comey read his script at every point along the way, even when it physically disgusted him in round one. So while you might be right about the time, I think if the Deep State made a move on Comey, it happened awhile ago. That’s wholly speculative on my part. You could well be right that they got to him just recently. I just doubt it. I think he’s the Company Man because he’s a company man. For DAMN SURE you’re right about holding Hillary hostage, but she’s so evil it’s like throwing a pedophile into a daycare center with no supervision, the shades drawn and the doors locked.

23703,Report: Governments Shut Off Access to the Internet More Than 50 Times in 2016 - Breitbart,"There have been more than 50 government shutdowns of the Internet in 2016, costing the respective countries hundreds of millions of dollars and choking citizen freedoms during crucial moments. [According to a report from the Brookings Institute, strangling the internet cost $2. 4 billion over the course of 2016. Senior Global Advocacy Manager Deji Olukotun of the Access Now digital rights organization believes that an even greater cost can be counted in human lives.  Olukotun says that the shutdowns “go hand in hand with atrocities,” citing the deaths of Ethiopian protesters “during the kind of blackout where it’s difficult to report on what’s happening. ” Other shutdowns include communication blackouts during the Ugandan elections, and governments that chose to go so far as shutting down all Internet access just to keep students from cheating on exams. The biggest losses are clustered near the top, with three major contenders. Conservative estimates suggest that India lost nearly a billion dollars due to its shutdowns, while Saudi Arabia managed nearly half a billion on its own. Morocco gave up $320 million. Even governments that didn’t wall off the entirety of the Internet still blocked access to social media in some cases, and their methods have steadily become more sophisticated. As time goes on, it grows more and more difficult for citizens to find any way around restrictions on digital information. Olukotun would like to see “telecommunications companies [push] back on government orders, or at least document them to show what’s been happening, to at least have a paper trail. ” The UN’s International Telecommunications Union could also discourage such measures by shining a light on the events as they happen. The good news is, “most governments want to expand internet access,” so that they can “participate in the global economy and be competitive. ” There have been as many or more investments in expanding access to the unlimited information made available by the Internet as there have been instances of censorship.

23709,CETA: Canada Has Challenged The EU’s Chemical Regulations 21 Times,"A man protests against international trade agreements TTIP and CETA in front of EU headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016.
The Canadian government raised concerns over the European Union’s regulations on chemicals on more than 20 occasions over the course of a decade, according to a letter seen by Energydesk .
In a note sent to the Belgian government on October 19 , the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) claims that the Canadian state challenged the EU’s REACH regulations at the World Trade Organisation 21 times between the years 2003 and 2011.
The UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) describes the REACH regulations as providing “a high level of protection of human health and the environment from the use of chemicals.”
The news will raise concerns that Canadian companies may use the trade and investment deal CETA to undermine EU regulations.
“The threat of undue Canadian influence on environmental regulations such as REACH is real,” CIEL CEO Carroll Muffett wrote .
The CETA deal – which sets up private courts that enable foreign corporations to sue countries – has been held up by the British government as a model for post-Brexit free trade deals.
Corporate courts Canadian companies have also used the trade agreements to take legal action against countries on 42 occasions, according to data from the Investment Policy Hub — with Canada ranked 5th among the nations in which this type of investor-to-state lawsuit have been filed.
Earlier this year, for example, the Canadian pipeline company TransCanada sued the United States government for $15 billion over its decision to scrap the Keystone XL project — using a provision in the NAFTA trade deal.
CETA, which is currently being signed by EU members following a week-long blockade by Wallonia and two other Belgian regions, sets up an investor dispute system called the Investment Court System (ICS) .
In fact the ICS was among the reasons that the Wallonian government took a stand, with the region’s leader Paul Magnette saying: “I would prefer that [the ICS] disappears pure and simple and that we rely on our courts or at the very least, if we want an arbitration court, it must provide equivalent guarantees to domestic ones.”
As part of the newly negotiated agreement, the Belgian government will ask the European Court of Justice to rule on the legality of the deal — and the ICS in particular.
Beyond REACH REACH – the r egistration, e valuation, a uthorisation and restriction of ch emicals – is a set of extensive rules “adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals” — so says the European Chemicals Agency .
Canada’s concerns – which were not formal actions, but rather issues raised at the WTO – largely related to rules around competition and whether the regulations would be burdensome to business .
The 21 complaints spanned the administrations of the Liberal Paul Martin, when REACH was just a draft, and the Conservative Stephen Harper.
Essentially Canada – like the United States – takes issue with the European approach to regulation, which is described as the ‘precautionary principle’.
This approach means products need to be proven safe by companies who seek to market them, before they enter the market. In North America, the burden of proof is on public authorities, which have to prove that a product is dangerous.
Documents unearthed by CIEL show that Canada has filed objections to the EU using this approach to regulate endocrine disrupting chemicals, arguing that the “EU’s hazard-based approach could unnecessarily disrupt trade in food and feed”.
Scientific studies show a range of health impacts caused by exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals – which are found in food containers and plastics – including IQ loss and adult obesity.",0

Robert Gehl reports that of all the videos and images to come out of the Milwaukee riots, there’s one that is particularly chilling. 
The 2-minute video is apparently taken during the riots Saturday night following the shooting of a black, armed man who was reportedly a gang member. 
Moments after the shooting occurred, hundreds of rioters took to the streets, setting cars on fire and burning about a half-dozen businesses. Chants of “Black Power!” could be heard sporadically as well. But in this video, it appears an entire gang of black youth are seeking out and targeting white people to assault.
“Hey! We’re beating up every white person! Get every white person!” the cameraman says. 
When he witnesses someone being assaulted, he asks “Who they beatin’ up? Who they beaten’ up?” 
At one point, when they spot a “white person,” he screams “He white! Beat his shit! Beat!” 
The thug pans around looking for white people to assault. You can hear the crowd reacting, trying to point out white people. Again, he cries: “Hey! They beating up every white person!” Apparently he spots a homeless man. “Look at the f***in’ white bum! Look at the white bum!”
Throughout the rest of the video, there’s screams of white people as their racist hunt continues. 
Toward the end, shots ring out in the distance, startling the cameraman. “Who the f*** is shooting? Stop shooting!” Moments later, shots are fired much closer and the video ends.” 
This is the direct result of the Black Lives Matter racist, anti-police agenda and Barack Obama’s acceptance of their cause. 
This is Obama’s “ post-racial America .” Welcome to it, folks .",0
23719,Rumours Persist That Mourinho Almost Thought About Blaming Himself For Latest Man Utd Defeat,"We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] Rumours Persist That Mourinho Almost Thought About Blaming Himself For Latest Man Utd Defeat November 4, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS , SPORT Share 0 Add Comment 
SCARCELY believable rumours have been circulating in the aftermath of Manchester United’s 2-1 loss to Fenerbahce in the Europa League, as sources close to Jose Mourinho claim he almost blamed himself in some small way for the defeat. 
“We’ve seen it a few times over the last decade, he almost gained some self awareness and was on the verge of realising he’s been paid £10 million a year not to be dog shite,” confirmed a source, who admitted Jose opened his mouth at one point with a look of ‘some of this may be my fault’ emblazoned on his face. 
Leading football psychologists were ready to hail a breakthrough in their study of Mourihno but their hopes were dashed when he chose instead to give out about Arsene Wenger for 44 minutes, blaming him for being responsible for the defeat in some way. 
As evidenced by some post-match interviews and comments the Portuguese manager was able to gather himself and get back to transparent attempts to safeguard himself from any criticisms. 
“We played the game, like happy puppies, but these players of mine, they are not puppies, they are meant to be lions. Jose Mourinho is disappointed in them, when you go to the zoo, you never, ever go to see the puppies,” Mourinho explained in the first of 47 vague, almost incomprehensible asides, “also I live in a hotel”. 
Mourinho would not be drawn on the speculation that he plans to add several more players to his list of scapegoats, with concern among his coaching staff that if he continues to just focus on Henri Mkhitaryan, people will soon realise the former Madrid boss is just weeks away from another cataclysmic implosion. 
“We are not just surrounded by football Einsteins, we have a Fermi and an Oppenheimer, they intend to use an atomic football bomb against me, a champion,” added the manager purposefully trying to be more obscure and disconnected with each passing sentence.",0
23720,Minister Slammed for Wearing Crucifix in ’Vile Attack’,"Norway’s immigration minister Sylvi Listhaug has slammed the “agenda”  “liberal media” after being accused of wearing a crucifix necklace merely as a “prop” to promote “xenophobic” views. [Listhaug said the left wing media “doesn’t care about facts” as long as right wingers are the target after writer and former newspaper editor Sven Egil Omdal claimed the Progress Party politician had never worn the crucifix before being appointed immigration and integration minister.  In a message posted to Facebook, alongside a picture of Ms Listhaug wearing the crucifix while speaking at the Oslo Symposium, the left wing journalist wrote: “She looks like a bishop even when she says that it ‘has never been something for us’ to live side by side with people from another culture. “Sylvi Listhaug is almost always seen wearing the cross now, and she is always talking about how important it is for her. But I’ve been through all images in the Scanpix database in the period from 2001 to December 15, 2015, when she became immigration and integration minister. She does not wear the cross necklace on one of them. ” “Would I say she’s using the cross as a political prop to appeal to strange people who think xenophobia is a Christian virtue? Yes, I would,” concluded Mr Omdal, who has weekly columns in four newspapers. Ms Listhaug hit back at what she called the “vile attack” accusing the “media mogul” of “spreading fake news” which the minister said Mr Omdal “invented to make me look evil and cynical”. “He has received well over 1, 000 likes, many of them from journalists and media professionals on an outright lie” she wrote to Facebook. She then pointed to three Scanpix photos from 2006 and 2007 attached to the post in which she can be seen wearing the crucifix, to disprove the journalist’s claim. The minister described how the jewellery piece  —   a gift from her grandmother who is nearly 100 years old  —   means a lot to her. Ms Listhaug took aim at the leftist media, writing: “It’s no wonder a growing number of people have seen through many of the leftist media and are relying less on journalists. “They have an agenda, which is attacking the right. They have no standards and they don’t care about the facts  —   everything is okay as long as I or the Progress Party is the target. ” Ms. Listhaug, who is Norway’s first ever immigration and integration minister, received global press attention soon after taking up the post after she said that Jesus would support her party’s tough stance on immigration. “What Jesus cared about is you should help as many people as possible  —   and that’s not as many as possible in Norway,” she said. She asserted it’s possible to relieve the suffering of a lot more people in refugee camps in the Middle East rather than encouraging them to make a perilous journey across Europe.",0

The craft began its journey on top of an Atlas 5 rocket that lifted off into the summer sky above Cape Canaveral, Fla. Seven years from now, the craft is to return and parachute a capsule with the asteroid bits into a Utah desert, giving scientists a window to some of the material that made up the early solar system, including some of the molecules that gave rise to life on Earth. Twelve minutes after liftoff, the   engine of the Atlas 5 shut off, leaving   in orbit around Earth. After some coasting, the engine fired again to kick the spacecraft onto a path around the sun. After the craft separated from the second stage, it deployed its solar arrays and established communications with controllers on the ground. ”The   spacecraft is happy and healthy,” said Richard Kuhns, the program manager at Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft. A year from now,   will swing back around and make a close flyby of Earth, using the planet’s gravity to tilt the angle of its orbit to match that of Bennu, a   asteroid that is 1, 600 feet in diameter and has an orbit around the sun similar to Earth’s. It is about as wide as the Empire State Building is tall.    —   a shortening of Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer  —   will catch up to Bennu in 2018, entering orbit for more than a year of observation to allow scientists to figure out where they want to scoop their sample.

23726,Washington Post’s Fake News of Russian Vermont Power Plant Hack,"Amid all the inflated headlines about Russian “hacking” of the U. S. the Washington Post was forced to retool an article that falsely claimed a Vermont power plant was hacked by Russian hackers. [Late on Friday, December 30, the Post broke a story originally entitled, “Russian hackers penetrated U. S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont, officials say. ”  The Post story went on to say, “A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U. S. officials. ” But it appears that the paper published the shocking story before actually getting any quotes from the power company in Vermont. It also turned out that the paper’s tale was wildly exaggerated. The Vermont utility in question, the Burlington Electric Department, later released a statement clarifying where it discovered the “Russian code” and it turned out it there was not any “penetration” into the U. S. electricity grid. Later that evening, Vermont Public Service Commissioner Christopher Recchia told the Burlington Free Press that “the grid is not in danger. ” “As commissioner of public service we are very concerned about cybersecurity,” Recchia insisted. “I’ve been working with homeland security and our department of emergency management, homeland security to make sure that we are on top of things like this because this is a real concern. ” Utility officials said that the Russian malware code was found on but a single laptop computer that was not in any way connected to its power grid systems. The utility also issued a statement about the discovery of the code: Last night, U. S. utilities were alerted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of a malware code used in Grizzly Steppe, the name DHS has applied to a Russian campaign linked to recent hacks. We acted quickly to scan all computers in our system for the malware signature. We detected the malware in a single Burlington Electric Department laptop not connected to our organization’s grid systems.

23727,Comment on Christian priest in Germany pelted with stones by children shouting ‘Allahu Akhbar’ by Dr. Eowyn,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by DCG | 2 Comments 
Ain’t multiculturalism grand? 
From Express UK : The Ethiopian vicar was visiting the town of Raunheim on the outskirts of Frankfurt when the pre-teens started throwing stones at him. 
Dressed in traditional priest’s gear and wearing a cross around his neck, the 47-year-old was walking to the Russian Orthodox chapel in Frankfurter Straße with a local priest, who wished to remain anonymous, when he was attacked. 
The three children, aged between 10 and 12-years-old, shouted “Allahu Akhbar” as they threw the stones , the other priest who was visiting from a nearby church said. Both priests tried to take photos of the children with their mobile phones, but the youngsters were too quick and managed to escape. 
Alexandra Rang, a Russian Orthodox hotel owner who built the chapel a few years ago, said she could not believe what the two priests told her at first. She said to be pelted with stones is the “worst thing a priest can imagine”. 
Raunheim social worker Dr. Isack Majura said he was going to do everything possible to get hold of the children. He said: “What happened is absolutely unacceptable.” 
Municipal staff said different religious groups in Frankfurt are generally on good terms and they are treating the incident as isolated . He said there has been a strong Christian-Muslim dialogue between the local mosque and church communities which has been cultivated over many years. 
Germany is facing a crisis following Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door migrant policy which saw more than 1.1million refugees entering the country last year. 
She is now backtracking on the policy, closing up some of Germany’s borders, but in some areas the impact is being heavily felt. 
Yesterday, Express.co.uk revealed pupils at a girl’s primary school in the German ski resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen are being forced to chant “Allahu Akhbar” and “there is no God but Allah”. A father of a pupil claimed his daughter had been “ forced ” by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants. 
Weeks before, parents complained their children’s nursery was refusing to acknowledge “Christmas rituals” such as putting up a Christmas tree or singing carols to accommodate the “diverse cultures” of other pupils. 
The school said they made the decision because the majority of children at the kindergarten are not Christian. 
Migrants now outnumber native children in many Germany schools.

23728,May puts nation on high-poppy alert,"November 6, 2016 
Distracted by suffering refugees, confused by convoluted Brexit negotiations or just plain scared by a Trump presidency? No? Neither is your Prime Minster. Today Theresa May did what every true leader does in a crisis – which is to turn everyone’s attention to meaningless ephemera; like poppies, Grammar Schools and who should present the new ‘Bake-off’? 
Taking a break from quashing the Orgreave Inquiry, Mrs May said FIFA’s stance of not politicizing sport was ‘outrageous’. A spokeswoman explained: ‘In these times of austerity, we need cheap, meaningless gestures accompanied by hollow outrage. If over-paid under-achieving footballers are not allowed to wear a poppy – then the terrorists have won. It’s a known fact that Afghan jihadists fear the poppy…although admittedly 80% of their income is based on the opium trade…um…er…I may not have thought this through…’ 
Armed police are expected to patrol our streets, opening fire on anyone not wearing a poppy or failing to whistle the tune from ‘The Dambusters’. A Police Inspector remarked: ‘We may be perpetuating a mawkishly sentimental view of war but don’t think for a second you can get away with recycling last year’s poppy – we’re wise to that dodge!’ 
Without a doubt this is the most important issue of 2016 – whether 22 footballers can wear poppies for 90 minutes in a stadium filled with 60,000 people wearing poppies. Some cynics have suggested Theresa May’s use of misdirection in these troubled times, is the political equivalent of David Copperfield pulling an elephant out his arse. Her spokeswoman countered: ‘The important thing is to remember those who sacrificed their lives in war– rather than the reasons behind it or making sure it never happens again’. Share this story...

“I didn’t sing the anthem during international games. Unless there will be a change in the words of the anthem not everybody can sing. The words “Jewish soul craving” do not fit the Arab sector. If I would sing the anthem it would be a lie.” Thus said the former captain of the Benei Sakhnin soccer team and former Israeli international Abbas Suan on Wednesday. 
Suan who has retired from professional soccer, was speaking at a special conference initiated by the NIF and entitled :”Kicking the racism and violence out of the stadiums.” The event was coordinated with the UEFA-sponsored week of anti-racist activity in European soccer termed FARE- Football against Racism in Europe. 
The conference was attended by many former and present players and managers in Israeli soccer including present Israeli manager Elisha Levi. 
Levi, who had previously managed the Arab Sakhnin team, said that one need not be afraid of people who are different. “Football is a bridge spanning cultures. Sport can cause more unity in society. I would be happy if I had more players from the Arab sector in the national team. They have tremendous drive. We don’t demand that players sing the anthem, but all of them respect one another.”

Is this coming to the United States? 
Children in school in Germany are being taught to chant Islamic prayers, including the phrase “Allah Akbar,” which is used before Radical Islamists commit terrorist attacks. 
The father of a girl at a school in Garmisch-Partekirchen, Germany, discovered his daughter was forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he found a handout she was given, The Express is reporting . He said his daughter was “forced” by teachers to memorize the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to a news organization in Australia. 
The handout read: “Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.” 
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in “ethics” at the Bavarian school. 
Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. 
The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children’s nursery was refusing to acknowledge “Christmas rituals” to accommodate the “diverse cultures” of other pupils. 
The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils were Christian. 
A spokesman for Kassel explained: “There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.” 
Migrants now outnumber native children at many schools in Germany as the country has been inundated with migrants in recent years.

23736,Don't Get Too Excited About the FBI's New Probe of Clinton - Srdja Trifkovic,"Don't Get Too Excited About the FBI's New Probe of Clinton 
The mainstream corporate media has proven itself very adept at protecting Hillary Originally appeared at Chronicles Magazine 
The FBI bombshell is not necessarily a gamechanging event. The Clinton campaign, and its mainstream media extension, have weathered with surprising ease the fainting episode on September 11. 
In the next two days they will focus on: the possibility (they will claim likelihood) that Anthony Wener’s/Huma Abedin’s server does not contain any emails not known to the FBI already, let alone those designated confidential, classified, secret or top secret—that was Hillary Clinton’s predictable immediate reaction ; the assertion that the FBI will not be able to sift through thousands of emails quickly enough to provide a clear answer to (1) before the election, which is the coded message behind the Clinton camp’s demand for a “detailed and thorough” investigation—demands for “immediate” disclosure notwithstanding—and an unnamed official has already indicated that it was not likely that the FBI’s review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day; and the claim that the FBI was acting under political pressure from Clinton’s foes: Sen. Dianne Feinstein has already declared that “the FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today’s break from that tradition is appalling.” 
The one truly appalling event in this saga was James Comey’s decision last spring not to ask for a grand jury, without which the entire investigation into Clinton’s emails was predictably sidetracked. On that inglorious form, his surprise Friday announcement may indicate that the potential for scandal is so great that his options for further damage limitation in Clinton’s interest were extremely limited. 
However . . . In 1982 I interviewed for the BBC World Service one of Ireland’s best respected diplomats and political commentators, Conor Cruise O’Brien, at his home by the cliffs above the Irish Sea. In passing he mentioned Ireland’s scandal-ridden prime minister of the day, Charles Haughey, who had managed repeatedly to survive numerous disclosures of corruption and wrongdoing. O’Brien said that if he saw Charlie Haughey “buried at midnight at a crossroads with a stake driven through his heart, I should continue to wear a clove of garlic around my neck, just in case.”

23737,General is most senior Army officer to kill self,"USA Today 
WASHINGTON — The Army acknowledged Friday that Maj. Gen. John Rossi committed suicide on July 31, making him the highest-ranking soldier ever to have taken his own life. 
Rossi, who was 55, was just two days from pinning on his third star and taking command of Army Space and Missile Command when he killed himself at his home at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. ‘ 
Investigators could find no event, infidelity, misconduct or drug or alcohol abuse, that triggered Rossi’s suicide, said a U.S. government official with direct knowledge of the investigation. It appears that Rossi was overwhelmed by his responsibilities, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation. 
Rossi himself talked in March about suicide at a conference on preventing troops from killing themselves. 
He held up a card from his wallet with photos of 10 soldiers who had died under his command at Fort Sill, Okla. Four of them had committed suicide. 
Rossi led off the event by reading the reports of recent suicide attempts to the soldiers at the event, according to a news story on the Army’s web site. He told the conference that he received reports of four soldiers per week thinking about or attempting suicide. 
“We are ultimately responsible for soldiers both on and off duty,” Rossi said. 
In a separate statement on Friday, Rossi’s family asked for privacy and called on soldiers with emotional problems to seek help. 
“To all the other families out there, to the man or woman who may be facing challenging times, please seek assistance immediately,” according to a statement released on the family’s behalf by the Army. 
The Army, the armed forces and its veterans have struggled with the scourge of suicide since the 9/11 terror attacks and the wars that followed in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 20 veterans a day kill themselves, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, putting them at 21% higher risk of suicide compared with civilian adults. 
The suicide rate for active-duty troops was similar to that of civilians in 2014, according to the most recent data released by the Pentagon. The Army’s rate of 23.9 suicides per 100,000 soldiers was the highest among the services. 
Almost 20 years ago, Adm. Jeremy Boorda, the Navy’s top sailor, killed himself with a gunshot to the chest. Then the chief of naval operations, Boorda had been the focus of an investigation into his improperly wearing combat medals. The four-star officer was the highest-ranking ever to have killed himself.",0

23742,US Commander: We Must Conquer Raqqa Before ISIS Launches Attacks on West,"Insists US Has 'Sense of Urgency' in Taking Over ISIS Capital by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
US officials in the past few days have kept talking up an imminent invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite so much focus presently on Mosul, and despite the obvious huge problems its going to cause between Turkey and the Kurdish YPG. 
Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the US commander in Iraq, insists the US has decided it doesn’t have a choice in the matter, and feels a “ sense of urgency ” to take over Raqqa before any of the ISIS leadership in that city is able to plan any retaliatory strikes against Western targets. 
“We’ve got to get to Raqqa pretty soon,” Townsend insisted, claiming that the capture of Manbij a couple of months ago uncovered ISIS plots to attack France and the US, and they are convinced even more plots are ongoing within Raqqa. 
ISIS is estimated to have around 4,000 troops in Raqqa, and the attack will require the Kurdish YPG to commit substantial portions of its force to the area. That’s problematic, because Turkey has in the past attacked them when they were fighting ISIS, and has warned the US not to allow any Kurds into Raqqa. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
23745,"Interview: Devyn Springer, Queer Black Muslim, On Homophobia In Islamic Spaces","Devyn Springer is a queer black Muslim. In this three-part video series, which is part of Roqayah Chamseddine’s project, “Islam In America,” Springer talks about the difficulty of fighting homophobia in Islamic spaces. 
“Oftentimes, if we’re being completely honest, I don’t fight it,” Springer confesses. “I really don’t. I stay silent most of the time. I’m very courageous when I’m at the front line of a protest, but then when you put me in a room with my umma, I stay silent. I think that’s a problem.”
As Springer shares, he used to fight homophobia when faced with it at his mosque and the Muslim student association at his school. But he has chosen silence lately just like women tired of trying to fight sexism or misogyny in Islam might choose silence. 
Muslims choose silence because they want to be “model minorities,” according to Springer. 
“So many Muslims are concerned with being a model minority and trying to paint this perfect picture of Islam, and it’s damaging. We want to live up to white supremacy and to whiteness and to all these Americanisms so much that we’re not willing to address the very problems in our communities. It has to stop,” Springer declares.
“We’re not model minorities. The model minority doesn’t exist. It’s a myth just to get people to assimilate.”
Roqayah’s “Islam In America” series is an ongoing project , which amplifies the stories of American Muslims and what they struggle with in their day-to-day lives beyond just Islamophobia. It promotes an alternative to the fear of Donald Trump’s presidential administration.

[From Bloomberg:  In a bid to expand its influence in the era of Donald Trump, Breitbart News, the crusading   website that was an early champion of the incoming president, has hired veteran financial journalist John Carney of The Wall Street Journal to lead a new finance and economics section set to launch soon after the Jan. 20th presidential inauguration.  “Breitbart was way ahead of the curve on politics and the rise of Trump,” Carney said in a telephone interview. “I think there’s an opportunity to do that for business, finance and economic news. ” In his new role, Carney will manage a roster of news contributors that includes former CNBC personality Larry Kudlow.   …     “There simply isn’t a better person in media to lead the economics section of an anti establishment,   global news outlet,” Larry Solov, chief executive of Breitbart News Network, said in a statement.

In a report released November 2 by the California state attorney general’s office, private educational technology companies are warned to be very vigilant in their handling of sensitive student data obtained by them in the course of their dealings with public schools. 
“In some instances we’re seeing evidence of companies mining data from school children beyond what’s necessary for their education,” said Daniel Suvor, chief of policy for California Attorney General Kamala Harris. 
Harris’s office released their report, entitled “Ready for School: Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data,” to convince these corporate educational conglomerates with substantial contracts with school districts nationwide to come up with procedures that aren’t careless with the private data obtained from students in the course of complying with the various standardized tests and other activities required as part of the big money agreements signed by administrators and the companies. 
According to the report, education has become an $8-billion-a-year business. No wonder these companies care so much about pleasing their clients. 
The purpose of the report and its recommendations is to limit “the collection and use of the student information acquired through the technology,” Harris’ office said in a written statement.",0
23749,"Actually, a Malfunction Did Affect Donald Trump’s Voice at the Debate - The New York Times","The Commission on Presidential Debates said Friday that the first debate on Monday was marred by an unspecified technical malfunction that affected the volume of Donald J. Trump’s voice in the debate hall. Mr. Trump complained after the debate that the event’s organizers had given him a “defective mike,” contributing to his widely panned performance against Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton lampooned Mr. Trump’s claim, telling reporters on her campaign plane, “Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night. ” Mr. Trump was clearly audible to the television audience. And there is no evidence of sabotage. But it turns out he was on to something. “Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump’s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall,” the commission said in its statement. The commission, a nonprofit organization that sponsors the presidential debates, released no other information about the malfunction, including how it was discovered, which equipment was to blame, or why the problem was admitted to only on Friday, four days after the debate. Reached by phone, a member of the commission’s media staff said she was not authorized to speak about the matter. Some members of the audience, held at Hofstra University in New York, recalled in interviews that the amplification of Mr. Trump’s voice was at times significantly lower than that for Mrs. Clinton. And at times Mr. Trump appeared to be hunching down to get his face closer to his microphone. Zeke Miller, a reporter for Time Magazine who attended the debate, mentioned the difference on Monday in a report to the traveling press pool for Mr. Trump. From his vantage point, Mr. Miller wrote, Mr. Trump was sometimes “a little quieter” than Mrs. Clinton. In an interview, Mr. Trump said he had tested out the audio system two hours before the event and found it “flawless. ” Only during the debate did he notice the problem, Mr. Trump said, and he tried to compensate by leaning down more closely to the microphone. He complained that the changing volume had distracted him and alleged again that someone had created the problem deliberately. “They had somebody modulating the microphone, so when I was speaking, the mike would go up and down,” Mr. Trump said. “I spent 50 percent of my thought process working the mike. ” He had wanted to pause the debate to address the problem, Mr. Trump said, but felt he could not. “How can I stop the show if I had 100 million people watching?” he said. Asked whether he was reconsidering participating in the next debate, scheduled for Oct. 9, Mr. Trump did not answer directly. “I want to do the next debate, but everybody is talking about the mike,” Mr. Trump said.",0

23753,’Hunger Games’ Star: Gender Can Be ’Whatever You Want It to Be’,"Hunger Games actress Amandla Stenberg says she rejects the traditional concept of gender, claiming instead that it is a construct that can be “pretty much whatever you want it to be. ”[“I tend to believe that gender as we’ve set it up in   society doesn’t actually exist,” Stenberg told People magazine in an interview. “I’ve said before that I’m comfortable with using the pronouns ‘they’ or ‘them’ alongside ‘she’ and ‘her’ just because that’s a conversation that’s important to me. ”  “I don’t necessarily always prescribe to female pronouns just because I don’t think that pronouns are necessarily very meaningful,” Stenberg continued. The actress, who last year came out as bisexual via a Snapchat video, has previously voiced her support for a number of   or   causes. In July 2015, Stenberg accused the media of ignoring and disparaging black females, arguing that they make “black women [into] objects of fetishism and brutality,” and advocated support for the Black Lives Matter movement. In a   video made for a history class last year titled “Don’t Cash Crop On My Cornrows,” Stenberg blasted artists including Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and Iggy Azalea for   aspects of black culture for personal gain. The    actress has also described herself as an intersectional feminist, writing essays on the subject and launching a comic book with a young black female heroine. This year, Stenberg will star in the film adaption of the book Everything, Everything, and in 2018 will also play the lead role of Ruby in another adaption of the book trilogy The Darkest Minds.

23754,Truth is Out There: Astronomers Capture 234 Signals From Space,"posted by Eddie Astronomers have recorded mysterious signals from 234 stars that they believe could indicate the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence – a notion that’s sure to excite alien truthers and beyond. Astronomers Ermanno Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Canada analyzed 2.5 million stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) project. In their resulting study published in Solar and Stellar Astrophysics journal, the pair conclude that the peculiar signals they recorded could be from aliens trying to make contact with Earth. The researchers came to this potential explanation based on a previous study by Borra which predicted the shape of an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) signal. The 234 signals identified match this shape exactly. The fact that only a small fraction – 234 out of 2.5 million – of the stars in our sun’s spectrum emitted this signal also matches the previous ETI hypothesis. However the theory that these signals are the result of aliens is only one of a number of possibilities, according to the study, and they could in fact derive from any one of “several possibilities” such as “ rotational transitions in molecules” or “rapid pulsations”. So is this the discovery we’ve been waiting for to finally confirm we’re not alone in the universe? Not quite.. The authors admit that further work is needed to confirm this theory and are also considering the ‘unlikely’ scenario that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars. Breakthrough Listen Initiative , a scientific and technological exploration program that includes Stephen Hawking and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on its board , has announced plans to research the findings further but says a breadth of independently verified proof is required to substantiate the claims. “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” the group points out in a statement . “It is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations.” “Internationally agreed-upon protocols for searches for evidence of advanced life beyond Earth (SETI) require candidates to be confirmed by independent groups using their own telescopes, and for all natural explanations to be exhausted before invoking extraterrestrial agents as an explanation,” they added.

The two men spoke while they were waiting with other world leaders to enter a gala dinner at a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations here, according to a White House official. The official did not say what the two men discussed, except to suggest that it was not substantive.

More than 130 command and control centers have been put on alert in Russia and six former Soviet republics - Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. All the countries contribute to the integrated air defense system overseen by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - an alliance of former Soviet republics that emerged after the collapse of the USSR. The large-scale military exercise is to train high-readiness forces in dealing with ""airspace violations, including by hijacked aircraft"" as well as ""assisting crews of aircraft in distress,"" the ministry added. Some 100 aircraft, including Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 fighter jets, Su-24 and Su-34 bombers, as well as Su-25 ground attack jets and combat helicopters provided by the allies, are expected to take part in the drill. Troops from electronic warfare and surface-to-air missile units are also participating. The exercise started at 8am Moscow time with Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 aircraft given the roles of aggressor. The planes, simulating an adversary force, were spotted over Eastern European and Central Asian airspaces, the Russian military said. All units are being coordinated from a Russian Air Force command center located outside Moscow. The joint CIS air defense system, established in 1995, currently focuses on protecting the ex-Soviet countries' airspace as well as providing air or missile strike early warnings and coordinated responses. Russia contributes the bulk of the system's early warning and air defense capacities, with short- and long-range radar stations monitoring the area. Notably, the system does not have a single commander. It is collectively controlled by the chiefs of the air defense forces of the member states themselves. Bilateral air defense systems between Russia and its neighbors have also been established in recent years. Last December, an air defense agreement between Russia and Armenia was signed by the two countries' defense ministers, Sergey Shoigu and Seyran Oganyan, respectively. In 2013 Moscow signed a separate treaty on a joint regional air defense system with Kazakhstan. Russian and Belarusian anti-aircraft missile forces have already been unified into an integrated system designed to contain any security threats in the European theater.

23771,"Branding Day, Fading Elsewhere, Still a Ritual on Colorado Ranch - The New York Times","DENVER  —   Time has changed much in the American West. On some ranches, cowboys round up cattle on   and track livestock with drones. While technology is easing tasks, though, some think it is also threatening the skills that make a cowboy a cowboy: roping, riding and a   devotion to hard work. But for centuries, neighbors have gathered each spring for a day of branding newborn animals.   cattlemen pull a hot iron from the fire, and calves mewl as curved steel singes hair and burns flesh. Afterward, there is cheap beer and a meal, maybe a band and a dance. The branding process has been criticized as cruel. And some families have moved to other methods, including freeze brands created with liquid nitrogen and ear tags they can read with an electronic wand. Perhaps the most notable innovation is the calf table, a viselike device that allows people to trap, flip and mark an animal, eliminating the need for a crew of helpers. In some places, that is sending the community gathering known as branding day into the past. But not on Bill Gray’s ranch, outside Ordway, Colo. Mr. Gray, 65, is a   rancher who still tracks and marks his cattle the old way. His brand serves a practical purpose, allowing him to prove ownership at sale and ward off cattle thieves. (Rustling is not just a crime of the past.) “You can put the ear tag in them,” he said. “But you can tear the ear tag out. ” He has two symbols he uses to identify livestock. One, called a    was passed to him by his grandfather, like a family crest. Ordway is three hours southeast of here and has about 1, 000 people. Mr. Gray calls on many of them to help in the ritual. “Tradition has a lot to do with it,” he said. “Part of ranching is neighbors helping neighbors. ” Among his chief concerns is an   divide. “I’m sure urban people think that what we do, some of the practices, are barbaric. But they’re not,” he said. “If I mistreat my cattle, it’s going to cost me money. I can’t do that. ” As for his neighbors who have moved to calf tables, “I don’t hold it against them,” he said. “Some people need to use it if they’re not proficient at what we do. ” Mr. Gray has eight children and 22 grandchildren and has been through a lot lately. A dry period lasting 14 years was followed by a recent drop in cattle prices. In February, his home burned down, cause undetermined. On a recent day, Mr. Gray’s roundup began just as the sun bumped over the muddy prairie. His son, his grandson, his neighbors and part of the high school wrestling team rode up to help. Cowhands on horseback pushed hundreds of animals into corrals, and ropers lassoed the calves by the legs, flipping them onto their sides. Flankers rushed to hold the animals down as older men took out the irons. Next came vaccination, the injection of a growth hormone and, for the males, castration. Many brandings are governed by an unspoken cowboy etiquette: Young people wrestle the cattle onto the ground, while older ones handle the iron. But Mr. Gray said that he was a bit different. “I try to let everybody do some of the jobs,” he said. “That way, when it comes their time, they’ll know how to do it. ”",0
23773,MILO: ’I Was A Victim Of Child Abuse’ - Breitbart,"MILO, who recently resigned as Breitbart senior editor, made a public statement at a press conference in New York City explaining his history with abuse and his reasons for leaving Breitbart.[  “I am a gay man, and a child abuse victim. ” wrote MILO in a Facebook post shortly after his press conference, “Between the ages of 13 and 16, two men touched me in ways they should not have. One of those men was a priest. My relationship with my abusers is complicated by the fact that, at the time, I did not perceive what was happening to me as abusive. I can look back now and see that it was. I still don’t view myself as a victim. But I am one. Looking back, I can see the effects it had on me. In the years after what happened, I fell into alcohol and nihilistic partying that lasted well into my late 20s. ” MILO continued, “I’ve reviewed the tapes that appeared last night in their proper full context and I don’t believe they say what is being reported. Nonetheless I do say some things on the tapes that I do not mean and which do not reflect my views. My experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous. But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, “advocacy. ” I am horrified by that impression. ” Apologising for his any hurt his words may have cause saying, “The remarks I made on podcasts and interviews more than a year ago were about my personal life experiences. I will not apologize for dealing with my life experiences in the best way that I can, which is humor. No one can tell me or anyone else who has lived through sexual abuse how to deal with those emotions. But I am sorry to other abuse victims if my own personal way of dealing with what happened to me has hurt you. ” And further explaining his reasoning for his resignation from Breitbart MILO said, “My employer Breitbart News has stood by me when others caved. They have allowed me to carry conservative and libertarian ideas to communities that would otherwise never have heard them. They have been a significant factor in my success. I’m grateful for that freedom and for the friendships I forged there. I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues’ important reporting, which is why today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately. This decision is mine alone. ” “When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them. For me, now, that means stepping aside so my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do. ” said MILO. “I regret the things I said. I don’t think I’ve been as sorry about anything in my whole life. This isn’t how I wanted my parents to find out about this. ” “Don’t think for a moment that this will stop me being as offensive, provocative and outrageously funny as I want on any subject I want. America has a colossal free speech problem. The land of the First Amendment has some of the most oppressive social restrictions on free expression anywhere in the western world. I’m proud to be a warrior for free speech and creative expression. I want everyone in America, the greatest country in the history of human civilisation, to be able to be, do, read and say anything. I will never stop fighting for your right to do that. ” Read MILO’s full statement on Facebook.",0

CNN has severed its relationship with Democratic strategist Donna Brazile after it became clear that she was secretly sharing information about CNN events with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was fired when WikiLeaks revealed she was heading a covert operation to steal the nomination from Crooked Hillary, she was replaced by Donna Brazile . WikiLeaks then showed us that Donna Brazile was feeding the interview questions from CNN to Crooked Hillary before the interviews and town halls took place. CNN today made a formal announcement of the severing their relationship with Donna Brazile. We are watching the complete destruction of not only the Clinton Crime Machine but of the reputation of the DNC as well. 
“We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,” CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said in a statement, according to Politico . 
Brazile apparently emailed Clinton campaign staff leaked information about a CNN town hall in Flint, Michigan. Democrat Donna Brazile On Final Debate and Email Scandal: 
“One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,” Brazile noted in the email . “Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.” In March, Brazile emailed to warn the campaign about Clinton’s stance on the death penalty. 
“From time to time I get the questions in advance,” she wrote in the subject line, noting that she was worried about Clinton’s response. CNN’s Jake Tapper CONDEMNS DNC Chair DONNA BRAZILE

23785,"Review: Lemony Snicket’s Creations, in a Cloud of Marvelous Gloom - The New York Times","Each generation apparently must have its own Lemony Snicket adaptation, and today’s    have been given a marvelously tangy one, courtesy of Netflix, that turns the franchise into an   series that becomes available on Friday. Parents: Brace yourselves for a dark turn in your children’s senses of humor and a marked improvement in their vocabularies. The show is called, of course, “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” and it’s based on the popular books, ostensibly written by Lemony Snicket but in fact written by an actual person, Daniel Handler. The tone of these gothic tales is twisted and gloomy, and in Patrick Warburton this version has found the perfect Lemony to narrate them. He warns glumly that viewers are about to embark on a “descent into misery, tribulation and dire inconvenience,” and he is not wrong. The story follows three children, the Baudelaires, who, it seems, are orphaned by a fire within the first few minutes. Violet (Malina Weissman) the oldest, is a tinkerer, a sort of young MacGyver. Klaus (Louis Hynes) who is “a little older than 12,” reads more than any    should. And a special casting prize should go to whoever found Presley Smith, a very expressive infant portraying Sunny, whose preverbal blatherings are not as meaningless as they sound (something we learn from subtitles). The child actors are all quite good, as they have to be  —   this series is all about tone, and not every young performer could nail the one required here. Things really fall into place, though, when Neil Patrick Harris materializes. It might require a double take to recognize him, as he is rather heavily made up for the role of Count Olaf, the villain of the tale, who becomes the children’s first guardian through questionable means and does not exactly have their best interests at heart. What he does have is a lust for the money they have inherited. Olaf is the role played by Jim Carrey in the 2004 movie version, a portrayal that some critics found excessive and  . In her review of that film in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote of the young actors who portrayed Violet and Klaus that it was “a wonder they didn’t request oxygen masks after being forced into such close proximity with so much ham. ” Mr. Harris’s performance proves that there’s an art to over the top. His Olaf is just as   even   but somehow not irritating. He seems to be having a wonderful time being wicked, and he invites you, the viewer, to enjoy his enjoyment. The running gag of breaking from the action to explain what various $4 and $5 words mean works beautifully, and the cast surrounding the core players is well chosen (especially Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss, Olaf’s neighbor). The whole enterprise is wrapped in a   look and served with a respect for the ability of young minds to perceive offbeat, incongruous humor, the very quality that made the books so successful in the first place.",0
23786,"3 New Presidential Actions: Lobbying Ban, Defeat ISIS Plan, National Security Council Reorganization - Breitbart","President Donald J. Trump signed three new executive actions on Saturday afternoon, including a five year lobbying ban, reorganization of the National Security Council, and a plan to defeat the Islamic State. [From the Oval Office, President Trump signed the documents while surrounded by reporters, advisers, and his Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.  Regarding the lobbying ban, Trump said: So this is a five year lobbying ban, and this is all of the people  —   most of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work. It’s a two year ban now and it’s got full of loopholes and this is a five year ban. So you have one last chance to get out. Good, I had a feeling you were going to say that. This was something, the five year ban, that I have been taking a lot about on the campaign trail. Ahead of the signing, a senior administration official indicated that the lobbying ban included not only a five year ban on administration officials, but a lifetime ban on administration officials lobbying for a foreign country. After signing the document to reorganize the National Security Council, the President said, “This is the organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, you know pretty much what it represents, it represents a lot, and also a lot of efficiency and I think a lot of additional safety. People have been talking about this for a long time, like many years. ” President Trump signed the ISIS plan, after which he said, “This is the plan to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, in other words ISIS. I think it’s going to be very successful. That’s big stuff. ” The White House senior administration official also said ahead of the signing that the executive action regarding ISIS would give military leaders 30 days to compile and present a report to the President on a strategy to defeat ISIS. The President responded to questions about Friday’s executive order on immigration after signing each of the three executive actions, stating, “It’s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared. It’s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",0
23787,34 Reasons This Bernie Voter Will Vote Trump,"“Why I Won’t Vote for Hillary Clinton | Evan Edinger” (but then he changes his mind on that) TO CLOSE: Evan Edlinger will vote for Hillary against Trump because he thinks that whereas Hillary’s actual track-record of policies (not mere statements) in public office have been horrific, Trump’s bad statements and lack of any track-record in public office at all, make Trump even worse. That’s what he thinks. I think it makes Trump better — the better choice — as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official, Hillary Clinton. Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a person’s private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying — and that’s Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official. Trump has no record at all as a public official. Edlinger at 1:30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for Hillary,”There’s always one thing that comes in the way, and that’s trust.” He says he doesn’t trust her — but what he doesn’t actually “trust” is her words; when he says he’ll vote for her, he’s simply ignoring her actions, he’s ignoring the real person-as-a-public-official, the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever. Proven selfishness in one’s private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in one’s public-office policies (such as “We came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!” ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my “I’m a Bernie Sanders Voter: Here’s Why I’ll Vote Trump” , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he won’t, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors .",0
23789,Johnson & Johnson Lose Third Multimillion Dollar Case Over Baby Talc,"Johnson & Johnson Lose Third Multimillion Dollar Case Over Baby Talc Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay over $70 million in third cancer case Posted on November 1, 2016 by Carol Adl in News , US // 0 Comments 
Big Pharma giant Johnson & Johnson has lost yet another legal battle in a row over its talcum powder which allegedly causes cancer. 
A St. Louis jury awarded over $70 million dollars to a California woman as a result of her lawsuit which claimed that her ovarian cancer was caused by years of using Johnson & Johnson’s baby talc. 
The trial started on September 26th and ended on October 27th and is the third successful lawsuit this year against Johnson & Johnson. RELATED CONTENT 
Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California was diagnosed with the disease in 2012 and accused the company of ‘negligent conduct’ in making and and marketing the baby powder. 
The lawsuit claimed Mrs Giannecchini contracted the disease after using baby powder in an intimate area. 
Jim Onder, Mrs Giannecchini’s lawyer, said: ‘We are pleased the jury did the right thing. They once again reaffirmed the need for Johnson & Johnson to warn the public of the ovarian cancer risk associated with its product.’ 
However, the company has rejected there is any risk to using their product – even in intimate areas – and will appeal the massive award. 
Carol Goodrich, spokesman for the company said: ‘We deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer. We will appeal today’s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder.’ 
Earlier this year, two other lawsuits in St Louis ended in jury verdicts worth a combined $127million. But two others in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said there wasn’t reliable evidence that talc leads to ovarian cancer, an often fatal but relatively rare form of cancer. 
Ovarian cancer accounts for about 22,000 of the 1.7million new cases of cancer expected to be diagnosed in the US this year. 
About 2,000 women have filed similar suits, and lawyers are reviewing thousands of other potential cases, most generated by ads touting the two big verdicts out of St. Louis – a $72million award in February to relatives of an Alabama woman who died of ovarian cancer, and a $55million award in May to a South Dakota survivor of the disease. 
Much research has found no link or a weak one between ovarian cancer and using baby powder for feminine hygiene, and most major health groups have declared talc harmless. Johnson & Johnson, whose baby powder dominates the market, maintains it’s perfectly safe. 
But Onder of the Onder Law Firm in suburban St Louis, which represented plaintiffs in all three St Louis cases, cited other research that began connecting talcum powder to ovarian cancer in the 1970s. 
He said case studies have indicated that women who regularly use talc on their genital area face up to a 40 per cent higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.",0
23791,Israeli minister urges greater West Bank land theft,"Israeli minister urges greater West Bank land theft By Stephen Lendman Posted on November 2, 2016 by Stephen Lendman 
Israel is run by a lunatic fringe combination of fascist hardliners, Zionist zealots and religious extremists. 
Education Minister Naftali Bennett is an over-the-top ultra-right-wing ideologue, urging unlimited settlement expansions on stolen Palestinian land, an ethnic cleansing policy for exclusive Jewish development. 
He believes Jews have exclusive sovereignty over all parts of Judea and Samaria. He supports racist hatred, state terror, ethnic cleansing and slow-motion genocide. 
On Sunday, he threatened Security Council members, saying that “[t]here is a discussion that in the coming months the UN Security Council will force a resolution on Israel.” 
“If that happens, we need to have an appropriate Zionist response, immediate sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, including Maaleh Adumim, Gush Etzion, Ariel, Ofra and Beit El.” 
“It is time to extend out sovereignty in the land of Israel . . . the entire story of settling and Zionism is a story of a great vision and the determination to see that vision through.” 
In September, Israeli-installed Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said he intends urging SC members to declare Israeli settlements illegal—knowing Washington will veto any resolution proposed. 
In 2011, it vetoed a Palestinian backed draft memo, denouncing Israel’s settlement policy as an illegal obstacle to peace. 
Last month, 88 US senators urged Obama to veto any similar Security Council resolution proposed. Extremist settlers and Knesset hardliners demand legislation authorizing annexation of Ma’aleh Adumim, Israel’s third largest settlement, home to over 37,000 residents. 
Israel’s settlement project flagrantly violates international law. Over 600,000 settlers occupy stolen Palestinian land. 
Fourth Geneva prohibits an occupying power from transferring its citizens to the territory it occupies, as well as displacing people from their land to permit it. 
Israel wants historic Palestine exclusively for Jews, Palestinians denied their fundamental rights—terrorized for decades with no international support.

23795,‘I Don’t Rent To N s’: Smoking Gun Proves Trump Family Racism (VIDEO) | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave,"on October 25, 2016 10:41 pm · 
New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him “I don’t rent to the n-word,” and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. 
The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump’s run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. 
One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a “C” on the documents for “colored,” and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump’s involvement with his father’s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father’s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization’s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away – it’s still there.

23796,Feminists ’Gallop’ Around Stockholm to Protest ’Patriarchal’ Statues of Men on Horses - Breitbart,"A group of feminist performing artists ‘galloped’ seven kilometres through Stockholm past a number of the city’s statues on Saturday to protest “patriarchal” statues of men on horseback. [“When you look at the sculptures we have in the park and city in Stockholm, you see men on horses and other men,” choreographer Anna Källblad told SVT. “Statues of women tend to be naked, and quite small. ”  The group ‘galloped’ past the Royal Palace, Humlegården, Royal Garden, and Gustav Adolf’s Square, pausing at statues, where participants “snorted” kicked, and flicked their hair in an attempt to mimic equine behaviour. Hoping that ‘City Horses’ could start a debate about men and women in public space, artist Helena Byström said the “feminist dance gallop” acted as a necessary “counterweight to the great hordes of men who take up room in the city in different ways”. Statues of men from Swedish history on horseback are outdated, and their presence overpowers Stockholm with “the male gaze and the idea of male power” according to Källblad. “Our performance is a fun way to confront it,” the choreographer told Svenska Dagbladet, describing the group as “living sculptures”. “Horses are a symbol of power, but at the same time they represent equestrianism and dance   —   both female activities which are often marginalised. “And just like the female body, horses can symbolise both the restrained and the wild,” said Källblad, remarking that “‘City Horses’ poses viewers the question of how women can occupy the public domain without being objectified. ” The idea that men occupy public spaces at the expense of women is a key theme of feminism in Sweden. Its environment minister announced in March that the country should reduce the number of cars on the road because male drivers outnumber women. “Cars are driven largely by men so by giving a lot of space to cars we’re giving a lot of space to men  —   at the expense of women,” she explained.",0

23802,Rancher Yearns for Trump Wall on US-Mexico Border,"Rancher Yearns for Trump Wall on US-Mexico Border AFP, October 28, 2016 
To many, Donald Trump’s pledge to build a wall along the US-Mexico border is unrealistic. But for Jim Chilton, it’s the only way he’ll get a good night’s sleep. 
The 77-year-old, a fifth-generation rancher on the Arizona border with Mexico, says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglers–rather than just cattle–on his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles. 
“I really admire Trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know what’s wrong with the current border system,” he said, as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his 75-square-mile ranch that stretches to the Mexican border. 
“We need a wall. I’ve been saying that for 10 years . . . and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in,” he added. “It would make my life so much better and I’d feel more secure.” 
{snip} 
Chilton, who admits that Trump was not his first choice among the Republican candidates for the White House, says building a barrier to secure the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) US-Mexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security. 
{snip} 
“I live in a no-man’s land. I live in a land that is occupied by the Sinaloa drug cartel,” he sighed, pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers. 
“I have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before . . . and even in my front yard,” he said. “I wave at them and they often yell ‘hola’ and wave back.” 
Chilton–who keeps a gun holstered on his hip, a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedside–added that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) may be using them to slip operatives into the United States. 
{snip} 
But beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism, Chilton insists that Trump’s wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons. 
“It’s just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch. It’s outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and it’s outrageous for my cowboys,” he said, referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the US through the brutal desert. 
“This is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue.” 
{snip} 
According to the US Border Patrol, nearly 2,600 bodies have been recovered since 1998 from the desert in the Tucson, Arizona sector which covers 262 miles of the border.

Contrary to his anti-establishment stance — which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton — Donald Trump’s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election.
Steve Mnuchin came on board Trump’s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs — and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management — conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee’s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians.
“It is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,” Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump’s curious choice for Treasury Secretary.
According to Fox Business Network , Trump’s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he’s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary.
Trump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton’s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate:
“I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.”
Zero Hedge noted when Trump hired the left-leaning hedge fund manager and financier as finance chair that Mnuchin had previously donated multiple times to various Democrats, including Barack Obama and none other than Hillary Clinton.
Further substantiating his establishing banking insider status — the precise profile Trump claims publicly to loathe — Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, headed OneWest Bank prior to its purchase by CIT Group in 2015, and now sits on CIT’s board while also serving as chairman and chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a private investment firm with a focus on financing big-time Hollywood movies, like “Avatar.”
If Mnuchin’s Wall Street ties don’t trouble Trump’s supporters enough, the hedge fund manager’s links to George Soros — an ardent Clinton fan — certainly will.
In fact, in terms of opposition, Soros has spent billions influencing global politics by inserting his brand of leftism wherever possible — and earlier this year even pledged , with others, some $15 million specifically to mobilize Latinos and immigrants to defeat Donald Trump.
“Steven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,” Trump said upon bringing Mnuchin into his campaign. “He brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.”
Indeed, Trump’s campaign, Quote: d by the Daily Caller , said Mnuchin “has previously worked with Mr. Trump in a business capacity and brings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fundraising operation for the Republican Party.”
While business dealings certainly bring ordinarily clashing personalities into contact on occasion, these details about the relationship between Trump and Mnuchin evidence the former’s links to the left.
Despite the nominee’s many diatribes excoriating Hillary Clinton as out-of-touch with the American populace, Trump’s own status as a billionaire belies both their decades-old friendship and striking similarities — particularly as darlings of the establishment.
Should you choose to vote on the 8th, it would be prudent to keep in mind blustery campaign rhetoric — from any politician — only constitutes so much hot air.

23810,Trevor Noah: ’When Are We Going to Start Treating Racism Like a Disease?’ - Breitbart,"Friday on ABC’s “The View,” Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah said racism should be treated “like a disease. ”  Noah said, “You know that’s tough is this. This is the question I ask myself all the time. When are we going to start treating racism like a disease? That’s my problem. When do we start treating racism like a disease? Because right now, think about it, if you look at an alcoholic, we go this person has a problem, and we treat you   …     I’m just saying. There was a time you would say, oh you’re just a drunk. Now we say you’ve got a problem. We need to help you. I think it’s the same with racism. ” “Racism is hereditary,” he continued. “It’s passed down. You teach it to your children. It grows generation to generation, and you have to know that you have it inside you, you’re susceptible to it. But if we treat it like a disease we wouldn’t shun people. I don’t understand how we think it’s going to change when we go ‘You are a racist, get out of here.’ Then where do they go and why would they change? All you’re doing is piling people into a group who then go, ‘I guess we’re all racists now,’ and then it stops having the effect that you want. Do you want them to change or do you want to maintain a higher ground?” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo",0
23812,Donald Trump Unleashes Twitter Support for Karen Handel - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump took to Twitter to support Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel on Monday, just hours before voters in Georgia go to the polls. [“Karen Handel’s opponent in #GA06 can’t even vote in the district he wants to represent because he doesn’t even live there!” Trump scoffed on Twitter about Democrat candidate Jon Ossoff. “He wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare. ”  Trump urged voters to vote for Handel during the last day of campaigning. The election is Tuesday. Handel is running to succeed Tom Price, who left office to work as the Secretary for Health and Human Services for the Trump administration. Polling shows the two candidates locked in a statistical tie as Republicans and Democrats have spent roughly $50 million on the race. A loss for Handel will be interpreted by the media as a sign that Trump’s agenda is no longer supported by the American people who elected him. Handel also recently welcomed House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to campaign for her, as well as House Speaker Paul Ryan. The group “Bikers for Trump” was also recently spotted in Georgia campaigning for Handel.",0

23815,“Fu**ing Insane”: Clinton Aide Freaks Out About Hillary Emails in Message Just Released by WikiLeaks,"
Dang, so this email just got released: ""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?"" https://t.co/jXc1mHi5vn — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 27, 2016 The Backstory: 
Clinton surrogate Neera Tanden was going on CNN with Jake Tapper in July of 2015, where she was told she'd be shown a new poll comparing Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders and others, including Jeb Bush. While she didn't know the results of said poll, she told John Podesta (via email) that she expected it to be rough. 
Podesta fired back: 
“PS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to [Bernie] if he were the nominee?” 
To which Tanden replied: 
""Well, let's see what the poll actually says. 
Let's hope the Democratic party is not suicidal."" 
Then Tanden dropped the hammer: 
""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And 
has that person been drawn and quartered? 
Like whole thing is fucking insane."" 
WikiLeaks has thus far released 33,000 Podesta emails. While the Clinton campaign has yet to confirm their accuracy, they have also not challenged their authenticity. It's been 3 weeks since @WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta emails. Not one doc has been claimed - let alone demonstrated - to be doctored. — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 27, 2016 
Expect even more to come out over the next two weeks, but keep this in mind: Way back in 2015, the people at the top of the Clinton campaign were at war over the decision to let her use personal emails. 
Will that continue if — or when — she returns to the White House? Image Credit: Pool/Getty Images 
Editor's Note: This story was updated after publishing to correct that Tanden, not Podesta, gave the money quote. ",0
23817,Apocalyptic Sounds In The Skies Are Back! This Time In Slovakia,"They call it ‘The Hum,’ a phrase coined by the geo-scientist David Deming of the University of Oklahoma to describe the ‘mysterious and untraceable sound that is heard in certain locations around the world by two to ten percent of the population.’ 
Via UsualRoutine 

The noises might vary from roaring sounds in the middle of the night, to prolonged periods of noise which sound like intense industrial activity taking place in the sky. Most unusually of all, ordinary people in cities such as York in England have claimed to hear trumpet horns coming from the sky playing chilling bars of music.
Scroll Down For Videos Below! Now Slovakia has become the latest location to these bizarre and completely inexplicable noises, which have been recorded on video.
As of yet, no one has been able to offer a completely coherent explanation for these mysterious sounds. Some have suggested that the chilling noises might be caused by changes in the Earth’s core which could eventually lead to a complete polar shift. However, aside from speculation, there is little evidence to suggest that this particular theory is true. According to Deming, they may well be caused by enormous amounts of collated feedback from telephone transmissions and aircraft which are operated by the United States Navy to communicate with submarines. However, this explanation is deemed to fall short as these noises became particularly apparent in 2011 and 2012 and if Deming is correct, there should have been previous indications of this feedback reaction before this period.

Some people have suggested that the noise could be being caused by projects such as the HAARP weapons program, which is believed to be dedicated to working on high-tech weather modification technology.
If this explanation is correct, it could not explain not only the unusual noises but also why they are so often accompanied by a bizarre phenomenon in the sky, such as those which have been detected in Slovakia in recent months.
And here is another recent video. Chilling to the bone:

Earlier on Wednesday, opposition leader Henrique Capriles initiated a large-scale peaceful protest across the country to defend the nation’s right to a referendum on Maduro's recall. According to media reports, police in some Venezuelan cities started to use tear gas against the opposition protesters. ""I want us to start a continuous session, to take into account this issue [of political tension ]… with more wisdom and with the widest possible evaluation criterion,"" Maduro said at a Council meeting, as quoted by the AVN news agency.

Maduro also expressed regret that the Council meeting was not attended by President of the National Assembly Henry Ramos. ""It is a pity that the president of the National Assembly continues to show lack of respect for the Constitution, and does not want dialogue. Here is his empty chair, I hope that he will start to act sensibly, because we need to strengthen democracy."" 
Venezuelan opposition has been seeking a referendum to remove Maduro from office. The process to collect signatures for a petition on his recall was halted last week on accusations that the signature gathering was rigged. ...",0
23820,The FBI and DOJ Summed Up By One BRUTAL Cartoon,"You are here: Home / political cartoon / The FBI and DOJ Summed Up By One BRUTAL Cartoon The FBI and DOJ Summed Up By One BRUTAL Cartoon October 27, 2016 Pinterest 
C.E. Dyer reports that FBI Director James Comey proclaimed in a congressional hearing last week that he didn’t want to be called a weasel and has vociferously defended the “integrity” of the FBI’s investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information and subsequently destroying evidence. 
It appears that many in the FBI aren’t too happy with their leader, with some even coming forward to vent their anger after Comey, who apparently doesn’t know that the buck stops with him, threw his career agents under the bus during the hearing when he said, “so if I blew it, they blew it, too.” 
Unless those career FBI agents made deals with the Clinton mafia too (allegedly, I guess…), they didn’t “blow it” like Comey did. 
Retired agent Dennis V. Hughes, who was the first chief of the FBI’s computer investigations unit, told the New York Post : “In my 25 years with the bureau, I never had any ground rules in my interviews.” 
Hughes’ comment echoed the reports that have trickled out that FBI agents were extremely frustrated by the way the investigation was conducted, or better yet, not conducted and the way agents had their hand tied behind their backs as they attempted to investigate. 
“The FBI has politicized itself, and its reputation will suffer for a long time,” Hughes said. “I hold Director Comey responsible.” 
Retired FBI agent Michael M. Biasello told the Post: “Comey has single handedly ruined the reputation of the organization.” 
Biasello pointed out that, had he and other agents done what Clinton did with classified information, the outcome would have been very different: 
Each month for 27 years, I received oral and computer admonishments concerning the proper protocol for handling top secret and other classified material, and was informed of the harsh penalties, to include prosecution and incarceration. 
Had myself or my colleagues engaged in behavior of the magnitude of Hillary Clinton, as described by Comey, we would be serving time in Leavenworth. 
Comey, who has shouted from the rooftops that the investigation was on the up and up, made the 25 agents who investigated the case sign non-disclosure agreements. 
From top to bottom, this investigations was conducted in a way that was meant to be extremely Clinton-friendly. There was never any intention of prosecuting Clinton for her crimes and the way the investigation was handled reeks of a cover-up. 
The “investigation” was plagued by five immunity deals that weren’t revoked when the grantees were less than truthful and open, the FBI conspiring to destroy evidence, Clinton getting a cozy witness interview on a holiday, onerous ground rules for interviews, limiting the scope of the investigation to certain dates so as not to reveal critical evidence, and more. 
While Martha Stewart was sentenced to prison thanks to then-federal prosecutor James Comey, Clinton has faced no consequences for her crimes. 
Gee, what changed Comey? He was awfully aggressive in Stewart’s case, but with Clinton he rolled over. Some may say he didn’t want to be another Clinton casualty, but that’s not the impression I get from Comey, who doth protest too much. 
It seems like a massive cover-up for political reasons that may have required Clinton to dip into the family slush fund, or make another such deal, for the whiny weasel. 
As more and more FBI agents speak out in addition to further information about the cover-up trickling out, it will be interesting to see how Comey explains it away or if he steps down — which he should absolutely do.",0

23824,Democrats Are Asking Hillary Clinton to Step out of the Spotlight - Breitbart,"Democrats are reportedly fed up with Hillary Clinton’s litany of excuses for losing the 2016 election and are asking her to step out of the limelight. [The consensus among former Clinton aides, former Obama aides, and Democratic strategists is that Clinton’s remarks blaming the Democratic National Committee and others for her election loss are hurting her image and the image of the Democratic Party, the Hill reported.  “She’s apparently still really, really angry. I mean, we all are. The election was stolen from her, and that’s how she feels,” one longtime Clinton aide said. “But to go out there publicly again and again and talk about it? And then blame the DNC? It’s not helpful to Democrats. It’s not helpful to the country, and I don’t think it’s helpful to her,” the aide added. Former DNC Data Director Andrew Therriault was a lot less restrained in his criticism of Clinton, calling her accusations against the DNC “fucking bullshit. ” Clinton has also gone    blaming former FBI Director James Comey, the Russians, the press, her primary and general election opponents, and even sexism for her election loss. Some aides and strategists think Clinton needs to step out of the spotlight entirely and let new leaders in the party take up that role. “If she is trying to come across as the leader of the angry movement of what happened in 2016, then she’s achieving it,” said one former senior aide to Obama. “But part of the problem she had was she didn’t have a vision for the Democratic Party, and she needs to now take a break and let others come to the forefront. ” Despite those in the party calling on Clinton to leave the public eye, her aides and advisers say she will probably remain in the public spotlight to discuss the 2016 election to promote her book that will be released this fall. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons says that she should talk more about where she went wrong in the election as opposed to blaming others for her elections. “It would be nice to hear a little more about the things she did wrong, which I believe mattered more than what she has discussed,” Simmons said.",0

Pennies are like the ‘extras’ of our society; nobody really wants them. In fact, the US government has even discussed getting rid of pennies for good, but it has yet to happen. One Reddit user thought he had just another normal penny, until he took a closer look at it. There are scores of stories of people finding old coinage, but few of somebody finding a blank penny! That’s right, this Reddit user came across a penny with no face on it. I guess Abe Lincoln had to go for a walk. Turns out that “blankface pennies” are not super rare, but they are a cool find. When a minting press misses a coin to be stamped, it is left without an imprint on it, and thus looks like the penny below. Minting presses typically end up giving these coins away on tours because they are not up to par with the rest of their production. Here is a side by side comparison of an old and new penny, in case you forgot what the face is supposed to look like: Other Reddit users responded with much vibrancy, saying things like, “I never wanted a penny more!” or “That looks super cool! Nice find there.” As it turns out, blank face or “blank planchet” pennies sell for between $1 and $2, thus making them a 10,000% return on investment! According to About.com, “A blank coin, technically called a blank planchet if it has an upraised rim on it, is worth a few dollars, perhaps $2 to $4 if it’s clad, more if it’s silver. The Sacajawea, Presidential, and Native American Dollar coins all use the same type of planchet. These coins are worth anywhere from twelve dollars to fifteen dollars.” The value of blank face coins will also vary depending on if the coin has a rim or edge on it. About.com says, “If your blank coin doesn’t even have the upraised rim yet, it’s technically a coin blank. If it is made of silver, it is almost impossible to authenticate, but if it’s clad, an expert in error coins could probably authenticate it, in which case (if authentic) it’s worth maybe $50 or more.” If you would like to see more “error coins” and learn more about blank planchet pennies, check out the video below and let us know your thoughts on this unnaturally smooth coin!

23832,Israeli Envoys Meet Trump Officials To Negotiate Settlements,"TEL AVIV  —   A senior delegation arrived in Washington Sunday to meet with officials from the Trump administration to discuss settlement activity and reportedly receive approval for construction in eastern sections of Jerusalem.  [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff Yoav Horowitz and Israel’s Ambassador to the U. S. Ron Dermer are scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt in order to reach an agreement regarding the settlements.  The meeting comes just days after Greenblatt completed a visit to the region in which he met twice with Netanyahu, as well as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah and King Abdullah II in Amman. Netanyahu and Greenblatt made “progress on the issue of Israeli settlement construction following up on President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s agreement in Washington last month to work out an approach that reflects both leaders’ views,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office issued after Thursday’s meeting said. Diplomatic officials said Netanyahu was seeking a green light from the White House to build in eastern Jerusalem and the larger settlement blocs in exchange for halting construction in the smaller settlements beyond the security fence, the daily Israel Hayom reported. Netanyahu is also vying to receive Washington’s approval for the construction of a new settlement to replace Amona, which was evacuated last month. If it goes ahead, it would be the first settlement to be built in nearly three decades. Netanyahu on Saturday night left for a three day trip to China and, according to the Times of Israel, the fact that he was not accompanied by Horowitz underscores the importance of settlement negotiations with the U. S. In a joint press briefing last month, Trump told Netanyahu to “hold back” on settlements. However, in a departure from traditional U. S. diplomacy in the region, Greenblatt  met with settler leaders last week, including Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan and Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy for the Council of Jewish Communities of Judea and Samaria in the West Bank. Following the meeting, Dagan said, “We respect Trump and the new government. We’re pleased there is a supportive government [in Washington]. ” “Our requests are to our government and to our ministers. We must make a drastic change and stop this edicts [against settlement activity] that harm the basic rights” of the Jewish communities in the West Bank, Dagan said.",0
23833,Shia LaBeouf Is Arrested at Anti-Trump Art Show in New York - The New York Times,"The actor and performance artist Shia LaBeouf was arrested early Thursday morning on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges while protesting President Trump at a livestream art installation in Queens. In videos online, Mr. LaBeouf  —   who has a history of provocative behavior and a record of arrests for minor offenses  —   expresses outrage, evidently aimed at Mr. Trump, and uses   language to ask how the public can make it normal “to be a Nazi out here. ” In one video, a small gathering of fellow protesters chants “He will not divide us” as the bearded Mr. LaBeouf speaks. A police officer approaches, and Mr. LaBeouf appears to get into a verbal altercation with him before the officer places him in handcuffs and escorts him out of the camera’s view. Mr. LaBeouf was arrested just after 12. 30 a. m. and charged with misdemeanor assault and with harassment, according to Detective Adam Navarro of the New York City Police Department. He was issued a desk appearance ticket and instructed to come to court on April 4. He was not jailed. Detective Navarro said that the police were called after Mr. LaBeouf got into an argument with another man at the installation, pulled off the man’s scarf and, in the process, scratched his face. The man did not need to be hospitalized, the detective said. The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf’s latest art project, “He Will Not Divide Us,” a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner. On Inauguration Day, the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, and invited members of the public to repeat the words “he will not divide us” into the camera. The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words,   throughout Mr. Trump’s time in office. Representatives for Mr. LaBeouf did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday morning. The arrest is not Mr. LaBeouf’s first   with the law: In 2014, while at a Broadway performance of the musical “Cabaret,” he was arrested and later charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. The actor first rose to prominence as a child performer on the Disney Channel television series “Even Stevens,” and in 2008 starred in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. ” More recently, he has drawn as much attention for his unusual art projects as for his acting. In November 2015, Mr. LaBeouf arranged a   marathon of all of his movies at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. The next month, he set up shop in an art gallery in Liverpool, England, asking people to call him and “touch his soul. ”",0

Head of Russia’s State Duma (lower house of parliament) Committee for International Affairs Leonid Slutsky “really hopes” that US president-elect Donald Trump will adhere to his position on recognizing Crimea as part of Russia that he expressed during the election campaign. 
“As for Trump’s position on recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, I really hope he does that,” Slutsky told a press conference in Moscow. 
He pointed out that “during the election campaign as well as after the election, Trump more than once reiterated his wish to meet with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and change the US attitude to the Syrian crisis.” “Let us wait for other statements on strategic matters. I think there may be a statement on the Crimean issue. I wouldn’t get too excited but as all the Russian citizens and the Crimeans in particular, I, too, would pin hopes on it,” he added. 
Slutsky believes Trump will “clarify his position on this matter” in the next few weeks.

23835,Leaked Email Shows Department of Justice Coordinating With Clinton Campaign,"On Friday, FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the FBI was reopening the Hillary Clinton email investigation due to the discovery of new emails. The emails were reportedly discovered by the FBI while investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for possibly illegal sexting with someone under 18.
The emails were contained on Weiner’s laptop and are connected to Hillary Clinton via Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin. Abedin is one of Clinton’s closest advisors and she apparently did not make the laptop available during the initial investigation which ended in July and exposed that Hillary Clinton had continually lied about her email practices. 
Due to the timing of Comey’s update in relation to the election, the Clinton campaign has gone into full attack mode against the FBI director. But reports now show the Obama Administration’s Department of Justice had been pressuring the FBI to go easy on Clinton for some time, even to the point of causing an internal revolt within the FBI.
Comey may have updated Congress to avoid his own staff leaking the information to the press ahead of him, as numerous agents have taken issue with the decision not to make a criminal referral in the email case and the Justice Department’s attempts to weaken investigations into the Clinton Foundation.
So, is Obama’s DOJ working for the Clinton campaign?
Well, a new email published by Wikileaks would appear to answer that question in the affirmative. On May 19, 2015, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon emailed Hillary Clinton: 
DOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge’s thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today.
Fallon, who previously worked at the Department of Justice, apparently is coordinating with “DOJ folks” on the Clinton campaign. He is telling Hillary Clinton, in an email chain that includes Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills and Abedin, about a court hearing related to Clinton’s emails that he was informed of by allies that work at the Department of Justice.
It appears that political appointees like Attorney General Loretta Lynch and others at the Justice Department put pressure on the FBI to protect the Clinton campaign. The question is, how far did the coordination go?

23836,Hillary Is The Perfection of a Corrupt System,"Posted on November 3, 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith 
Let’s set aside Hillary Clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system. As I noted yesterday, Politics As Usual Is Dead , and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes. 
The corruption of pay-to-play and the commingling of public and private influence is not the failing of an individual–it is the logical conclusion of a thoroughly corrupt political system. 
Given the incentives built into politics as usual , public/private pay-to-play doesn’t just make sense–it is the only possible maximization of the political system . 
Cobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike. 
All the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else. Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in “contributions” and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds. 
The nation’s political system needs a thorough cleaning from top to bottom. Exposing the Clintons’ perfection of politics as usual won’t change the conditions and incentives that created the Clintons’ harvester of corruption. 
That will require rooting out the incentives that made the Clintons’ perfection of corruption both logical and inevitable.",0

Some members of the United Nations Security Council are planning anti-Israel resolutions during the last days of the Obama administration, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, told Arutz Sheva. This comes as no surprise. 
The Ambassador reported that he had been alerted to a specific effort to pass one-sided, binding resolutions in the Security Council that could have serious ramifications for the Jewish state. 
“We’ve been hearing for some time from various sources about attempts to take advantage of the lame-duck period after the election, and to pass resolutions against the State of Israel in the Security Council,” Danon said. 
“We’re working on a number of fronts,” the Ambassador added, “including with the present [American] government and the incoming administration, as well as with other countries, in order to prevent [one-sided UNSC resolutions].” 
Danon then outlined some of the warnings he had received regarding planned efforts towards a Security Council resolution.",0

President Obama was interrupted by a protester while he was speaking at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton. Suffice it to say, Obama had the best reaction to a protester ever. Hands down. So, of course, Trump had to start lying about what happened. 
Speaking to a crowd in Hershey, PA, Trump said that the president had done quite literally the exact opposite of what he actually did . 
“You saw it today on television, right? He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say, “He became unhinged! He became –“You have to go back and look and study. And see what happened. They never moved the camera. And he spent so much time screaming at this protester and frankly, it was a disgrace.” 
Okay, so let’s “go back and look” at just how President Obama handled the situation today. When the protester interrupted him, the crowd was not having it. He struggled to quiet them as they chanted “Hillary,” and when he succeeded, he began by reminding them of all the reasons they should treat this man with respect. Obama defended the protester’s First Amendment rights and then told those in attendance that this is what he means when he says they aren’t “focused.” He concluded with his now trademark phrase, “Don’t boo, VOTE!”

23845,"Neil Armstrong: 'Their Ships Were Far Superior To Ours – Boy, Where They Big!'","Neil Armstrong: 'Their Ships Were Far Superior To Ours – Boy, Where They Big!' Please scroll down for video 
Everyone is familiar with the broadcast images of Neil Armstrong's historic first steps on the moon, and many believe his footsteps to be the first ever on the lunar surface. However, during a documented NASA symposium, Armstrong made comments alluding to the fact that not only had other species visited the moon, but that there were signs of colonization there upon. The Real Reason NASA Refuses a Return to the Moon 
Armstrong stated in an interview with an unnamed professor at the symposium that their presence on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission was immediately noticed and addressed by an alien race. The beings that occupied the lunar air space made very clear their displeasure of the human's arrival on the moon's surface: 
Armstrong: It was incredible … of course, we had always known there was a possibility … the fact is, we were warned off. There was never any questions then of a space station or a moon city. 
Professor: How do you mean “warned off”? Related Articles Neil Armstrong’s UFO Secrets 
Armstrong: I can’t go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology – Boy, where they big! … and menacing … No, there is no question of a space station . 
Armstrong: Naturally – NASA was committed at that time, and couldn’t risk a panic on earth…. But it really was a quick scoop and back again. (Above Top Secret, p. 186) 
Additionally, there are reports that upon arrival on the moon Armstrong witnessed structures on the surface resembling shops and other buildings obviously not designed by man. It is believed that while footage exists of these findings, the decision was made not to make these films public so as to not incite public panic. 
NASA's unwillingness to move forward with lunar cities or even stations can easily be explained by the fear of going against the will of a much more advanced race. Armstrong stated that this fear is what lead to the following Apollo missions to only include a quick landing and sample collection. With this limited access to the moon, NASA or any other space exploration organization would be greatly hindered in their efforts to establish surface space stations of any type and lunar colonies would be completely infeasible. 
Could it be that human's exploration of the cosmos is closely regulated by alien races? What lengths would those races go to prevent space travel advancement by humans? Perhaps in the future, humans will gain the favor of the celestial inhabitants and be privy to the mysteries of beyond.

The sound of motorcycles filled the air as the crowd gathered in the square. “No baby deserves that. They don’t. That little boy was innocent. Never done anything to anybody in his life. It just didn’t deserve it,” Mike Jarvis of the Chisholm Trail Motorcycle Group told KFOR. Police found the decomposing infant in a dumpster April 9 inside a trash bag placed in a box. “It’s a baby. Like why would you do that to a baby? It’s Enid’s baby and you just don’t do that to a kid,” said Kassydi Reisner, who performed at the memorial.

CBS New York reports that the man’s body appeared to be floating in the water for about a week or two, and police have identified the body from an ID in the man’s pocket but are waiting to release the man’s identity until it is confirmed.

The discovery of the body comes less than 24 hours after another body was found in the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir Tuesday afternoon near Central Park West and 90th Street. The man’s naked body was estimated to be in his 20s or 30s and did not appear to have undergone any trauma. The body was believed to have been in the water for at least a month because it was badly decomposed. Police say that they do not suspect the bodies were connected to any crime, and a medical examiner will perform autopsies to determine the causes of death. Boyce said a body had not been found in Central Park’s waters since 2015.",0

23862,BREAKING – Obama Caught RED-HANDED With THIS Sick Move to STEAL The Election! | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print The Democrats have become synonymous with the word scandal in this election. We have yet another scandal and reason to distrust Obama and Hillary Clinton—just for you. President Obama’s Justice Department has been caught red handed stealing money, which should be going to victims of crimes, and putting it into the hands of left-wing advocacy groups, as per Breitbart . This new scandal comes after we saw Hillary Clinton cleared of charges for acid washing her emails. This clearance came from the Justice Department, as run by a person who had private meetings with Bill Clinton prior to the decision. This also happened after Hillary Clinton said that if she was elected, she would reappoint the current attorney general—that same person—Loretta Lynch. The key facts of this news scandal are as follows: the Justice Department has millions of dollars of taxpayer money that is usually reserved for the victims of serious crimes. However, Obama has been funneling money, in the ballpark of $650 million, away from victims of serious crimes and towards organizations that are helping him. This money is supposed to be going to victims of federal crimes like gang violence, wall street corruption, or other white collar crimes. It’s normally used for restitution of the money the victims lost as a result of criminal actions. Is it surprising Obama thinks this money should be lining his pockets instead? Obama and his cronies find ways to make these left wing advocacy groups “victims” of crimes. These are organizations are signing people up to vote, going to rallies, knocking on doors, and helping elect Hillary Clinton—not advocacy groups that need restitution of money lost to criminals. Obama’s Justice Department has failed us once again. Instead of abusing taxpayer money, this Justice Department should be prosecuting Hillary Clinton for lying to Congress, destroying evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena, and obstructing justice. This is, alone, is enough to impeach the president, but we all know there simply isn’t enough time left in his presidency to do so. But, maybe we could get the paperwork rolling just to scare him a little bit! If elected, it is clear Hillary Clinton will continue these corrupt practices, especially with Loretta Lynch as her attorney general.

23867,"Moving to Make Amends, Georgetown President Meets With Descendant of Slaves - The New York Times","More than a century after Georgetown University used some of the profits from the sale of 272 enslaved   to help ensure its survival, John J. DeGioia, the university’s president, took a first step on Monday toward making amends to their descendants. He walked into the public library in Spokane, Wash. for a private meeting with Patricia   a     of Nace and Biby Butler, two of the slaves who were sold in 1838 to help keep the college afloat. The   meeting, which was followed by a lunch at the nearby Davenport Hotel, may well have been a historic one. More than a dozen universities have recognized their ties to slavery and the slave trade. But historians say they believe this is the first time that the president of an elite university has met with the descendants of slaves who had labored on a college campus or were sold to benefit one. “I came to listen and to learn,” Mr. DeGioia said in an interview, describing the discussion as “moving and inspiring. ” Ms.   an amateur genealogist and retired teacher, said she believed Mr. DeGioia was willing to take necessary steps “to honor the sacrifice and legacy” of her ancestors. “He asked what could he do and how could he help,” she said in an interview. “It was a very good beginning. ” The meeting comes as officials at Georgetown continue to grapple with how to address the college’s complicity in the slave sale. The slaves, who were owned by the Jesuit priests who founded and ran the college, were sold for about $3. 3 million in today’s dollars. A portion of the profit  —   about $500, 000  —   was used to help pay off Georgetown’s debts at a time when the college was struggling financially. The slaves, who had lived on Jesuit estates in Maryland that had helped to finance the college’s operations, were uprooted and shipped to plantations in Louisiana. A working group assembled by Mr. DeGioia in September has been considering whether the university should apologize for profiting from slave labor, create a memorial to those enslaved, or provide scholarships for their descendants, among other possibilities. The report is expected to be released this summer, Mr. DeGioia said. Craig Steven Wilder, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied the roots of elite universities in slavery, said he did not know of another instance in which a university president had reached out to descendants. “Georgetown has made a decision to recognize the humanity of the problem they’re dealing with, to treat it as more than a public relations problem,” Mr. Wilder said. The search for descendants of the men, women and children sold in 1838 intensified in the fall after Georgetown students called on the university to remove the names of the Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry from two campus buildings. The priests were two of Georgetown’s early presidents. Both were involved in the slave sale. Mr. DeGioia, who had already called for a campuswide discussion about the college’s roots in slavery, agreed to change the names of the buildings. The student protests inspired a Georgetown alumnus, Richard J. Cellini, to found a nonprofit, the Georgetown Memory Project, to help identify and support the descendants of the people who were sold. Mr. Cellini hired eight genealogists, including Ms.   and several researchers who are working with her. University officials are also identifying descendants of the slaves. Ms.   said that she made a point of telling Mr. DeGioia what she knew about her ancestors and emphasizing the importance of the university’s archival records. This year, Georgetown created an online archive that includes records that describe the slave sale and the Jesuit and Louisiana plantations. “These were real people,” Ms.   said of her enslaved forebears, “and I wanted to put faces on them for him. ”",0

23869,Donald Trump: I Would Let My Son Barron Play Football - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump would be willing to let his son Barron Trump play football, despite the dangers posed by the physical nature of the game. [During a Westwood One radio broadcast with Jim Gray before the Super Bowl, Trump was asked whether he would allow his son Barron, or any of his grandchildren to play football.  “If they wanted, I would allow them to play,” Trump said. “But I will say that they have to be very careful. ” Trump’s answer is different than former President Obama  —   who regularly signaled that if he had a son, he would probably not allow him to play in the sport. “I would not let my son play pro football,” Obama said, in 2014. But Trump remarked that he played football “at a certain level” while growing up and appreciated the toughness of the sport. “It’s a rough game and it’s a tough game and there’s something really good about that in terms of competition, and learning how to compete and win,” he said. Trump acknowledged that some parents were keeping their children out of football, but he would let the children in his family decide for themselves. “Regardless, I would leave it up to the young person in the family, I think I would have to do that,” he said.",0
23870,Trump Silent As Iowa Cop Killer Identified As One Of His White Supporters,"Comments 
During the middle of the night, the city of Des Moines in Iowa was rocked with violence as a man opened fire on police officers in “ambush” style, killing two. The suspect is a white male, as per police reports, and has just been taken into custody. 
What we do know about this man is that his mind is a whirlwind of hatred and hypocrisy. He was kicked out of a football game in October for waving a Confederate flag at football players kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police violence against blacks. 
“I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.” said Greene in a rant tinged with white nationalist themes, three weeks before he would ambush two policemen in their patrol car and killing them both. 
The Trump camp is silent as a man who supports him embarks on an act of anti-government violence that Trump himself has been calling for . The muted response is infuriating, especially for the blacks and Muslims of America who have been demonized by right-wingers for trying to stop racial/ethnic profiling and ask they be given the benefit of the doubt that white Americans get. 
Why does the media refuse to call this what it is – terrorism? Where was Greene radicalized? Why won’t Donald Trump say “radical white terrorism?” Is he part of a larger white supremacist terror group? We need to put a stop to white men entering this country until we can figure out what the hell is going on. Sound familiar? 
While civic institutions like Black Lives Matter and the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are smeared as terror groups for daring to ask some uncomfortable questions and demanding that the rights bestowed upon the American people are enforced equally for all her citizens, the real terror threat – as confirmed by the FBI, no less – comes from white conservatives.

23872,The Daily Traditionalist: Speaking of Independence,"Radio Aryan October 26, 2016 
Dr Matthew Raphael Johnson joins Matthew Heimbach for Wednsdayâs edition of The Daily Traditionalist to comment on geopolitics and starts by lamenting Albania being a member of NATO, when the country has no military force or hardware. Matt then brings us the news that a huge NATO force is amassing in the Baltics and Eastern Europe in the largest build up on Russiaâs border for 3 decades and they are specifically calling these forces âbattle groupsâ. Dr Johnson thinks Russia had really better watch out now that Albania is on board. 
Albania is well integrated into the EU hydra, yet itâs whole economy is based upon whores and heroin. They claim their biggest business is agriculture, yet they import everything they eat from outside, which seems to be a common problem among recent EU members. The process seems to be to bring countries that were self-sufficient into partnerships where they will then have to rely on others. This has happened with various former Soviet countries that were brought into the EU and Matt brings us another example in Venezuela. Norway has now broken itâs previous declaration to not allow American troops on itâs soil and Dr Johnson reminds us that Norway is a competitor with Russia for oil supplies. 
Matt points out that Russia has new updated nuclear warfare technology that the western media is calling âsatanâ and Dr Johnson thinks this move forward in technology was a reaction to the sanctions in Russia. It forced them to nationalise industries and do things for themselves and they will now be food independent by 2020. This is exactly what the NWOÂ doesnât want, a self sufficient nation able to defend itself without having to go cap in hand to America. 
The conversation then moves to America and Dr Johnson explains what polls mean when they say they are âover-samplingâ. This means that it is not a random sample but has been picked to over represent certain groups. The polls are just there to try and make it look less suspicious should they try to steal the election, because every form of registration online such as Facebook and Twitter shows Trump trouncing Clinton in supporters. 
The Democrats were given Hillaryâs questions from the media before being asked and the evidence is there that hired thugs have alsoÂ been used to intimidate Trump voters. If this was happening anywhere else in the world it would be universally condemned as an invalid election. It is also completely illegal to shut down a political rally, yet we have seen this happen more than once. 
If the election was cancelled however, it would just mean more of Obama in office, so there are not really any options of what else to do if these felonies were actually prosecuted. The level of corruption is so high that it is clear to everyone, in fact America could be in a pre-civil war state at the moment. When similar staged elections took place after the Jew instigated coup in Ukraine, Donesk and Luhansk rose up and separated themselves from the rest of the country. Could something like that ever happen in America?

23877,Panic Grips Italy Residents : Strong Earthquakes,"Panic Grips Italy Residents : Strong Earthquakes October 27, 2016 An officer of the State Forestry Corp national police stands in front of a collapsed church in Campi di Norcia, central Italy, October 27, 2016. 
Three earthquakes paralyzed Italy's Umbria, Marche and Lazio regions throughout the night. Residents express unshakable fear. The series of earthquakes comes just two months after hundreds were killed by another one nearby. Many residents of Campi, a town of about 200, slept in their cars as aftershocks rocked the region. First tremor measured magnitude of 5.4, second at 6.1 and third one 4.9, aftershock came a couple hours after that, and dozens of weaker ones followed. Officials say that the first tremor served as a serious warning and residents fled their homes. 
(CAMPI, ITALY) After the night came daylight revealing widespread damage in central Italy on Thursday after strong earthquakes overnight caused panic and fear among residents just two months after a quake nearby killed hundreds. No one was killed this time, but dozens of people sustained minor injuries and about four others more serious ones, Italy's Civil Protection Agency said. 
Many residents of Campi, a town of about 200, slept in their cars as aftershocks rocked the Umbria, Marche and Lazio regions throughout the night. The earthquake on Aug. 24 in the same area killed nearly 300 people and destroyed several towns. 
""I can't shake off the fear,"" said Mauro Viola, 64, who said he had not sleep and had spent the night outside. 
Police had blocked off the road to his home with a park bench, and Viola said a chapel beyond his house had collapsed. 
The three quakes, about two hours apart, damaged several buildings, including Campi's late 14th century church, San Salvatore a Campi di Norcia, whose rose-windowed facade was reduced to rubble. The quakes were probably a result of August's seismic break, Massimiliano Cocco from Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. 
The first tremor measured magnitude 5.4, causing many people to flee their homes and the second was stronger at 6.1 magnitude. A 4.9 aftershock came a couple hours after that, and dozens of weaker ones followed. Rescue workers set up some 50 beds in a quake-proof building for people who could not sleep in their homes. 
""The first tremor damaged buildings, with the second one we had collapses,"" fire department official, Rosario Meduri, said. 
He had come from southern Italy before Wednesday's tremors to help secure structures damaged by the August earthquake that hit some 50 km (30 miles) to the south. 
While massive boulders that tumbled down the valley had yet to be cleared from the roads, on the whole there was a sense of relief. 
The fact that the first earthquake was weaker than the second probably helped save lives because most people had already left their homes, Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said on state radio. 
He also said that a decree now being voted on by parliament to pay for the immediate costs of the August tremor could be extended to cover the latest series of quakes.

23893,WikiLeaks: Obama Is A Saudi Agent,"Apparently Obama wasn’t as worried about placing women in senior-level positions but Froman decided to offer up some suggestions anyway. “While you did not ask for this, I prepared and attached a similar document on women.” 
Froman even went ahead and “scoped out” which people should be appointed to which cabinet positions. “At the risk of being presumptuous, I also scoped out how the Cabinet-level appointments might be put together, probability-weighting the likelihood of appointing a diverse candidate for each position (given one view of the short list) and coming up with a straw man distribution.” 
As New Republic points out, the Froman appointments ended up being almost entirely right. The cabinet list ended up being almost entirely on the money. It correctly identified Eric Holder for the Justice Department, Janet Napolitano for Homeland Security, Robert Gates for Defense, Rahm Emanuel for chief of staff, Peter Orszag for the Office of Management and Budget, Arne Duncan for Education, Eric Shinseki for Veterans Affairs, Kathleen Sebelius for Health and Human Services, Melody Barnes for the Domestic Policy Council, and more. For the Treasury, three possibilities were on the list: Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner. This was October 6. The election was November 4. And yet Froman, an executive at Citigroup, which would ultimately become the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis, had mapped out virtually the entire Obama cabinet, a month before votes were counted. And according to the Froman/Podesta emails, lists were floating around even before that. Many already suspected that Froman, a longtime Obama consigliere, did the key economic policy hiring while part of the transition team. We didn’t know he had so much influence that he could lock in key staff that early, without fanfare, while everyone was busy trying to get Obama elected. The WikiLeaks emails show even earlier planning; by September the transition was getting pre-clearance to assist nominees with financial disclosure forms. 
So if this history is any guide then the real power within a future Clinton administration is being formed right now. In fact, another email from January 2015 reveals that Elizabeth Warren was already “intently focused on personnel issues” almost two full years ago as evidenced by the following recap of a conversation that the Hillary campaign had with her Chief of Staff, Dan Geldon. He was intently focused on personnel issues, laid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administration’s choices, and explained at length the opposition to Antonio Weiss. We then carefully went through a list of people they do like, which EW sent over to HRC earlier. We spent less time on specific policies, because he seemed less interested in that. He spoke repeatedly about the need to have in place people with ambition and urgency who recognize how much the middle class is hurting and are willing to challenge the financial industry. 
To the extent there are any purists left, this should clear up any illusion of who controls the political powers that be.",0

DES MOINES, Iowa ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Since he launched his bid to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump has made many promises, but nothing has caught the attention of the media and electorate more than what he said today in Iowa, on the eve of the first caucus of the 2016 presidential elections season. 
If elected president of the United States, Trump says he will not live in the White House. 
Instead, the billionaire candidate will establish his own White House outside of Washington, D.C. — as a matter of fact two of them : one in Florida and another in Nevada. Trump’s White House (s) will be headquartered in the Trump hotels in Doral and Las Vegas. 
“This will bring the White House — and the president — closer to the people,” Trump declared. He also indicated that he will not be using Airforce One or Marine One. Rather, he said he will be using his own private jet at no cost to the taxpayers. 
The Adobo Chronicles asked Trump what will happen to the media and the White House press corps when he travels across the country or abroad. 
“Well, they just have to book their own commercial flights and follow me around,” he said. 
Thousands of miles away in the Philippines, a leading presidential candidate said that if elected president, he will not live in Malacañang — the Filipino counterpart of the White House — because he likes to sleep in his own bed. His bed is in Davao City of which he is currently the mayor. 
Rodrigo Duterte said he will commute daily from Manila to Davao using a private jet of his friend. Davao is about a hour and forty-five minutes by plane from Manila, which is a far way shorter commute than being stuck in daily traffic on Metro Manila’s streets.",0
23907,Libertarian Candidate Endorses Hillary,"Libertarian Candidate Endorses Hillary By Daily Bell Staff - November 02, 2016 
‘I fear for the country’ if Trump wins, Bill Weld tells Rachel Maddow … Libertarian vice presidential candidate William Weld said the country will be in “chaos” if Donald Trump wins the presidency and praised Hillary Clinton during an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Tuesday. – USA Today 
Bill Weld is hardly a libertarian. His informal endorsement of Hillary Clinton shows this clearly. 
Of course it is hard to say what a “libertarian” is, but it certainly isn’t someone who has supported gun control and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Weld has … and is. 
He comes from one of the oldest families in America, is a Harvard graduate like many in his family and former governor of Massachusetts. 
Some of his career was spent with the federal justice system where he sent numerous “white collar criminals” to jail. 
Why is he the vice presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party? 
That’s hard to say. More: 
The former Massachusetts governor conceded that a realistic goal for the Libertarian Party in this election would be to win 5% of the popular vote and while he didn’t call for Libertarian voters in swing states to vote for Clinton, he made it clear that he strongly opposes Donald Trump. 
“I see a big difference between the R candidate and the D candidate and I’ve been at some pains to say that I fear for the country if Mr. Trump should be elected,” Weld said. “It’s a candidacy without any parallel that I can recall. It’s content-free and very much given to stirring up envy and resentment and even hatred. 
Weld also said he believes Trump is “psychologically” unstable, a bully and incapable of “competently managing the office of the presidency.” 
The article points out that Weld’s criticism of Trump is in contrast to the “kind words” he had for Hillary. It also informs us that Libertarian presidential candidate. Gary Johnson, has criticized both mainstream candidates. 
Weld is not so even-handed. The article quotes him as saying that he knows Hillary well, has worked with her professionally and believes her to be a “person of high moral character.” 
He also said she is “reliable” and “an honest person.” He even predicted “chaos” if Trump were elected and said that the continued investigation into Hillary’s emails was just a distraction from more important issues. 
Just from the public record alone, Weld’s comments on Hillary don’t seem accurate. It seems fairly obvious that Hillary and Bill Clinton have presided over a “pay-to-play” program that funnels donations to the Clinton Foundation in return for political favors they are able to grant or initiate. 
Meanwhile, the Council on Foreign Relations is evidently America’s most prominent globalist think tank. Weld’s membership certainly implies that he supports a borderless world managed by a technocratic elite using monopoly central banking and global corporatism. 
Libertarianism certainly implies decentralized power and a lack of a guiding elite, which would seem to be the opposite of what the Council on Foreign Relations obviously endorses. 
Weld’s presence on the Libertarian ticket is surely more evidence of the meaninglessness of political parties in an era of increase internationalism and high-level homogeneity. 
Interestingly, while political parties have been neutered from the top down, Trump’s candidacy suggests that there is much different approach among voters who actually have to support these parties. 
Conclusion: Political leadership in modern Western societies usually also doesn’t change much, and Weld’s presence on the Libertarian ticket is testimony to that. However, the current contentiousness in both Britain and America indicate that a change is occurring, though it certainly won’t come from Weld or Hillary. It is not necessarily political change, as it is taking place on a personal level. But over time that will make it even more powerful.",0
23908,Campus Police May ARREST Students Wearing ‘Offensive’ Halloween Costumes,"Pinterest 
Students at Tufts University outside Boston are being told that if they wear Halloween costumes that anyone finds “offensive, they could get a visit from the police. 
Students in the school’s Greek system were told they could face “serious disciplinary sanctions” including an investigation by university police for wearing costumes that offend people or make people feel “threatened or unsafe,” The College Fix is reporting . 
In a letter to the presidents of all the school’s fraternities and sororities signed by council leaders, they seem to be cracking down on pretty much any costume at all that anyone, anywhere would find offensive. 
Greek Brothers and Sisters have worn costumes that appropriate cultures and reproduce stereotypes on race, gender, sexuality, immigrant or socioeconomic status. Outfits relating to tragedy, controversy, or acts of violence are also inappropriate. … It is our mission to promote spaces that allow members of the Tufts community to have fun without feeling as though any part of their identity is being misrepresented or targeted. 
It then goes a step further and warns of the “consequences for wearing an offensive costume: 
Mary Pat McMahon, the Dean of Student Affairs, described the consequences as follows: “The range of response for students whose actions make others in our community feel threatened or unsafe, or who direct conduct towards others that is offensive or discriminatory, includes [Office of Equal Opportunity] and/or [Tufts University Police Department] investigation and then disciplinary sanctions from our office that could run a wide gamut depending on what is brought to our attention and the impact of these actions on others. Any complaints will result in full investigation by University officials and could result in serious disciplinary sanctions through Judicial Affairs.” 
Of course, this kind of totalitarian behavior is only possible if fellow students tell on each other . And that’s exactly what they do. They encourage students to report someone wearing an “inappropriate or offensive” costume and provide a link to the school’s “ bias reporting form .” 
The letter was signed by the Inter Greek Council, Multicultural Greek Council, InterFraternity Council, and Panhellenic Council. It also reminds students to obtain consent before any sexual encounters during Halloween, citing a traditional increase in assaults during this time. 
School officials insist that the students themselves wrote the letter and that the school does not have an official policy about Halloween costumes: 
“The letter was written by students, for students, to encourage a thoughtful and considerate celebration of Halloween within our diverse and inclusive community and to stress the importance of alcohol safety and sexual consent,” campus Spokesman Patrick Collins said. “We commend the leaders of our Greek Life councils for proactively raising these important issues with their fellow participants in Greek Life and encouraging responsible behavior. As is the case at any time, students whose actions are discriminatory or threaten others can face a range of disciplinary sanctions. Depending on their seriousness, such actions, when called to our attention, can prompt investigations by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, the Office of Equal Opportunity or, in certain circumstances, the Tufts University Police Department.”",0

Today Dr. Duke talked about how the corrupt media controls the political system and manipulates our elections. He brought up the example of the polls, which can never really be random and are manipulated by selective sampling. These polling results then impact the selection of voters who don’t want to waste their vote on someone they feel has no chance of winning. 
He talked about his debate tonight, which will be live on C-SPAN. You can find the livestreaming information here. Dr. Slattery joined the show and spoke of the fact that even if Donald Trump becomes president, European Americans will not have a single voice representing their interests in Washington unless David Duke wins his race for the Senate.

23917,"Sheriff: Be Armed, Be Mentally Prepared, Make Terrorists Defend Their Lives for a Change - Breitbart","Florida’s Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey is urging   Americans to arm up, get familiar with their firearm, and be ready to make terrorists worry about defending their own lives, for a change. [Ivey made these comments in a video he posted to Facebook in reaction to the horrendous attacks on unarmed,   Londoners. Looking at terror attacks around the world, Ivey observed:  Terrorists and active shooters are using every weapon available to target citizens. Guns, knives, trucks, hammers, and even explosives have all become the weapon of choice for murderers who only have one goal —  killing innocent and   citizens. It seems that almost everyday we hear of another attack taking place at a concert, tourist destination, church, business, or anywhere else in the world where they can strike fear in the hearts of citizens. He urged Americans to take their safety seriously and to determine to be “the first line of defense” against a terror attack.  He stressed, “Let me be perfectly clear, doing nothing or just hoping it won’t happen to you is not going to save your life. ” Ivey mentioned that officials in other parts of the world are teaching citizens that the best thing they can do is “run, hide, tell,” and he rejects that paradigm, citing the fact that “this is war” and you win a war by fighting  —   not by running. He points out that “terrorists and active shooters know that our citizens have been coached to run and hide, and then patiently await help. ” He said attackers “count on” Americans to respond this way, then added, “What they don’t count on is being attacked themselves. ” Ivey says it is time to be prepared to counterattack to be armed and ready to make the terrorists fight to defend their own lives for a change, should they strike.  Ivey said: No matter who you are or what your position is on guns, there is no denying the fact that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun —  or a knife —  is an armed and   citizen or law enforcement officer. There is no doubt that as soon as 911 is called law enforcement is on the way, however, until they arrive it is up to you and those with you to neutralize or eliminate the threat.

23919,Saudi Arabia Warns Trump on Blocking Oil Imports: FT,"Kingdom’s energy minister says move would risk damaging the US economy. 2 Shares
1 0 0 1
Saudi Arabia has warned Donald Trump that the incoming US president will risk the health of his country’s economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports.
Over the course of the two-year American election process, Republican nominee Trump promised on the campaign trail to divest U.S. interests from “our foes and the oil cartels,” referring mainly to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which the KSA is the largest producer and de facto leader.
“At his heart President-elect Trump will see the benefits and I think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy,” Khalid al-Falih , chairman of Aramco and Saudi Aramco Oil Minister, told the Financial Times in Marrakesh, where world leader’s are currently negotiating the nuts and bolts of the landmark 2015 climate change agreement.
Saudi Arabia is the U.S.’ largest Middle Eastern oil supplier, though the North American country gets most of its energy from domestic and Canadian sources.
Al-Falih added that the free trade energy culture currently in place benefits the United States because it has created a refining industry and ignited a job-hungry shale revolution.
MORE... Setting the method to probe U.S.-Saudi wars How the occupied mentality syndrome works Will a 28 page Congressional Report on 9/11 unravel US foreign policy? The occupied mentality Syndrome “The U.S. is sort of the flag-bearer for capitalism and free markets,” according to Al-Falih. “The U.S. continues to be a very important part of a global industry that is interconnected, that is dealing with a fungible commodity which is crude oil. So having equalization through free trade is very healthy for oil.”
During Presidential race Donald Trump had blamed Saudi Arabia for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and in March, the real estate magnate said he would consider stopping US oil purchases from Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies unless the Saudi government provided ground troops to fight ISIS.
NY Daily News revealed Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $4.5 million in June 2001, according to a city Finance Department spokeswoman. In 2008, the apartments became part of the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, records show.
The reports emerged back then revealed the reality of Trump's relations with the Riyadh regime; but Mr Trump has not always expressed a positive view of the Middle Eastern country.",0
23923,Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation,"By wmw_admin on October 31, 2016 Ed Klein — DailyMail.com Oct 30, 2016 
New York Times bestselling author Ed Klein has just published his fourth book about the Clintons since 2005, Guilty as Sin. 
Klein had told how Bill Clinton enjoyed foot rubs, massages and romps in his presidential library with female interns and has described new details about Hillary’s medical crises. Guilty as Sin is available in bookstores and for order from Amazon. 
James Comey’s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI, including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. 
‘The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn’t recommend an indictment against Hillary,’ said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. 
‘Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,’ said the source. ‘They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.’ 
According to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. 
He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom 
‘He’s been ignoring the resignation letters in the hope that he could find a way of remedying the situation,’ said the source. 
‘When new emails that appeared to be related to Hillary’s personal email server turned up in a computer used [her close aide] Huma Abedin and [Abedin’s disgraced husband,] Anthony Weiner, Comey jumped at the excuse to reopen the investigation. 
‘The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,’ the source continued. ‘And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. 
‘He talks about the damage that he’s done to himself and the institution [of the FBI], and how he’s been shunned by the men and women who he admires and work for him. It’s taken a tremendous toll on him. 
‘It shattered his ego. He looks like he’s aged 10 years in the past four months.’ 
But Comey’s decision to reopen the case was more than an effort to heal the wound he inflicted on the FBI. 
He was also worried that after the presidential election, Republicans in Congress would mount a probe of how he had granted Hillary political favoritism. 
His announcement about the revived investigation, which came just 11 days before the presidential election, was greeted with shock and dismay by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the prosecutors at the Justice Department. 
‘Jim told me that Lynch and Obama are furious with him,’ the source said. 
As I revealed in my latest New York Times bestseller Guilty As Sin Obama said that appointing Comey as FBI direct was ‘my worst mistake as president.’ 
‘Lynch and Obama haven’t contacted Jim directly,’ said the source, ‘but they’ve made it crystal clear through third parties that they disapprove of his effort to save face.’",0

Archaeologists have long believed this ‘dead zone’ holds of a perfectly preserved graveyard of shipwrecks. Now, a mapping expedition has proved them right, after accidentally uncovering more than 40 ancient shipwrecks from the Ottoman and Byzantine periods. More than 40 shipwrecks have been discovered from the Ottoman and Byzantine periods, many of which provide the first views of ship types known from historical sources. Pictured is a shipwreck from the Ottoman period The expedition has been scouring the waters 5,900ft (1,800 metres) below the surface of the Black Sea using an off-shore vessel equipped with some of the most advanced underwater equipment in the world. The vessel is on an expedition mapping submerged ancient landscapes which were inundated with water following the last Ice Age. The project, known Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (Black Sea MAP), involves an international team led by the University of Southampton’s Centre for Maritime Archaeology. Professor Jon Adams, the principle investigator on the project, said: ‘We’re endeavouring to answer some hotly-debated questions about when the water level rose, how rapidly it did so and what effects it had on human populations living along this stretch of the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea. ‘The primary focus of this project is to carry out geophysical surveys to detect former land surfaces buried below the current seabed, take core samples and characterise and date them, and create a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Black Sea prehistory.’ The vessel is based on board the Stril Explorer and carries some of the most advanced underwater survey systems in the world. The researchers are using two Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to survey the seabed. One is optimised for high-resolution 3D photography, while the other, called Surveyor Interceptor, ‘flies’ at four times the speed of conventional ROVs and carries an entire suite of geophysical instrumentation, as well as lights, high-definition cameras and a laser scanner.",0

It is a rare day indeed that members of the party aren’t acting in a nakedly political, self-interested manner, but the announcement last Friday that the FBI is reopening the probe into the Clinton email scandal has them in overdrive. 
Take DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile … please! She has been tweeting out a steady stream of condemnations of FBI Director James Comey ever since his letter of intent to relaunch their investigation into potential wrongdoing arrived in the hands of Congress.

Simply pathetic to watch members of Congress grill Director Comey because he's not playing their game of gotcha. #Overreach

The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.”

23928,Canada’s Immigration Crisis: Too Many American Leftists?,"Posted on October 26, 2016 by GrinNBarrett 
International Liberty – by Dan Mitchell 
This arrived in my inbox today. A quick search on the Internet reveals it is not a real article from a Canadian paper. But it is somewhat amusing, so enjoy. 
“Build a Damn Fence!” From The Manitoba Herald , Canada ; by Clive Runnels, December 1st 2010 
The flood of American liberals sneaking across the border into Canada has intensified in the past week, sparking calls for increased patrols to stop the illegal immigration. The recent actions of the Tea Party are prompting an exodus among left-leaning citizens who fear they’ll soon be required to hunt, pray, and to agree with Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck. 
Canadian border farmers say it’s not uncommon to see dozens of sociology professors, animal-rights activists and Unitarians crossing their fields at night. “I went out to milk the cows the other day, and there was a Hollywood producer huddled in the barn,” said Manitoba farmer Red Greenfield , whose acreage borders North Dakota . The producer was cold, exhausted and hungry. He asked me if I could spare a latte and some free-range chicken. When I said I didn’t have any, he left before I even got a chance to show him my screenplay, eh?” 
In an effort to stop the illegal aliens, Greenfield erected higher fences, but the liberals scaled them. He then installed loudspeakers that blared Rush Limbaugh across the fields. “Not real effective,” he said. “The liberals still got through and Rush annoyed the cows so much that they wouldn’t give any milk.” 
Officials are particularly concerned about smugglers who meet liberals near the Canadian border, pack them into Volvo station wagons and drive them across the border where they are simply left to fend for themselves.” A lot of these people are not prepared for our rugged conditions,” an Ontario border patrolman said. “I found one carload without a single bottle of imported drinking water. They did have a nice little Napa Valley Cabernet, though.” 
When liberals are caught, they’re sent back across the border, often wailing loudly that they fear retribution from conservatives. Rumors have been circulating about plans being made to build re-education camps where liberals will be forced to drink domestic beer and watch NASCAR races. 
In recent days, liberals have turned to ingenious ways of crossing the border. Some have been disguised as senior citizens taking a bus trip to buy cheap Canadian prescription drugs. After catching a half-dozen young vegans in powdered wig disguises, Canadian immigration authorities began stopping buses and quizzing the supposed senior citizens about Perry Como and Rosemary Clooney to prove that they were alive in the ’50s. “If they can’t identify the accordion player on The Lawrence Welk Show, we become very suspicious about their age.” an official said. 
Canadian citizens have complained that the illegal immigrants are creating an organic-broccoli shortage and are renting all the Michael Moore movies “I really feel sorry for American liberals, but the Canadian economy just can’t support them.” an Ottawa resident said. “How many art-history majors does one country need?”",0

23934,Corey Lewandowski Continues to Be Paid by Donald Trump’s Campaign - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump paid his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski $20, 000 in August for “strategy consulting,” two months after Mr. Lewandowski left the team and was hired by CNN as a commentator. The payment, revealed in Federal Election Commission filings on Tuesday, was the second monthly consulting fee paid to Mr. Lewandowski through his consulting company since he left the Trump campaign and joined CNN, raising questions about whether the network in effect has a Trump campaign strategist on its payroll. Mr. Lewandowski still speaks with Mr. Trump regularly. Reached by phone, Mr. Lewandowski said he could not comment because of his contractual obligations with CNN. But Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said that the payments were actually severance payments owed to Mr. Lewandowski under his old contract with Mr. Trump’s campaign. “Corey Lewandowski, who is no longer involved in the campaign, continues to receive monthly severance payments,” Mr. Cheung said. “The campaign will continue to honor its contract with Mr. Lewandowski, which stipulates he will be paid through the end of the year. These payments are in no way compensation for services rendered. ” But on F. E. C. paperwork, the campaign listed both the August and July payments as “strategy consulting. ” Mr. Cheung did not respond to a   email about why the payments were not described to the F. E. C. as severance. In July, when Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor, took over as interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, the network suspended her contract. Barbara Levin, a CNN spokeswoman, likewise said that the payments were severance and were disclosed to viewers whenever Mr. Lewandowski appeared. “We disclose the severance payment publicly each time he is on our air,” Ms. Levin said.",0
23937,Hubble has just spotted mysterious ‘plasma balls’ of unknown origin,"Using the Hubble space telescope, NASA has detected massive flaming spheres traveling at a speed of 580 thousand kilometers per hour. These monstrous balls of melted plasma are located at a distance of 1200 light years from Earth. Their origin is unclear.
Given the speed at which they travel, they could get from the Earth to the Moon in just half an hour. The researchers, who have observed stars in extinction with the telescope since 1990, found that these giant balls have a size twice that of Mars and a temperature much higher than that of the sun. Hypothetically, they would have fed off the star V Hydrae which experts have studied for eight years.
Even though this is an exceptional finding, experts have failed to uncover the origin of these mysterious fiery missiles, although they have proposed a theory suggesting that the massive fiery balls were expelled by stars revolving in the orbit of the huge red star and are part of a stellar rain that occurs every eight and a half years.
A death of a star Could V Hydrae be the responsible culprit? According to experts, V Hydrae is a bloated red giant that is dying. V Hydrae has already shed half its mass into space in its final death throes and is nos discharging the residual nuclear fuel as it burns out – hardly a probable origin of super-hot, giant blobs of charged gas.
“The current best explanation suggests the plasma balls were launched by an unseen companion star,” NASA said in a statement.
“According to this theory, the companion would have to be in an elliptical orbit that carries it close to the red giant’s puffed-up atmosphere every 8.5 years. As the companion enters the bloated star’s outer atmosphere, it gobbles up material. This material then settles into a disk around the companion, and serves as the launching pad for blobs of plasma, which travel at roughly a half-million miles per hour.”
Massive strings of super hot blobs “We suggest that these gaseous blobs produced during this late phase of a star’s life help make the structures seen in planetary nebulae,” Raghvendra Sahai, an astronomer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and lead author of a study on the cosmic cannonball, said in the statement. “We knew this object had a high-speed outflow from previous data, but this is the first time we are seeing this process in action.”
According to IBT , between 2002 and 2004, and from 2011 to 2013, researchers led by Raghvendra Sahai utilized Hubble’s imaging spectrograph in order to perform observations of V Hydrae and the regions surrounding it. They discovered supermassive strings of super hot blobs, each with a temperature superior to 17,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
“The observations show the blobs moving over time,” Sahai said. “The data show blobs that have just been ejected, blobs that have moved a little farther away, and blobs that are even farther away.”

23942,Taxpayers Foot $1M Bill to Clean Up Dakota Pipeline Protest Area - Breitbart,"The U. S. Army Corps will spend more than $1 million to clean up the mess left behind by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others opposed to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. The protesters  —   who succeeded in temporarily shutting down pipeline construction under orders from President Barack Obama  —   were evicted after President Donald Trump put the pipeline project back online. [“The corps’ contract with a   company to provide trash removal and environmental cleanup includes the main Oceti Sakowin camp on the north side of the Cannonball River and the smaller Rosebud camp on the south side,” the Bismarck Tribune reported on Friday. “Both are on corps’  property. ”  Despite efforts by the tribe to clean up the protest sites, the land was littered with garbage, and even cars and motor homes had to be removed. “About 240 rollout dumpsters have been hauled out, each brimming with debris of old food stores, structures, tents, building materials and personal belongings, much of it buried under winter blizzards or simply left behind,” the Tribune reported. “Officials are estimating it will require another equal number of loads to get the job done. ” The article said special consideration would be given to some items, such as teepees, that could have cultural significance and toxic materials. Logan Thompson, owner of Prairie View equipment contractor, said his company got instructions on handling human waste and waste compost from health officials. In January, Stand Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II spoke out about the clean up after the protest, which was staged because the tribe and others believed a pipeline spill could contaminate the Missouri River and a reservoir, the Tribune reported. “Because of this risk of flood, we’re worried about what’s going to be left at the camp,” Archambault said. “What we want to do is make sure none of that waste gets into the Missouri River .  …     We’re water protectors, but we’re the ones that are going to start contaminating the water. ” “The Dakota Access Pipeline is a   underground state of the art 30” pipeline extending from the   Forks production area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois,” according to Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the project. “The pipeline will transport   light, sweet crude oil from North Dakota to major refining markets. ” Other facts about the pipeline include:",0

Public Dumping Stocks From Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader: “ U.S. equity funds got punched again. There was a huge outflow from domestic funds that focus on stocks, the 5th-largest since 2007. Total fund assets have grown over that time, but even if we express the outflow as a % of total assets, it was large. There is a temptation to automatically consider such an outflow to be a contrary indicator (and bullish for stocks) but the history of other large weekly outflows has been mixed… IMPORTANT: To find out which company the richest man in China has invested in, one that Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest investment opportunities in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
Huge outflow from mutual funds…again Weekly outflow the largest in years, but not as extreme as % of assets, and not necessarily a good contrary indicator 
A popular topic on Wednesday was a shockingly large outflow from equity funds in the latest reporting period by the Investment Company Institute. The association estimated that U.S.-based mutual funds lost $16.3 billion in the week ended October 19. That’s the fifth-largest weekly outflow in nearly 10 years (see stunning chart below). 
… There is a strong tendency to be a knee-jerk contrarian, see that headline number of a $16 billion outflow, and automatically conclude that investors have panicked and it’s time to buy stocks. 
An immediate concern for the knee-jerk conclusion is that the last time we saw such a large outflow as in November 2015, immediately leading to a large correction in the market. Since 2011, the six occurrences led to a positive return a month later only two times, despite the persistent uptrend in stocks. Large outflows during the 2008 bear market proved to be terrible contrary indicators as well.”

Jatras said the US had spent millions of dollars and thousands of man hours to train so-called “moderate militants” in Syria – only for most of them to join al-Qaeda or Islamic State terrorist groups. 
The former Washington diplomat rejected the idea that there are some “moderate militants” in Syria, declaring that they are all terrorists. 
“ People who for ideological or religious goals want to attack innocent people and kill them in order to impose some kind of an ideology on them, I think that constitutes terrorism, ” he said. 
“ And I think trying to overthrow a government of another country to achieve that purpose is terrorism, ” Jatras added. 
However Jihad Mouracadeh, a political analyst from Beirut, ruled out the accusation that the US and its allies want to redeploy Daesh from Mosul into Raqqah, according to regional reports. Recommended (3 months ago) Assange: Emails Prove Hillary Armed ISIS In Syria To Oust Assad 
Mouracadeh said the US and NATO are planning to attack the Syrian city; “ says so, it seems to be illogical to redeploy Daesh to a city that is going to be under attack. “ 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups. 
The foreign-backed militancy has left millions of people homeless. According to a UN report more than 400,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict.",0

Partial transcript as follows: STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, we’re going to talk about the Democrats. How about that last point, Mr. Speaker, from Matthew Dowd? That was one of the things that I had noticed as well. You start out high here. You don’t tend to find things that make you do higher. NEWT GINGRICH, FMR. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: You guys all collectively lived through Trump knocking off the Republicans, Trump knocking off Hillary, being wrong about all of it at every stage. And you turn around and play the same old conventional wisdom. Donald Trump is the most divisive president since Abraham Lincoln. He represents an alternative world so that’s why you have riots at places like Berkeley, he  —   you have two parallel universes here. There’s actually a very funny Megyn Kelly interview I did two weeks before the election, she’s giving me all this polling data. And I said, look, there are two universes. Now if your universe is right, Hillary Clinton’s president. If our universe is right, Donald Trump is president. STEPHANOPOULOS: I completely take that point. That’s how he’s being seen out in the country, in parts of the country right now. But how does it affect the governing? Can you govern effectively  —   with 40 percent? GINGRICH: Sure. Well, first of all, as you know, because you’ve done it, presidents are really powerful. Presidents who are willful and   and focused have enormous capability to move the system. But second, I have a very simple test. Reagan in his farewell address said I am so proud that together we created 19 million jobs. If Trump has the economy rolling in 2020, he’ll get  .

23957,GRAPHIC: Mexican Cartel Spreads ISIS-Like Beheading Video to Gain Border Turf near Texas,"  is thriving near Texas as one of the Mexican cartels controlling the U. S.  Border is resorting to   beheading videos to intimidate rivals and to scare the civilian population into complete compliance. The cartel, Los Zetas, is fighting for control of lucrative border drug and illegal immigration corridors into Texas. Breitbart Texas obtained exclusive video of Los Zetas’   which can be viewed  in full on LiveLeak. [A video that was leaked to Breitbart Texas by our sources in Mexico this week shows the moment when two gunmen wearing masks stand behind a shirtless man and begin to interrogate him. The gunmen claim to be members of the Los Zetas and fire off a series of threats against other Los Zetas factions including Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) Vieja Escuela Z, and others. You can see the entire video in the   LiveLeak Channel warning —  the content is extremely graphic in nature.  Roughly an hour after publication, LiveLeak removed the video despite having served as a reliable platform for those wishing to share graphic content strictly for   purposes. Should any law enforcement or other officials wish to review the footage, feel free to contact Breitbart Texas. In the video, the shirtless male kneels as he is interrogated. The victim says he is David Mandujano Montoya and had been sent to Ciudad Victoria to carry out crimes in order to spark fear.  Mandujano said he worked for Pancho Carreon, one of the leaders of the Vieja Escuela Z in the southern part of Tamaulipas. His group would receive help from the Gulf Cartel, Carteles Unidos, and others.  “This is a message from all of the Zetas in Ciudad Victoria,” one of the gunmen yells out. “To enter Tamaulipas and especially Ciudad Victoria, you need permission. ” The gunman further taunts Pancho Carreon, telling him to stop sending more people or they would meet a similar fate. The gunman claims that they do not tolerate extortion or kidnapping and those who do that are not Zetas. “Victoria is Zeta territory, without CDG, CDN and other cartels,” the gunman says in the video as he asks the citizens to report on anyone who is carrying out kidnappings and extortions.  Immediately after, the second gunman pulls out a large silver meat cleaver and begins to cut the victim’s throat.  Soon after, the victim falls forward and the gunman uses the cleaver to hack away at his head. Once the gunmen sever the head, they place it on top of the victim’s back to begin removing the hands.  Brief, graphic footage of a second decapitation acquired at the same time by Breitbart Texas has been appended to the end of the video. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, Ciudad Victoria is one of the main battlefronts for a fierce turf war between various Los Zetas factions. Initially, the groups known as Vieja Escuela Z and Grupo Bravo had been fighting with the faction going by the name “Cartel Del Noreste” or CDN. Since then, Grupo Bravo and Vieja Escuela Z have severed ties —  waging a   war. The constant fighting has resulted in almost daily kidnappings, executions,   shootings, and  .  Authorities have not commented on the contents of the videos, nor if they have located the bodies of the victims. Mexican law enforcement officials consulted by Breitbart Texas claim the gunmen in the video are likely members of the Grupo Bravo who are trying to   their organization amid the shifting alliances and betrayals. The members of Grupo Bravo appear to have laid claim to Ciudad Victoria. Time will tell if the violence relent. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

23960,VIDEO: U.S. Diplomat Shot in Mexico,"GUADALAJARA, Jalisco  —   A U. S. diplomat was shot in this city when he was leaving a shopping center in a failed murder attempt. The suspected gunman was able to ran away after the attack. Police later apprehended the shooter. [UPDATE, Jan. 8, 12:00 CST: Mexican Investigators with Jalisco’s Attorney General’s Office, have confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the suspected shooter has been identified as a    man from India who then became a naturalized U. S. citizen.   The suspected shooter, Zafar Zia, was arrested by Mexican authorities as part of the investigation into the attack. At the time of the arrest, authorities seized a . 38 caliber handgun, an automobile with California license plates and a wig that is believed to have been used at the time of the attempted murder. According to authorities, Zia had moved to Guadalajara in November 2016 from Phoenix and had been residing in the city since. The apparent motive for the attempted murder appears to have been a disagreement over an undisclosed visa process.  Authorities in this state have identified the shooting victim as Christopher Ashcraft, a consular agent with the U. S. Consulate in Guadalajara, Jalisco.  A security video obtained by Breitbart Texas shows the moment when Ashcraft walks to a booth to pay for parking in the shopping center. The consular agent carryied a gym bag and was dressed in a manner that led authorities to believe that he was leaving a local gym inside the shopping center. The video shows a man wearing dark blue shirt and pants similar to a nurse’s Authorities following Ashcraft.  A second video shows the man in blue walking in circles as he awaits for Ashcraft’s vehicle. When the consular agent arrives at the exit of the parking lot, the gunman pulls a handgun from his pants pocket and fires a single shot at the consular agents vehicle before running away.  Authorities revealed to Breitbart Texas that the gunman had been using a hat or a wig, mustache, glasses and gloves during various stages of the crime  —   such as when he followed Ashcroft, during the shooting, and when he fled the scene.  The diplomat was left bleeding inside his compact vehicle until medical personnel arrived. An ambulance transported him to a local hospital. Ashcraft’s vehicle had consular license plates BCC0911 from Mexico’s Foreign Relations Secretariat.  Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigations arrived at the shopping center to go over the crime scene and take copies of the surveillance videos. A second team of agents rushed to the San Javier Hospital where Ashcraft was undergoing emergency surgery. Medical personnel confirmed that the consular agent was shot in his right midsection.  For security reasons, Ashcraft will be sent back to the U. S. while authorities continue to look into the failed assassination attempt. The consular agent served in the Guadalajara Consulate since March 2016. Authorities announced a $20, 000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gunman and any accomplices.  On Friday morning, officials with the Jalisco Attorney General’s Office confirmed to Breitbart Texas that the suspected gunman had been arrested. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

23963,UNESCO passes anti-Israel resolution despite Tel Aviv brickbats,"Press TV 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. 
UNESCO’s 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday’s secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris. 
Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. 
The resolution expresses UNESCO’s deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. 
Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
“Through an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem,” Erekat said. 
He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges “respecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.” 
Earlier this month, UNESCO’s 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. 
Wednesday’s vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regime’s ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel Shama-Hacohen, had been recalled for consultations. 
“We will decide what the next steps will be,” Netanyahu said in a statement. 
Elias Sanbar, Palestine’s UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were “politicizing religion and this is very dangerous.” 
Makram Mustafa Queisi, Jordan’s ambassador to UNESCO, also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a “technical point of view” while many parties were politicizing it. Palestinian Ambassador to UNESCO Elias Sanbar (L) and Jordanian envoy Makram Mustafa Queisi address the media after an anti-Israel resolution was passed by secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris, France, October 26, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Palestine became the 195th full member of UNESCO in October 2011, triggering a cut in Tel Aviv’s funding to the agency. 
The occupied territories have already been the scene of increased tensions ever since the Israeli regime imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015. 
More than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of last October.",0
23965,To Wear Makeup or Not to Wear Makeup? - The New York Times," The question is surprisingly fraught, but the answer is simple. Recently, Buzzfeed compiled examples of men on Reddit and Twitter who had shared photos of women they found beautiful, seemingly amazed by their own enlightened taste: The women, celebrities like Rihanna, Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone, were, they believed, not wearing makeup. “Kylie Jenner looks so much better without makeup to me idk why. Im prob just weird,” one man bravely tweeted. In fact, these women were wearing makeup in one particularly egregious instance, a photo had been taken from a magazine editorial featuring a natural makeup look, with products listed. The men had confused makeup that does not announce itself with makeup that does not exist. And who can blame them? “Natural beauty” has become less about lack of effort than about successfully hiding effort altogether. After a punishing night, when I use a   brush to apply Clé de Peau Beauté concealer to my   lower lashline, I am trying to fake wakefulness I cannot fault a man who would, taking my illusion at face value, rush to celebrate his own wokefulness. In light of this, it’s not surprising that it became news earlier this year when the singer Alicia Keys declared she would abstain from makeup, declining to wear it even at public events or on television. In an essay about her decision for the online magazine Lenny, she wrote of realizing that she had written “a lot of songs about masks filled with metaphors about hiding. ” After years of feeling like she needed to wear makeup to perform, both as a singer and as a woman in the world, it struck her that this preparing for the public eye was only magnifying the effect of its scrutiny. The #nomakeup movement soon took off, with other celebrities and women’s magazines jumping on the bandwagon. (“Mila Without Makeup” boasted Glamour’s August cover.) At first glance, Alicia Keys, Mila Kunis or Gwyneth Paltrow  —   women whose visages we’ve come to know intimately in their   form  —   look a bit naked and exposed without it, as though a veil has been lifted, revealing something private and raw. But to examine them more closely is simply to get reacquainted with the features of the human face: its shapes and curvatures gradations of light and color freckles eyelashes. It would be easy to deem a   Alicia Keys “honest,” or “real,” or even radical, but that would be missing the point: More than anything, she looks exceptionally relaxed and open, completely at ease in her own skin. She is radiant with serenity, like a person on vacation who really knows how to let go. The message she broadcasts is that comfort is the root of confidence, and not the other way around. This is true whether a person is wearing makeup or not. Of course, Keys’s kind of comfort requires its own sort of discipline. On the beauty website Into the Gloss, her makeup artist described the many rituals and products that go into her new look: acupuncture, exercise, a healthy diet. Facials, lip treatments, sprays and oils. I began to wear a full face of makeup in middle school, as a gesture of defeat, attempting to obscure hormonal breakouts, asymmetrical features, eyebrows that were too bushy and lips that were too big. As I got older, I spent less time searching for pigmented powders to cover my face, and more time searching for concoctions to strengthen or improve it. I didn’t so much want to look better as I wanted to be better. I bought serums with the consistency of liquefied amber, thick white creams expelled from pump bottles with such force that they seemed impatient to get to work, masks made from insect secretions. The irony, naturally, is that clean, clear skin is the ideal base for makeup.",0
23970,Clinton’s Email Narrative Just Fell Apart,"Posted on November 3, 2016 by WashingtonsBlog 
Clinton and her supporters have tried to blame Russia for hacking her emails and making them a focus in this election. 
In reality, it’s likely that American intelligence and defense workers are the source for at least some of the leaks. 
The Guardian reports today: 
Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. 
*** 
The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is “the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,” and that “ the reason why they’re leaking is they’re pro-Trump.” 
*** 
The leaks have not exclusively cast aspersions on Clinton. Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, is the subject of what is said to be a preliminary FBI inquiry into his business dealings in Russia. Manafort has denied any wrongdoing. 
Moreover, Clinton supporters have claimed that the emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop are only duplicates of emails the FBI has previously seen. 
However, CBS News reports : 
The FBI has found emails related to Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state on the laptop belonging to the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, according to a U.S. official. 
These emails, CBS News’ Andres Triay reports, are not duplicates of emails found on Secretary Clinton’s private server.

23972,Study Confirms Network Evening Newscasts Have Abandoned Policy Coverage For 2016 Campaign,"License DMCA 
Walking away from a long-standing tradition of covering issues and presidential policies during campaign season, the network evening newscasts have all but abandoned that type of reporting this year, according to recent tabulations from Tyndall Report, which for decades has tracked the flagship nightly news programs. 
Since the beginning of 2016, ABC's World News Tonight , CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News have devoted just 32 minutes to issues coverage, according to Andrew Tyndall. 
Differentiating issues coverage from daily campaign coverage where policy topics might be addressed, Tyndall defines issues coverage by a newscast this way: ""It takes a public policy, outlines the societal problem that needs to be addressed, describes the candidates' platform positions and proposed solutions, and evaluates their efficacy."" 
And here's how that kind of in-depth coverage breaks down, year to date, by network: 
ABC: 8 minutes, all of which covered terrorism. - Advertisement - 
NBC: 8 minutes for terrorism, LBGT issues, and foreign policy. 
CBS: 16 minutes for foreign policy, terrorism, immigration, policing, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
And this remarkable finding from Tyndall [emphasis added]: 
""No trade, no healthcare, no climate change, no drugs, no poverty, no guns, no infrastructure, no deficits. To the extent that these issues have been mentioned, it has been on the candidates' terms, not on the networks' initiative."" 
These numbers are staggering in terms of the complete retreat they represent from issues-orientated campaign coverage. Just eight years ago, the last time both parties nominated new candidates for the White House, the network newscasts devoted 220 minutes to issues coverage, compared to only 32 minutes so far this year. ( CBS Evening News went from 119 minutes of issues coverage in 2008 to 16 this year.) - Advertisement - 
Note that during the Republican primary season alone, the networks spent 333 minutes focusing on Donald Trump. Yet for all of 2016, they have set aside just one-tenth of that for issue reporting. 
And look at this: Combined, the three network newscasts have slotted 100 minutes so far this year for reporting on Hillary Clinton's emails while she served as secretary of state, but just 32 minutes for all issues coverage . (NBC's Nightly News has spent 31 minutes on the emails this year; just eight minutes on issues.) 
Indeed, this approach used to be a hallmark of presidential campaign reporting; outline what candidates stand for, describe what their presidency might look like, and compare and contrast that platform with his or her opponents. i.e., What would the new president's top priorities be on the first day of his or her new administration? 
It seems clear that the media's abandonment of issues coverage benefits Trump since his campaign has done very little to outline the candidate's core beliefs. Clinton, by contrast, has done the opposite.",0

23979,California Lt. Gov: We’ll Stop Trump’s Wall with Environmental Suits,"  Donald Trump’s plan to build a border wall along with U. S.  Border will be challenged through environmental lawsuits, according to California’s   official. [California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an interview with ‘The Golden State Podcast’ that he would use specific environmental laws in the state to stop the border wall from being built, at least in southern California.  “There’s something called CEQA in California —  NEPA at the federal level,” Newsom told the podcast host. “There’s indigenous lands and autonomies relating to governance on those lands. There are all kinds of obstructions as it relates to just getting zoning approval and getting building permits. All those things could be made very, very challenging for the administration. ” Newsom hinted that if he could not actually stop the construction of the border wall in California, he would at least try to tie it up in bureaucratic battles. Trump’s border wall is reportedly in the works, as he explained at a press conference at Trump Tower today that he would not be waiting on payment from Mexico and begin construction immediately. “I could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get into office,” Trump said as Breitbart News reported earlier. “But I don’t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin. ” “I don’t feel like waiting a year or year and a half. We’re going to start building,” Trump continued. “Mexico, in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us. And they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall,” Trump said. “That will happen, whether it’s a tax or whether it’s a payment. Probably less likely that it’s a payment. But it will happen. ” John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.",0
23983,North Korea Says Diplomat Who Defected Is ‘Human Scum’ - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   North Korea said on Saturday that a diplomat in its London embassy who recently defected to South Korea had fled rather than face punishment for various crimes, calling him “human scum. ” The statement, from the official Korean Central News Agency, was North Korea’s first reaction to the defection of Thae   its most senior official to defect in almost two decades. The defection of Mr. Thae, who was the No. 2 diplomat in the embassy, was announced by South Korea on Wednesday. The North Korean statement said Mr. Thae, whom it did not identify by name, had been ordered in June to return from Britain to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, because he had embezzled state funds, sold official secrets and sexually assaulted a minor. The statement offered no evidence for those accusations. Rather than return home, the statement said, Mr. Thae “proved himself to be human scum who betrayed the fatherland” by fleeing. It said that North Korea had informed the British government of the accusations against Mr. Thae and asked that he be handed over to North Korean officials, but that London had instead created an “indelible stain” in relations between the countries by letting him go to South Korea, to be used in a “smear campaign” against the North. South Korea has not explained how or when Mr. Thae made his way to the country with his wife and children, and the North Korean statement suggested that he had been in British custody beforehand. There was no immediate response from the British or South Korean government. North Korea has typically referred to its defectors as “scum” or “traitors,” often accusing South Korea’s intelligence agency of kidnapping them. On Friday, Jeong   a South Korean government spokesman, said he expected the North to react similarly to Mr. Thae’s defection. Doing otherwise “would be tantamount to admitting to the inferiority of its own regime,” he said. The South has said that Mr. Thae defected out of disillusionment with the North Korean government, and that his decision to flee was a sign that such sentiments were spreading among the North Korean elite.",0
23984,Mattis: U.S. ’Not in a Position’ to Work with Russia,"The United States military is “not in a position” at the moment to “collaborate” with their Russian counterparts, U. S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. [During the press conference Thursday, a reporter asked the secretary, “What does Russia need to stop doing in order for the U. S. to work with it?”  President Donald Trump’s Pentagon chief responded: We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward where Russia, living up to its commitments, will return to a partnership of sorts here with NATO. But Russia is going to have to prove itself first and live up the commitments they have made in the   agreement. Secretary Mattis also noted that “there’s very little doubt” that Russia has “either interfered or they have attempted to interfere in a number of elections” in the United States and other democracies. During his confirmation hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee in January, retired Gen. Mattis described Russia as one of the “principal threats” facing the United States. Nevertheless, he indicated that he supports U. S. engagement with the Kremlin. Mattis told lawmakers: When we identify other areas where we cannot cooperate, we must confront Russia’s behavior and defend ourselves if Russia chooses to act contrary to our interests. Challenges posed by Russia include alarming messages from Moscow regarding the use of nuclear weapons, treaty violations, the use of hybrid warfare tactics to destabilize other countries, and involvement in hacking and information warfare. Buttressing NATO will be fundamental to meeting these challenges, and we will need an integrated strategy that strengthens the North Atlantic Alliance and ensures that the Department of Defense is prepared to counter both traditional and emerging threats. During the press conference in Brussels, the secretary emphasized the need to negotiate with Russia “from a position of strength. ” He also accused Russia of violating international law with its “aggressive” and “destabilizing” actions. “The point about Russia is they have to live by international law just like we expect all mature nations on this planet to do,” Mattis told reporters. “We thoroughly discussed the increased threats facing our alliance,” added the U. S. secretary of defense, referring to America’s NATO partners. “And unified by the threats to our democracies, I found strong alliance resolve to address these growing threats.  Russia’s aggressive actions have violated international law and are destabilizing. ” Before the press conference at the NATO headquarters in Brussels Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the United States to restore communications between their respective intelligence services, adding that ”all relevantgovernments and international groups should work together. ” Echoing comments made during his confirmation hearing, Secretary Mattis described NATO on Thursday as a “fundamental bedrock for the US and all the transatlantic community,” but stressed that member states must share the fiscal burden of common defense.",0

23987,Morrissey Declares Brexit “Magnificent” Win For British Democracy,"  Sean Adl-Tabatabai in News , UK // 0 Comments 
Outspoken singer Morrissey recently declared that Brexit was a “magnificent” result for British democracy and a slap in the face for the New World Order. 
Speaking with Australian magazine Faster Louder , Morrissey said: 
“ As for Brexit, the result was magnificent, but it is not accepted by the BBC or Sky News because they object to a public that cannot be hypnotised by BBC or Sky nonsense. 
These news teams are exactly the same as Fox and CNN in that they all depend on public stupidity in order to create their own myth of reality. Watch them at your peril! “ 
Thequietus.com reports: 
“The British political class has never quite been so hopeless, but the same can be said for the USA.” 
Railing against “media”, he continues: “As for Brexit, the result was magnificent, but it is not accepted by the BBC or Sky News because they object to a public that cannot be hypnotised by BBC or Sky nonsense. 
These news teams are exactly the same as Fox and CNN in that they all depend on public stupidity in order to create their own myth of reality. Watch them at your peril!” 
In the interview he also implies that he and The Smiths should have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame before now, while he describes the ongoing commitment to keeping venues he plays gigs at meat-free “liberating” rather than “tiring”.",0

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/angelina-jolie-exposes-hollywood.html A stunning video has surfaced in which a 23-year-old Angelina Jolie reveals the true inner workings of Hollywood as she describes her experiences participating in Satanic S&M rituals to close friends. In 1999 an anonymous source secretly filmed Angelina Jolie, then aged 23, speaking to two close friends about the initiation rituals she had recently taken part in while attempting to establish herself in Hollywood. In the following video (below), Angelina describes in detail the gruesome ritual celebrities must go through. During the ritual you are tied up, raped, and tortured by other members. She compares the secret society rituals to S&M, but claims there are differences.At times Angelina looks crazed and possessed while describing to her friends the experiences she had with the Satanic secret society. She explains that she killed a snake as a sacrifice and was tattooed as part of the initiation ritual. It is well known that many members of various Secret Societies get tattoos as part of the ceremony, as a way of sacrificing more blood to Satan. “My snake, I tried, I had to kill him,” Jolie said. It has long been claimed that Hollywood stars and other celebrities need to join the Luciferian secret society in order to establish their career in the cutthroat business and make it to the top, and in the secrets filmed video Angelina can be heard telling her friends that she has encouraged other celebrities to go through the initiation and join the secret society. Shocking Expose: I Was in the Illuminati I’m Going to Tell You Everything The tape also reveals that Jolie showed a recording of a ritual to one of her friends. Her friend, speaking in halting tones, describes viewing the footage, saying: “I only saw that film that she [Angelina] bought over that night. People who are, like, darker… It’s great to be able to see everybody’s sexuality, but it’s so weird when you just… I have the most amazing compromising pictures of people.“ The video has now been posted online, with the identity of her two friends redacted for their safety.

23998,Hillary Clinton Reportedly Launching PAC as ’Quiet Catalyst’ for Her Pet Causes - Breitbart,"Hillary Clinton is reportedly in the process of launching a PAC that will act as a “quiet catalyst” for some of her pet causes. [The PAC is not intended to be something that the former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee will use to run for office herself one day, but it will help congressional candidates in the 2018 election, Axios reported Wednesday.  A source told Axios that the PAC will primarily work with groups that began after President Trump’s election, but it will also work with existing groups that have risen in prominence as a result of the election. Clinton has already begun meeting with some of these groups, the source added. Clinton is also back on the speaking circuit, represented by the Harry Walker Agency. Although it is unknown what her speaking fees are as of May 2017, Clinton fetched up to $225, 000 a speech for a series of speeches to Goldman Sachs, and charged UCLA up to $300, 000 for a speech in 2014, When UCLA officials tried to negotiate a reduced rate as a public university, Clinton’s representatives from the Harry Walker Agency told them that $300, 000 is the “special university rate. ” Clinton is also writing a book that is set to be released in September 2017. Although it does not yet have a title, it is already available to   on Amazon. Clinton said she took responsibility for her election loss in 2016 Tuesday in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “If the election had been on Oct. 27, I would be your president,” she said. “It wasn’t a perfect campaign  —   there is no such thing  —   but I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey’s letter on Oct. 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off. ” Clinton also mentioned that she is now an “activist” and part of “the resistance. ” “I’m now back to being an activist citizen, and part of the resistance,” she said.",0
24000,Report: White House Looks to Fire CFPB Director Cordray,"The Trump White House is weighing its options to fire Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Richard Cordray. [Richard Cordray directs the CFPB.   legislation tasked the CFPB with regulating mortgages and other consumer loans from predatory practices.  The Boston Globe reports that the White House will decide the future of the director, seen by critics as partisan, unconstitutional, and abusing his authority to regulate the consumer financial world. One lobbyist said, “They want to fire him. Their legal counsel are looking at every angle. ” Firing Cordray will not be as simple. The CFPB is an independent agency, and his term as director expires in 2018. Trump can only dismiss Cordray for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Sources say that the administration examines Cordray’s   tenure as director to justify his termination. A Washington, D. C. circuit court ruled in October that the CFPB is, by design, unconstitutional. Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion, “The director of the CFPB possesses more unilateral authority  —   that is, authority to take action on one’s own, subject to no check  —   than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U. S. government. ” He continued, “The CFPB’s concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable, unchecked director not only departs from settled historical practice, but also poses a far greater risk of arbitrary   and abuse of power, and a far greater threat to individual liberty, than does a   independent agency. ” Judge Kavanaugh’s opinion gave a blistering refutation of the CFPB, until this month when a U. S. appeals court agreed to reconsider the D. C. court’s opinion to repeal his job protection. The U. S. appeals court will start in May. Republicans believe that the CFPB has made it harder for Republicans to get credit. Other conservatives contend that accountable to the president or Congress. Reformers in Congress want Congress, not the Federal Reserve, to fund the CFPB. Senator Ben Sasse ( ) said, “The CFPB has done some things that are good, and they’ve done some things . . . that are really bad  . There are counties in Nebraska where you really can’t get a mortgage, and it’s because of CFPB and larger   overregulation. ” He continued, “If people in Nebraska have a problem that’s actually created by bad   by the CFPB, who do they complain to? Who really has the power? He doesn’t report anywhere. ”",0

24003,Trump Attorney: The President Is Not Under Investigation - Breitbart,"Jay Sekulow, one of the attorneys representing President Donald Trump, told several Sunday morning news shows that Trump “is not under investigation. ”[Sekulow, who is also Chief Counsel of the American Center for Law  Justice (ACLJ) appeared on both NBC News’ Meet the Press and CNN’s State of the Union to counter mainstream media reports that the president is officially under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for obstruction of justice.  Former FBI director James Comey told the president three times that he was not under investigation for collusion with Russia, but would not reveal that information to the public. That fact that only emerged publicly once the president fired him and suggested publicly that he might have “tapes” of their conversations. On Friday, the president tweeted: “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt. ” I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017, The media widely interpreted that statement as an admission that Trump was under investigation for obstruction of justice for firing Comey. But Sekulow told the Sunday shows that Trump was referring only to claims made by the Washington Post that he was under investigation, and that he had no reason to believe he was actually being investigated. “As James Comey said in his testimony, and as we know as of today  —   the president has not been, and is not, under investigation [for obstruction],” Comey told NBC’s Chuck Todd. “you’re reading more to the tweet than what’s there,” Sekulow said, noting that the Post had relied on “five anonymous, unnamed sources from unnamed agencies. ” Sekulow repeated that message on CNN, telling host Jake Tapper: “Let me be clear: The president is not under investigation   …     The president is not the subject or target of an investigation. ” He also called the Post story a “fake report. ” Update: On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Sekulow whether Trump had been “notified” by Mueller that he was under investigation. Sekulow said that he had not. However, confusion erupted when Sekulow suggested that Trump’s tweet referred to the Department of Justice, adding, “He’s being investigated. ” Wallace chalenged Sekulow on that point, whereupon Sekulow clarified again: “We have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the President of the United States. ” “Sir, you just said two times that he’s being investigated,” Wallace replied. Sekulow answered that he had simply been describing the “legal theory” under which the president would be investigated, if he were, which Sekulow denied he was. He added that he could not read Mueller’s mind. Wallace then suggested that Sekulow did not actually know if Trump was being investigated. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

24004,Florida University Students Latest Victims Of On-Campus Racism,"Videos Florida University Students Latest Victims Of On-Campus Racism Students at Florida Gulf Coast University were greeted by “kill n s” and a drawing of a man hanging from a tree on a classroom whiteboard. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! The message on the whiteboard read, “Kill N—–s,” along with a drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree with a rope around its neck. 
Amid one of the most racist presidential campaigns in the United States, a hateful threat with the words “kill n s” and a drawing of a person hanging from a tree were painted on a whiteboard at Florida Gulf Coast University earlier this month, but police failed to launch an investigation. 
Officials believe the vandalism occurred on Oct. 12, soon after it was found by a professor at the university. President Wilson Bradshaw called the incident “deeply disturbing” In a statement released Wednesday, 
“While occurrences such as this are very rare at FGCU, we strongly condemn this hateful expression which is contrary to the civil and mutually respectful culture of our campus community,” he said. 
The person who made the drawing is unknown and the university police department said it could not do anything other than increase patrols in the area. “This was on a whiteboard with the proper type of pens so easily erased, therefore, no vandalism. As there is no crime, there is no hate crime,” Chief of Police Steven Moore said. 
Students of color said such threats made them feel less safe in their own classrooms as it was directed at them. “The fact that it is in relation to the way I identify, yeah that’s harsh, that’s … kinda scary,” a student named Cassie told WBBH TV channel. 
Attacks on Black and other people of color have skyrocketed over the past few years amid a heated national debate and unrest over police killings of unarmed Black people. 
The anti-police brutality Black Lives Matter movement was countered by pro-police groups rallying under slogans such as “White lives matter” and “All lives matter” and arguing that African-Americans do not suffer from systemic racism in the country. 
Earlier this month, the historic Black Ashburn Colored School in Virginia was vandalized with racist graffiti , including swastikas and “white power” slogans, as it was being renovated by a group of local students who looked to turn it into an education museum. 
Anti-Black sentiment in the U.S. seems to be on the rise. Just last week, a group of white students at Texas State University stormed out of an anthropology class after the professor explained all humans were descended from Africa. 
The walkout caused heated debate, with the remaining students chanting “Black lives matter,” and criticizing the racist attitudes of their classmates. 
The news comes amid a presidential electoral season that saw white supremacist and neo-Nazi activists using the campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump to become more vocal and push their racist agendas. 
Nearly half of Trump’s supporters described African-Americans as more “violent” than whites, according to a Reuters poll in June. The same proportion described African-Americans as more “criminal” than whites, while 40 percent described them as more “lazy” than whites. 
But racist views crossed party boundaries in the country. The same poll found that one-third of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton supporters described Black people as more “violent” and “criminal” than whites, and one-quarter described them as more “lazy” than whites.

24006,Why Business Class Poses a Unique Fire Hazard - The New York Times,"In   and again in late June,   passengers on Qantas flights from Australia to the United States dropped their smartphones into the mechanism below their seats. What happened next, in each case, wasn’t pretty. The electronically activated seat crushed the phone, damaging the battery, which began heating uncontrollably. Both times, as other travelers watched in alarm, flight attendants were able to retrieve the devices  —   in one case, already flaming  —   and submerge the phones in water to cool them down. The planes landed without further incident. “It’s a small number, considering how many flights we have,” said Sharna   a spokeswoman for Qantas. “It’s not like it’s happening all the time. But we are asking people to be a little bit more aware of where their phones are. ” Little wonder, then, that Qantas has imposed a ban on Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which have a propensity to spontaneously catch fire. Qantas is not the only airline to have had such episodes with reclining   seats. Air France has had three   smoke or fire events that were set off in the same way. And the Qantas and Air France incidents do not fully illustrate the hazard, according to N. Albert Moussa, founder of BlazeTech, a fire safety company. “If you take the same device and crush it differently in the seat, you could release the energy much faster,” Mr. Moussa said. Economy seats, which are much less complex and do not move on a track, tend not to have the mechanisms that could trap and crush a phone. Qantas and Air France have modified their preflight safety announcements to warn passengers not to move their   seats if their digital devices fall. But some wonder if asking passengers to pay closer attention to the location of their phones is sufficient. In business class, many seats are fitted with a shield meant to prevent items from dropping into the moving parts below. But the shields are not required. Laura Brown, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman, said airline seat makers are required to ensure only that body parts  —   not dropped objects  —   cannot be trapped in seat mechanisms. Vern Alg, an aircraft interiors consultant, described it as a case of learning by experience. “You build a seat with the idea that you’ve thought of everything,” he said. “And as the seat goes into service and people test it, you find other avenues for things to get down into the mechanism. ” With more passengers carrying more devices onboard, as well as the growth of business class and ever more elaborate seats, the evolution of cabin design ought to be thoroughly investigated, said Merritt Birky, a former fire and explosion specialist at the National Transportation Safety Board who is now a private consultant. “Any fire onboard an aircraft is a serious problem,” Mr. Birky said. “And if the seats are involved, if the mechanism of the seat is involved, it should be part of the investigation. ”",0
24007,The Reopening Of The Clinton Email Investigation Is More GOP Hype Over Nothing,"The letter from FBI Director Comey announcing the reopening of the Clinton email investigation is already being blown up into more than it is. 
Here is the letter via CNN’s Jake Tapper: FBI Dir Comey letter to congressional committee chairs re discovery of ""new emails…pertinent to the investigation"" pic.twitter.com/y4gvHiILLn 
— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 28, 2016 
As Republicans cheer because they think that they have been thrown an election lifeline, read the whole letter and look at what it says. The letter does not say that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. The letter states that emails were found that were pertinent to the email investigation while looking into an unrelated matter. 
The letter FBI Director Comey reads like what it is, an update on an investigation. The FBI is dotting the Is and crossing the Ts. Comey’s letter destroys the Republican claim that there was a conspiracy to cover up Clinton’s emails. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have spent months criticizing Comey’s investigation, but it turns out that they were wrong. 
It would take something unprecedented and dramatic to change the FBI’s original findings. Director Comey made it clear that the agency’s work might not be completed before the election. 
The email story that Republicans and the media love, but voters have never cared about is back in the news, but it remains an empty scandal. 
The FBI’s reopened investigation does open the door for Republicans to continue their bogus witch hunt if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. Unless voters want two more years of conspiracy investigations instead of action, today’s developments have made voting for Democrats in House and Senate contests more vital than ever.",0
24008,Comey Letter Backfires As Email Scandal Revival Energizes Hillary Clinton Supporters,"Share on Twitter Print This Post 
In a conference call with reporters, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager said that FBI Director Comey’s letter is backfiring and energizing Clinton’s volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers. 
Clinton campaign chair John Podesta called Comey’s letter long on innuendo, short on facts. Podesta said the more information that comes out, the more this seems overblown. Podesta went off on Rep. Jason Chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened. Podesta said that Comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts. 
Podesta said there’s no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing. He said if all the media reports are true, about the investigation having nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, it’s hard to see how this amounts to anything. 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair called on Comey to provide answers to be public. 
Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that the Comey letter is motivating Clinton volunteers and supporters: 
Based on the anecdotes I am hearing from out team on the ground, this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election. Our volunteers are rallying around Hillary They know what a fighter she is. 
…. 
They are turning out, not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote, as early voting goes into full swing. We’re not just seeing this in our offices, on the ground, but also in our online, in the online space as well. I think this is; we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday. I think that this has only increased the momentum that we’re feeling among our activists on the ground. 
Later Mook suggested that the Comey letter is helping the Clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire. It is likely that the Comey letter will backfire on Republicans and motivate Democrats to get out and support their nominee. 
An early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters. Hillary Clinton may end up benefiting from Comey’s actions because the FBI Director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her. 
With one written paragraph, James Comey may have destroyed Democratic complacency.",0

Moms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. 
{snip} 
The analysis also found that the growth in the birthrate of America is entirely driven by immigrants. 
“While the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent years–most markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births nationwide–the trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970,” said Pew. 
“This growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014,” added Pew.",0

The computer reportedly contains “floor plans for Trump Tower, information about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and other national security information. ”[The NYDN describes authorities as “frantic” and “scrambling like mad” to recover the laptop. Other items stolen from the agent have been recovered, including a bag emblazoned with the Secret Service logo, which would suggest the thief knows he is holding a very important piece of hardware. The agent is said to have told investigators there is data on the laptop that “could compromise national security. ”  “The thief also took ‘sensitive’ documents and the agent’s access keycard, though the level of the agent’s access wasn’t immediately clear,” the New York Daily News adds. WABC reports the agent’s car was “parked in the Bath Beach section” when the crime occurred. The New York Daily News specifies that the agent is female, and the car was parked in “the driveway of her home. ” Security camera footage of the theft is described as showing an individual wearing a backpack arriving in a car, possibly an   rented ride, and leaving with the pilfered items on foot  —   a scenario that implies a disturbing level of advanced preparation. However, the Secret Service told Fox News “they don’t believe the laptop was stolen by a foreign power, and the incident is being investigated as a ‘street crime. ’” WABC’s news team reports it was told “the laptop is encrypted and information cannot be accessed by someone who is not authorized. ” ABC’s national news bureau adds a claim that “authorities are able to wipe the hard drive remotely if needed. ” Sources told NBC News “the laptop requires a keycode to access, and two unsuccessful attempts to log in will destroy the device’s memory. ” NBC also spoke to a senior law enforcement official who said the report by the, NBC also spoke to a senior law enforcement official who said the report by the New York Daily News was not entirely accurate, and the laptop does not actually have the sensitive data about Trump Tower, national security, and the Clinton email investigation in its local storage rather, it has the ability to “access such data remotely from Secret Service servers, but only if it was logged into properly. ” “The U.

24025,Election 2016 Current Votes in 8 Battleground States,"For decades, media networks, newspapers, and journalists have vowed to keep exit polling information to themselves, until all the polls have closed. This was decided because there was the overall thought that real-time voting information, on Election Day, could sway those who had not yet cast their votes. However, that silence will be broken for the 2016 presidential election.
VoteCastr will be providing real-time voting data from eight battleground states. This information is being collected using the same techniques as the presidential campaigns.
At 3:48 p.m. ET, the voting data was given as follows: Over 83 percent of the expected voters have cast their ballots in Florida. Thus far, Hillary Clinton has 48 percent and Donald Trump has 45 percent of the state.
In Colorado, 80 percent of the votes have been counted. Currently, Clinton holds a three-point lead over her Republican opponent.
More than 66 percent of the registered voters have cast their ballots in Iowa. At this time, Trump has a narrow lead of 1 percent.
Wisconsin has turned in 62 percent of their votes. Clinton leads with 48 percent of the votes. Trump trails with 43 percent.
In Nevada, almost 69 percent of registered voters have cast their ballots. Clinton currently leads by a narrow 1 percent.
Clinton holds a 1 percent lead in Ohio. So far, 74 percent of voters have made their choice.
Over 63 percent of the votes have been collected in Pennsylvania. Trump is trailing Clinton by 3 percent.
The VoteCastr model is showing Clinton in place to win these eight battleground states. However, there is an expected surge of votes for Trump, later today. Nevertheless, if Clinton maintains her three-point lead in Florida, her victory will be solidified.
In order for Trump to take the 2016 presidential election, he would have to gain electoral votes from all the states in this report. In the last hour, Trump has not only tightened the gap in Ohio and Iowa, he has a one-point lead. Clinton leads in the remainder of these battleground states, however, her lead has narrowed from 4 to 3 percent.
Guardian Liberty Voice will continue to provide updates throughout the election.

24026,Obama Drinks from Orange Cup to Support Gun Control Campaign - Breitbart,"June 2 is National Gun Violence Awareness day, which is a fancy way of saying Michael   Everytown for Gun Safety’s Day to #WearOrange for gun control. [Never one to miss out on the opportunity to push a curtailment of Second Amendment rights, Barack Obama took to Twitter to show his solidarity with the gun control cause. He held an orange coffee cup and tweeted, “On this National Gun Violence Awareness Day, let your voice be heard and show your commitment to reducing gun violence. ”  On this National Gun Violence Awareness Day, let your voice be heard and show your commitment to reducing gun violence. pic. twitter.   —   Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 2, 2017,  During his two terms in the White House, Obama’s   Amendment stance drove background checks for gun sales sky high. Moreover, concealed carry surged under Obama as social unrest and the Democratic Party’s pursuit of gun control —  and complete gun bans —  flourished. May 2015 set a record for the most background checks of any May on record. Then June 2015 set the record the most background checks of any June on record. Then July, and August, September, November, and on and on. Every month set a record for 19 consecutive months beginning May 2015. By that point in Obama’s presidency it was clear that every   gun crime would be viewed as an opportunity to propose more gun control, even if the proposed gun control had nothing to do with the crime that spurred its introduction. We saw this with the Sandy Hook Elementary attack a horrific crime wherein the criminal stole his guns then killed 26 innocents in a   zone. Neither Obama nor his fellow Democrats said anything about removing the   zones that forced teachers to be sitting ducks, but they did recruit Senator Joe Manchin ( ) to push universal backgrounds (even though background checks have absolutely zero to do with an attack where the guns are stolen). Now it is June 2, 2017, and Obama is back —  with an orange cup —  pushing gun control.

24027,2016 Shows Record Number of Refugee Deaths in Mediterranean,"Get short URL 0 5 0 0 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the 2016 refugee death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has hit a record high of at least 3,800 people. ""We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded,"" the UN refugee agency spokesman, William Spindler, said at a news briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva Wednesday. 
In March, the EU signed a deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the tide of refugees into Europe. Since that time, deported refugees have been forced to return to Turkey or their country of origin. Although less people are migrating now, primarily due to new policies enacted by some European countries, more refugees are dying. An estimated 327,800 asylum-seekers have crossed the sea so far this year, compared with at least 1,015,078 people last year. © REUTERS/ Alaa Al-Marjani UN Refugee Agency Airlifting Over 7,000 Tents to Assist Displaced in Mosul The higher death rate might be a result, Spindler said, of the dangerous route from North Africa to Italy. Combined with bad weather, unseaworthy vessels, and cramming too many people into a boat, tragedy is inevitable.
The extremely hazardous route between Libya and Italy has become the main path for refugees fleeing their war-torn country, Spindler said, calling on European countries to consider ""enhanced resettlement and humanitarian admissions, family reunification, private sponsorship, and humanitarian, student and work visas for refugees.""

24028,WHO cancer agency under fire for withholding ‘carcinogenic glyphosate’ documents,"RT 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on “probably carcinogenic” glyphosate. 
The IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to Reuters. The agency told Reuters on Tuesday that it tried to protect the study from “external interference,” as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was “the sole owner of such materials.” 
The scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under US freedom of information laws. 
The groundbreaking review, published in March 2015 by the IARC – a semi-autonomous agency of the World Health Organization (WHO) – labeled the glyphosate herbicide as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Glyphosate is a key ingredient of Monsanto’s flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name ‘Roundup.’ It is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified “Roundup Ready” crops, also produced by Monsanto. 
The IARC’s report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. 
The report sparked a heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several EU countries – including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands – to object to the renewal of the glyphosate’s EU license. The vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in June 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. 
The controversial report has seemingly made the IARC a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. 
Various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the IARC’s evaluations are fuel for “unnecessary health scares,” since the IARC allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a “typical human” exposure to it. It remained unclear whether the critics urged a WHO body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. 
The critics also brought up other controversial statements from the IARC, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. 
The agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and…freedom from conflicts of interest.” Numerous freedom of information requests by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a US conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. 
E&E Legal told Reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the IARC or to the US federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. Basically, it’s being decided whether the IARC, as part of the WHO, is truly independent and free from “conflicts of interest.” 
According to Reuters, officials from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why American taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. 
“IARC’s standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,” a letter from US Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to NIH director Francis Collins states, as quoted by Reuters. 
The Oversight Committee demanded a full disclosure of NIH funding of the IARC, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agency’s activities. 
IARC opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which believes glyphosate is “unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans,” promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its “commitment to open risk assessment.” The food safety watchdog made this statement in late September, and still has to deliver the promised information.",0
24030,"Childish Gambino’s ‘Awaken, My Love!’ Sounds Like the 1970s - The New York Times","Donald Glover  —   actor, comedian, writer, producer, rapper, songwriter  —   has set himself a complex cultural project: to both embody current   culture and reveal it to the wider world. He has done that on albums under his musical alias, Childish Gambino, and also as the driving force of “Atlanta,” the superb TV series on FX on which he is an executive producer, writer and actor, presenting a   corrective to the      fantasies of “Empire. ” “Awaken, My Love! ,” his third album as Childish Gambino, takes a sharp turn: from rapping to   singing and from contemporary production to unabashed throwback. The music directly recalls the 1970s RB before    —   the era of   Earth, Wind  Fire Stevie Wonder the Spinners the   the Ohio Players late Sly and the Family Stone and early Prince. It’s at once a homage and a parody, equally aware of that era’s excesses and its glories, of the way that the most memorable 1970s RB merged sensuality, activism, humor, toughness, outlandishness, futurism, soul roots, wild eccentricity and utopian community spirit. That’s an extremely high bar, but at its best, “Awaken, My Love!” recalls many of those virtues. “Have Some Love” and “Stand Tall” pick up the messages of countless soul and RB predecessors, calling for solidarity and  . And “Boogieman,” over a funky fuzztone riff, confronts racist assumptions that lead to rising violence. The album shares the perils of all revivalism: that it’s an emulation and pastiche rather than an invention, that it’s nostalgic rather than contemporary. Mr. Glover, born in 1983, never heard the music in its original time frame. But he inhabits it like an actor who’s done his homework to get fully immersed in a role. Mr. Glover’s longtime collaborator in Childish Gambino, the Swedish musician and producer Ludwig Goransson, realistically reconstructs the greasy guitar tones, sliding synthesizers, eager backup vocals, snappy drums and chattering clavinet of   production. And luckily, Mr. Glover can sing passably enough. He knows he’s not the one to put across a   love ballad he doesn’t try. But he’s   to more cartoonish 1970s approaches: yowls and cackles, grainy screams,   falsettos, zany swoops between speech and song. Sometimes Childish Gambino shares the songwriting credits directly with its influences, like the Funkadelic members behind the frantic funk of “Riot!” Other songs hold obvious echoes “Baby Boy,” a ballad that worries over fatherhood and custody, directly models its sparse arrangement on “Just Like a Baby” by Sly and the Family Stone. But Childish Gambino generally makes good use of what it borrows. “Zombies” deploys its    synthesizers to ooze along nicely as it sets up a     scenario that doubles as a warning about exploitation. “Redbone” and “Terrified,” two falsetto ballads laced with paranoia and fear, stay poised between plush   soul and synthesizer subversion. The songs don’t hide their   status. Mr. Glover often sings about lessons from elders and the responsibilities of parenthood. But Childish Gambino doesn’t invoke the comforts of nostalgia. The songs recognize, instead, that for all the changes in styles over the decades, other conditions persist  —   human needs and weaknesses, societal pressures  —   and that music still strives to face down the problems without stopping the party.",0

A total of 83 percent of likely voters believe that Clinton did something wrong – 51 percent saying she did something illegal and 32 percent saying she something unethical but not illegal. Just 14 percent said she’s done nothing wrong. 
By comparison, 79 percent think Donald Trump did something wrong, though not nearly as many think he did something illegal. Just 26 percent think he’s done something illegal, while 53 percent think he’s dome something unethical but not illegal. Just 17 percent think he’s done nothing wrong. 
17% and 14% thinking that Trump and Clinton, respectively, did nothing wrong is not a meaningful difference. 
The real difference is that twice as many voters think Clinton broke the law as thing that Trump did.",0
24035,Woman Who Streamed Boyfriend’s Death by Police Faces Unrelated Assault Charge - The New York Times,"By narrating the raw aftermath of a police shooting in a widely shared Facebook Live video last year, Diamond Reynolds turned the death of her boyfriend, Philando Castile, into a nationwide call for racial justice. Now Ms. Reynolds, who was widely praised for her poise during the video, is facing legal troubles. Ms. Reynolds, of West St. Paul, Minn. was charged with felony assault last week, stemming from accusations that she attacked a woman with a hammer. The police said Ms. Reynolds, 27, was among a group of women who “jumped” a woman at 10:30 a. m. in St. Paul. She was freed on bail after a court appearance on Monday. Her lawyer, Michael Padden, said she intended to plead not guilty at her next court appearance on April 3. The woman, who is 24 but whose name was not included in the criminal complaint, told the police that while waiting at a stop sign, she saw a white S. U. V. make a   to follow her. She said she drove to a parking lot and got out of her car, at which point Ms. Reynolds ran up and punched her in the head while another woman, Chnika Blair, 18, grabbed her by the hair, the police said. At one point, Ms. Reynolds struck the woman in the head with a hammer, knocking her to the ground, the police said. Ms. Reynolds then struck the car’s windshield with the hammer, smashing the window, the police said. A third woman, Dyamond Richardson, 25, got out of the car, chased the woman down and sprayed her with mace, the police said. Ms. Blair and Ms. Richardson were also arrested. The woman identified Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Blair and Ms. Richardson out of three separate photo lineups, the police said. The woman showed officers a Facebook post by Ms. Reynolds in which she threatened to “come after” her, the police said. Ms. Richardson told investigators there was an ongoing conflict between her and a friend of the unnamed woman, according to the complaint. The death of Mr. Castile, a    school cafeteria worker, was one of several shootings last year that focused the nation’s attention on police treatment of  . He was shot by an officer while inside a car at 9 p. m. in Falcon Heights, a small city northwest of St. Paul. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office said he died about 20 minutes after he was shot. The encounter was made even more chilling by Ms. Reynolds’s anguished but calm commentary during her   Facebook video, which began soon after Mr. Castile was shot. As her    daughter watched in the back seat, she walked viewers through her account of what happened, saying she informed officers that he had a gun and that he was reaching for his driver’s license and registration when the officer opened fire. Her account was laced with emotion  —   “Stay with me,” she pleaded to Mr. Castile  —   but she also had the wherewithal to repeatedly call the officer “sir. ” The video was viewed millions of times, serving as a window into the personal effects of violence not often seen. The officer who shot Mr. Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, was charged with   manslaughter in November. He pleaded not guilty in February and his trial is scheduled to begin on May 30. Activists began calling for black men and women to stream their encounters with the police live so others could watch for mistreatment. Since the shooting, Ms. Reynolds has been rattled by insomnia and panic attacks, she told The Washington Post in November.",0

24040,L.A. #ResistMarch: The Day the Gay Rights Movement Ended - Breitbart,"The conversion of the Los Angeles Gay Pride march into the   “#ResistMarch” on Sunday marked the effective end of the gay rights movement. [Once, the gay rights movement stood for tolerance: hence the rainbow flag, which is a symbol not only of pride but also of acceptance. But the message on Sunday was that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) conservatives are unwelcome in that spectrum  —   and are, in fact, aiding the enemy.  The purpose of Gay Pride parades, in L. A. and elsewhere, has historically been to create an environment into which LGBTQ individuals could “come out of the closet” and express their sexuality without fear of persecution. But the complete transformation of the gay rights movement into a   political monolith has created an environment profoundly hostile to gay conservatives. The gay rights movement has destroyed one closet, only to build another. Aside from the totalitarian,   mentality of some of the movement’s leaders  —   which was on full display in the screeching speeches from the front of the march on Sunday  —   there are two other reasons for the gay rights movement’s transformation from a force for liberation into a tool for repression. One is that the movement has run out of great causes for which to fight. With the Supreme Court’s June 2015 discovery of a right to gay marriage in the U. S. Constitution, the gay rights movement has little left to achieve. It has poured energy and resources into the new cause of transgender rights, but that is a deeply complicated issue that affects a tiny percentage of Americans. The other reason the gay rights movement appears to have adopted a   political approach is that its leaders seem to think that they simply do not need Republican support. Although Americans, and Republicans in particular, have been increasingly tolerant toward the LGBTQ community  —   with Donald Trump specifically   the movement at the 2016 Republican National Convention  —   the gay rights movement has generally preferred to fight its cause in the courts rather than appealing to the goodwill of voters. That strategy has largely worked, and the lesson the movement and its leaders appear to have drawn is that they can dispense with Republicans as allies. But it is one thing to ignore Republicans, and quite another to declare war on them. The leaders of L. A. Pride made a conscious decision to turn their annual celebration into a Democratic Party rally, adopting the rhetoric of the   “Resistance. ” There was not even a perfunctory gesture at bipartisanship. The battle lines were sharply drawn, with even “our love, and our music, and our joy” denied to people who might vote for the opposing political party. The #ResistMarch willingly cast aside the idea of standing up for LGBTQ people of all political backgrounds. In so doing, it effectively declared the gay rights movement over. Gay Pride is no longer about pride: it is about the mobilization of popular culture for partisan purposes, with LGBTQ conservatives shoved behind the closet door. Joel B.

LONDON – England – The consequence of diverting the result of a democratically held referendum vote which was given full support from parliament and won by 52% of voters for Brexit will be the undoing of Britain’s constitution. 

To simply bypass the peoples vote will not be tolerated by many and there will be civil unrest in the future if Brexit is not delivered. 
Mass rioting and looting in all cities will be the norm, because if there is no rule of law in our democracy, why should the people adhere to any rule of law on the streets? 
In essence, civil unrest is the last bastion of justice, and to have the conclusive EU referendum vote stolen by crooked biased EU centric judges will be their final undoing. 
There will be no peace, as the rioting masses converge burning everything in their path, who is to say what will happen, but when the anger envelopes the populace there is no stopping the torrent. 
It is better to fight for justice than to be timid, civil unrest is a disruptive tool that when utilised correctly can bring forth real change. Change that crooked corrupt judges commandeered by rich business people cannot do. 
Of course violence and looting is a terrible thing, but so is war, so is injustice, but these are necessary measures for survival, if nothing is done soon, Britain and its people will be no more. Already, we have been inundated, but if there is no Brexit, the numbers will increase tenfold, until the tiny island of Britain is nothing more than a holding prison, a junk filled morose, barren overpopulated garbage dump. 
Britain fought two world wars and was on the winning side of both, this time, the Germans will take Britain without a single shot being fired, this is the central position of the EU. The European Union is an East German Soviet construct incorporating German Imperial fascist techniques to subjugate other nations through economic means. 
By bribing the corrupt judges who are linked to EU centric projects, the EU is seeking to halt Brexit. 
No More 
Are you a fucking fool to take that? Are you going to stand by and let your nation be taken over? Or are you going to fucking stand up and fucking do something about it?

24044,Bomber Kills 4 Americans at U.S. Base in Afghanistan - The New York Times,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   A suicide bomber managed to sneak onto the main American military base in Afghanistan on Saturday and kill four Americans, according to American and Afghan officials. The attacker entered on foot hidden among a group of workers reporting for duty at Bagram Air Base early in the morning, said Abdul Wahid Sediqi, spokesman for the governor of Parwan Province, where the military base and airfield are. Once inside the base, the attacker detonated explosives, Mr. Sediqi said. The blast killed two American service members and two American contractors working on the base, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said in a statement on Saturday morning. The explosion also wounded 16 American service members and a Polish soldier serving with the NATO coalition forces, the statement said. A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the attack on the militants’ behalf and said it had killed a large number of American soldiers. The Taliban often give inflated casualty figures after an attack. Mr. Sediqi said that the suicide attacker “was able to pass from the first check post at the gate of the base and enter the base. ” Bagram is heavily guarded, with several layers of security and a series of gates and check posts controlling entry. Attacks inside the base are rare, although there have been a number of episodes near its outer gates, and rockets have been fired into it.

24047,"Once Rock Star of French Right, Marion Le Pen Announces She Is Quitting Politics - Breitbart","French Front National firebrand, and niece of Marine Le Pen, Marion   Pen has announced she is to step down from politics citing personal reasons. [Ms.   Pen made her announcement on Tuesday afternoon saying she would not be seeking office for the French legislative elections set to occur next month. She told the press she wants to spend more time with her young child and escape the “whirlwind” of political life, Le Figaro reports.  According to various sources, there was some conflict between Ms.   Pen and her aunt Marine Le Pen who was recently defeated by independent presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. Somewhat sympathetic to her grandfather   Le Pen, Marion had difficulty keeping a low profile when   was eventually kicked out of the party by Marine.   Pen also came into conflict with FN   Florian Philippot who she claimed had too much influence. In public, Marion supported her aunt’s candidacy for the French presidency. It is unclear how much of the perception of their personal conflict was true and how much was played up by French media to divide the two most popular politicians in the National Front. For Marion, the base of the Front National is conservative, Catholic, and traditionalist, and she has opposed gay marriage and abortion to a much greater extent than her aunt. Marion had previously marched and spoke at rallies of the   family group La Manif pour Tous (“Protest for All”) who slammed Macron as the “ ” candidate. Marion has also railed against feminists in the French National Assembly over abortion and the shutting down of   websites. She then slammed left wing feminists for supporting the hijab calling it an “Islamic submission tool”. It is unknown how long Marion will stay away from political life as she is currently ranked as one of the most influential MPs in the entire country. Marion is also the youngest member of the National Assembly ever elected, assuming the office at only 22 years old. Now aged just 27, Marion may still have a huge potential in future French politics. After conceding defeat on Sunday evening, Marine Le Pen announced her   migration populist movement would continue on. Others have said the Front National may also be “rebranding” away from its controversial past. The new movement could even drop the ‘Front National’ name as the party looks to make huge gains in the legislative elections next month, even if it is missing one of its most prominent members.

Hackers exposed her secrets then her husband’s sex scandal opened the floodgates… Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s top assistant for years, has perhaps become the most significantÂ figure in the final weeks of the 2016 Election. Born in the United States, Abedin’s family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was two. At age 18, she returned to the United States, and, in 1996, at age 20, started interning for Hillary Clinton. From 2002-2008, she also worked for her mother’s radical Muslim magazine, the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs. Reportedly, the Journal advocates Sharia law and denounces the right of women.

Clearly, Huma knew that they had been hacked in the past, yet she never once reported the possible vulnerabilities to National Security? 
Today, we learned that the New York Police Department, while investigating the sexting scandal of Huma’s estranged husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, uncovered a digital folder entitled, âLife Insurance.â Multiple news sources have reported that the folder contains 650,000 official emails from Huma and Hillary’s time at the State Department.

24052,Ratted Out: Kuwaiti Man’s Affair With Maid Exposed by Pet Parrot,"Get short URL 0 2 0 0 A man in Kuwait was nearly sent to prison after his family’s pet parrot exposed -- by repeating phrases spoken between him and the housekeeper in front of his wife -- that he was having an affair with the maid. 
Following the bird’s revelations, the man’s wife filed a complaint with the Hawally Police Department, accusing her husband of deception. She had long suspected that there was an improper relationship between him and the maid. Bird-en of Proof: Parrot's 'Testimony' Could Help Solve Michigan Murder Case Luckily for the husband, the case was thrown out based on lack of credible evidence, as the parrot could not testify in court. Investigators also explained that it could not be conclusively proven that the bird was mimicking a conversation it heard in person — and not just some flirty scene that had played on television.
In Kuwait, adultery is illegal and can carry a sentence of hard labor or even prison time, the India Times reports. 
In 2006, a woman in Leeds was busted for infidelity after her boyfriend’s parrot began squawking “I love you Gary.” Gary, it turned out, was an ex-colleague of the woman’s. After being confronted with the parrot’s phrases the girlfriend admitted to the affair. 
The parrot also made smooching noises when it heard the name Gary. Though the girlfriend moved out, the parrot’s owner had to get rid of the bird as well, as it would not stop repeating the name of the homewrecker, and became a painful reminder. ""I wasn't sorry to see the back of Suzy after what she did, but it really broke my heart to let Ziggy go,"" the jilted boyfriend told BBC at the time.

24054,Marmite Survives After ‘Brexit’ Spurs Tesco-Unilever Price Dispute - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the first tangible victim of that decision has emerged and, like the   bloc itself, it is something that has divided the country for years: Marmite, a sludgy and   breakfast spread. Since the June referendum, many who voted for withdrawal from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, have brushed off concerns that a recession was possible or that car manufacturers and banks based in the country might leave. They have even celebrated the pound’s recent fall to a   low, arguing that a weaker currency is good for exporters. But they probably never thought it would come to this. Fears that Marmite and other British classics, like the PG Tips brand of tea, might disappear from store shelves had gripped Britons after reports that the supermarket chain Tesco and the owner of those brands, the   consumer goods company Unilever, were locked in a price dispute over who should bear the cost of the weakening pound. Marmite was briefly unavailable in Tesco’s online market, and store supplies dwindled. The pound has fallen drastically against other major currencies since the vote to leave the bloc, and as worries have increased that Britain would opt for a “hard Brexit”  —   shorthand for a strict break with the European Union  —   which could limit its   access to the region’s single market for goods and services. But after the markets closed on Thursday, Tesco reassured the public that the crisis had been averted. In a statement, Tesco said, “We’re pleased this situation has been resolved to our satisfaction. ” In reality, consumers will most likely have to dig deeper into their pocketbooks. Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever’s chief financial officer, said during an earnings call on Thursday that “prices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling. ” Still, the concerns over the beloved consumer goods led to a political uproar. “Who would have thought that the first casualty of a hard Brexit would be the nation’s supplies of Marmite?” asked Pete Wishart, a member of Parliament for the Scottish National Party, which campaigned to remain in the European Union. On Twitter, Britons wryly noted that store shelves were emptied of Marmite jars, and one used jar was put up for sale on eBay for 100, 000 pounds, or about $122, 000. News bulletins on the BBC led with the possible Marmite shortage. “This is a concrete case of Brexit affecting people’s lives,” said Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International. “Talk of Brexit had been more political, financial and a bit abstract” before, she added. “This touches their lives. ” Among the affected brands is Colman’s Mustard, which, like Marmite, is produced in Britain. Analysts noted that although Marmite and some of the other affected brands were made in Britain, Unilever published its company results in euros, meaning that those products were still affected by a weaker pound. Imported household goods like Dove soap and Ben  Jerry’s ice cream are also under the Unilever umbrella. In 2011, Tesco refused to stock Branston Pickle after another supplier, Premier Foods, tried to pass on cost increases. Analysts have predicted that food prices will start to rise across the board in the coming months as supermarkets struggle to absorb the extra cost of imported goods, which are more expensive when a currency weakens. Stores have already stopped promotions and discounts on their products, Ms. Hosafci said. But “price increases will start happening in the next four to five months, when they will need to renew their stocks. ” “Eventually, they’ll need to increase prices,” she added. “Otherwise, their businesses will no longer be profitable. ”",0
24055,MINNESOTASTAN: Tagging the Muslim Student Association (MSA) sign with “ISIS” is NOT a hate crime but an accurate description of what the MSA stands for,"BNI Store Nov 5 2016 MINNESOTASTAN: Tagging the Muslim Student Association (MSA) sign with “ISIS” is NOT a hate crime but an accurate description of what the MSA stands for The discovery of ISIS graffiti on the MSA sign at the University of Minnesota campus has the local chapter of designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) calling for a hate crime investigation. CAIR-MN says that “Islamophobic” vandals spray-painted “ISIS” on the Muslim Student Association’s sign on campus. However, if you are familiar with the background of the MSA, it’s easy to understand why ISIS is an appropriate tag for them. MSA, like CAIR, is a North American affiliate of the terror-linked Muslim Brotherhood organization (original founders of al-Qaeda), whose headquarters, originally in Egypt (from which it has been banned by the al-Sisi government for its terrorist activities) now is in Qatar, a well-known state sponsor of terrorism, including the Islamic State (ISIS). FOX9 Naturally, the CAIR thugs think you are too ignorant to know this, so they perform their usual “Islamophobia” tap dance, demanding yet another time-wasting state and local hate crime investigation for some harmless graffiti which was likely painted by Muslim students themselves. “University administrators and state religious and political leaders must speak out forcefully against the rising anti-Muslim hate in our society that results in such disturbing incidents,” said a statement from CAIR-MN executive director Jaylani Hussein. “We urge campus police and other relevant law enforcement agencies to investigate this incident as a hate crime.” Hussein cited the “Islamophobic rhetoric in the presidential election campaign,” particularly from Donald Trump, as a possible contributing factor to these types of incidents. (No, it’s the abhorrent behavior of Muslims themselves that cause so many people around the world to hate Muslims)",0
24059,Obama Commutes Sentence of F.A.L.N. Member Oscar Lopez Rivera - The New York Times,"President Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentence of a man convicted for his role in a Puerto Rican nationalist group linked to more than 100 bombings in New York and other cities in the 1970s and 1980s. The man, Oscar Lopez Rivera, was serving a   sentence after being convicted of numerous charges, including seditious conspiracy, a charge used for those plotting to overthrow the United States government. He was linked to the radical group known as the F. A. L. N. the Spanish acronym for the Armed Forces of National Liberation, and was one of more than a dozen group members convicted in the 1980s. Under Mr. Obama’s commutation order, Mr. Lopez Rivera’s prison sentence will expire May 17. It was one of 209 grants of commutation by the president announced Tuesday. The F. A. L. N. which waged a violent campaign for the independence of Puerto Rico, was considered by the authorities to be among the most elusive and resilient terrorist groups to operate in the United States. Among its notable attacks was a bombing at Fraunces Tavern in New York in 1975 that killed four people. The group was known for its   membership, fanatical zeal and    tactics, as exemplified by the bombings of four government buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn on New Year’s Eve in 1982 that seriously wounded three police officers. Mr. Lopez Rivera was not specifically charged in the Fraunces Tavern bombing but more broadly with, among other things, the interstate transportation of firearms with the intent to commit violent crimes, and transportation of explosives with intent to kill and injure people and to destroy government buildings and property. President Bill Clinton offered Mr. Lopez Rivera and other members of the F. A. L. N. clemency in 1999, a decision that stirred an emotional debate. Mr. Clinton said their sentences were out of proportion with their offenses. While 12 prisoners accepted the offer and were freed, Mr. Lopez Rivera rejected the chance to reduce his sentence because it did not include all of the group’s members, his lawyer, Jan Susler, said at the time. If he had accepted the agreement, she said, he would have been eligible for release in 2009. A senior Obama administration official said on Tuesday that Mr. Lopez Rivera, 74, had served nearly half of his life in prison and was the only F. A. L. N. member still in prison. In 1981, he was sentenced to 55 years for seditious conspiracy and in 1988 was sentenced to an additional 15 years for conspiring to escape from a prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kan. The news on Tuesday was received with jubilation by some on social media. On Twitter,   Miranda, the creator of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” wrote: “Sobbing with gratitude here in London. OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA IS COMING HOME. THANK YOU, @POTUS. ” Over the years, supporters of Mr. Lopez Rivera have tried to have him freed on parole. The National Boricua Human Rights Network in 2011 said that he posed no threat to the public and that others who were released went on to have productive,   lives. A lawyer for Mr. Lopez Rivera, Jan Susler, said in an interview on Tuesday that there was widespread support for the commutation of his sentence. “Really the only controversy is that this man was still in prison after 35 years after not being convicted of hurting or killing anyone,” she said. In an earlier interview with El Nuevo Día, Mr. Lopez said: “I want to enjoy Puerto Rico, my family. But I like to work. I have some skills  —   organizing, helping young people  —   that I want to share with people. ”",0

24062,Media Silent As Millions Of Muslims March Against ISIS In Iraq,"Share on Facebook Millions of marchers joined together in the annual Arbaeen Procession in Karbala on Monday, marking the final day of the mourning for Imam Hussein. The devoted marchers came from over 60 different countries, with the majority marching all the way to Karbala from Iraqi cities such as Najaf and Baghdad. Imam Hussein was martyred in a battle with the army of Yazid, who was promoting a similar type of Islam as ISIS, following a refusal of allegiance to the tyrant caliph. The under reporting of this seemingly peaceful event has been seen by some as a biased act and double standard, considering the sensationalist reporting on terror and Muslims at many other opportunities. This mark of mourning takes place each year, as Sunni Muslims and followers of other religious groups, including Christians, join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussein. Whilst this traditional mourning is usually used to mark the anniversary of the 7th century social justice leader, several people took the seemingly controversial step of taking the march towards a more political stance following the global ISIS terror attacks, in order to denounce all forms of terror, where tens of thousands of Muslims have been killed, since these terrorists began a campaign of terror in June 2014. The yearly occasion has begun to create additional significance in recent years, due to it becoming a rallying cry for the campaign against ISIS terrorists, who have frequently targeted the pilgrims. Due to this, Iraqi troops are deployed to act as added security for these dedicated pilgrims. Whilst terrorist campaign, has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey, the media seemed to turn a blind eye to this peaceful event, which many are seeing as biased reporting.

24063,Dallas Police: ’Social Media’ Fueling Surge in Drive-by Shootings,"Dallas is witnessing a surge in   shootings and local police believe exchanges between rival gangs on social media fuel the incidents. [According to The Dallas Morning News, Dallas has witnessed 122   shootings in 2017 alone. The city saw only 49 such incidents at this same time last year. Police believe drugs and gangs are factors in the shootings and they think these matters become actionable following   interaction on social media.  Interim Police Chief David Pughes said, “We’ve seen instances in which there is a gang war that takes place on social media where one gang is challenging another gang. That ultimately ends up in a   shooting at one of the places. ” A number of the   incidents are taking place in the area of the city patrolled by the southeast division. Tiffinni Young is the city council member for that area and lives in Buckner Terrace. She says she “hears shots almost every night. ” Moreover, she added, “You have seniors in our district that are living in fear that they can’t come to the other side of the door. ” Pastors and other leaders in the community are worried that violence may swell to unimaginable levels in the hot months of summer if the gang problem is not addressed. The Morning News reports that the “police gang unit was nearly gutted under former Chief David Brown” and is only now being rebuilt. It is interesting to note that in January 2016, Chicago’s top cop blamed social media for a surge in shootings in that city. Chicago interim police superintendent John Escalante said, “A lot of it is gang conflicts, but [it’s] also heavily driven by social media. It is the new way   …     of taunting and challenging other gangs, and is the modern way of gang graffiti. ” Chicago ended 2016 with almost 4, 400 shooting victims and nearly 800 homicides.

24067,Grieving Families Of Victims Of Jailed Palestinian Terrorist Leader Slam NYT For Publishing Oped,"TEL AVIV  —   The families of terror victims murdered by jailed Palestinian terrorist leader Marwan Barghouti blasted the New York Times for giving him a platform by publishing his   earlier this week. [Barghouti is serving five life terms plus 40 years for murdering several Israelis and a Greek Orthodox monk during the Second Intifada, of which he was one of the architects.  Barghouti, who is a chief contender to succeed Mahmoud Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority, penned the article to explain why he had launched a hunger strike among Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, claiming abuse by prison guards, including his own claim of being kicked in the genitals. The original article included a bio describing Barghouti only as “a Palestinian leader and parliamentarian,” conspicuously omitting his terrorist past. Following an outcry, the NYT amended the bio. Shmuel Landau, the father of    Ronen Landau, who was killed in a July 2001 roadside shooting attack near Jerusalem that was orchestrated by Barghouti, slammed the NYT for whitewashing Barghouti’s past. “I would show the [NYT editors] pictures of my late son, who can no longer speak out. Terrorists went out and murdered children on the orders of a   ‘political leader,’” Landau told Hebrew news site nrg, adding that he would tell the NYT, “This is what happens when you present him as a ‘freedom fighter. ’” “He should not be given any concessions whatsoever,” Landau said, referring to Barghouti’s demands for improved prison conditions. “He is a terrorist leader. He is a murderer, but he acts as if he’s the head of a workers’ union. I don’t think he needs any leniency. ” Shlomo Chen, who lost his wife and mother of his two children Yoela in a 2002 shooting attack near Jerusalem, said, “I have nothing to say to [the New York Times]. ” “Those who killed my wife will never be free,” he said. “I won’t agree to it. ” Tzion Sviri, whose son Doron, daughter Sharon and    Yaniv   were killed  in a shooting attack in August 2001, said, “Every week I visit the graves of my murdered children   …     my hope is that Barghouti sticks with the hunger strike until the end so that [someday] his children will have to visit the cemetery each week in order to speak to him. ” Sviri further blasted the suggestion that Barghouti should be released early. “Anyone who speaks this way, none of them were hurt and none of them know the pain of a bereaved family. I’d wish them this pain and then they’d talk differently. ” The New York Times was roundly condemned by Jewish groups in the U. S. and by Israeli lawmakers, including, chiefly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said that calling Barghouti a political leader is like calling Syrian President Bashar Assad a children’s doctor. On Monday, MK Michael Oren, who also served as Israel’s ambassador to the U. S. said that the incident merited the shuttering of the New York Times’ Jerusalem bureau. “If someone in the paper helped him [smuggle the article out of prison] the New York Times should be held accountable,” said Oren. Following the outcry, the Times later added the following editor’s note to the oped: On Tuesday, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Barghouti may be prohibited from meeting with his lawyers if they are found to have helped smuggle his   to the the New York Times.",0

24075,College Removes Scales from Gym to Avoid ’Triggering’ Overweight Students - Breitbart,"Carleton University faces severe criticism for its latest politically correct decision to remove weight scales from its gym and workout areas to prevent the “triggering” of overweight students. [The Ottawa, Ontario, university calls the decision “in keeping with current fitness and social trends,” Fox News reported.  The school’s manager of health and wellness, Bruce Marshall, claims that the move helps improve the mental   and health of the school’s students. Indeed, Marshall went on to insist that scales only remind people they are fat and can have a “negative impact” on health. “We don’t believe being fixated on weight has any positive effect on your health and ” Marshall said to Canada’s The Charlatan newspaper. “The body is an amazing machine and even when we are dieting and training it will often find a homeostasis at a certain weight. ” Marshall excused his position saying that body changes can take months, so “why obsess” about weight indicators? Some students agreed with the move. One even labeled scales as “triggering. ” “Scales are very triggering,” student Samar El Faki said. “I think people are being insensitive because they simply don’t understand. They think eating disorders are a choice when they are actually a serious illness. ” Not every student agrees with the school’s move. Marko Miljusevic, a   computer science student, said people should take responsibility for themselves. “We shouldn’t remove something because some people abuse it,” he said in a post on the school’s Facebook page. “If they can’t handle the number that shows up on the scale then don’t step on it. ” Doctors say that a person’s true weight is best measured in the morning after waking up and before eating breakfast. But, they also warn that fluctuations of several pounds from day to day is nothing to be concerned over. Many doctors also suggest that people trying to improve their health with diet and exercise should weigh themselves only a few times a week.

24080,How Putin’s Plan to Collect Former US Allies Could End the American Empire,"As Anti-Media reported Monday, analysis of recent events suggests President Vladimir Putin may have ulterior motives in sending the largest Russian naval fleet since the Cold War steaming toward the Mediterranean Sea. He may, in fact, be initiating the first stages of militarily securing the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline.
As highlighted , positioning the aircraft carrier-led fleet just off the western coast of Syria in the Mediterranean also strategically places it between friendly nations to the north and south — Turkey, with whom the pipeline deal was officially signed last week, and Egypt, with whom Russia is now expanding ties both militarily and economically.
But in truth, the agreements being struck around the Mediterranean — while unquestionably important in their own right — are indicative of a much broader, and rather recent, Russian pattern.
On the southeast border of Russian ally, Iran, for instance, lies Pakistan. Russia raised eyebrows back in September when it announced that for the first time in modern history Russia and Pakistan would conduct joint military drills — a signal Russia’s influence is spreading across Asia.
In October, it was reported additional joint exercises between the two nations had been scheduled for 2017.
Pakistan’s neighbor to the east is India. In mid-October, it was announced Russia’s largely state-owned oil company Rosneft, along with other partners, would invest around $12.9 billion in India’s Essar Oil. Additionally, a Russian state investment fund would work with an Indian counterpart to invest $1 billion toward Indian infrastructure.
Reported at the same time was the fact that Russia has also agreed to sell missiles to India, as well as to establish a joint venture to build military helicopters in the country. India, incidentally, will participate in 2017 drills with Russia and Pakistan.
Farther east, the story has been much of the same.
While officially pivoting from the United States to China last week, Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte proudly declared it was now China, the Philippines, and Russia against the world. While it may have sounded like wishful thinking on Duterte’s part at the time, it’s nonetheless the case that days ago the Russian ambassador to the Philippines said Duterte’s government should make a wish list of the types of assistance it wants from Moscow.
Considering China has of late been strengthening relations with regional countries, such as it has with the Philippines — and, as it happens , Vietnam, who will also participate in the 2017 drills with Russia, Pakistan, and India — one could be forgiven for concluding the burgeoning Russian-Chinese superstate has an eye on locking down the entire coastline in the northern Indian Ocean.
Even loyal U.S. satellite, Saudi Arabia — which currently finds itself sandwiched between established Russian ally Iran to the northeast and, as Underground Reporter has previously outlined , what could very well be the new Russian ally of Egypt to the west — may be beginning to get swept up in pro-Russian sentiment.
Over the weekend, it was reported the Saudi energy minister has just invited his Russian counterpart to meet with Gulf Arab energy bigwigs in Riyadh in an effort to stabilize the global oil market.
So while Putin’s sailing of the Russian fleet toward the Mediterranean Sea may, indeed, as many have suggested , be about power projection in the Middle East — which doesn’t negate the possibility the fleet also has every intention of laying waste to Aleppo — it’s difficult, given the emerging pattern, not to conclude that Russia and cohort China are making a move toward something much, much bigger.

Pretty cool! This restores my faith in Americans, for sure. 
It seems that there are a lot of people who are disgusted with Trump’s constant threats to sue. USA Today reports that Trump has been involved in over 3, 500 lawsuits. He routinely uses the law to badger and intimidate his opponents. 
Trump has famously refused to pay contractors who have worked on his multi-million dollar projects. When those small companies ask for payment, Trump glibly tells them to take him to court, knowing that the costs would stop them from going forward. They end up settling for cents on the dollar, every time. 
He has also threatened to sue various media outlets when they report information that he doesn’t like. Donald Trump threatens legal action against NBC over 'Access Hollywood' tape https://t.co/IWhwwHcHjz via @CNNMoney

That threat, as well as his threats to sue the media, prompted the famous lawyer to send his original tweet offering a pro bono defense. The response to his offer has been excellent. Boutrous said : “Ever since I sent that tweet, the outpouring from other lawyers and people who want to help is just incredible. It was so offensive to fundamental First Amendment values and democratic principles to have someone threaten to sue people who are criticizing him. The First Amendment is designed to protect exactly that kind of speech.” 
This is the part that Donald Trump seems incapable of understanding. It is a violation of the U.S. Constitution to deny people the right to speak freely, even if they criticize you.

24084,"Trump Invites Republican Congressional Leaders to White House for Healthcare, Tax Reform, Overseas Trip Discussions","WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   On Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump will host a handful of Republican congressional leaders at the White House for a dinner centered around the President’s first trip abroad. [He will also preside over an afternoon bicameral Republican leadership meeting to discuss plans for healthcare and tax reform.  Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short briefed reporters late Monday on the meetings, as well as updates on the President’s legislative agenda. Short said that a “handful” of Republican House and Senate leaders would come to the White House for a dinner on Tuesday. They will discuss the President’s recent overseas trip, his first foreign trip since assuming the office of President of the United States, and will also discuss foreign policy challenges that the United States faces. For the dinner, President Trump will host Sens. Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Todd Young, Cory Gardner, and Reps. Francis Rooney, and Lee Zeldin. Tuesday afternoon, Trump will host a bicameral Republican leadership meeting in which the group will discuss a path forward on legislation. Healthcare and tax reform will be included, according to Short. He said: On healthcare we are looking forward to delivering the choice and control that Americans want in their own individual health plans. We are looking forward to delivering the affordability that Americans need and the quality that they deserve. The American people are anxious about healthcare. Obamacare is an unaffordable disaster that is collapsing around the country today. Attendees of the afternoon bicameral meeting will be Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Rep. Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Sen. John Cornyn. Short cited increases in health insurance premiums under Obamacare from 2013 to 2017 of 123% increase in Louisiana, 176% in North Carolina, and 203% in Alaska. On average health insurance premiums have more than doubled in the U. S.  —   increases of approximately $3, 000 per plan. Moving to the tax reform discussion the leaders will have on Tuesday, Short said, “In order to jumpstart the economy we need to cut taxes for both businesses and individuals. ” He cited a low average two percent rate of growth in the economy over the past eight years. Short added of plans for tax reform, “The plan will provide tax cuts by simplifying the tax code, broadening the base, and increasing growth. ” He indicated that a tax reform bill will likely come after Labor Day. While the Trump Administration continues to endeavor to make bipartisan strides on tax reform, Tuesday’s meeting will be a conversation for Republican leaders. In response to questions from reporters on whether tax reform will be revenue neutral, Short said that the goal is for tax reform to be revenue neutral, but the greater priority is to provide growth. On tax reform, the Trump Administration hopes to avoid having separate bills on tax reform from the House, Senate. and White House. Instead, through discussions on the issue, the administration hopes to see one bill that all three can pass into law. Short later told Breitbart News that the White House recognizes the urgency expressed among Americans to see tax reform and healthcare reform passed. The Trump Administration expects to see a summer focused on passing the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and the FY2018 budget. In the fall, the administration is looking to continue to make the case for FY2018 spending bills, ensure funding for border security, and pass a tax reform package. During the briefing, Short also highlighted the 36 bills that Trump has already signed into law and the executive orders that Trump has signed thus far. Short said this is a pulling back of the Obama era regulatory burden. “These bills and executive orders save our economy $18 billion dollars annually in regulatory compliance costs,” he said.

24086,Flight to London Evacuated Following Bomb Threat,"Virgin Atlantic have evacuated a flight from Dubai to Heathrow as a “precautionary measure” following a bomb threat. [“Our customers travelling on the VS401 from Dubai to London Heathrow have temporarily disembarked the aircraft for additional security checks,” a spokesman told the International Business Times.  “This is purely as a precautionary measure as the safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we’re planning to have everyone on their way as quickly as possible. ” Passengers have reportedly been advised they must undergo full body scans before reembarking, although some are said to demanding a change of flight. “We were just moving and then the captain called his flight crew immediately and they all ran up the front,” a passenger told MailOnline. “Ten minutes later we were told to get off. ” They described how “the captain just came out and said Virgin take[s] the safety of passengers very seriously  —   following the events in Manchester, Virgin had received a bomb threat so as [a] precaution they have asked everyone to leave the plane. ” Late on Monday night, a suicide bomber targeted    —   including many young girls  —   leaving the Manchester Arena. Eyewitnesses reported “there were bodies scattered about everywhere” and police have reported 22 dead and 59 injured so far.",0
24088,"Pope Francis Goes Forward with Egypt Trip, Despite Jihadist Bombings","Despite two separate ISIS bombing attacks on Christian churches in Egypt Sunday, the Vatican has confirmed that Pope Francis is moving forward with his plan to visit Cairo just three weeks from now. [On Monday, Archbishop Angelo Becciu, the number two of the Vatican Secretariat of State, confirmed that the Pope would still be traveling as planned to Egypt April   just as Egypt’s Cabinet announced a   state of emergency.  “There is no doubt that the Holy Father will stick to his plan,” Becciu told the Italian daily, Corriere della Sera. “What happened causes distress and great suffering, but it cannot prevent the Pope from carrying out his mission of peace. ” On Sunday morning, jihadists set off two separate explosions in the Christian churches of Mar Girgis (Saint George) in Tanta, and Saint Mark’s Church in Alexandria, killing at least 45 people and injuring scores more. The Islamic State terror group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement from the organization’s Amaq news agency. “Islamic State squads carried out the attacks on two churches in Tanta and Alexandria,” the statement declared. The Pope was informed of the attacks during the celebration of Palm Sunday Mass in the Vatican, Becciu said, after which the pontiff publicly denounced the bombings in his weekly Angelus address at noon. Speaking before tens of thousands in Saint Peter’s Square, Francis prayed that the Lord “convert the hearts of the people who are sowing terror, violence and death, and also the hearts of those who make and traffic weapons. ” In his interview, Archbishop Becciu said that ever since the Islamic State appeared on the scene, the Pope “wanted to distinguish between terrorist acts carried out by zealous fanatics and the religion itself. ” “He has always refused to associate Islam with terrorism,” Becciu said. “Certain deviant Islamists might be terrorists, but not the religion. And this has earned him the gratitude of the Muslims, for the honesty of his positions. Many Islamic authorities have met with the pontiff to thank him and many others have written to him with admiration for his moral authority. ” Last summer, Islamic State representatives expressed deep offense at Pope Francis’ claims that their war was not being waged for religious motives, hastening to assure the pontiff that their sole motivation is religious and sanctioned by Allah in the Qur’an. ISIS censured the Pope for his naïveté in clinging to the conviction that Muslims want peace and that acts of Islamic terror are economically, rather than religiously, motivated. “This is a   war between the Muslim nation and the nations of disbelief,” the authors state in an article titled “By the Sword” found in their propaganda magazine, Dabiq. The article attacked Francis for claiming that “authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Qur’an are opposed to every form of violence,” saying that by doing this, “Francis continues to hide behind a deceptive veil of ‘good will,’ covering his actual intentions of pacifying the Muslim nation. ” Pope Francis “has struggled against reality” in his efforts to portray Islam as a religion of peace, the article insisted, before going on to urge all Muslims to take up the sword of jihad, the “greatest obligation” of a true Muslim. During his upcoming visit, Francis will meet the grand imam of Al Azhar University, Ahmed   the highest authority of Sunni Islam, as well as Egyptian government officials and prelates of the Coptic Church.

24090,Comment on ‘Westworld’s’ four-minute orgy scene leaves some viewers outraged by Alma,"Posted on November 3, 2016 by DCG | 1 Comment 
Westworld was originally done in 1973. From Wikipedia , “Westworld is a 1973 science fiction Western thriller film written and directed by novelist Michael Crichton about amusement park androids that malfunction and begin killing visitors . It stars Yul Brynner as an android in a futuristic Western -themed amusement park, and Richard Benjamin and James Brolin as guests of the park. 
Sometime in the near future a high-tech, highly realistic adult amusement park called Delos features three themed “worlds” — West World (the American Old West ), Medieval World ( medieval Europe ), and Roman World (the ancient Roman city of Pompeii ). The resort’s three “worlds” are populated with lifelike androids that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and even a fight to the death. Delos’s tagline in its advertising promises, “Boy, have we got a vacation for you!” 
The HBO remake premiered on October 2 nd and stars Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright, James Marsdan, and a bunch of other actors I’ve never heard of. Their parents must be so proud… 
From Fox News : HBO has been known to push the boundaries in their original programming, featuring scenes depicting incest, rape and over-the-top gore. But some say they might have finally hit gone too far when Sunday night’s episode of their new futuristic show “Westworld” featured a four-minute orgy scene with approximately 40 actors engaging in a variety of sex acts . 
“HBO is a network that broadcasts ‘Sesame Street’ re-runs. And yes, parents should turn it off, stop paying for it and block it,” Dan Gainor, Vice President of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, told FOX411. “‘Westworld’ is a disturbing reminder of the sick and demented way Hollywood views the world.” 
But industry insiders said nudity and adult content is fine for cable television. “Good or bad TV, this is something that is on pay cable, and viewers who don’t like it can tune it out. It’s appropriate for the story they are telling ,” TV producer Geoff Skinner told us. He added that it’s a parent’s responsibility to monitor the programming a child watches. 
“Parents like myself should never allow a child to watch this until they are old enough to understand all of the thematic and semiotics that this show is trying to achieve.” 
Former television executive Scot Safon said the show does not misconstrue its adult content, and the sexual scene in question was in line with the plot of the series . In other words, viewer beware. 
“It is deliberately disturbing and provocative, and it makes its intentions very well-known from the opening credits onward,” Safon shared with us. “ It is a show about ideas and it is done with tremendous artistry. I trust the artists here, and would assume that their extended orgy sequence is in line with the vision of the show .” 
But branding and communications expert Scott Pinsker warned that HBO has to find a delicate balance and not push the boundaries so far it pushes away its main audience. 
“HBO is in the business of distributing movies, sports and original content, but it’s primary objective is to promote the HBO brand. It’s a delicate balancing act, because many HBO viewers want to see edgy, risqué content that pushes the envelope, but if HBO goes too far, they can alienate their core audience,” Pinsker said. 
He added, “Instead of censoring content, they should have internal standards of what’s appropriate for their brand, and then advise their audience accordingly, so they can decide whether or not to watch.” 
HBO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

24094,"ObamaCare Architect Admits ""The Law Is Working As Designed"" As Premiums Spike","Oct 26, 2016 5:20 PM 0 
Submitted by Joseph Jankowski via PlanetFreeWill.com, 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor and architect of ObamaCare Jonathan Gruber told CNN’s Carol Costello on Wednesday that ObamaCare, which is set to see a sharp increase in premium prices next year, is going just as planned. 
When asked what could be done to the Affordable Care Act in order to drive the prices of premiums down, Gruber responded by saying “the law is working as designed.” 
“Look, once again, there is no sense of just what has to be fixed, the law is working as designed,” Gruber told CNN. “However, it could work better and I think the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty.” 
Johnathan Gruber made headlines in 2014 when video surfaced of him saying that the “lack of transparency” and the “stupidity of the American voter” helped ObamaCare become law. 
“Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” Gruber said. “And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass.” 
Gruber made the comments while discussing how law was “written in a tortured way” to avoid a negative score from the Congressional Budget Office. He suggested that that ObamaCare would have been rejected if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes. 
“If CBO scored the (individual) mandate as taxes, the bill dies,” Gruber said. 

“If you had a law that made it explicit that healthy people are going to pay in and sick people are going to get subsidies, it would not have passed,” he added. 
As the AP reported yesterday, the Obama Administration has confirmed that premiums will sharply rise under the ObamaCare law, with many consumers left with only one insurer to choose from. 
Premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase on average 25% across 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. 
“Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,” Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, told the Associated Press .",0

24096,At Least 37 Killed in Yemen Fighting Since Ceasefire’s End,"Several Clashes Reported Around Country by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
Fighting was reported in several areas around Yemen over the past 24 hours, with the ending of the 72-hour ceasefire leading to a substantial uptick in clashes in several areas, mostly in the northern half of the country. 
Three different incidents were reported, with the largest an exchange of artillery fire east of the capital city of Sanaa, in which 15 Houthis and 5 pro-Saudi fighters were slain. 11 more were killed in fighting at a border post, and six others were killed in Baida. 
The UN special envoy Ismail Ouid Cheikh Ahmed was in Yemen yesterday pushing proposals for a new peace process, though it as yet doesn’t appear that either side is willing to commit to anything, and only accepted the most recent 72-hour ceasefire because it came at the behest of US and British officials. 
Saudi Arabia attacked Yemen in March of 2015, vowing to reinstall former President Hadi in power. The war has continued since, with heavy airstrikes and a naval blockade, so far resulting in a split of the country along north-south boundaries, with the pro-Saudi forces centered on Aden, a southern port and former capital of South Yemen.

24100,Boycott Targets Uber for Not Joining Strike in Protest of Trump Travel Ban - Breitbart,"#DeleteUber started to trend on Twitter Sunday, following a call to boycott the   service by   celebrities and   protesters.

24101,California & Massachusetts Just Legalized Recreational Cannabis,"Waking Times 
In a major win for cannabis proponents, the state of California has just voted to legalize recreational marijuana. California just turned green. 
The Proposition 64 was approved by California voters on Tuesday evening, which now makes California as the biggest state for legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. 
As it is often said, “As California goes, so goes the nation.” This will certainly bring a massive push from the rest of the nation to legalize marijuana for recreational use. 
With the proposition now passed, people living in California who are 21 or older can now legally possess, transport and buy up to an ounce of marijuana as well as allowing up to 6 plants to be grown by an individual. 
Nate Bradley , executive director of the California Cannabis Industry Association is happy with the results: 
“We are very excited that citizens of California voted to end the failed policy of marijuana prohibition. Proposition 64 will allow California to take its rightful place as the center of cannabis innovation, research and development.” 
Proposition 64 was opposed by most major law enforcement groups, including the California Assn. of Highway Patrolmen, the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California and the California Police Chiefs Assn. 
Interestingly and perhaps somewhat controversially, the initiative to vote in favor of the proposition was supported and funded by Facebook’s President Sean Park as well as billionaire George Soros. They raised nearly $16 million which is about 10 times the amount the opposition campaign raised. 
Massachusetts has also joins California in passing recreational marijuana with Florida approving medical marijuana. 
As of this writing , the vote for recreational marijuana is currently being approved in Maine, has officially been approved in Nevada and is being opposed in Arizona. Votes are also pending for medical marijuana in North Dakota, Arkansas and Montana. 
We could very well wake up in the morning with 4 new states approving recreational marijuana and at least 1 state (Florida) approving medical marijuana. 
With California, Massachusetts and Nevada passing the legalization of recreational marijuana, they now join Colorado, Alaska, Washington and Oregon. 
Regardless of the presidential election outcome, we are surely to wake up to a different and more green friendly world tomorrow. Spread the good news! About the Author

24102,Life: 6 People Who Came To My Garage Sale Who Seem To Be Sticking Around For Dinner,"I had a garage sale today, and a number of people came and bought stuff. Most of them left. Here are the ones who are still sticking around. 1. The Guy Who Bought My Lamp 
I expected the guy who bought my lamp to leave after he bought my lamp. But he did not leave. He sat down on my lawn and started reading the newspaper. I went up to him and asked him if he needed help with anything, and he said, “Nope. Been saving my appetite all day.” I didn’t really know what that meant, but someone had a question about my foosball table at that moment so I didn’t have time to get clarification on that. 2. The Couple Who Didn’t Buy Anything But Spent A Lot Of Time Browsing My Box Of National Geographic sAnd Then Got In Their Car And Took A Nap 
These people seemed really into my National Geographic s, so I was pretty surprised when they decided not to buy them. I was also surprised when, instead of leaving, they just got in their car and started napping. They’re still asleep, and there’s a little Post-it on their window that says, “Wake us up when it’s ready.” 3. The Old Woman Who Bought My Vacuum 
When the old lady who bought my vacuum offered to pay for my vacuum by vacuuming my house, I thought it was a little odd but also kind of nice. My place is a little dusty these days, and definitely could use a good vacuuming. So I said yes. I wish that she had left after she finished vacuuming my house. She is now in the kitchen and has been vacuuming the same corner for the last 20 minutes. Plus, she keeps chiming in on how to make the pasta sauce. I have to admit she did a pretty good job cleaning my house, though. I don’t know how to ask her to leave without sounding rude. 4. The Lady Who Bought A Plate, A Fork, And A Knife 
I assumed this woman bought these items for her own home, but it’s been three hours and she is just standing by the front door sneaking peeks at the kitchen through the window. This is becoming stressful. 5. The Kid Who Bought My Toaster Even Though I Told Him It Was Broken And Then Handed Me A List Of His Allergies 
When this kid asked me how much I wanted for the toaster, I was up-front about the fact that it was broken. But that didn’t matter to him. He bought the thing for 50 cents and then handed me a list of allergies he had. Now he is sitting out on the lawn along with the guy who bought my lamp, and I think they’re working on a crossword puzzle together. I really don’t think I have enough ingredients to make food for all these people. Also, there are a lot of allergies on this list. 6. The Older Gentleman Who Brought A Raw Steak To My Garage Sale And Then Bought A Coatrack 
I don’t know why the old man who bought the coatrack brought a raw steak to my garage sale. After he purchased the coatrack, he placed the raw steak in a dish to marinate, then put it in my garage fridge. I asked him what he was doing, and he said, “Gotta marinate this bad boy for dos horas, compadre. Buon appetito.” He is still here, and his steak is still marinating. Overall, I’d say the garage sale itself was a success because I made about $250. But it ended hours ago and all these people have not left yet, and I don’t know what to do.",0
24106,Йемен — самый яркий пример западной политической импотенции | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Йемен Как отмечает в своей новой статье пакистанский исследователь Салман Рафи, политическое бессилие Вашингтона сегодня лучше всего можно наблюдать в Йемене. Седьмая попытка установить режим перемирия, которую западные дипломаты тщательно готовили, с треском провалилась, когда боевые действия между повстанцами-хуситами и войсками Саудовской Аравии, незаконно вторгшимися на территорию Йемена, разгорелись с новой силой. Ирония здесь заключается в том, что Вашингтон является главным виновником конфликта в Йемене, поскольку без непрекращающегося потока западного вооружения Эр-Рияд не имел бы никакой возможности вести боевые действия. Однако Вашингтон сегодня не слушают нигде: ни в военно-промышленных кругах США, которые интересует только прибыль, ни на международной арене, где доверие к «оплоту демократии» и его заверениям находится на критически низком уровне.

24110,"FBI: 33,000 Criminal Gangs, 1.4 Million Members Active in U.S.","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) website content devoted to criminal gangs operating in the United States includes staggering figures about these groups’ presence and criminal activities across the country. [“Some 33, 000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs with about 1. 4 million members are criminally active in the U. S. and Puerto Rico today,” the FBI reports. “Many are sophisticated and well organized all use violence to control neighborhoods and boost their illegal   activities, which include robbery, drug and gun trafficking, prostitution and human trafficking, and fraud. ”  “Many gang members continue to commit crimes even after being sent to jail,” the FBI reports. The 1. 4 million figure for the number of gang members is as big or bigger than four of the Top 10 largest cities in the U. S.  —   San Antonio, Texas, 1. 3 million San Diego, California, 1. 3 million Dallas, Texas, 1. 1 million and San Jose, California, 945, 942. The FBI has numerous entities working to combat the gang problem, including the Safe Streets Task Forces, the National Gang Intelligence Center, and Transnational   Task Forces. The NGIC, established by Congress in 2005, “integrates gang intelligence from across federal, state, and local law enforcement on the growth, migration, criminal activity, and association of gangs that pose a significant threat to the U. S. ” That intelligence reveals that the “Mara Salvatrucha ( ) and 18th Street gangs continue to expand their influence in the United States, while transnational (operating across national borders) gangs are present in almost every state and continue to grow their memberships, now targeting younger recruits more than ever before. ” The FBI’s transnational   task forces operate in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, according to the FBI website. President Donald Trump said in April that his administration is cracking down on violent gangs operating in the U. S. “They are getting the hell out or they are going to prison,” Trump said in an interview with Fox and Friends. Trump praised Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for enforcing the laws. “I will tell you we have gotten tremendous criminals out of this country,” Trump said. “So many towns and cities are thanking me because we have gotten rid of a burden that you would not believe,” he said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in April the expansion of the Texas   Task Force (TAG) and the creation of a technical operations center in response to a sharp increase in rape and murder in the Houston area by violent gangs. Abbott and Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw singled out   and its connection to human smuggling, drug trafficking, murder, and rape during the announcement. “This recent wave of senseless violence cannot continue,” Abbott told reporters at a press conference attended by Breitbart Texas. “Government’s foremost responsibility is to keep our citizens safe and secure,” Abbott said. “Texas will take action and use all lawful means to put an end to this lawlessness. ”",0
24112,BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio,"BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio 3 Shares Comments 
Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. 
That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. 
It’s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. 
Ford’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. 
“Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” 
The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. 
The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. 
The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn’t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It’s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. 
“We’re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven’t decided what will go there,” said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. 
“How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.” ",0

24121,Mexican Cartel Kingpin ’El Chapo’ Guzman Extradited to U.S.,"Mexico has announced the extradition of Mexican Drug Lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera. [A prepared statement issued on Thursday afternoon from Mexico’s Foreign Relations Ministry announced the extradition that took place on Thursday.  Known as “El Chapo” Guzman has been the leader of the famed Sinaloa Cartel —  a criminal organization responsible for most of the drug trafficking in the country. Guzman is facing multiple charges in U. S. federal district courts in Texas, California, and Washington, D. C. that include money laundering, drug trafficking, conspiracy, and murder. A statement from the Department of Justice revealed that Guzman is already in the custody of U. S. law enforcement and is expected to make an initial appearance in the near future in connection with six federal indictments. Guzman had been trying to fight the extradition from Mexico by having his legal team file multiple appeals and injunctions however various Mexican judges struck down each of the motions until the extradition was announced in May. As Breitbart Texas had reported, Mexico’s SRE had notified Guzman about an extradition agreement with the U. S. so the drug lord could face the pending charges in federal court. As part of the agreement, U. S prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. The death penalty issue comes after the Western District of Texas filed murder charges against Guzman for his alleged role as the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. The murder was part of a drug dispute where cartel gunmen kidnapped and murdered a U. S. citizen and two relatives. The victims of that hit were Rafael Morales Valencia, Jaime Morales Valencia, and Guadalupe Morales Arreola, who were believed to be tied to the rival Juarez Cartel. The three men were kidnapped on May 7, 2010, during a wedding. Their bodies were found on May 10, 2010. At the time of the murders, Ciudad Juarez was going through a violent turf war between the Sinaloa and the Juarez Cartels. As Breitbart Texas has reported, Guzman became a major headline in July 2015 when he was able to escape a maximum security prison through a   tunnel. After the escape, Mexican authorities arrested 23 prison guards and employees for their alleged complicity in the escape. Guzman had originally been captured in 1993 and was sent to Mexico’s Altiplano prison from where he escaped once before by hiding in a laundry cart. Guzman has been listed by Forbes magazine as a billionaire in their ranking of the world’s richest. In a press release issued Thursday evening, the DOJ expressed “gratitude to the Government of Mexico for their extensive cooperation and assistance in securing the extradition of Guzman Loera to the United States. ” Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

24125,Senior Lawyers Demand Action to Replace White Males in Judiciary,"The large number of “privately educated white men” amongst Britain’s judiciary is a “serious constitutional issue” according to a report by senior lawyers, which calls for dramatic measures to increase the proportion of women and ethnic minorities. [Asserting that Britain’s judiciary has a “diversity deficit” law reform group Justice called for “systemic structural changes” to the selection process including “targets with teeth” so as to “deliver sufficient diversity to the bench”.  As well as describing diversity as an “intrinsic good” the report said the “lack of female and visible [black and ethnic minority] senior judges threatens to erode the public’s confidence in the judiciary” warning it could be perceived to be “unfair” that in the Crown Court “those tried are disproportionately   yet the judges are overwhelmingly white”. The   group said “positive action” must be taken to increase the share of women and ethnic minorities in the judiciary, stating: “‘Merit’ can all too easily become a vehicle for unconscious bias. ” Justice director Andrea Coomber said: “We realise that some of the measures recommended in this report will be unpopular with some, but if the   issue of lack of diversity is to be genuinely addressed then those at the most senior levels must accept that difficult and perhaps unpopular decisions will have to be taken to deliver a more diverse judiciary. ” Noting the majority of supreme court judges will be replaced over the next three years, Coomber said there is now an “unprecedented opportunity” to “change swiftly the demographic composition of [Britain’s] senior judiciary”. Justice recommends setting ambitious “targets with teeth” for courts deemed to lack sufficient numbers of women or ethnic minorities, the “teeth” meaning that there would be obligations to monitor and report on progress. The report said: “If there is persistent failure to meet targets over the next decade, strong consideration should be given to introducing quotas. “Structural change  —   not tinkering  —   is required if the complexion of the bench is to really change. ”",0

24129,Tunisia denies hosting US drones for Libya operations,"North Africa Tunisian Defense Minister Farhat Horchani (C) attends the unveiling of an anti-militant fence in eastern Tunisia, close to the border with Libya, on February 6, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Military officials in Tunisia have rejected claims that the country is hosting a base for US drone operations against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in neighboring Libya. 
Tunisia’s Defense Minister Farhat Horchani on Thursday ruled out any possibility that foreign forces could have direct access to Tunisian military bases or run their own in the country. 
“We don't -- and won't -- have a foreign military base in Tunisia,"" Horchani said, adding, “We were one of the few first countries to oppose a foreign military intervention in Libya.” 
A Tunisian Defense Ministry spokesman also said on Thursday that the North African country has never allowed Washington to operate unmanned planes from its territory for anti-Daesh missions. 
""Tunisian soil has never been and never will be used to strike targets in Libya. The drones are used by Tunisians and no one else,"" Belhassen Oueslati said, adding, ""As part of Tunisian-US bilateral cooperation, we have acquired drones to train our military personnel to use this technology and to control our southeastern border with Libya and detect any suspicious movement."" 
The remarks came after US media claimed that Washington has expanded its deployment of drones to North Africa as part of a secret program. 
A report by the Washington Post said on Wednesday that unmanned aircraft and US military personnel had been deployed to a facility in Tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring Libya. The paper added that ""drones began flying out of the Tunisian base in late June,” claiming that the dispatch of the planes was a key element of the extended US air offensive against a Daesh stronghold in Libya. 
Daesh, which is known for its terror acts in Iraq and Syria, has been operating mostly in northern Libya, a country which slipped into chaos in 2011 following the ouster of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. 
Forces loyal to Libya’s unity government, which enjoy the support of the West and the United Nations, have been battling Daesh militants over the past six months in the coastal city of Sirte. 
US Africa Command (AFRICOM) said on Thursday that since August 1, Pentagon has carried out 351 airstrikes in Libya to help Libyan forces in the fight in Sirte. 
“There are US service members working with the Tunisian security forces for counter-terrorism and they are sharing intelligence from various sources, to include unarmed aerial platforms,” said Colonel Mark R. Cheadle, spokesman for US Africa Command. 
Tunisia, which is frequented by Western tourists, has suffered several major attacks by the Daesh terrorist group. 
Last year, a total of 59 foreign tourists were killed in two such assaults by Daesh on the National Bardo Museum in Tunis and a beach resort. Loading ...",0
24130,Fact Check: Democrats Have Created Twice As Many Jobs As Republicans Since 1950’s,"Comments 
Democrats are better for the economy. This statement is not an opinion, but a fact. According to economist Steven Stoft, who created a series of graphs charting job creation under each party over the last 72 years (during which time Democrats and Republicans have held control for 36 years each), Democrats have created 58 million jobs while Republicans can only claim 26 million . 
For roughly the last century, electing a Democrat has been the better option for the economy, with Dems creating more than double the jobs than that of Republicans, and faster. 
Even when taking the percent change of number of jobs held, or scaling population (to avoid counting an increased population, thus falsely indicating an increase in jobs), Democrats still prove more successful than Republicans in job creation, and by a wide margin. 
Another way of studying job creation is to take unemployment into account. When a Democrat is in the White House, logically unemployment decreases as well. By this rational, of course, when a GOP takes the Oval Office unemployment rises (and has risen under this party) since 1945. 
Indeed, this extends to state and federal levels—the top 20 years of national GDP growth have all been under a Democrat. This is not only true for GDP, but for all economic growth in general—extending to the stock market, income growth and debt as a percentage of GDP. 
As if you needed more proof that the blue party is better for the economy, simply turn to the numbers over the last 70 years. When it comes time for Election Day, it’s a matter of fact that with every Democratic ballot cast, it’s almost guaranteed the country will be in a better economic position than if a Republican is sworn in.",0
24131,All we need to know about Trump’s demise we learned from his campaign launch speech,"Will shake things up 
Media ratings magnet / Likely to steal all the thunder 
Since Trump’s June 2015 announcement speech, every word or phrase listed above describes what the American electorate witnessed or felt during the campaign because, as I said, Trump’s consistency has been uncanny. 
Now, let’s now examine three quotes from the speech and then refer back to the list. All three reinforce the premise in my headline. But it was the following statement that haunted Trump’s campaign from the second the words left his mouth: 
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people. 
Watching Trump say that on live television, I immediately thought, “There goes the Hispanic vote!” The fact is demographic voter data shows that for a Republican to be elected president, he or she must win at least 47% of the national Hispanic vote. Then poof, in one 20-second rant, Trump destroyed all the Republican Party’s Hispanic outreach rendered since Romney won only 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012. 
From the “impression list,” Trump’s inartful Mexican statement branded him with “lacks a political filter,” and “lacks presidential demeanor” to put it mildly. These two major negative “branding phrases” may have begun with his much-maligned Mexican comments, but later applied to numerous Trump-isms which popped up over the last year slowly undermining and unraveling his chances of ever winning 270 electoral votes. 
Next is a Trump foreign policy gem about terrorism: 
Islamic terrorism is eating large portions of the Mideast. They’ve become rich. I’m in competition with them. 
What the #@& does that mean? Let’s go to the “impression list” where we apply incoherent, inarticulate, uninformed, and desperately in need of a speech writer , to name just a few. And once again, repeat after me: “Aall we need to know we learned….” 
For my last selection, I chose an example of how Trump, right out of the starting gate, tried to antagonize and denigrate other Republican presidential candidates (and later high-ranking party leaders.) It is important to note that Trump made the following statement within the first minute of his announcement speech: 
The other candidates — they went in, they didn’t know the air conditioning didn’t work. They sweated like dogs. They didn’t know the room was too big because they didn’t have anybody there. How are they gonna beat ISIS? I don’t think it’s gonna happen. 
Yikes! That nonsensical statement exploded the “impression list.” It was the opening act of an obstinate candidate who, we found out too late, is totally resistant to change even after his campaign began its slow-motion meltdown. 
Sadly, Trump’s announcement speech stands as living proof that he flunked kindergarten etiquette. Circling back to Flughum’s theory, during his campaign, Trump never learned to clean up his own mess and has never said he was sorry after hurting someone (or a group of someones.) 
In the end, Trump’s likely defeat will be written off as an historical fluke. He will be viewed as a charismatic, untested, one-time outsider candidate who spearheaded a successful movement of fed-up voters. Through his celebrity status, he managed to parlay mass frustration into winning the Republican presidential nomination but, along the way neglected to learn the basics of kindergarten-level political behavior.

24133,Trump Moves to Stabilize the Obamacare Exchanges - Breitbart,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a new rule on Thursday to keep insurers in the Obamacare exchanges. [HHS will make changes to the individual insurance marketplace to prevent insurers from leaving the Obamacare exchanges or raising insurance premiums next year.  The Trump administration’s new rule seeks to stabilize the Obamacare insurance marketplace while Congress continues to work on repealing Obamacare. The new rule includes several changes insurers requested to keep them in the insurance marketplace: Insurance companies cheered the new rule but cautioned that they will wait to see how the Trump administration will handle Obamacare’s insurance reimbursements. Insurers threatened to raise premiums or leave the Obamacare exchanges if they no longer receive the Obamacare reimbursements for offering discounted deductibles and copayments for   Americans. The White House will continue to provide these   subsidies, although Trump signaled that he might cancel the reimbursements to force Democrats to sign a deal on health care reform. In 2016 a federal judge ruled against the Obama administration but allowed the federal government to continue providing Obamacare subsidies while the administration appealed the decision. Republicans sought to delay the court case after Trump was elected president. Marilyn Tavenner, the president and CEO of America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) and the former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, praised the rule for adopting “important changes” to “improve the functioning of the individual market” but said insurers still need to hear Trump’s final decision whether to retain the Obamacare subsidies. Tavenner said, “There is still too much instability and uncertainty in this market. Most urgently, health plans and the consumers they serve need to know that funding for   reduction subsidies will continue uninterrupted. Without funding, millions of Americans who buy their own plan will be harmed. ” The AHIP CEO cautioned that many plans would drop out of the Obamacare marketplace if the subsidies discontinue and premiums could rise as much as 20 percent. She warned, “We urge Congress and the administration to act now to guarantee funding for   reduction subsidies. ”",0
24134,"H-1B Reform Has ’Zero Impact’ on Americans Replaced by Foreigners, Expert Says","A bill to curtail the number of Americans being replaced by foreign guest workers through the   visa “would have zero impact” on the program, according to an expert on the issue. [Reps. Derek Kilmer ( ) and Doug Collins ( ) have reintroduced the “Keeping American Jobs Act” which they claim will tackle abuses of the   foreign guest worker visa.  “The Keeping American Jobs Act protects American workers by preventing bad actors from abusing the system in order to offshore jobs,” Collins told Live Mint. “Companies have the opportunity to bring workers from overseas on   visas in the event that qualified Americans aren’t available, but we can’t allow the law to be exploited to displace American workers and send their jobs abroad,” Collins continued. But, NumbersUSA’s Director of Government Relations Rosemary Jenks said the congressmen are “misunderstanding” what the   visa program actually does, as far as Americans being replaced by cheaper, foreign workers. “This doesn’t have any impact on outsourcing jobs,” Jenks told Breitbart Texas. “ ’s are coming here. This shows a misunderstanding of the entire   program.   has nothing to do with moving jobs abroad. ” Some 85, 000 foreign workers are allotted jobs in the U. S. every year under the   visa program, often leaving Americans to train their replacements. Jenks told Breitbart Texas that this   bill is not actually reform at all, and instead is “just another case of Members of Congress being sadly confused. ” “This is pathetic,” Jenks said. They need to actually understand what the   program is. This would have zero impact. ” The bill states that it would “prevent the transfer of knowledge from United States workers for the purpose of facilitating their jobs being moved abroad. ” Nonetheless, while U. S. jobs have been shipped overseas in order for companies to pay less for workers, that issue is entirely unrelated to the abuses of the   visa. The   visa remains incredibly unpopular with American voters. As Breitbart Texas reported, only 30 percent of Americans say companies bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs is necessary. Additionally, some 44 percent said those foreign workers take jobs away. The vast majority of Americans also said the number of   visas allotted every year to companies should either be decreased or kept at the current levels. The use of the   visa was panned by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail last year, often holding rallies with fired Disney and tech industry employees who were forced to train their replacements. However, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the   abuses are not a reform priority for the Trump Administration this year, as Breitbart Texas reported.

24136,Gorilla Killed After Child Enters Enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo - The New York Times,"Visitors to the gorilla exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo were screaming, panicked. Somehow, a    boy had slipped through the exhibit’s barrier on Saturday afternoon and was now being dragged around like a toy by a hulking silverback gorilla. In videos of the encounter posted to Twitter, a woman can be heard calling to the sobbing child: “Mommy loves you! I’m right here!” After about 10 excruciating minutes, witnesses said, zoo workers shot and killed the animal, named Harambe. The boy, who was hurt but not severely, was taken to a hospital and released on Saturday night, zoo officials said. “It was pure panic,” said Brittany Nicely, 29, who was there with her two children. Ms. Nicely said that out of the corner of her eye she spotted the boy on the wrong side of wooden and wire barriers along the edge of the enclosure. She reached for him, she said, but not in time, and he fell about 10 feet into a shallow moat. Harambe, a teenage western lowland gorilla, then grabbed the child, but his intentions were not clear. At times, he stood over the boy in what appeared to be a protective posture. But then he darted across the water, dragging the child roughly behind him. “He wasn’t throwing him around,” Ms. Nicely said. “He wasn’t mauling him to death, which is what I thought was going to happen. ” The gorilla could have easily crushed the boy at any moment, however, if only by carelessness, she said. Cincinnati Fire Department personnel responding to the scene witnessed the gorilla “violently dragging and throwing the child,” according to an incident report. The department said a zoo employee shot Harambe as the boy was positioned between his legs with a single round from a long rifle. The zoo said in a statement that the decision to use lethal force had been a difficult one. A tranquilizer would have taken several minutes to neutralize the animal, prolonging the risk. The dart could also agitate the animal, the zoo said, and cause a violent reaction. “The zoo security team’s quick response saved the child’s life,” the zoo’s director, Thane Maynard, said. “We are all devastated that this tragic accident resulted in the death of a critically endangered gorilla. This is a huge loss for the zoo family and the gorilla population worldwide. ” The breach raised concerns about the apparent ease with which the boy was able to get into the arms of such a powerful animal. The zoo said in a Facebook post on Sunday that the Gorilla World exhibit met safety guidelines and had experienced no other breach since its opening in 1978. “The barrier that we have in place has been effective for 38 years,” Mr. Maynard said. “Nevertheless, we will study this incident as we work toward continuous improvement for the safety of our visitors and animals. ” Mr. Maynard did not return messages seeking additional comment. The incident also led hundreds of people on social media to question the mother’s culpability, but Ms. Nicely said it would be unfair to judge the mother too harshly. “I don’t feel like it was neglectful,” she said. “She had three other kids that she was with. She had a baby in her arms. It was literally the blink of an eye. ” She added: “I saw it, and I couldn’t even prevent it. It happened so fast. ” Western lowland gorillas are threatened by habitat destruction, disease and poachers, with fewer than 175, 000 left in the wild in Africa, according to the zoo. The zoo described Harambe, who was born in captivity, as an intelligent and curious animal who was on his way to becoming a group leader. On Friday, the day before his death, the zoo celebrated his 17th birthday. On Sunday, visitors left flowers at a gorilla statue inside the zoo.",0
24137,North Dakota Pipeline: Cell Service Blacked Out As Violence Against Protesters Increases,"As violence against protestors at the construction site of the North Dakota Access Pipeline escalates, social media outlets like Facebook show millions what is actually going on. 

Arrests at the recently erected frontline camp in the path of the Dakota Access Pipeline have begun and they are anything but non-violent. Police and military have moved in on Indigenous water protectors and their allies. 

Law enforcement seem to have been interfering with cell signal, making it difficult for protestors to keep Facebook and other social media outlets updated on what is happening. Yet the social media users who were able to post videos and livefeeds have been able to spread awareness about the ongoing fight against the build of the Dakota Pipeline, a pipeline that could endanger the clean drinking water supply for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 

According to eyewitnesses, buses filled with law enforcement have been traveling toward the frontline. The indigenous water protectors and their allies are prepared to stand their ground even though crackdowns by law enforcement are getting more and more violent while the protesters have continued to use nonviolent tactics in their civil disobedience. 

The Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners warned that demonstrators occupying land in the pipeline’s path must leave or face prosecution. This new frontline camp sits slightly north of the main protest camp on federal land near Cannon Ball. 

Amidst potential arrests, violence, and legal charges, members of tribes from across the United States are standing with Standing Rock, ready to give their lives to the cause. While the protest is a fight to save tribal lands and fresh drinking water, it is also a fight to preserve indigenous rights, wants, and needs. 

Meanwhile, Morton County sheriff’s office has been leading police response to the demonstration and it has also been conducting mass arrests like the one that just took place over the weekend. The sherif department announced that the use of dogs by private security guards against protesters last month may have been illegal. 

The scare tactics used by law enforcement to get protesters out of the pipeline’s way are not working the way police forces had envisioned. Although protesters have been violently hurt by police use of force and violence, they are prepared. 

Tribal leaders, led by Standing Rock Sioux tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II called on the Department of Justice to look into the use of an unnecessary amount of force by state and local law enforcement. He believes that the state has militarized the reservation. 

With the rising amount of support through social media platforms, word about what is going on in North Dakota is beginning to get out to the public. Yet, with cellular service blacked out in the area, supporters are having trouble sharing what is going on. Violence against protesters was recorded on live-streams that were shared by thousands of people, highlighting what law enforcement is doing to protesters. Photos show bloody activists bit by dogs, shot with rubber bullets, and more. There have been canon attacks by police and military tanks have been brought out to disperse road blocks. 

Although mainstream media is choosing to black out what is happening, social media is telling a story of people coming together to fight for water, land, and indigenous rights. What is happening at Standing Rock is history in the making.

24138,New Solar Panels Pull Drinking Water From The Air Because Clean Water Is A Human Right,"These solar panels are seriously changing the game for both tap water and clean energy. Credit: Zero Mass Water 
In an exciting new development, a startup company called Zero Mass Water has created solar panels that passively and efficiently pull water from the sky, purify it, and transport it to the tap for drinking and cooking purposes. Though the primary motivation for creating these panels was to help people living without access to clean drinking water, it can also help a variety of people from all walks of life while conserving traditional energy that is bad for the environment . 
The founder and CEO of the startup, Cody Friesen, said he was inspired when he was setting up another one of his technologies in Indonesia and thought about the abundance of rain, but lack of clean water in the region. He decided to focus his efforts on improving the global water supply. Friesen told Fastco Exist: 
“Everybody’s heard about the latest nanofilter this…or whatever the latest pump technology is. None of those end up being sort of the leapfrog technology that addresses the fact that drinking water is a fundamental human right, and yet we have one person dying every 10 seconds from waterborne illness on the planet.” Credit: Zero Mass Water 
Though these are the first solar panels of their kind, the idea and technology behind the water conversion and supply is simple. Zero Mass Water created a material that absorbs water from the air at an extremely accelerated rate, then it draws the water back out to evaporate it and draw out pollutants. After this purification process, the distilled water is run through a mineral block to add calcium and magnesium and to improve the taste. 
Since waterborne illnesses are so prevalent, this water can save millions of lives and slowly eliminate diseases, as it becomes more widely-used by countries suffering the most as a result of contaminated drinking water . Having an in-home water supply would also save girls and women worldwide approximately 200 million hours annually , as that’s how much time they spend retrieving water. They could use this time to go to school, perform more tasks around the house, or work. 
The solar panels are currently being tested in Ecuador, Jordan, and Mexico to test their viability and effectiveness. Though they’re starting out in areas rampant with poverty , the panels can also make a difference in the lives of the citizens whose water supplies are tainted with lead. There are roughly 5,300 such water systems, and this could be a safe alternative to drinking that lethal tap water and buying bottled water. Credit: Zero Mass Water 
A single panel can provide enough clean drinking and cooking water for a family of 4, and additional panels can be used on larger buildings, such as hospitals. 
Zero Mass Water hopes that this concept won’t remain novel for too long; despite the success they’re likely to have for being the only sellers of this panel, their goal is to make the technology common throughout all solar panels installed in people’s homes. 
“When you think about solar today, what do you think about? Electricity,” Friesen said. “Everybody thinks that way. I think that in a few years when people think about solar, they’ll also think about water abundance.”

24141,"Florida Man Strangled Wife, Then Impersonated Her on Facebook, Police Say - The New York Times","A Florida man has been charged with murder after strangling his wife during an argument and then posting messages on her Facebook page under her name to try to fool her friends and family about her absence, the police said. The man, George J. McShane Jr. was trying to “convince her friends and family she was still alive,” according to the Orlando Police Department. Mr. McShane, 42, who a police report said worked at a resort, was arrested on Jan. 11 and charged with   murder and battery by strangulation in the death of Kristen McShane, 30, the police said. For several days this month, Ms. McShane’s Facebook page was updated with cheerful photographs documenting her life in Florida: a portrait of her smiling in front of an easel, paint brush in hand and another of her enjoying an outing with friends. On Jan. 7, a Facebook message informed friends and relatives why she had not been in touch: “I can’t believe I dropped my phone in the toilet. I am such an idiot. Message me here, til I can get it fixed. ” Friends replied with advice (“Put it in rice”) or with offers to lend her a phone. This week, the police in Orlando, where the McShanes lived, revealed that the author of some of those messages was not Ms. McShane, who was 30, but her husband. Mr. McShane posted the Facebook message about her phone so that others would not become alarmed because she “was not returning their phone calls or text messages,” the police said. Officers were called to the house on Jan. 10 by a relative of the couple who had been concerned about them, according to a police affidavit. They found Mr. McShane sitting in his car in the garage with the engine running. Then they found Ms. McShane’s body in a bedroom. The authorities said Mr. McShane told them that he had “lost his temper and jumped on Kristen, using his two hands to choke her until he realized she was dead. ” The reason for the argument was not available on Friday. Mr. McShane had not yet been arraigned on Friday, a court official said in an email, but appeared in court on Jan. 11 to hear the charges, court records showed. Robert Larr, a public defender assigned to Mr. McShane, declined to comment on the case on Friday. The Florida murder case is the latest example of someone assuming the social media identity of another person to deflect suspicion from family and friends after a crime. In December, Shanna Golyar of Iowa was arrested and charged with murder in the 2012 killing of Cari Farver of Nebraska, the Omaha police said. Ms. Golyar had posted messages on Ms. Farver’s Facebook account posing as the victim, a Douglas County prosecutor said on Friday. In October, the Facebook pages of a missing South Carolina couple suddenly became active with updates that family and friends did not believe were written by them. Todd C. Kohlhepp, 45, was later charged with murder in the death of the man and with kidnapping the woman, who had been held chained in a container, the police said. In the Orlando case, Ms. McShane’s Facebook page was updated on Jan. 7 with a photograph showing her next to a man at a social event. “Who’s your friend?” someone wrote. “That’s my new guy,” came the reply in the comments section under Ms. McShane’s name. Another post the same day described her dropping her phone in the toilet. Both posts appeared after 3:30 a. m. that day  —   the time that Mr. McShane told the police the couple had started to argue, according to the police. Her Facebook profile was updated twice again on Jan. 8 with posts showing a photo of her painting and another image including the sleeping face of a little girl, apparently the couple’s daughter. By Jan. 11, after Mr. McShane’s arrest, there were only condolence messages.",0

Graham said, “I don’t know if I’m going to vote for the bill they’re going to present to the Senate here soon. ” He continued, “I think the Democrats cleaned our clock. I think there are things in this bill that I just don’t understand. This is not winning from the Republican point of view. The bottom line is I don’t want to shut the government down, but I don’t want to continue to fund Obamacare, either and that is what we do here. ” He added, “There is all kinds of ways to look at it. We got more money for the military. I’m for comprehensive immigration reform, but the sanctuary cities go untouched. Obamacare continues to be funded in a way we all say is illegal. The bottom line is this whole process of funding the government where the put 12 bills into one and you don’t get any input, and you vote on a bill two days after you have a chance to look at it is just bad government.

24146,"WATCH: Trump Gropes, Humiliates Miss Universe Just To Get REVENGE","WATCH: Trump Gropes, Humiliates Miss Universe Just To Get REVENGE By Karen Shiebler   
It is absolutely incredible that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is still trying to deny his sexual misconduct. 
First the man brags about grabbing women and kissing them without consent, then he acts completely outraged that anyone would ever accuse him of doing just that. As a literal parade of women have come forward, one after another, to accuse the candidate of grabbing them, he has responded by threatening to sue them. 
It is hard to believe that anyone would believe Trump’s shallow denials, but if there is anyone out there who still needs convincing, here you go . 
A video has surfaced from 2011 showing Donald J. Trump publicly humiliating a beauty pageant contestant with sexual jokes at her expense and an unwanted grope in front of thousands of corporate audience members. 
Not only did Trump embarrass the woman and grab her in public, he did it out of a very twisted desire for revenge. 
The need for revenge moves Trump’s misogyny out of the realm of the creepy and into the realm of the truly sick. 
Here’s what happened, according to reports . 
Trump was speaking to a corporate audience in Sydney, Australia in 2011. As he often does in his corporate speeches, Trump talked about getting revenge on those who have slighted him. He said: “Get even with people. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.” 
What a prince. 
He went on to give the crowd an example of how he gets even. He decided to single out a woman named Jennifer Hawkins. She was the 2004 winner of the Miss Universe Pageant, which Trump owned. He had asked the beauty queen, who is Australian, to introduce him at the corporate event, but there had been some type of miscommunication. 
Either that, or she had simply declined to do so. 
Either way, Trump was furious at Ms. Hawkins. He wanted the crowd to see how he handled his anger at a perceived snub. As he talked about getting revenge, he said : “I’ll give you an example: Jennifer Hawkins. Where’s Jennifer? Where’s she sitting? Get over here, Jennifer. First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer? This is about getting even.” Trump pulled Hawkins up on the stage, telling the crowd how angry he had been at her. When she tried to explain herself, Trump pulled the mic away from her and told the crowd how she had “dissed” him after he had made her a “big star” through his pageant. He disregarded her attempts to explain, instead choosing to make a sexual joke of her. “So what happens is ― and you know what? She came tonight, she came ― came, she came, she came.” When the audience dutifully laughed at Ms. Hawkins’ expense, Trump added: “See, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia.” Oh, ha,ha. What a sick adolescent mind. What an ass. It got worse, though. Trump grabbed the embarrassed woman and pulled her in for a clearly unwanted kiss. She managed to get an arm in between them, but Trump still managed to kiss her cheek. This is all on video, folks. This is right there for everyone to see. The disgusting sexual pervert who wants to be our next President can’t dismiss this one with a threat to sue. He can’t pretend that it didn’t happen. Because we can all watch it. Right here .

24148,Constitutional Option Unstoppable: John McCain and Lisa Murkowski Will Vote Yes - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C. —  Sens. John McCain ( ) and Lisa Murkowski ( ) announced on the Senate floor Wednesday that they will not allow a filibuster of Neil Gorsuch, and will instead vote for the constitutional option to restore a   vote to confirm Supreme Court nominations, making that outcome now almost certain. [Earlier during the day Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) claimed that he had the 50 votes he needs —  plus Vice President Mike Pence as a   if needed —  to invoke the constitutional option and confirm President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee.  With his towering stature in the party, both in seniority and later as the 2008 presidential nominee, McCain was seen by some as the de facto chairman of the Gang of 14 effort in 2005 to save the option of filibustering judicial nominees in the future  —   but allowing through many of President George W. Bush’s nominees that were then being blocked by a Democratic filibuster. Ironically, that strategy’s architect was none other than Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) who implemented it in 2003. “The unprecedented nature of the Democrats’ filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee has left me in a difficult position,” the Arizona senator lamented on the state of affairs in 2017, and after surveying years of past practice in Senate confirmations. “I’m left with no choice,” McCain declared. “I will vote to change the rules to allow Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority. ” “Elections have consequences,” McCain affirmed. In this case, that means electing a Republican president and a Republican majority in the Senate. For her part, Murkowski has long supported the Gang of 14, even though she had not been part of it in 2005, so she was another senator to watch in this unfolding historic drama. Speaking shortly before McCain, Murkowski made comments, then announced, “I will not acquiesce to an effort to deny Judge Gorsuch a seat on the Supreme Court. ” “I am left with the undeniable impression that Neil Gorsuch has been nominated to a position that he prepared his whole life to assume,” Murkowski continued. “He is not merely a good choice in my book, he’s the best choice  …     perhaps a justice of historic proportions. ” Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

24150,Small Stocks Threaten Breakdown – Can They Hang On?,"Small Stocks Threaten Breakdown – Can They Hang On? by IWB · October 27, 2016 
by Dana Lyons 
The Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index has violated (for now) the 2 key uptrend lines that we recently identified. 
A main theme recently among both our posts and our quantitative risk analysis has been the battle between weakening market internals and resilient price averages. Despite deteriorating breadth and momentum, most of the major averages had been able to hold above the key levels that we’ve identified. For example, just 9 days ago , we highlighted 2 Up trendlines on the chart of the Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index (RUT). These lines (e.g., the post-2009 and post-February Up trendlnes), we suggested, were the key in determining whether the RUT would maintain its upward trajectory (above the lines), or see an expansion in potential downside. Recently, the RUT had been able (barely) to hold the top side of of the trendlines and maintain its path of least resistance to the upside. That path may have shifted today. 
As these updated charts show, the RUT closed below the 2 key trendlines today – albeit by a fairly slim margin. 
Wide Angle: 
Close-Up: 
While the winds may have potentially shifted following today’s action, the overall message here is the same as it was 9 days ago. Thus, we will repeat what we stated in that post: 
If the RUT should “Continue to hold above the trendlines, the bulls will remain in control and the intermediate-term rally in small-cap stocks can persist further. Should the level give way, however, the bears may have their chance to finally deliver a more serious blow.” 
Absent a quick recovery of the broken trendlines, the bears would appear to have their chance now, especially given the elevated status of our broad market risk assessment. The question is will they finally follow through, or will the small stocks manage to narrowly hang on once again?",0

24153,"At Least 27 Shot, 7 Fatally, in Chicago Over Christmas Weekend - The New York Times","At least 27 people were shot, seven fatally, in a   period in Chicago over Christmas weekend, according to the Chicago Police Department. It was the latest bloody chapter in a city besieged by gun violence. Homicides and shootings, already an    hazard in the city, have skyrocketed since last year, when the numbers were already high. The rise in violence is fueled in part by gangs, whose disagreements range from neighborhood turf wars to disputes over girlfriends. The conflicts often escalate quickly to gunfire. This weekend, one of the victims was an    man who was shot multiple times in the neck and back while he was driving at 1:30 a. m. on Christmas Day in the Gage Park neighborhood, on the city’s Southwest Side. His death would become another entry in a   police log of murder investigations, many with no suspects in custody. Officer Jose Estrada, a spokesman with the Chicago Police Department, said in a telephone interview on Sunday that the total number of homicides so far this year was 745, a 56 percent increase from 476 at the same time last year. This year was the first time in nearly two decades that more than 700 homicides had been recorded in the city, The Chicago Tribune reported this month. Officer Estrada said the total number of shooting victims so far stood at 4, 252, up 47 percent from 2, 884 at the same time in 2015. Data of the shootings over Christmas weekend logged by The Chicago Tribune reflected a relentless crime blotter: Nearly all of the people shot were men, the majority under 30. The brutal cold of a Chicago winter has not been as reliable a deterrent of violence as it has been in the past: 42 homicides have been recorded so far this month, compared with 33 during December last year, according to The Tribune’s data.",0
24157,Британское парламентское расследование не выявило причин для свержения Каддафи | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Ливия Как отмечает в своей новой статье пакистанский исследователь Салман Рафи, расследование британской парламентской комиссии по международным отношениям не выявило каких-либо оснований для свержения правительства Муаммара Каддафи. Несмотря на тот факт, что ливийские войска и уничтожали проамериканские радикально настроенные группы, никакой угрозы для мирных жителей Ливии эти силы не представляли. Более того, тех боевиков, которые не были замечены в каких-либо зверствах и которые при этом добровольно складывали оружие, ливийские войска отпускали восвояси. Однако не только западным обывателям, но и представителям западного политического истеблишмента интервенция НАТО в Ливии подавалась под соусом «защиты мирного населения Бенгази». Более того, как отмечается в докладе, никакие другие варианты кроме вооруженного вторжения, такие как переговоры или санкции, западными политиками даже не рассматривались. В итоге то, что должно было стать «самой успешной операцией НАТО», низвергло Ливию, одну из наиболее состоятельных стран региона, в пучину хаоса и нищеты. В то время как обычные ливийцы могут лишь мечтать о том уровне жизни, который казался им когда-то «нормальным», многие районы страны до сих остаются в руках радикальных группировок, которые творят бесчеловечные преступления с молчаливого попустительства Запада.

24163,California Dems vs. Congressional Republicans over Endangered Species Act - Breitbart,"California Democrats are readying themselves to battle Republicans in Congress over potential attempts to roll back regulations under the Endangered Species Act. [Last month, the Oroville Dam’s spillway malfunctioned, sending gallons of water rushing through an area affecting nearly 200, 000 residents. The damage  —   beyond the spillway itself  —   is estimated to be in the millions.  However, certain U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulations under the Act, which protects endangered species like the   Delta smelt, and which require property owners to consult with the agency before carrying out construction or repairs, could present roadblocks to fixing the damages. According to the San Bernardino Sun, “Section 7 consultations” specifically allow wildlife agencies to determine how projects are carried out in order to prevent harm to protected species. Last month, congressional Republicans took aim at the Endangered Species Act because it could prevent necessary projects from taking place  —   and also, possibly, because of longstanding grievances over the diversion of water from farms to the Delta smelt because of the Act. California Democrats are now pushing back with a state bill that would prevent federal changes from affecting the protection of endangered wildlife at the state level. The California Environmental, Public Health, and Workers Defense Act of 2017, introduced in December by Democratic state Senators Kevin De León (  Angeles) and Henry Stern (  Park) would require the Golden State to implement environmental laws that are equal to or even more stringent than regulations set into law under federal environmental laws. According to the San Bernardino Sun, the bill, SB 54, seeks to ensure that California maintains and strengthens protections for air, water and endangered species, including for worker safety laws. “This is the least we can do to protect our state,” Sen. Stern reportedly said before the Senate Environmental Quality Committee on April 5, the San Bernardino Sun notes. The committee reportedly voted   to move the bill forward. President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for the coming fiscal year would reportedly trim $1. 5 billion, or 12 percent, from the Interior Department’s budget, which could directly affect the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service  —   a move that has some California environmentalists concerned. However, others have argued that existing state and federal regulations already go too far. Some who support the Democratic bill reportedly contend that the Endangered Species Act is in need of reforms that would provide farmers and other property owners with incentives to protect wildlife. The bill’s next stop will be at the State Senate’s Judiciary Committee. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.",0

Trump Jr. was traveling between campaign events in Arizona on Thursday when the woman’s car stalled in front of him. 
Instead of pitching a fit, blaming the woman for getting in his way or just going around the car — like many celebrities in his position would have done — Trump’s eldest son jumped out of his car and helped the stranded motorist push her car to safety. 
Tyler Bowyer, chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Party, was impressed by the young businessman’s reaction to the situation. Advertisement - story continues below 
“I’ve been around a lot of politicians. Most would just freak out or go around,” Bowyer told the Arizona Republic . “But Don Jr. … before you can blink, he’s out there pushing the car.” 
Bowyer took a video of Trump Jr. and two other men pushing the woman’s Chevy Impala out of the roadway and posted it to social media where it has been shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook and retweeted nearly 7,000 times on Twitter, as of Friday afternoon. 
“This just happened in Mesa and this is why I’m voting for (Donald) Trump,” Bowyer wrote on Facebook. “We were on our way from a rally to another event and Donald Trump Jr. hopped out first to help push this ladies (sic) car off the road, get some water and call for help.” 
Trump Jr. and his group also gave the woman bottles of water so she wouldn’t get dehydrated while waiting for help in the 100-degree Phoenix heat. Advertisement - story continues below",0
24169,Mexican Brewery Portrays Trump as Gun-slinging Nazi Mariachi,"A new Mexican beer has a label depicting a   gloomy, mariachi President Donald Trump with a swastika belt buckle. [The “Amigous Cerveza” beer  has the word “amigo” misspelled to allegedly make fun of a mispronunciation of the word by Americans, reported Reuters.  The back label of the brew says the Republican president should be “in a mad house, not the White House. ” The chief executive of brewery, Casa Cervecera Cru Cru, Luis Enrique de la Reguera, was reported to be surprised with the success of the product. The original production was gone within a week. “We knew that a Trump label was going to be controversial, but it’s been selling extremely fast,” he said. Cru Cru designed the beer: similar to a New England pale ale with a hint of mango. The idea came to Cru Cru and his partner in Mexico, Error de Diciembre and Epic Brewing, before the presidential election. The Cru Cru team took to Instagram to wish President Trump a happy birthday. Best birthday ever   …     HBP! A post shared by ima_lore (@ima_lore) on May 25, 2017 at 8:42am PDT,  The Republican angered some when during his speech announcing his run for the presidency in June 2015 he said: When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically. The U. S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems. Thank you. It’s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people. It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably —   probably —   from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine later claimed, “As a candidate, [Donald Trump] started his campaign where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. ” As reported by Breitbart: Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.  border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, it’s common for human traffickers to “to sexually assault or rape the females” en route to the U. S. and the smugglers “usually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree —  a rape tree. ” Furthermore, it is true that as the U. S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47, 000 people in 2014 alone, “nearly all” of the heroin consumed in the U. S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation.

Согласно распоряжению правительства РФ, размещенное на официальном интернет-портале правовой информации, комплекс работ должен быть проведен до 2022 года. В 20173–2018 годах разработают план управления объектом в соответствии с требованием Конвенции об охране всемирного культурного наследия 1972 года, этот документ планируется передать в ЮНЕСКО. Также в 20173–2019 годах должна быть разработана концепция перспективного развития ансамбля Новодевичьего монастыря. 
Как сообщает ТАСС, благоустройство территории историко-культурного ансамбля продлится до 2023 года. Объект избавят от временных хозяйственных построек, будет ликвидирована стихийная парковка туристических автобусов в пределах границ буферной зоны, при этом вблизи памятника появится служебная парковка для нужд Московской епархии Русской православной церкви. Кроме этого планируется создать экспозиционно-выставочный музейный центр, который станет структурным подразделением Государственного исторического музея. 
Напомним, Реставрация Новодевичьего монастыря началась в 2012 году, из-за подготовки проектной документации, в активную фазу она вступила в 2014 году. В марте 2016 года заместитель министра культуры РФ Николай Малаков сообщал ТАСС, что реставрация должна завершиться в 2019 году. Общий объем финансирования, по его словам, составляет 5,2 миллиардов рублей, из них на тот момент уже было освоено 1,5 миллиарда. 
Новодевичий монастырь был основан великим князем Василием III в 1524 году. Он входит в список Всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО. В 2010 году передан Русской православной церкви и в настоящее время находится в совместном ведении с Государственным историческим музеем. 
В марте 2016 года вице-глава Министерства культуры и еще несколько человек были задержаны по подозрению в хищении не менее 60 миллионов рублей, выделенных на реставрацию объектов культурного наследия. 
По данным следствия, в 2012 году замминистра культуры РФ Григорий Пирумов создал преступную группу, участники которой заключали госконтракты с недостоверной информацией и завышенной стоимостью услуг на выполнение реставрационных работ с целью хищения денежных средств. 
В деле пока фигурируют четыре эпизода: хищение средств, выделенных на выполнение реставрационных работ ансамбля Новодевичьего монастыря, Драмтеатра в Пскове, Иоанно-Предтеченского монастыря и музея Космонавтики в Калуге. По словам одного из адвокатов, сумма ущерба составляет более 100 млн рублей. 
Кроме того, как сообщала Pravda. Ru, ранее ФСБ возбудила уголовное дело в отношении некоторых руководящих работников министерства культуры РФ и ряда предпринимателей, подозреваемых в хищении государственных денежных средств, выделенных на проведение реставрационных работ на объектах культурного наследия. 
В рамках дела были заключены под стражу замминистра культуры Григорий Пирумов, глава ФГУП ""Центр реставрации"" Олег Иванов, директор департамента управления имуществом и инвестиционной политики министерства культуры Борис Мазо, глава компании ""БалтСтрой"" Дмитрий Сергеев, управляющий ""БалтСтроя"" Александр Коченов, предприниматель Никита Колесников, глава ФГКУ ""Дирекция по строительству, реконструкции и реставрации"" Борис Цагараев и руководитель проекта ООО ""Стройкомплект"" и АО ""БалтСтрой"" Владимир Сванбек.

24171,سر الكذب الدائم - RT Arabic,"وجد علماء نفس من بريطانيا والولايات المتحدة الأسباب التي تجعل الشخص يبدأ يكذب بانتظام، وقد نشرت هذه الدراسة في مجلة Nature Neuroscience. 
واتضح للعلماء أن كذبة صغيرة تستطيع أن تحفز الجهاز العصبي على التعود على الخداع والكذب أكثر فأكثر. 
وقال نيل غاريت الباحث في قسم الطب النفسي التجريبي في جامعة لندن: ""إنها المرة الاولى التي يثبت فيها أن التصرفات غير النزيهة تتعاظم حين تتكرر"". 
وبحسب تالي شاروت من جامعة لندن: ""سواء أيتعلق الأمر بالخيانة أو بالغش في المسابقات الرياضية، أو بتزوير الحقائق العلمية أو البيانات المالية، يقول الكاذبون انهم بدأوا ببعض الكذب ثم انزلق بهم الأمر إلى ما هو اعظم"". 
وقد شملت هذه الدراسة 80 شخصا تراوحت اعمارهم بين 18 و 55، فعرضت أمامهم صورة عالية الدقة تظهر وعاء مليئا بقطع نقدية. 
وتعين على المشاركين أن يساعدوا شريكا لهم على تقدير قيمة هذه القطع النقدية، ولم يكن في حوزة الشريك هذا سوى صورة باهتة للوعاء وما فيه من مال. 
وطلب من المشاركين في المرحلة الأولى من التجربة أن يجتهدوا في معرفة قيمة القطع النقدية، وقيل لهم أنهم ان فازوا في الاختبار سيجنون المال هم وشركاؤهم. لذا يعتقد الباحثون ان اجاباتهم هنا كانت صادقة. 
واستخدمت نتائج المرحلة الاولى كمعطيات أساسية لتقييم المرحلتين الثانية والثالثة، حين كان تقليل قيمة القطع النقدية أو تعظيمها ينطوي على مصلحة للمشاركين على حساب شركائهم. 
وتقول تالي شاروت: ""الناس يكثرون من الكذب حين تكون في ذلك مصلحة لهم وللشخص الآخر، ربما لان ذلك لا يولد لديهم شعورا بالانزعاج من انفسهم، أما حين يكون في الأمر مصلحة لهم على حساب مصلحة شركائهم، فهم يكذبون اقل، لكن معظمهم صار يكذب اكثر مع الوقت"". 
ولفهم ما جرى في ادمغتهم، خضع 4 مشاركين لتصوير الدماغ بالرنين المغناطيسي أثناء الاختبار. ولاحظ الباحثون أن الجزء من الدماغ المسؤول عن إصدار المشاعر، كان أكثر نشاطا حين كان المشاركون يكذبون لتحقيق مصلحتهم على حساب مصلحة الآخر، وكان يصدر مشاعر سلبية تحد من نطاق الكذب، ولكن مع كل كذبة جديدة، كان أداء هذا الجزء من الدماغ يتراجع، ونطاق الكذب يتسع. 
وتقول تالي شاروت ""هناك نوع من التكيف في المشاعر، من شأنه أن يؤدي إلى انزلاق المرء إلى المزيد من الكذب"". 
ويرى نيل غاريت ان هذه النتائج تؤيد فكرة ان هذا الجزء من الدماغ ينشط حين نتصرف بشكل نراه سيئا أو غير اخلاقي.

24174,Jerry Seinfeld Slammed for ’Offensive’ Black’s Life Matters Tweet - Breitbart,"Comedian Jerry Seinfeld’s tweet to promote the new season of his comedy series, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, offended social media users.

And it’s likely due to the fact that the    star is no fan of what he calls “politically correct nonsense. ” In 2014, Seinfeld slammed the idea of creating comedy strictly through the lens of race, gender, or one’s sexual preference. “It’s more about PC nonsense than ‘Are you making us laugh or not? ’” he said. A year later, Seinfeld doubled down on his   remarks, noting that contemporary college students carelessly use the terms “racist” or “sexist. ” “They just want to use these words,” Seinfeld told radio host Colin Cowhard. “‘That’s racist. That’s sexist. That’s prejudice.’ They don’t even know what they’re fucking talking about. ” Seinfeld’s Comedians, in which the comic riding in a car and sitting in diners sharing a cup of coffee with his famous friends, debuted in July 2012. Seinfeld recently signed a deal to bring the the comedy series to streaming giant Netflix. The 9th season of  Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee premiered on January 5.

24178,Topless ‘Sextremist’ Feminists Grab Trump Waxwork ‘By the B*lls’,"Topless, feminist activists have overrun the unveiling of a wax statue of   Donald J. Trump in Spain, screaming “grab patriarchy by the balls”. [The protestors, from the infamous Ukrainian group FEMEN, grabbed the statue in the crotch area at the event at the Wax Museum of Madrid on Tuesday.  The activist group claimed responsibility for the protest on Twitter, saying: “FEMEN just grabbed Trump’s statue by the balls in Madrid. ” According to Reuters, Museum staff spent several minutes trying to restrain the woman before eventually bundling her out through a back door. FEMEN describes their “ideology” as “Sextremism” “Atheism” and “Feminism” and have become renowned for holding provocative topless protests in churches and other places. Their “objectives” include “provok[ing] patriarchy into open conflict by forcing it to disclose its aggressive antihuman nature to fully discredit it in the eyes of history” and “promot[ing] new revolutionary female sexuality as opposed to the patriarchal erotic and pornography. Gonzalo Presa, head of communications at the museum, called the woman’s protest “unpleasant” and said he had hoped to give a “special welcome” to Donald Trump from Madrid. “If they want to do this they should do it directly to him. This is too easy,” he told a Reuters reporter. Explaining their “ideology” the group claim on their website: “Sextremism is female sexuality rebelling against patriarchy and embodied in the extremal political direct action events. “Sexist style of the actions is a way to destruct the patriarchal understanding of what is the destination of female sexuality to the benefit of the great revolutionary mission. “Extremal nature of sextremism demonstrates intellectual, psychological and physical superiority of female activists from FEMEN over the bandogs of patriarchy. “Unsanctioned format of the sextremism events represents the historical right of the woman to make her protest anywhere at any time and not to concert her action with the patriarchal   structures. “Sextremism is the woman’s mockery of vulgar male extremism and its bloody mayhems and a cult of terror. “Sextremism is a   but highly aggressive form of provocation it is an   demoralizing weapon undermining the foundations of the old political ethics and rotten patriarchal culture. ”",0
24180,Jewish Student Driven from Berlin School by Threats and Violence from Muslim Classmates,"Beatings and abuse from Muslim classmates have been cited by the parents of a Jewish teenager as the reason they removed him from a leading Berlin school. [The    was born in London to a British mother and a German father. According to a report in the Sunday Times, the student was kicked and punched by students of Middle Eastern and Turkish origin so many times he was left fearing for his life. One of the attackers is alleged to have threatened to shoot him with a mock gun he believed was real.  The Central Council of Jews in Germany described the bullying allegations at the Friedenauer Gemeinschaftsschule in Berlin as “  of the ugliest form. ” The Times reports Ferdinand and his parents  —   Gemma, an entrepreneur from London, and Wenzel, a human rights organiser  —   chose a multicultural environment for their son’s schooling. Until recently the family had hosted a Syrian refugee in their Berlin home. “I loved the fact that the school was multicultural . . . the kids and teachers were so cool,” Ferdinand said. Yet within a week of enrolling last November, at a school where almost   of the pupils are from immigrant families, Ferdinand’s troubles began after he let slip that he was Jewish. “First my Turkish friend Emre said he could no longer hang out with me because I was Jewish,” Ferdinand said. “Then other pupils started saying stereotypical things about how Jews only want money and hate Muslims. ” Daily beatings by a gang of pupils, all of immigrant origin, soon followed. These were accompanied by racial insults. “This boy, Jassin, whose parents are Palestinian, asked me if I’m from Israel,” Ferdinand said. “I’ve never been to Israel. He said Palestine will burn Israel and his friends said Turkey will burn Israel. He kept kicking me. “One day he came up to me from behind and he punched me in the back. I became dizzy . . . I had a bruise for a week or two. Every time something bad happened, I told myself I could manage it, but it only got worse. ” The experience of Ferdinand is not an isolated incident in the Berlin school system. Aaron Eckstaedt, principal of the Moses Mendelssohn Jewish High School in Berlin, told the Jewish Chronicle that six to 10 Jewish parents apply to switch their children to his school every year. The requests are generally “in reaction to   statements coming overwhelmingly from Arabic or Turkish classmates,” he said. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, insisted Berlin’s education ministry investigate the school and pinpoint any failings. In his statement, reported in the Juedische Allgemeine weekly paper, he also called on Muslim leaders in Germany to combat “antisemitic tendencies in their ranks with all the determination they can muster. ” As Breitbart Jerusalem has reported,   is rising in a variety of forms in Germany, and is being found to include criticism of the modern state of Israel in general and Jews in particular. The Independent Expert Group on   published its findings in Germany at the end of April on the matter. It found Jews are “increasingly concerned for their safety due to everyday experiences of  ” as the number surveyed who agreed with   statements rose from 28 per cent in 2014 to 40 per cent in 2016.

24181,"Small Town Attack: ’African, Arab’ Men Use Stolen Tools to Terrorise Locals","Police in the small German town of Bad Sobernheim have reported a group of men described as being “African or Arabic origin” who broke into a construction site, stole tools, and used them to attack locals. [The attack, which was reported to have taken place over the weekend of the 25th of March saw a gang of migrants roam around the small town which has a population of only six and a half thousand and attack  .  Police say that the men had broken into a construction site in the town earlier that evening, stealing various tools which they used to torment the people in the town according to a press release from the force. Witnesses to the rampage said the gang numbered between five to seven people who attacked three individuals at around midnight on Sunday morning. Police say that the men were armed with various “striking tools” though did not specify what exact tools they used to attack the residents. The victims of the attack were able to run into a nearby restaurant where they hid from the gang. Shortly afterwards the migrants fled the area, but not before damaging a street sign. Those attacked all described the gang as “persons of African or Arabic origin” police said. Only one person was injured in the attack and authorities have yet to determine a motive. None of the males who participated in the incident have been caught or arrested by police so far and authorities have reached out to the public to help them identify those responsible for the violence. Many migrants settled in Germany during the migrant crisis have been placed in small towns of only a few thousand residents or less over the last year and a half to relieve pressure on the nation’s larger cities. One of the more significant problems for small towns has been the cost of taking care of migrants and many municipalities are expected to go into debt because of the migrant crisis. In one town a migrant home designed for 500 migrants is costing the local government 500, 000 euros per month, despite only 21 migrants living there. In one small town, residents attempted to lay out some ground rules for the new arrivals which included learning German, not harassing girls and exclusively using toilets for defecation. The town residents were labelled as racist for writing up the guidelines by others in Germany. Other areas have reacted negatively to attempts by politicians to bring large amounts of migrants into their towns. One politician in Oersdorf was violently assaulted for trying to encourage large amounts of migrants to be housed there.

24182,GERMANY: Parents outraged after German primary school ‘forces’ children to chant “Allahu Akbar” and “there is no God but Allah” in Muslim prayer,"BNI Store Oct 27 2016 GERMANY: Parents outraged after German primary school ‘forces’ children to chant “Allahu Akbar” and “there is no God but Allah” in Muslim prayer The father of the pupil at the girl’s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. He claimed she had been “forced” by teachers to memorize the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. UK Express (h/t Terry D) The handout read: “Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.” It had been given to the girl during a lesson in “ethics” at the Bavarian school. Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children’s nursery was refusing to acknowledge “Christmas rituals” to accommodate the “diverse cultures” of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils. A spokesman for Kassel explained: “There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.” Migrants now outnumber native children at many schools in Germany as the country has been inundated with Muslim migrants in recent years. More than one million migrants are estimated to have arrived in Germany during the last year alone. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees estimates that another 200,000 Muslims will apply for asylum in 2017.",0

24188,John Elway Puts to Rest Rumors He’s Running for Colorado Governor - Breitbart,"As the field of GOP candidates in the hunt for Governor of Colorado for 2018 grows, Denver Broncos General Manager John Elway is assuring everyone he is not one of them. [Elway again stomped down speculation that he intends to jump into the GOP primary for governor for the Centennial State. Current Governor, Democrat John Hickenlooper, faces a term limit end to his tenure in 2018.  But the Hall of Fame quarterback says he is not interested in running for office right now. “My intentions are to continue to run the Denver Broncos football operations,” Elway told KUSA 9News. “They can run. I’m not running for Governor. For some reason these things continue to come up. ” Just as the   Super Bowl champion (1999 and 1998) quashed rumors of a political career in Colorado, he also insisted he is not interested in taking his football management career to California. Elway has an offseason home in Los Angeles and there has been much speculation that he intends to parlay that home into a job with the L. A. Rams, or the San Diego Chargers if they move to L. A. “I’m working for the Denver Broncos. You can put an end to those,” Elway said. Still, Elway has only one year left on his current Broncos contract and has been in talks about an extension since October. Speculation of a political career, though, isn’t out of the blue where it concerns Elway. A   Republican, Elway ruffled feathers early this year by appearing in an advocacy commercial over the Amendment 71 issue, a measure to make it harder to change the state constitution. Still, state Republicans have wooed Elway to run for one office or another for years and he has thus far always resisted the temptation.

24189,South Africa police clash with protesting students in Cape Town,"More Police move to disperse students protesting outside the parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, October 26, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
Clashes have erupted outside South Africa's parliament as police struggled to disperse students protesting against financial hardships and the deteriorating economic situation in the country. 
The protest on Wednesday outside the national assembly building in Cape Town saw a direct confrontation between the police and about 2,000 students. 
The protesting students were mainly angry at the increased tuition fees in the universities. They also voiced anger at South Africa’s grim economic prospects. 
Other cities across the country have seen similar protests over the past weeks, some of them violent. Officials in Cape Town, Johannesburg and elsewhere have even ordered the temporary closure of the universities to calm down the situation. An injured student is helped by classmates during a protest outside the parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, October 26, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
The clashes on Wednesday came as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered a speech in the parliament to warn about South Africa’s weakening economy, although he vowed that the government would do anything to help students in the country cope with financial problems. 
“We will do everything that is possible to regain normality on our campuses. We want the violence to stop,” Gordhan said, adding, “Many students face financial hardships that undermine their ability to succeed academically.” 
Gordhan said South Africa’s 2016 growth forecast stood at 0.5 percent. He also stated that an extra 17 billion rand ($1.2 billion) would be earmarked for funding university students. 
He warned that a growing sense of political uncertainty in South Africa could seriously harm the country’s financial position in the world. 
“Much more disturbing, and more difficult, is the rise in our own communities of anger and discontent, spilling over into violence and destructive protests,” Gordhan said, adding, “It is not just that our economic outlook is distressed, and there is the possibility of downgrades in credit ratings.” 
Gordhan’s promise of spending cuts and fighting corruption has triggered a new political stand-off in South Africa. He has been ordered to appear in court on November 2 to face charges of fraud in what many see as a direct clash between him and people loyal to President Jacob Zuma. The minister enjoys a good deal of public support over his record in office. 
Some senior members of Zuma’s African National Congress (ANC) have dismissed charges against Gordhan as politically motivated, calling on Zuma and the ANC’s senior figures to resign to save the party from the current political turmoil. Loading ...",0

IN what is probably his ‘last year for it’, 10 year-old Barron Trump has written his letter to Santa… and a transcript has leaked online. 
Although many expected the letter from the son of president-elect Donald Trump to be a word-for-word facsimile of the one Sasha Obama wrote when she was 10, young Barron actually sat down and composed a wholly original missive, which can be read below… 
Dear Santa, 
How are you? I’m good. Really good. Ask anybody. I’m as good as anyone can be. Just so good. 
First of all, I need to inform you of a change in my address. You can deliver everything to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA, I’ll pick everything up there in February, okay? 
Now, for what I want… look, I’m doing pretty okay at the minute, but there’s a few things you could maybe get for my Dad? 
He needs the materials to build a wall that he kinda promised, but has no way of ever delivering. Concrete, rebar, that kind of thing. Enough to run about 1,000 miles, to about 40ft high or so. If you can send over some elves to help build it, that’s cool too. 
I’ve heard my Dad say that he’d also like a waterboard. I’m not sure what it is. Some sort of surfboard thing? Anyways, he’s big into bringing waterboarding back. So throw in one of those. 
Could you also fix it for my half-sister Ivanka to not be related to our family anymore? I think Dad would really like that. 
Also, kill all Muslims. And a surprise. 
Sincerely,",0
24193,Bob Dylan Will Receive His Nobel Prize While on Tour in Sweden - The New York Times,"After months of suspense and typically inscrutable standoffishness, Bob Dylan, the elusive Nobel laureate, will finally accept his literature prize at a meeting with members of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm this weekend. Sara Danius, the Swedish Academy’s permanent secretary, broke the news in a blog post titled “Good News About Dylan” on Wednesday, and a spokeswoman for the Academy confirmed it. A representative for Mr. Dylan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ms. Danius wrote that Mr. Dylan  —   who greeted news of the prize last fall with two weeks of silence and skipped the December ceremony because of “  commitments”  —   would meet with members of the Academy while in town to play two concerts at the Stockholm Waterfront. She said that those behind the prize will “show up at one of the performances” and “hand over” Mr. Dylan’s commemorative diploma and medal in person. “The setting will be small and intimate, and no media will be present only Bob Dylan and members of the Academy will attend, all according to Dylan’s wishes,” Ms. Danius added. Yet some uncertainty still remains. Nobel laureates, who are awarded 8 million Swedish krona, or about $900, 000, are required to give a lecture on their subject within six months of the prize ceremony, which was held on Dec. 10. Mr. Dylan will not deliver his this weekend. His deadline is in June. Ms. Danius wrote: “The Academy has reason to believe that a taped version will be sent at a later point. (Taped Nobel lectures are presented now and then, the latest of which was that of Nobel Laureate Alice Munro in 2013.) At this point no further details are known. ” For the ceremony in December, Patti Smith performed a version of Mr. Dylan’s “A Hard Rain’s   Fall,” while the American ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, read a gracious acceptance speech from the singer. “Not once have I ever had the time to ask myself, ‘Are my songs literature?’ ” wrote Mr. Dylan, a controversial pick because his medium is song. “So, I do thank the Swedish Academy, both for taking the time to consider that very question, and, ultimately, for providing such a wonderful answer. ” More recently, the singer, who rarely engages with the public beyond the stage, gave a lengthy interview to the author and music television executive Bill Flanagan. The chat, which was posted to Mr. Dylan’s official website, covered his new   album of standards, “Triplicate,” in detail, as well as scattered memories of the music business, but mentioned the Nobel Prize not once. In what has proved to be a busy season for Dylanologists, there is still more to pore over: The singer’s new historical archive in Tulsa, Okla. announced on Tuesday that it was officially open to researchers. Because of high demand, those Dylan scholars interested in viewing the 6, 000 artifacts from across six decades must apply for access, showing that their projects qualify for an appointment. A list of everything in the archive, which was previewed by The New York Times last year, is available to both eager researchers and curious super fans online. Among the contents: Lyrics, written in notebooks, on hotel stationery and matchbook covers, along with personal letters, recording contracts and even Mr. Dylan’s leather wallet from 1966, containing “Johnny Cash’s contact information and three business cards. ”",0
24198,"History: Trump Becomes First President to Use Words ’Islamic,’ ’Urban’ in Inaugural Address","President Donald Trump’s inaugural address made history in being the first to use a number of words, paramount among them “Islamic” when referring to the threat of international terrorist actors and his plan to eradicate radical Islamic terror groups. [“We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth,” Trump said in his speech Friday morning after completing his oath of office. He noted in his speech that his foreign policy would also strive not to “impose our way of life on anyone else. ”  President Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama famously refused to refer to groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State as “radical Islamic terrorists,” claiming the term unfairly maligned Muslims who were not members of jihadist groups. The Washington Post notes that Trump’s inaugural address was also the first to use the words “urban” and “infrastructure,” a nod to the core message of city repair and equality of opportunity in his speech. “Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator,” Trump told the crowd gathered in the heart of Washington, DC.

The irony is that the LGBTQWERTY community is almost uniformly liberal. They support the people who are stoning them, throwing them from buildings, and hanging them. They have ceded any influence with the political Right, as no matter what the Right does, they will not get any meaningful Gay support. That means that just or unjust, there is absolutely no upside to supporting Gay issues. There is a small upside from the Christian Right, to pissing on them. 
Meanwhile, although we disagree on some major issues, we are probably their best friends. We are the people who would die to protect them.",0
24203,Iran’s Latest Propaganda Tool: The Clinton-Trump Debates on Live TV - The New York Times,"TEHRAN  —   In the past, Iranians looking to mock the United States would burn cardboard effigies of Uncle Sam or Lady Liberty. But in recent months, as the American presidential election took a series of bizarre turns, Iranians seeking to make fun of the “Great Satan” have ditched the arts and crafts and simply switched on their TV sets. Iran’s state television, a bastion of conservative ideologues, for once interrupted its regular programing about the “murders and crimes committed” by the United States and broadcast all three debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump  —   live. In a country that tightly controls information about the United States and depictions of Western democracy generally, the decision to show the debates was unprecedented but by no means inexplicable: The presidential campaign shows the United States political system in such a poor light,   evidently want it to speak for itself. “We only need to sit back and let these candidates show themselves how idiotic they are,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a conservative analyst and a regular guest on state television. “The best way for us to prove that the U. S. government is corrupt and hideous is by showing these people live on our TV. ” Live, yes, but some parts  —   especially those criticizing Iran  —   were not fully translated. After each debate, analysts discussing the outcome were in unanimous agreement that America, in its current state, “cannot do a damn thing. ” To say that Iran’s political establishment has been thoroughly enjoying the campaign is an understatement. Last week, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the American election “a spectacle for exposing their crimes and debacles. ” Ayatollah Khamenei seized on the campaign’s tawdriest details: accusations of infidelity and sexual assault. “The remarks made by these two U. S. presidential candidates over the last few weeks on immoral issues  —   which are, for the most part, not baseless accusations  —   are enough to disgrace America,” he said during a speech commemorating the 1979 takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran. His supporters responded enthusiastically by shouting, “Death to America. ” Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, was not mentioned by name, but the ayatollah seemed to praise his outspokenness, saying: “People pay more attention to him. ” The candidate, he said, is tapping into genuine American dissatisfaction. “Because the people look at what he says and see it is true,” Ayatollah Khamenei said. “They see it in the facts of their lives. ” Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has been officially  . Many ordinary Iranians have milder feelings for the United States, where over two million of their relatives live. Iran’s leaders, long entangled in a battle for power and influence with the United States in the Middle East, have been emboldened by the American withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan. “America is no longer a superpower in the region. It’s weak in the Middle East. They are now only one of the players,” said Jalal Barzegar, a reformist journalist. “It’s now just a country. ” For Iranians uninterested in watching the debates, Iran’s state television had another option. In recent weeks it has been airing Netflix’s “House of Cards,” called “House of Straw” here because playing cards is considered  . Kevin Spacey’s portrayal of the conniving politician Frank Underwood is the perfect embodiment of the “inhumane face” of American politics, state television officials have said. Apparently, Ayatollah Khamenei has also been watching. In his recent speech, he quoted a line uttered by Mr. Spacey in the series. “‘Shake with your right hand, but hold a rock in your left one,’ as they say themselves,” Ayatollah Khamenei said. “This is the kind of people they are. ”",0

[“America has been divided,” King said, according to the Washington Post. “And the center of America is disappearing, and the violence is appearing in the streets, and it’s coming from the left. ”  Asked whether the shooting was politically motivated, he said he did not know why the gunman did what he did. However, King pointed at anger and demonstrations against Trump, according to the Post: King, in his remarks at the shooting scene, said it was impossible to separate the hyperpartisan climate in Washington  —   especially people protesting Trump  —   with Republican members of Congress being fired upon at a baseball practice. “The divisions within the country, people that can’t accept the results of the election that are determined to try to take this country down, take this organization down,” he said. “This city was filled up with demonstrations the day after the inauguration, where you couldn’t drive down the streets. And we’ve had demonstrations every week since then, sometimes different topics. ” King added: “We do need to focus on what’s happening to the culture in this country. ” The shooter has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson III, 66, of Belleville, Ill. by law enforcement officials. The shooting occurred early Wednesday morning at a park where Republican congressmen and their aides were practicing for an annual baseball charity game played against Democratic colleagues. Democrats were also practicing at the time, but in D. C. An FBI official told reporters at the scene that it was “too early to tell” if the GOP congressmen were targeted or not. Yet, a look at a Facebook page appearing to belong to Hodgkinson showed he was a Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) supporter who bashed Trump several times and liked an   cartoon.",0

24218,Amurexit from NAFTA TPP Wall Street and Global Policeman,"Topics: Hillary Clinton , Donald Trump , 2016 Presidential Election , Brexit , FBI Director Comey Sunday, 13 November 2016 
Despite the continuing wailing and tears and gnashing of teeth from angry Hillary supporters, the Trump Party is officially the winner of the 2016 presidential election. 
Foremost now in all the post-election sound and fury is the new United States of Amurkier, according to analyst Dmitri Globulus, of the website Times Die Hard. 
Hillary and the Clintonistas are lining up all the culprits for the defeat--since that obviously had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton herself--starting with FBI Director James Comey. 
It wasn't her politics of more of the same, including beefing up wars in the middle east, continuing the policies of Obama, and renewing hostility with Russia. 
No, it was Comey. 
Comey was very nasty in announcing new emails had been discovered in Anthony Weiner's computer, which tipped the balance. 
If only he had kept his mouth shut, according to the Clinton DieHards, she would have prevailed. 
Her failure to talk Amurexit had nothing to do with it, whereas Trump continually signaled ""The System is Rigged!"" 
But Dmitri Globulus says Trump was on target, not Clinton. 
""It's basically a grapes of wrath syndrome. Too much imbalance in wealth distribution, severe economic depression, and Government Pretense of a 'recovery' that fooled nobody."" 
Add in free trade ideas and shipping jobs to the cheapest labor markets in the world leaving ordinary citizens out of work and you've got a lot of anger. 
Add in Obamacare with its premiums going up and the Pharmaceutical Industry leaping up its profit margins--more anger. 
Add in stupid wars with the only logic behind them making money for the munitions people and The War Establishment--more anger. 
Add in refugees fleeing somewhere, anywhere, with their countries either blasted economically or from continuing, monstrous war--more anger. 
Add in Washington-As-Usual with its talking heads and scoffing and labeling its opposition ignorant and stupid--more anger. 
The Brexit people across the Atlantic are calling out: ""Welcome to the Club! We're done with the Plutocrat Trans-nationalists!"" 
Many Amurkier people have responded: ""So are we! Time to change it!"" 
The Clintonistas meanwhile continue to enjoy their outrage. Make joseph k winter's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0
24221,"Blog: If Donald Trump Pardons Me, I Would Be Honored To Serve As Secretary Of Agriculture","Email 
One year ago, I was arrested for both statutory rape and possessing child pornography, and I deeply regret my disgusting crimes. Since that fateful day, I’ve been serving a 16-year jail sentence, using every second of that time to reflect on, and repent for, what I have done. I’ve truly learned a lot about myself as a person, and if our president-elect, Donald Trump, were to recognize my transformation and to pardon me, I would be honored to serve as his Secretary of Agriculture. 
In the event Donald J. Trump pardons and then appoints me to his future Cabinet, I, Jared Fogle, current federal inmate and former Subway spokesperson, could think of no greater privilege than to serve our commander in chief, and our country, as the head of our Department of Agriculture. 
It is the Secretary of Agriculture’s sworn duty to provide assistance to our nation’s farmers, as well as to protect farmland and enforce food safety, and if I am let out of jail, I believe I am ready for the task. To have Donald Trump both forgive my child-sex crimes and recognize how useful my deep knowledge of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, hot Italian peppers, olives, and other sub toppings could be to his administration would make my heart swell with pride. 
To serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any Subway sandwich I ever ate, greater than any Subway commercial I ever made, and greater than any large pair of pants I ever wore. 
As someone who has sold hundreds of millions of Subway sandwiches to the American people since the year 2000, I know the burden of working for the public, and I would not let our new president, nor the American people, down. It would be an immense privilege to serve for a full four years, and pending Donald Trump negating my seven federal counts of production of child pornography, I would start that process immediately. 
I lost over 245 pounds and ate thousands of Subway sandwiches before I was arrested for paying for sex with a minor, and I do hope that President-elect Trump considers that fact when making his decision whether or not to pardon and appoint me secretary of agriculture. To serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any Subway sandwich I ever ate, greater than any Subway commercial I ever made, and greater than any large pair of pants I ever wore. 
So, hopefully, the next time I address you, it will be not from my prison cell in Englewood Federal Correctional Institution but from the National Mall, in Washington, D.C. Believe me, the next four years would be incredible not just for me, but for you, should our president-elect look deep into his heart and give the department the spokesperson it deserves!",0

It was 1992, and doubts about Bill Clinton’s integrity, stoked by his marital infidelities and avoidance of the Vietnam War, were the biggest threat to his presidential campaign. Stanley Greenberg, a top Democratic campaign strategist, devised a secret plan to turn around the candidate’s reputation for dishonesty. In the latest episode of The   we talked to Mr. Greenberg about how Mr. Clinton pulled it off, and what lessons it holds for his wife, Hillary, whose image problems as a   today are even greater than her husband’s were in the 1990s, surveys show. As of the latest New York Times poll, 67 percent of registered voters have doubts about her trustworthiness.

24226,ACLU Attorney: Dismemberment Abortion Not ‘Inhumane’ - Breitbart,"An ACLU attorney says the   abortion procedure known as Dilation  Evacuation (DE) or “dismemberment” abortion, is not “inhumane. ”[Maryland House Delegate Sid Saab (R) addressed Rachelle Yeung, public policy counsel for ACLU of Maryland, during a hearing for Maryland HB 1167. The bill, titled the “Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act,” would prohibit “dismemberment” abortions performed primarily during the second trimester of pregnancy.   The dialogue is as follows: Del. Sid Saab (SS) to ACLU attorney Rachelle Yeung (RY): You really think this is unconstitutional? RY: Yes, sir, I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t believe that. SS: Do you think it’s inhumane? RY: I’m testifying on the legal aspects of this bill. SS: Right, but do you think it’s inhumane? RY: No. SS: You don’t? RY: No, sir. In her full testimony prior to questions, Yeung said: A method ban is essentially a ban on abortion prior to viability, which we’ve already heard, would be unconstitutional. Even if it doesn’t ban all forms of abortion, it would ban the safest, as you’ve heard, and most common method of   abortions, which accounts for 95 percent of   abortions. This does create an undue burden on a woman’s ability to seek an abortion, which would be unconstitutional. Seven other states have passed method bans: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas, and West Virginia. And in four of those states, the laws have already been challenged, and, in all four, the laws have been  …    are currently blocked, by court order, from taking effect. So, for these reasons, we are due to issue an unfavorable report on H. B. 1167. Michele Hendrickson, eastern regional director for Students for Life of America, who testified in support of the legislation, reported her own observation that Yeung’s response that dismemberment abortion is not “inhumane” was “something that made the entire room look up from their cell phones and left everyone in shock. Everyone, that is, except for representatives from NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and the ACLU. ” Panelists testifying on the legislation were shown a video, produced by   organization Live Action, that features former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino using medical animation to demonstrate a   DE surgical abortion. During this procedure, an abortionist uses instruments to dismember an unborn baby between 13 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, and then extracts the parts from the uterus.  According to Levatino: After the amniotic fluid is removed, the abortionist uses a sopher clamp  —   a grasping instrument with rows of sharp “teeth”  —   to grasp and pull the baby’s arms and legs, tearing the limbs from the child’s body. The abortionist continues to grasp intestines, spine, heart, lungs, and any other limbs or body parts. The most difficult part of the procedure is usually finding, grasping and crushing the baby’s head. After removing pieces of the child’s skull, the abortionist uses a curette to scrape the uterus and remove the placenta and any remaining parts of the baby. Robin Elliott of Planned Parenthood of Maryland, who testified in opposition to the bill, said dismemberment abortion is a “very safe method” used in abortion.

24228,Twitter Bars Milo Yiannopoulos in Wake of Leslie Jones’s Reports of Abuse - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   For years, one of the main grievances among Twitter users has been the ability of anonymous trolls to send abusive comments to other people on the service. But on Tuesday, Twitter barred one of the most egregious and consistent offenders of its terms of service, Milo Yiannopoulos, in an attempt to show that it is cracking down on abuse. The ban against Mr. Yiannopoulos, a technology editor at the conservative news site Breitbart and known by his Twitter handle, @Nero, follows a campaign of prolonged abuse against Leslie Jones, a comedian and   of the recently released “Ghostbusters” movie. The film and its stars have come under fire from various parts of the internet for months, after it was first revealed that the reboot of the 1984 film would feature an   cast. Ms. Jones in particular has borne the brunt of the online abuse in recent days, especially since the release of “Ghostbusters” in the United States on Friday. Hundreds of anonymous Twitter commenters hurled racist and sexist remarks at the star’s Twitter account, rallied and directed by Mr. Yiannopoulos this week. The news media picked up on the abuse after Ms. Jones began retweeting screenshots of the litany of comments sent to her over the past few days. On Monday evening, Ms. Jones quit using Twitter with a final message of exasperation after days of   abuse. “I leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart,” Ms. Jones tweeted. “All this cause I did a movie. ” In a statement, a Twitter spokesman said: “People should be able to express diverse opinions and beliefs on Twitter. But no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. ” Twitter did not comment directly on Mr. Yiannopoulos’s account or actions of the past 48 hours, but the spokesman said over that period, “We’ve seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension. ” In a brief interview on Tuesday evening, Mr. Yiannopoulos said, “This is the beginning of the end for Twitter. ” “Some people are going to find this perfectly acceptable,” he said. “Anyone who believes in free speech or is a conservative certainly will not. ” The move stops short of providing Twitter’s    users with effective tools to combat trolls and abuse on a much larger scale, an issue that celebrities and everyday users alike deal with on a regular basis. In the past, Twitter, the San   social media company, has faced criticism for its handling of the   GamerGate controversy, as women in the gaming community were increasingly harassed on Twitter  —   often to the point of receiving death threats  —   in the wake of a dispute in the online gaming community. Twitter has said that dealing with abuse and “trust and safety” issues is one of its top priorities, though it has not detailed how it will handle the issues in the future. “We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter,” the company said in a statement. “We agree. ” Twitter said it is investing in improving its tools and enforcement systems, and is in the process of reviewing its hateful conduct policies “to prohibit additional types of abusive behavior and allow more types of reporting, with the goal of reducing the burden on the person being targeted,” according to a statement. Twitter said it expected to detail more of that in the coming weeks.",0

24232,Rutgers Student Fired from Campus Newspaper After Writing ‘Illegal Alien’ in Column,"Toni Airaksinen, College Fix, November 4, 2016 
{snip} 
The Rutgers University student who hosted anti-feminist provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos for his first U.S. college event says the student newspaper fired him Monday because of his conservative views. 
Aviv Khavich published his final column for The Daily Targum Sunday night, arguing that immigration enforcement is not “anti-immigrant.” 
He spoke as an immigrant himself, born in Israel after his Ashkenazi Jewish parents fled Belarus in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse. 
But the trigger for the firing may have been Khavich’s demand that his column include the phrase “illegal aliens” to describe those in the country illegally. 
It was the final straw for the Daily’s editor, who said Khavich repeatedly fought over “stylistic” editing changes to his columns over the past several months. 
{snip} 
But two of his last three [columns] were about immigration. Khavich opposes accepting Syrian refugees into America as a security threat, and his final column Sunday said flatly: “Justice is mass deportation. Justice is respecting my [legal immigrant] family and millions of others like us.” 
Khavich told The College Fix in a phone interview that “every instance of ‘illegal alien’ I wrote was changed to ‘undocumented immigrant’” by his editors. “But I considered it a part of my opinion to not use” the latter term, which he finds “politically correct and also inaccurate.” 
When Khavich complained to his editor about the edited draft, she said the “illegal” edit came from the top: Editor in Chief Dan Corey wanted the column to follow Associated Press Style. 
The AP Stylebook was revised three years ago to disapprove of using “illegal” to describe a person, as opposed to an action, after having affirmed “illegal immigrant” just a year earlier . 
But AP Style also frowns upon “undocumented”–the term used in Khavich’s published column–because the term is “not precise.” Khavich notes that federal law uses the term “alien.” 
His editor was “not happy” after being confronted, Khavich said, and he was fired the next day. 
{snip} 
“At the slightest questioning of their ‘unbiased editing,’ they jump at the excuse to rid themselves of someone who has been challenging their narrative,” he wrote in The Tab. 
“I was writing articles that very strongly challenged narratives,” he told The Fix. “I am sure that it was a termination was based on political bias.”",0
24234,"Anti-Extremism Charity Staff Made Antisemitic, Homophobic Comments","Members of a   Muslim   organisation praised by the Prime Minister have been found to have made numerous   and homophobic comments on social media. [The   charity Odara is believed to have received over £150, 000 of taxpayer money via the government’s   Prevent program, for the work it does in running workshops for women. The charity prides itself on providing what it calls a ‘safe environment for discussion on issues like domestic violence, mental health and extremism’.  But Aysha Iqbal, leader and   of Odara, and outreach worker Tasmiyah Bint Naeem were both found by the Daily Mail to have made numerous comments on Facebook of an   and homophobic nature. Iqbal posted a series of videos suggesting that Israel was behind mass shootings in America. Posting a video entitled: Israel did Sandy Hook, Newtown CT School Massacres says Michael Harris, she wrote: “Truth be told. ” Bint Naeem shared in her colleague’s belief in conspiracy theories, posting a video which claimed   was an “inside job” with the comment “watch and think”. In other posts to the social media platform, she referred to all Israelis as Zionists, a modern   trope, as well as commenting “may Allah destroy Zionists. ” And she expressed homophobic views, saying she would not want to “be in the company of those that are gay” adding that she would not “embrace” homosexuality, she said: “Shoot me for my views  …     don’t care if times have changed. ” Odara was singled out last year by Theresa May, then as Home Secretary, who said she was “proud” to support the group in “working to stand up against the extremists who seek to divide us”. The group was also singled out by Dame Louise Casey in her recent report  —   which was highly critical of   by British Muslim communities  —   as an organisation providing an example of how Muslim women with poor English language skills are being encouraged to integrate. Yet sources from two groups who have considered working with Odara told the Mail that they had last year decided against it thanks to the group’s “homophobic and   views”. When asked for comment, Iqbal said the posts were from 2013, before she began working on   matters. She claimed the comments had been “tongue in cheek” but that she now realised how ‘inappropriate and offensive it appeared without the context’. She added that Bint Naeem had stopped working for Odara last month. Bint Naeem said: “I want to make it very clear I am not homophobic or  . What has been picked up on are online profile statuses from a long time ago  —   since then I have developed personally and professionally and reject any of the views in question. ” Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said: “Again this is an example of how the Home Office has been duped into supporting, recommending and funding organisations that spring up from nowhere. “It is wrong that such groups are receiving Government money without first understanding what their role is in the community and whether they have any positive track record. ”",0
24235,CNN’s Acosta: Trump Only Calling on Conservative Media Can Only Be Described As ’The Fix Is In’ - Breitbart,"On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Inside Politics,” CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta stated that in the last three news conferences President Trump has done “all of the questions to the American news media have been handled by conservative press,” and “there’s no other way to describe it but, the fix is in. ”  Acosta said, “[I]n the last three news conferences, Wolf, all of the questions to the American news media have been handled by conservative press, and I think, Wolf, there’s no other way to describe it but, the fix is in. This White House, this president, does not want to answer questions, critical questions, about his associates, his aides’ contacts with the Russians during the course of that campaign, just as his national security adviser is being run out of this White House on a rail. And so, I think that this only, you know  —   they may think that this is being cute, or they think this is strategic in terms of trying to shield the president from questions, but those questions can only be shielded for so long, Wolf. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

24242,Man gets only one missed call from Mom,"Topics: Parents , Phone calls , mom   
Local Mom reportedly called her son just once, and hasn't left any messages whatsoever asking him to call her back when he gets this. 
Fort Wayne, IN - Worried sick, 29-year-old Barry Oldman reported Thursday he got just one missed call from his mother. 
""I went to the shower, and when I was out, there was this single missed call from Mom on my phone,"" said Oldman, who had been living away from his parents since he was 18. "" No more calls, no messages, nothing! It's been two hours, and she still hasn't called me again."" 
Barry Oldman has reportedly checked with his girlfriend, best friend, and even former roommate to see if his mother called any of them to ask for his whereabouts. However, not a single one of Barry's friends has been approached by Mom within the last 24 hours. 
""She hasn't even called the office! I don't understand what's going on. Only last week, when I forgot my phone at home, she went as far as calling my karate instructor. This time - nothing."" 
Sources confirm the 55-year-old Mom is alive and well, and was seen talking on the phone to her neighbour, which indicates her phone isn't broken or anything. Oldman finds the news alarming. 
""It's just so unlike her. I was hoping something was wrong with her phone, but clearly it's working just fine. I'm beginning to think she might have stopped caring about my well-being. It's even possible that she doesn't love me anymore, but I'm doing my best to steer away from that thought."" Make Alice Malice's  ",0
24243,WSJ: National Enquirer Shielded Donald Trump From Playboy Model’s Affair Allegation,"By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 4, 2016 Tabloid owner American Media agreed to pay $150,000 for story from 1998 Playmate of the Year, but hasn’t published her account with Bruce Willis MICHAEL ROTHFELD and LUKAS I. ALPERT 
The company that owns the National Enquirer, a backer of Donald Trump , agreed to pay $150,000 to a former Playboy centerfold model for her story of an affair a decade ago with the Republican presidential nominee, but then didn’t publish it, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the matter. 
The tabloid-newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early August with Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. American Media Inc., which owns the Enquirer, hasn’t published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to his current wife, Melania. 
Quashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as “catch and kill.” In a written statement, the company said it wasn’t buying Ms. McDougal’s story for $150,000, but rather two years’ worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man. “AMI has not paid people to kill damaging stories about Mr. Trump,” the statement said. 
Ms. McDougal expected her story about Mr. Trump to be published, people familiar with the matter said. American Media didn’t intend to run it, said another person familiar with the matter. Ms. McDougal didn’t return calls for comment.

24244,BOMBSHELL: Hillary Clinton’s Leaked Audio Proves She Rigs Elections,"BOMBSHELL: Hillary Clinton’s Leaked Audio Proves She Rigs Elections Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This 
Astonishing, newly released leaked audio of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has just surfaced, and what it reveals is damning. In her own voice, we hear the corrupt Democrat telling reporters that elections can and should be rigged to ensure who wins. This throws the validity of every government on earth in the shredder because she isn’t only talking about rigging American presidential elections. 
Since the FBI reopened their investigation into the criminal Democrat and Hillary seeks a powerful position to dictate the lives of others, it’s important to hear this audio. She is blatant when she say elections shouldn’t take place unless we make “sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” 
Hear it from her own mouth: 
Hillary clearly said, “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. ” 
This conversation took place in 2006 during a discussion with Eli Chomsky, an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press. At the time, Hillary Clinton was running for a “shoo-in re-election” as a U.S. senator. 
Her trip, making the rounds of editorial boards, brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. Her conversation was secretly recorded, and the audio hasn’t been released until now. 
According to Chomsky, this little audio clip has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006 — until now. Election rigging Democrat, Hillary Clinton 
It proves she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. With massive amounts of voter fraud already being reported in favor of the most criminal and corrupt politician of our time, in combination with this audio, it’s hard to deny that Hillary wouldn’t rig the election to win. 
Luckily, Americans are wising up to her disturbing antics. We all saw her cheat during the debates , and the proof came out in leaked emails, thanks to WikiLeaks. 
It’s important to hear this, coming directly from Hillary herself, and we can all tell that it is her voice. We all know she’s rigging this election to beat Donald Trump, but she obviously has had her hands in rigged elections before. 
It is hard to say how many elections across the globe she has influenced or just stolen. Hillary Clinton will stop at nothing to grab even a small amount of power, and she continues to prove she is as corrupt as they come.",0
24245,Paul McCartney Sues to Get Back His Beatles Songs - The New York Times,"In the latest twist in a legal issue that has galvanized musicians, Paul McCartney filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday against the music publisher   over ownership of some of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Mr. McCartney’s suit is over what is known as copyright termination: the right of authors  —   or any creators  —   to reclaim ownership of their works from publishers after a specific length of time has passed. It was part of the 1976 copyright act and in recent years has become a potent force in the music industry as performers and songwriters have used the law to regain control of their work. In Mr. McCartney’s suit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for the singer detailed the steps they have taken over the last nine years to reclaim Mr. McCartney’s piece of the copyrights in dozens of Beatles songs he wrote with John Lennon, including “Love Me Do,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “All You Need Is Love. ” That process involved filing numerous legal notices, which, the suit says, should be enough to guarantee that   would return the rights to Mr. McCartney, starting in October 2018. But the suit contends that late last year, after the band Duran Duran lost a copyright suit in Britain, executives at   began to suggest to Mr. McCartney’s lawyers that the rule might not apply to his songs. In the Duran Duran case, a judge ruled that the band’s original contract was governed by British law, which barred it from reclaiming rights in the United States. Under United States law, this power cannot be waived by contract. As Mr. McCartney’s suit notes, he and Mr. Lennon signed a series of publishing contracts in Britain beginning in 1962. The suit contends that in a series of remarks and emails to Mr. McCartney’s lawyers,   executives alluded to the Duran Duran case and refused to confirm that he could reclaim his rights. The suit asks for a declarative judgment that Mr. McCartney would not be violating any contract by exercising his termination rights. In a statement,   said that it had “the highest respect for Sir Paul McCartney” and that it worked closely with Mr. McCartney and the Lennon estate. But the company added, “We are disappointed that they have filed this lawsuit, which we believe is both unnecessary and premature. ” For many musicians, especially those who had hits decades ago, copyright termination has become a powerful means to reclaim their work and to gain financial leverage with the record companies and music publishers that represent them. When Prince’s classic albums were nearing the point at which he could reclaim them, he struck a lucrative new deal with his label, Warner Bros. to let the company continue to release his music. And in the music industry, there is no more valuable catalog than the songs of the Beatles. Michael Jackson purchased the rights to those songs in 1985, and 10 years later he formed   as a joint venture with Sony. Last year, Sony bought out the share of Mr. Jackson’s estate for $750 million. In a note referring to a standard legal threshold, Mr. McCartney’s lawsuit includes a major understatement. “The copyright interests at issue in this case,” the suit says, “are worth well in excess of $75, 000. ”",0
24248,"Joint Drills Between China, Saudis To ‘Fight Terrorism’","Joint Drills Between China, Saudis To ‘Fight Terrorism’ 10/31/2016 
SPUTNIK NEWS 
China is improving its Special Forces combat capability to protect national interests abroad. Sputnik spoke with Russian experts about the first antiterrorist drills of the Special Forces of China and Saudi Arabia. 
The joint drills demonstrating combat skills and tactics took place for two weeks on the ground, in the vicinity of the Chinese city of Chungqing. 
The drills came to an end on Thursday and according to reports, 25 members of the Special Forces from each side took part in the exercises. Among the observers were Afghan military experts, who drew attention to the training that was focused on hostage rescue and improvement of overall combat training. 
Saudi Arabia is the first country in the Arab East with whom China has held bilateral military exercises. 
Expert from the Diplomatic Academy of China, Gao Fei, believes that it is natural for China and Saudi Arabia to have a partnership in this sphere. 
“Saudi Arabia is a major regional power and the largest oil-producing country. It competes with Russia for the title of the world’s leading oil producer. In regard to oil reserves, it also holds the first place in the world,” Fei said. 
He further said that the country plays an important role in economics, politics and security in the whole region. In short, Saudi Arabia is an influential regional power. 
According to Fei, “Last month, China surpassed the US as world’s largest importer of oil. Cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia as an importer and supplier of oil shows mutual benefit and common interests.” 
In addition, China is already a major player in the international arena; its diplomacy has its own specifics. It not only gives meaning to its own interests, but also in international affairs takes the role of the responsible power. 
The expert further said that in the long term “cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia will contribute to solving existing global problems, form a new world order, help search for consensus on specific issues and contribute to expansion joint interest.” 
The choice of Saudi Arabia as China’s partner to conduct anti-terrorist exercises is not surprising, according to an expert at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, Ajdar Kuratov. 
Kuratov said that Saudi Arabia is the main economic partner of China in the Middle East, a region where growth of China’s presence is particularly noticeable. 
China’s leadership is likely quite concerned with terrorism against the country and its citizens. Cases such as hostage taking on airplanes and other public places and attacks on public buildings are a big concern for the country.",0
24249,Kevin Annett reviews the past few years of the ITCCS | Oct. 15th 2016 [VIDEO],"Kevin Annett reviews the past few years of the ITCCS | Oct. 15th 2016 
Published on Oct 20, 2016 In this interview with Ella Ster Kevin Annett reviews the work of the ITCCS in the past years and in particular the year 2014. This was an important year for the ITCCS (International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State), as the organisation got more and more momentum and started to reveal serious crimes committed by the Vatican, European royals and political leaders. Kevin reflects on the break with Alfred Webre who completely distanced himself from the ITCCS and it’s work. 
As a result the initial momentum seemed to have stagnated, although behind the scenes the investigations into the crimes committed by religious leaders and heads of state continued. In order to pick up the pieces we look back at some of the dossiers and witness statements that were revealed at that time and in particular in regards to the revelations involving the Dutch and Belgium royals and Dutch political top. We discuss specific details that were brought up by the Dutch witnesses Toos Nijenhuis and Anne Marie van Blijenburgh in 2013-2014. The latter testified about torture parties and human hunting parties that involved children as prey, ordered by and paid for by the former Dutch Queen Beatrix, organised by her previous husband Kees van Korlaar, and attended by the Dutch political establishment, including the present Prime Minister Mark Rutte. 
We also talk about the dark forces behind ritual abuse and why Kevin likes to focus on the human aspect of things. Apart from restoring justice, the work of the ITCCS also involves creating awareness and inspire people to reclaim their own power. In order to end the energy transfer that does not only take place during ritual abuse, but also in other areas of society, people need to realize that the authority lies within themselves.",0
24251,Does Cannabis Heal The Brain After A Concussion?,"posted by Eddie A concussion is a minor traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by a blow to the head. A person can also suffer deleterious effects from sub-concussions, which are repeated minor assaults to the head. These assaults can lead to a TBI. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a way to prevent damage from concussions before they occur? What about a way to speed up the healing process? Medical scientists point to cannabis as a potential solution. But, can the herb really heal a concussion? Cannabis has shown a wealth of potential in traumatic brain injury. Unique properties of the herb may help the brain repair itself after trauma, including trauma from a concussion. Overall, there are three main characteristics that make cannabis a promising treatment for concussions and other forms of head trauma. These include, 1. Reduced brain inflammation The cannabis plant contains neuroprotective antioxidants. These neuroprotectants have many functions, including preventing stress-related damage and reducing inflammation in the brain. One major impact of a concussion or any sort of head trauma is increased neural inflammation. A 2014 study from Tel Aviv University found that microdoses of psychoactive THC reduced brain swelling in rodent models. The researchers write, Our results suggest that an ultralow dose of THC that lacks any psychotrophic activity protects the brain from neuroinflammation-induced cognitive damage and might be used as an effective drug for the treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. 2. Neuroprotection These same anti-inflammatory effects may prove very useful in treating a concussion. Surprisingly, the US government also thinks that cannabis is a promising treatment for head injury. The Feds currently hold a patent on nonpsychoactive CBD as a neuroprotective agent. In the patent application , they write, The cannabinoids [in cannabis] are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and HIV dementia. So, even the US government admits that compounds in the cannabis plant may decrease the damage from head and brain trauma, as well as from strokes, oxygen deprivation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Further, research from 2013 found that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a crucial role in the brain’s ability to repair itself. The ECS is the pathway in which cannabis engages with the body. The study articulates that therapeutic cannabinoids may provide protection against nerve cell damage after acute injury. 3. Pre-treatment with cannabis prevents damage 
There is some evidence that pre-treatment with cannabis can help protect against possible concussions associated with certain occupations. This includes professional athletics, horseback riding, and other lifestyle activities that make a person more susceptible to concussions. This doesn’t necessarily mean smoke some herb every day. Rather, this may be a case where having a little CBD oil on hand or using it as a dietary supplement may be beneficial. In an interview with Fox News, Dean Petkanas, CEO of KannaLife Sciences, explains , You have a repository of chemicals in the plant. But, more prominantly we’ve found in some preclinical research that cannabidiol (CBD) acts as a neuroprotectant. So, in the parlence of pharmacutical science, we could be using that as a prophilaxis against repetative concussive injury. Simply stated, pharmaceutical companies are hoping to make drugs that would prevent brain damage from concussions before they happen. While much of the research has focused on CBD, preclinical research shows that psychoactive THC may be helpful as well. A 2014 study found that patients with traumatic brain injury who had detectable levels of THC in their systems at the time of an accident were less likely to die from brain trauma. Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is a complex condition that sometimes follows a concussion. The symptoms pf PCS can last for months after the initial brain injury. According to the Mayo Clinic , some of the symptoms include, Headaches",0
24252,Cannes Film Festival Bans Streaming-Only Movies Going Forward - Breitbart,"Taking a stand against Netflix and other video streaming services, the Cannes Film Festival will ban any films that are solely digitally distributed from entering the festival starting next year.

The Cannes Film Festival and Netflix have had a rocky relationship for some time now, leaving many surprised when Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories  —   both distributed by Netflix  —   were included in the festival lineup. Many Netflix films had previously been refused entry, and festival officials previously advocated for the “discouraging” of Netflix’s online distribution platform. The two Netflix films in question will be receiving a theatrical release in the US, but festival officials stated that “no agreement has been reached” to release the films in French cinemas and that the effort to reach one was made “in vain. ” Festival Officials did clarify that their new   rules will go into effect next year, allowing Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories to enter the competition this year: Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

24257,Court rules that a medical marijuana card will prevent you from buying a gun,"Court rules that a medical marijuana card will prevent you from buying a gun Nov 15, 2016 0 0 
( Minds ) The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has decided that if you have a medical marijuana card, you can’t buy a gun because it “raises the risk of irrational or unpredictable behavior with which gun use should not be associated.” 
Seems somewhat interesting, as you see people stumbling over at the bar from alcohol use.

24258,Witches Unite to Cast ‘Binding Spell’ on Trump and Followers,"A group of witches is attempting to use black magic to neutralize U. S. President Donald Trump by casting a “binding spell” to prevent him from governing. [The “mass spell to bind Donald Trump” will be performed at midnight on every waning crescent moon beginning Friday, February 24, “until Donald Trump is removed from office,” the group’s website states.  The mass ritual will allegedly be repeated again March 26, April 24, May 23, June 21 (the summer solstice) July 21, and August 19. The spell also invokes evil on “those who abet” Trump, which would seem to appear to cover his staff and political nominees, and perhaps the millions who voted for him as well.  The spell involves such items as an unflattering photo of Trump, a tower tarot card, a tiny stub of an orange candle, a pin or small nail, water, salt, a feather and an ashtray. “This binding spell is open source, and may be modified to fit your preferred spiritual practice or magical system,” the site explains. What is critical is “the simultaneity of the working” as well as “the mass energy of participants. ” “Some   are doing a variation of this as a group working, while a number of solitary practitioners are planning to connect and livestream via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media,” the site explains. In reaction, a number of Christian groups and individuals have promised to pray for Mr. Trump, asking God’s blessings on his work and on the nation.

Trump so that “he may fail utterly, that he may do no harm. ” Calling on the spirits to work the same harm on “all those who enable his wickedness and those whose mouths speak his poisonous lies,” the hex beseeches the spirits to “bind them in chains, bind their tongues, bind their works, bind their wickedness. ” The climax of the spell involves a crescendo “with increasing passion” ending by blowing out the orange candle while “visualizing Trump blowing apart into dust or ash. ” Follow Thomas D.

It’s possible for even the average joe to make a lot of money through running their own IRS approved charity. A while back this scheme was brought to light here in Arizona. I personally know some of the players and I wasn’t surprised to learn how incestuous their organization was. What you do is set up a charity. Then have trusted friends and family do the same. Choose a good name like ‘Feed the Suffering and Starving Babies’ i.e. something that tugs at the heartstrings and then solicit donations. Who wouldn’t want to help starving babies. Then, within your charity network (of maybe ten separately named and owned charities) donate to each others charities over and over again passing around the same money. On your IRS Form 990 it looks like you gave away 10X more than you received. Pay yourself a nice salary and travel expenses. Rinse and repeat.

24271,WHAT EVERYDAY LIFE IS REALLY LIKE IN CUBA UNDER RAÚL CASTRO,"Home › WORLD NEWS › WHAT EVERYDAY LIFE IS REALLY LIKE IN CUBA UNDER RAÚL CASTRO WHAT EVERYDAY LIFE IS REALLY LIKE IN CUBA UNDER RAÚL CASTRO 0 [10/28/16] Cuba is like going back in time. 
It’s old and dirty. 
There’s no advertising, probably because there’s nothing to sell. The only billboards are propaganda for the dictatorship, with the faces of Fidel or Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. 
You hear on the radio again and again “in 1958,” or “since the Revolution,” followed by news on Venezuela: ” …the monopolization of private supermarkets of the right and their allies…the international press…thanks to public policies of the Venezuelan government…famine has declined…” 
Money is the key factor determining how a person is treated. If you are a foreigner, things are great, given that apart from having money, the regime forces Cubans to try to “make a good impression” — though it is difficult to pretend. The government behaves as if foreigners were royalty and Cubans were commoners. The same happens with Cuban-Americans who fled the island and return to visit, because they come back with purchasing power. 
Cubans work for practically nothing. The average salary for a Cuban is US $20. A nurse earns $40 per month. A teacher earns $20 per month and a doctor earns $60 per month. 
There are two markets in Cuba: the Cuban peso market and the dollar market. The dollar market has decent products, while poor quality products are valued in Cuban pesos. With the salary of a Cuban, the possibilities are limited to buying products in pesos, because only foreigners can buy products in dollars. 
Usually, when one goes to the market looking for a food item, it is not available. Sellers say they might have it tomorrow, but they rarely do. Other times, sellers do not have any money for giving change to the customers, or no packaging like napkins, plates, cups, bags, etc. 
Each family has its own “sales control for food items” book, which indicates the amount of food that families can buy from the government. Often, they are the only things accessible and reasonably priced for a Cuban salary. 
Fruits, vegetables and meat are not part of the Cuban peso system, so not everyone gets to enjoy such things. The sales control book only includes rice, beans, sugar, coffee and pasta. Together, they still aren’t enough to form a healthy diet. Post navigation",0

[Candidate Rep. Keith Ellison’s decision to share the microphone with CAIR director on Wednesday afternoon highlights the willingness of party activists to deepen their alliance with the small number of radical Muslim voters living in the United States, despite the huge ideological conflicts between the party’s liberal base and the Muslim groups’ toxic Islamic ideology and aggressive Arab politics.  Ellison is a leading candidate to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who will be chosen by a party vote in late February. He has public support from the Democrats’ leader in the Senate. Sen. Chuck Schumer, but faces growing opposition from former labor secretary Tom Perez. The press conference was called to protest President Donald Trump’s popular policy to curb immigration of people with “hostile attitudes. ” Both Ellison and Awad insisted the hostile attitudes policy is   even though it only seeks to exclude people who: do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law   …     those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Ellison is already facing criticism for his closeness to the Islamic groups. For example, the   League flipped from support to opposition. His public appearance with Awad could add to his political problems. In a Tweeted photograph from Ellison’s office, Awad is the partly bald man with a red scarf standing to left of the microphones.

Zeiger October 28, 2016 He’s survived. I guess some Jew’s prayer remains unanswered tonight. 
While there was the makings of a tragedy, the heavens themselves have intervened to keep the Glorious Leader’s lieutenant safe and sound. 
While there is currently any evidence that this accident was caused by human malfeasance, I’ll just go ahead and assume this was conjured by the Kabbalistic magic of vengeful Rabbis trying to thwart the God-Emperor’s rise to power. 
ABC news : 
A charter aircraft carrying Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence slid off the runway Thursday night while landing at LaGuardia Airport in the New York City borough of Queens, prompting a temporary closure of the entire airport. 
About an hour and a half after the incident, one of LaGuardia’s two runways has reopened for arriving and departing flights. The FAA said the airport’s other runway will remain closed indefinitely pending clearing of the aircraft. Immediately back into action. 
According to the FAA, there were no injuries among the 37 people onboard the Boeing 737, which was arriving from Fort Dodge, Iowa. 
Pence tweeted, “So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!” So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!

According to an ABC News reporter on the aircraft, the GOP vice-presidential candidate came back to check on everyone on the plane and said there was mud on the windows and the plane had skid onto the grass. 
According to The Associated Press, the plane made a rough impact when it landed. The AP also reported that the pilot slammed on the brakes and passengers could smell burning rubber.

On one hand, whenever I hear about airplane shenanigans involving high-level American politicians, my first reflex is to assume some kind of nefarious plot. But things seem relatively straightforward here. 
It was raining, the runway was slippery, and the plane just had a rough landing. 
But if anything, this event will still help the Trump campaign. Because of all the scandals involving the Clintons these days, many people will have a vague suspicion that this might have been an attempt on Pence’s life by system agents. People are already speculating in that direction on Twitter. 
Again, there is not reason as of yet to seriously entertain conspiracy theories. But that doesn’t mean those perceptions don’t exist. And it doesn’t mean they don’t affect the election.",0

24277,Ireland Would Take In 2nd Child Refugee But Too Busy Letting Down Its Own Children,"0 Add Comment 
FOLLOWING inquiries made by Barnardos CEO Fergus Finlay, it was revealed that Ireland has spared neglecting refugee children here in Ireland by limiting the number the country has taken into just one. 
“We’ve a lot on our plate at the minute, and we’ve to concentrate on the children we have in places like Direct Provision Centres before taking on the task of letting down even more vulnerable and exposed children,” the government confirmed in a statement earlier today. 
A date for the expected arrival of a second orphaned child of the Syrian War has not been put forward yet by any State agency, but optimists within the government remain characteristically upbeat. 
“Don’t use my name but I’d say we could even have a third child land in Ireland by 2050,” a nervous unnamed government TD shared. 
“This is serious, as many as 25% of children here are technically living in poverty so we’ve a responsibility to neglect those children through a lack of State investment and government solutions before we can neglect refugees, God knows how many inquiries into how the country has failed children are ongoing at the moment, but we’ve got to prioritise them, it may sound selfish but it’s common sense,” a spokesman for the government confirmed.

24279,Climate Scientists Spread Panic: ‘Ten Years’ to Save the Earth,"In the latest in radical climate doomsaying, a new report warns that fossil fuel consumption will need to be reduced “below a quarter of primary energy supply by 2100” to avoid possibly disastrous effects on global temperatures. [In their report, titled “Pathways for balancing CO2 emissions and sinks,” a team of eight scientists warns that “anthropogenic emissions need to peak within the next 10 years, to maintain realistic pathways to meeting the COP21 emissions and warming targets. ”  The statement was immediately repackaged by environmentalists to read: “Scientists say we have ten years to save the earth. ” As is always the case in studies of this sort, the scientists juggle dozens of variables, none of which is entirely predictable and which taken together tell us virtually nothing about the future of the environment. Although the scientists admit that “there are significant uncertainties associated with projecting energy consumption several decades into the future,” they fail to acknowledge a number of even greater uncertainties implicit in their calculations. Despite their valiant efforts to produce trustworthy projections, the scientists rely on basic presumptions that are contested by extremely capable minds within their own field. Dr. Duane Thresher, a climate scientist with a Ph. D. from Columbia University and NASA GISS, has stated bluntly that it is “mathematically impossible for climate models to predict climate. ” Appealing to corollaries of the   “Butterfly Effect,” Thresher said that   climate forecasting is “a quintessential example of this phenomenon” because of the elevated number of variables playing into climate phenomena. “Climate models are just more   weather models,” Thresher has noted, “which have a theoretical maximum predictive ability of just 10 days into the future. ” “Predicting climate decades or even just years into the future is a lie, albeit a useful one for publication and funding,” he said. Undaunted, the team of scientists has declared that achieving global, net decarbonization of human activities “would halt and even reverse anthropogenic climate change through the net removal of carbon from the atmosphere. ” Among the many unproven assumptions behind this assertion is the implied claim that   climate change (itself a contested concept) is a function solely of carbon emissions, such that “net decarbonization” would halt or reverse it. Here the scientists state as fact what is by all accounts very much an unproven hypothesis. In recent studies, plants have been found to adapt to a greater carbon concentration in the atmosphere, unexpectedly accelerating their ability to assimilate carbon, something unaccounted for in the new report. Moreover, there is still significant debate within the scientific community regarding the precise relationship between carbon presence in the atmosphere, global temperatures and the health of the planet. While this study takes for granted that carbon dioxide is an evil that must be severely restricted, other eminent scholars have suggested that the contrary is true. One such scientist, Dr. William Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, has insisted that the earth can handle substantially more carbon dioxide than is currently found in the atmosphere and would actually benefit from a higher concentration. “We’ve heard that CO2 is a demon molecule that causes global warming,” Happer has stated, whereas in reality more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere produces increased crop yields and a greener planet. According to Happer, an increase in carbon dioxide would only benefit both plant life and human life. Similarly, Dr. Indur Goklany, who has previously represented the United States on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has asserted that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally”. The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain,” he said in a 2015 paper titled “Carbon Dioxide: The Good News. ” Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome",0

The number of abortions performed at Planned Parenthood, however, has increased, as have its taxpayer funding and profits. “Despite reports that the number of abortions performed in the United States is declining, Planned Parenthood once again reports an increase in the number of human lives ended in their facilities: 328, 348 abortions last year,” says Americans United for Life’s president Catherine Glenn Foster. “Additionally, despite their repeated claims that American women rely on them for   health care services, many of their   services have continued to decrease. ” #Regram (@mayasworld): @TheLipstickLobby and their new lippie “Kiss my Pink”. 100% of net profits go to@PlannedPar  …     https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   The Lipstick Lobby (@TLipstickLobby) May 24, 2017,  Congressional legislation aimed at eliminating Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding also seeks to redirect that funding to other community health centers that provide more expansive services and do not perform abortions. “It’s time to redirect Planned Parenthood’s funding to community health centers,” said Susan B. Anthony president Marjorie Dannenfelser. “They outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by an average of 20 to 1 nationwide and are more comprehensive and accessible to the poor. ” “Taxpayers would be disentangled from the grisly abortion industry and get a better return on their investment in women’s health,” she added.

ST. LOUIS—Saying he has a pretty good hunch about how much more rejection and fatigue each of his friends can withstand, local man Eric Mueller, 27, told reporters Monday that he can tell which one will be the first to abandon his dream. “My buddy John [Herrera] is a great musician, but I can just hear it in his voice whenever we talk that he only has a few more months left in him before he falls back on his marketing degree,” Mueller said, noting the amateur singer-songwriter’s insistence on living in a one-bedroom apartment in the hippest part of town pretty much guaranteed he would turn his back on his life’s passion within the next year. “After him, though, it gets a little tougher to say. There’s my old roommate Tom [Halverstadt], who’s clearly getting fed up with rejections from book publishers, and my friend Caleb [Larsen], who just wouldn’t be able to handle being part of a second failed startup. They’re both definitely going to give up on the one thing they truly love doing, but between the two of them, it’s too close to call.” Mueller then assured reporters that despite only a handful of sales in the past several years and having to pay $240 a month out of pocket for health insurance on top of his rent, he was in the indie comic book business for the long haul.

24295,Is It Safe To Use Expired Prescription Drugs?,"Backdoor Survival October 29, 2016 
The topic of using expired prescription drugs comes up frequently in survival and preparedness circles. Although there are many articles detailing with the efficacy of outdated meds, one question I get over and over again is “what do I do when the meds run out?” 
Whereas there is no single clear answer, one thing we can all start to do now hangs on to our old, unused meds. For the most part and with very few exceptions, they will be viable for two to twelve years beyond their expiration date. The secret is to keep them in a cool, dark, location that is not too dissimilar from your food storage. 
In another exclusive article for Backdoor Survival, Dr. Joe Alton, a medical doctor who is well versed in survival medicine, is here today to give us an update on the use of expired drugs in a survival setting. In addition, for those of you that have asked, he is providing us with links you can use to initiate your own research on this important topic. 
Of course, as with anything preparedness related, let your own good judgment prevail. 
An Update on Expired Drugs in Survival Settings 
In normal times, replacing expired medicines isn’t a major issue. You call your physician and get a refill for “fresh” meds. Medicine bottle descriptions and those in print and online sources tell you to discard any drug that has gone expired, a recommendation so common that it’s considered standard. 
You might be surprised to know, however, that expiration dates have only been government-mandated since 1979. The expiration date is simply the last day that the pharmaceutical company will guarantee 100% potency of the product. In other words, you won’t grow a horn in the middle of your forehead or another ill effect if you take the drug the week after it expires. Indeed, it is rare for expired drugs, especially in pill or capsule form, to be any riskier than the non-expired versions. 
This is an important issue to those preparing medically for survival scenarios. If you believe that some disaster will take society to the brink, then you should also understand that such a scenario also means that it’s unlikely that pharmaceutical companies will be functioning to manufacture drugs. Therefore, at one point or another, a well-supplied survival medic will have to make a decision regarding the use of an expired medication. 
This is a decision that also must be made by government agencies such as FEMA and the Department of Defense. Federal warehouses store tens of millions of dollars’ worth of drugs meant for use in peacetime disasters. When these drugs expired, the forklifts came out and huge quantities of life-saving medicines were discarded.",0
24296,"US President shouldn’t tell Britain what to do, unless there’s a job in it for me, insists Nigel Farage","Radio Tuesday 22 November 2016 US President shouldn’t tell Britain what to do, unless there’s a job in it for me, insists Nigel Farage 
Nigel Farage has said he stands by his claim that the US President should stay out of British affairs , unless of course there is a cushy job lined up for him at the end of it. 
Nigel Farage has told the government that ignoring Donald Trump’s calls for him to be made US Ambassador was putting political dislike above what is best for Nigel Farage. 
The three-time UKIP leader told reporters, “When I said during the referendum campaign that President Obama had no place commenting on the British political process, I of course meant that he had no place disagreeing with me. 
“This new guy though, he agrees with me on lots of things, so now the British government should be listening very closely to the US President-elect, and what he wants. 
“If the US President says I should be Britain’s Ambassador to the US, then it’s the British Government’s job to jump to attention and make it so, regardless of me being the leader of a party in opposition, or disagreeing with the government’s position on just about everything. 
“President-elect Trump wants it, so do as you’re told.” 
Voter Simon Williams said, “Learning that Nigel Farage is an opportunistic hypocrite only interested in furthering his own political ambitions is just about the least surprising thing to happen in 2016. 
“But, this being 2016, the chances are he’ll be in post by Christmas.” ",0
24297,YouTube TV Customers Will Be Forced to Watch Commercials on Recorded Shows - Breitbart,"Customers of YouTube TV, the upcoming television cable package from YouTube, will be forced to watch commercials even on recorded shows, according to a report. [“Let’s say a subscriber decides to record ABC’s ‘Blackish’ episode in hopes of being able to catch up on it in a few days, skipping over the ads while they watch. Within 24 hours, though, YouTube likely will have the   version of that show available, since many TV networks offer cable providers at least the last five episodes for catch up on demand,” explained The Wall Street Journal. “In   versions of shows, TV networks typically disable   over ads to make sure they get credit from marketers who pay for the commercials. ”  “If YouTube TV does have the   version of Wednesday night’s ‘Blackish’ available, then it won’t let its subscribers watch a recorded version that allows for ” they continued. “Instead, viewers will be forced to watch the   episode and all of the ads, even though consumers thought they saved the show on their DVR. ” The move has been attributed to YouTube’s various deals with companies such as Disney, 21’st Century Fox, and NBC Universal, though it has also been noted that “if the   version doesn’t exist, the YouTube TV subscriber will be able to watch a recorded version and skip ads. ” YouTube TV, which was announced in March, acts as a “skinny bundle” to compete with cable television providers at a much lower price. As reported by Breitbart Tech’s Jack Hadfield last month, “YouTube TV will cost customers only $35 a month, which gets them 6 accounts, 3 of which can be used to stream live TV concurrently, and access to 40 different networks, including ‘ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, regional sports networks, and dozens of popular cable networks,’ according to a recent entry on the official YouTube blog. ” “Each of the accounts will be personalized and utilize   searching algorithms, similar to Netflix’s profile system,” wrote Hadfield. “Users also gain access to YouTube Red original shows and an unlimited cloud DVR (1 per account) to record live TV. ” The service is only initially available in select U. S. cities, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

24298,Report: FBI’s Facial Recognition Database Is ’Out of Control’ - Breitbart,"The facial recognition database used by the FBI is “out of control,” according to a new report by The Guardian. [“Approximately half of adult Americans’ photographs are stored in facial recognition databases that can be accessed by the FBI, without their knowledge or consent, in the hunt for suspected criminals,” reported The Guardian on Monday. “About 80% of photos in the FBI’s network are   entries, including pictures from driver’s licenses and passports. The algorithms used to identify matches are inaccurate about 15% of the time, and are more likely to misidentify black people than white people. ”  “These are just some of the damning facts presented at last week’s House oversight committee hearing, where politicians and privacy campaigners criticized the FBI and called for stricter regulation of facial recognition technology at a time when it is creeping into law enforcement and business,” they continued. During the committee hearing, chairman Jason Chaffetz praised the positives of using facial recognition technology before also raising concerns about some of the more negative potential uses. “Facial recognition technology is a powerful tool law enforcement can use to protect people, their property, our borders, and our nation  …     But it can also be used by bad actors to harass or stalk individuals,” declared Chaffetz. “It can be used in a way that chills free speech and free association by targeting people attending certain political meetings, protests, churches, or other types of places in the public. ” “For those reasons and others, we must conduct proper oversight of this emerging technology,” he continued, adding that body cameras with the potential to scan faces while walking down the street were the “most concerning. ” In their report, The Guardian added, “Unlike with the collection of fingerprints and DNA, which is done following an arrest, photos of innocent civilians are being collected proactively. ” “The FBI made arrangements with 18 different states to gain access to their databases of driver’s license photos,” they explained, adding, “Last year, the US government accountability office (GAO) analyzed the FBI’s use of facial recognition technology and found it to be lacking in accountability, accuracy and oversight, and made recommendations of how to address the problem. ” Brian Brackeen, CEO of the movie and theme park facial recognition company Kairos, also criticized the lack of regulation for facial recognition software and databases, proclaiming the commercial side of the industry to be “five years ahead” of FBI. According to The Guardian, Brackeen claimed “he was ‘not comfortable’ with the lack of regulation,” before adding “There has got to be privacy protections for the individual. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

We describe that attack as a flagrant violation of international law and an act of aggression. We strongly condemn the illegitimate actions by the U. S. The consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious. This attack was a flagrant violation of the 2015 memorandum on preventing incidents and ensuring security during our operations in Syrian airspace and the ministry of defense of Russia has stopped its cooperation with Pentagon under that memorandum. ” He continued, “Of recent times the United States administration has often talked about combat international terrorism and this was just  —   this justified American troops and their allies being present on Syrian territory. Although they were there without the invitation of the legitimate government of Syria and without the approval of the security council of the United Nations. Manipulating articles of the United Nations charter beyond any criticism. The aggression by the U. S. has only facilitated the strengthening of terrorism. The attack came against Syrian armed forces structure and its air force. That is against those who over all these years have been combatting terrorism.

24301,Apocalyptic sounds in the skies are back! This time in Slovakia.,"Apocalyptic sounds in the skies are back! This time in Slovakia. Please scroll down for video 
They call it ‘The Hum,' a phrase coined by the geoscientist David Deming of the University of Oklahoma to describe the ‘mysterious and untraceable sound that is heard in certain locations around the world by two to ten percent of the population.' The noises might vary from roaring sounds in the middle of the night, to prolonged periods of noise which sound like intense industrial activity taking place in the sky. Most unusually of all, ordinary people in cities such as York in England have claimed to hear trumpet horns coming from the sky playing chilling bars of music. Strange noises heard over the sky in Slovakia 
Now Slovakia has become the latest location to these bizarre and completely inexplicable noises, which have been recorded on video. 
As of yet, no one has been able to offer a completely coherent explanation for these mysterious sounds. Some have suggested that the chilling noises might be caused by changes in the Earth’s core which could eventually lead to a complete polar shift. However, aside from speculation, there is little evidence to suggest that this particular theory is true. According to Deming, they may well be caused by enormous amounts of collated feedback from telephone transmissions and aircraft which are operated by the United States Navy to communicate with submarines. However, this explanation is deemed to fall short as these noises became particularly apparent in 2011 and 2012 and if Deming is correct, there should have been previous indications of this feedback reaction before this period . 
Some people have suggested that the noise could be being caused by projects such as the HAARP weapons program, which is believed to be dedicated to working on high-tech weather modification technology. If this explanation is correct, it could not explain not only the unusual noises but also why they are so often accompanied by a bizarre phenomenon in the sky, such as those which have been detected in Slovakia in recent months. 
And here is another recent video. Chilling to the bone:

24307,How Stress Affects Your Health,"in: General Health , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Everyone feels stress from time to time, but many of us are unaware of the fact that many commonly-experienced imbalances in health may actually be our body’s way of responding to physical and mental stress. Recent scientific studies have indicated that the human body’s reaction to stress could be one of the main causes of many life-threatening diseases, including heart disease and cancer. When we feel that we are in danger, a stress response surges through us and our bodies under-go an explosion of stress hormones that, over-time, are hazardous to our health. Ways Stress Negatively Affects Your Health 1. Increased Heart Rate When we enter into the fight or flight mode, the heart-rate naturally speeds up. While this may be a great thing if we need to run quickly, overtime this can significantly tire out the heart and lead to cardiovascular diseases, increased cholesterol and even excess belly fat . 2. Digestion Slows When we go into a state of stress, the energy needed for digestive processes is immediately sent to external areas of the body, such as the head, heart and limbs. This leads to a whole host of chronic stress-related digestive conditions. Chronic constipation and irritable bowel conditions are directly related, in many cases, to chronic stress. In fact, estimates show that as many as 20 percent of Americans experience chronic constipation and symptoms of IBS. Changes in appetite are also a stress-related condition. When we experience mental and emotional stress, we often reach for comfort foods to give us the false sensation of being calm. Similarly, some people react in the opposite way, losing their appetites when stress or anxiety levels are high. 3. High Blood Pressure Problems Studies show that when we are under stress, blood flow to the brain and muscles increase up to 400 percent. While this may be useful if we are planning on leaping into a tree, over time, chronic stress creates the scene for high blood pressure conditions or even a stroke. 4. Weight Gain Evidence shows that increased cortisol hormone levels caused by prolonged stress can lead to overall weight gain . 5. General Muscle Tension and Chronic Fatigue Muscles become tight when we are stressed. Because the muscles are constantly in a “gripping” state, they later become over-worked and leave us with a general sensation of body fatigue. Studies show that generalized back pain may also be a response to chronic stress-related muscle gripping along the spine. 6. Insomnia and Other Sleep-Conditions When the mind is continually spinning and stressing on the problems of life, it can be hard to unwind when the day is over. Insomnia is a sleep condition that is directly related to mental stress. 7. Reduced Happiness and Quality of Life Stress causes negative mental and emotional reactions. When we are stressed, it can be difficult for us to establish healthy social relationships, as we are constantly working to preserve personal stasis. 8. Immune Conditions Stress negatively effects the blood cells that aid in your body’s ability to ward off infections, leading to greater likelihood of developing colds, flu and degenerative disorders. 9. Other Conditions Many modern studies are now linking the experience of chronic stress with a multitude of conditions. In fact, estimates show that up to two-thirds of all medical visits are for stress-induced conditions. Other stress-related conditions include depression, anxiety, migraine headaches, lack of sexual desire, chronic fatigue syndrome, IBS, immune disorders, memory loss, reproductive disorders, cold and flu conditions , skin imbalances such as acne, stunted growth and hair loss. On a Personal Note We all get stressed out at some point. It’s inevitable and part of life. However, there are a few things you can do to help relieve stress, as well as stop it from coming in the first place. I recommend the following for stress relief: Exercise Daily",0

Here’s how: 
Brett MacDonald | Twitter | Facebook | 
NEW YORK — Today was not a great day for the Clinton campaign. Recently leaked emails from within the Clinton campaign have reached the ears of some prominent members of the Black Lives Matter community — members whom the emails were about. They are particularly upset about a series of emails that seems how to best “use” the victims of gun violence while making sure those victims were black. Understandably, some of the members have taken to speaking out against her campaign now. In a word, they’re pissed. 
Erica Garner, the daughter of controversial man who died after being put in “chokehold” by a New York officer has been one of the most vocal critics. “I’m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed ‘using’ Eric Garner …. Why would you want to ‘use’ my dad?” she tweeted. 
That was way earlier today. She hasn’t stopped since: “If you vote for her (Clinton) by default you are endorsing her and whatever she does. Remember her hiding being Negros(sic) that supported the crime bill?” If you vote for her by default you are endorsing her and whatever she does. Remember her hiding being Nergos that supported the crime bill?

But that’s not the only setback the Clinton campaign saw today.

24316,"The Michael Flynn Resignation: What We Know, What We Don’t - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   On Monday, Michael T. Flynn resigned as President Trump’s national security adviser after admitting he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his phone calls with a Russian diplomat. In his resignation letter, Mr. Flynn “sincerely apologized” to Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump, blaming the fast pace of events for what he called his “incomplete” account. Mr. Flynn has a   history with Russia, but there is still much about the case that is not clear. ■ In December 2015, Mr. Flynn, then retired from the Army, attended a  dinner to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT, a Russian     news channel that disseminates Russian views on global affairs. He sat at a table with President Vladimir V. Putin, spoke beforehand and subsequently appeared on RT as a commentator. ■ Mr. Flynn had multiple conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, before and after Mr. Trump’s November victory. He spoke to the envoy after President Barack Obama announced new sanctions against Russia to punish it for interfering in the American election. Mr. Putin did not retaliate for the sanctions, which surprised Obama administration officials but drew praise from Mr. Trump on Twitter: “I always knew he was very smart!” ■ Mr. Flynn and other Trump officials, including Mr. Pence and Sean Spicer, the press secretary, denied that Mr. Flynn had raised sanctions in the phone call with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Spicer said the call had focused on the logistics of a planned phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin after the inauguration. Mr. Flynn later backed away from that assertion, saying his memory might have been faulty. In his resignation letter, he said he had “inadvertently” misled Mr. Pence. ■ The Justice Department told the White House about the contents of Mr. Flynn’s conversation with Mr. Kislyak, which had been recorded by a government wiretap. ■ The F. B. I. interviewed Mr. Flynn just days after he took office. Shortly thereafter, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned that Mr. Flynn was susceptible to blackmail by the Russians because he had misled Mr. Pence and other officials. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates in an unrelated incident after she said the Justice Department would not defend his executive order on immigration. ■ It is not clear whether Mr. Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador were directed by, or carried out with the knowledge of, the   or any of his other senior advisers, including the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. It is also not clear why the White House did not act earlier on the information given to it by the Justice Department. ■ The precise nature of the conversation between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak has not been made public. Did Mr. Flynn explicitly reassure the Russian government that the incoming administration would ease sanctions? Did he urge the Russians to hold off on imposing retaliatory measures? ■ How did Mr. Flynn’s dealings with the Russians affect American policy toward Russia? As a candidate, Mr. Trump called for warmer relations between the United States and Russia  —   a message echoed by Mr. Flynn, who said it could be a partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Yet two weeks ago, the ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, declared that the United States would not lift sanctions on Russia until it withdrew from Crimea and stopped destabilizing Ukraine. ■ What is the status of the F. B. I. investigation of Mr. Flynn’s phone calls? Did he break any laws in his conversations with Mr. Kislyak? What did he tell F. B. I. investigators? Has Mr. Flynn hired his own lawyer? And what will he do now?",0

Despite what the media might want you to think, there are a fair number of blacks who support Trump . In fact, The Gateway Pundit reported that a series of polls indicated that Trump may receive more black votes than any GOP presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1960. 
If the liberal media actually did their job correctly, we wouldn’t even be hearing about this non-issue. Instead, because they are so desperate to avoid talking about the WikiLeaks emails that are hurting Clinton’s campaign, they will look for anything to distract the American people.

24322,Alarmist report: Earth to lose 67% of wildlife populations by 2020,"Print 
[Ed. – The earth has lost millions of species throughout its history, according to current research. You couldn’t prove a catastrophic loss of wildlife since 1970 by the experience of humans; the animals are still all around us, and many of them are flourishing to the detriment of human-inhabited areas. This report sounds like the tendentious exaggeration of something that is to be expected, but is framed in alarmist terms.] 
The number of wild animals living on Earth is set to fall by two-thirds by 2020, according to a new report , part of a mass extinction that is destroying the natural world upon which humanity depends. 
The analysis, the most comprehensive to date, indicates that animal populations plummeted by 58% between 1970 and 2012, with losses on track to reach 67% by 2020. Researchers from WWF and the Zoological Society of London compiled the report from scientific data and found that the destruction of wild habitats, hunting and pollution were to blame. 
The creatures being lost range from mountains to forests to rivers and the seas and include well-known endangered species such as elephants and gorillas and lesser known creatures such as vultures and salamanders. 
The collapse of wildlife is, with climate change, the most striking sign of the Anthropocene, a proposed new geological era in which humans dominate the planet. “We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,” said Prof Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, in a foreword for the report.",0
24323,Exclusive: Joy Villa Reveals Dream White House Gig,"After making waves with a   dress at last Sunday night’s Grammy Awards and subsequently topping the singles chart on Amazon, singer Joy Villa revealed in an exclusive interview that she has one more goal in mind. [She wants to go to the White House and perform her rendition of Queen’s 1977 classic, “We Are The Champions,” for President Donald Trump.  “That is my goal,” she said of singing that song for Trump. “That is what I would love to do. I would like to show an outpouring of support and perform for the president. And that would be just the cherry on top of everything. “ Villa continued: “And also to create a wave of support for our president for Americans for patriotism and just for tolerance and love. And just changed the narrative. In the award shows. In the Grammys. In the red carpet. Anything that pops up. So it is a more fair portrayal of actually what Americans are feeling and thinking. Because we don’t all think like how they are telling us to think. And that is my whole platform. ” Villa was speaking in an interview to air on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM. Upon arriving at the Grammys, Villa took off a white robe to reveal a red, white and blue dress emblazoned with the sparkling words “Make America Great Again” and had “Trump” on the hem. Villa’s   Grammys appearance skyrocketed her album to #1 on Amazon’s digital chart. In an initial interview last week, Villa confirmed to this reporter that she is a Trump supporter and that she voted for the president. Asked why she decided to essentially troll the Grammys, Villa explained that she was “tired” of Hollywood’s treatment of Trump supporters. “I was tired of the bullying,” she said in a phone interview. “I was tired of being pushed down so that I couldn’t say my beliefs. And being fearful of losing sales. Losing fans. Losing bookings. Losing contracts and sponsorship. You know, that’s my day to day. And a lot of my friends have the same thing. And we live in Hollywood, which is supposed to be the most open viewpoint city. But the truth is there was a lot of hate and a lot of negativity and I wanted to change the storyline to love and support and unity as an American. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

24328,"Confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General To Curb Gun Crime in Chicago, Says NRA-ILA’s Chris Cox. - Breitbart","Senators can help reduce the continuing bloodshed in Chicago by confirming Sen. Jeff Sessions as the new Attorney General, says   executive director Chris Cox. [The political response to this situation has been immoral. But help is on the way with a new AG. #confirmsessions. https:  .   —   Chris Cox (@nracwc) December 31, 2016,   Sen. Jeff Sessions’ nomination hearing is expected to begin next week, amid fierce opposition from progressive groups. Breitbart News previously reported that Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 800 homicides for the year. The Chicago Tribune reports that there were a total of 779 homicides between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016, an increase of nearly 300 homicides over 2015 figures. And there were a 4, 385 shootings  —   fatal and   combined  —   in   Chicago during 2016. The response to this carnage has been business as usual. The Tribune summed up the response to Chicago’s rise in homicides by suggesting there are “few answers” for curtailing the violence. It has long been known that one of the biggest problems in the status quo response to Chicago gun crime is the lackadaisical approach to prosecuting individuals who violate federal gun laws in the city. The NRA made this very point in Amercia’s 1st Freedom in August 2015: In 2014 in Chicago, over 2, 500 people were shot —  nearly 400 of them fatally —  and police seized more than 6, 252 guns. Yet out of those 6, 252 guns seized, Fardon’s federal prosecutors saw fit to pursue just 62 weapons prosecutions. In other words, for every 100 guns police seized, federal prosecutors made just one prosecution. With nearly 800 homicides in   Chicago last year, the  ’s Cox labels the lackluster response to death upon death as “immoral” and posits Sessions’ confirmation as the means to reverse the lack of prosecutions for gun law violations.

“In a free and open democracy, we should be allowed to talk about anything.”– Tim Burton 
On #LoudonClear Thursday night, Trevor Loudon hosts Tim Burton, a special guest from across the pond who has been a vocal critic of Islam’s impact on the West, which has put him afoul of 2006 legislation in England “criminalizing racial and religious hatred” for tweeting that Fiyaz Mughal of Islamophobia-measuring group Tell Mama was a “mendacious taqiyya-artist.” 
Burton was charged with “racially aggravated harassment.” Burton successfully made the case that “taqiyya” was not a racial slur, as argued by the court. 
In fact, if one is advancing the cause of Islam, “taqiyya” is a duty, as noted by host Trevor Loudon. 
Burton points out that criticism of Islam is “not allowed” in England and is again facing charges, but this time from a higher court!

24332,The Guardian is Going Friggin Nuts Over Calais,"The Guardian is Going Friggin Nuts Over Calais 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 Where is this innocent little boy supposed to go if he can’t live in a squatter camp and throw rocks through car windshields, The Guardian asks. 
Okay, so earlier today I already posted a front page story from The Guardian featuring an imagine of a “16-year-old child” who was obviously a man in his forties who was forced out of his home in the Jungle camp in Calais. 
But I’ve gotta post more. 
They are going absolutely nuts over this. 
The rest of the media is too, of course, but The Guardian epitomizes liberal hysteria, so we’ll focus on them. 
All of these headlines are from the last 24 hours – the period since the camp was officially closed. I won’t even bother to link them, because who cares. You already know what they’re saying. 
Three of them are written by the same woman, Lisa O’Carroll. 
One has to wonder if she wasn’t one of the women who were using the Calais camp as a sex tourism destination . 
You can ask her about it on Twitter. 
@lisaocarroll 
This situation is insane though, holmes. 
These people invaded Europe, mostly from Africa. None of them are legitimate “refugees,” or they would claim that status. They are allowed to stay in France indefinitely, where they are clothed and fed, but they want to go to Britain because the welfare system is so good. They set up an illegal squatter base next to the freeway, and used it to break into trucks bound for the UK and to launch random violent attacks on cars – very often just throwing rocks for no reason. 
This week, 7 years after it was founded in 2009, they finally closed it and forced out the inhabitants, because basically it had become impossible to safely pass from France to England in a car. And the entire media is saying that the act of closing the camp is nothing short of pure and unadulterated evil. 
The way they’re selling it? 
By showing pictures of men between the ages of 25 and 45, saying they’re teenagers and calling them “children.” 
It’s like something out of an absurdist comedy. But most everything is these days. 
Anyhow, these women, cucks and kikes are eventually going to get their way. Migrants are already moving back in, as the fires have died down from where they set their own squat on fire when they were asked to leave. 
Migrants have started moving back into the “Jungle”, hours after French authorities announced they had finished clearing out the Calais camp. 
Thousands of migrants were evacuated as multiple large blazes raged across the sprawling camp in northern France. 
By midday, regional prefect Fabienne Buccio had said operations to clear the camp, which began on Monday, had been completed days earlier than planned. 
“There are no more migrants in the camp,” she told the Associated Press news agency. 
I said this would happen. Everyone knew it would happen. White Europeans have no will to do what needs to be done, so these animals are simply allowed to do whatever they want. 
What needs to be done is of course race war. 
These people need to be rounded up and deported back to Africa, and if they refuse and start fires, they need to be shot. 
This situation isn’t complicated or nuanced in any way. 
But that won’t happen. 
Because Europe is ruled by the coalition of evil: empowered women, cucks and kikes.",0

24334,Cost of Target’s Data Breach Nearing $300 Million,"The cost estimate to retail giant Target is now approaching $300 million for damage created by its massive 2013 data breach where the credit card information of some 40 million customers was lost to hackers. [Last week, the   company announced an $18. 5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by a group of state attorneys general that alleged that Target put its customers’ financial   at risk.  The lawsuit was filed after Target fell victim to one of the biggest data breaches to hit a U. S. retailer in U. S. history. As a requirement of the settlement, Target will have to institute new security procedures and will have to hire a   company to conduct a full security audit of the company’s systems. But this lawsuit is hardly the end of the company’s troubles over the data breach. The damage is now approaching $300 million, according to one tech security blog. A report at SSL Store says the payout has hit $292 million already, and this figure does not include the several lawsuits that are still outstanding. The list of costs includes: Thus far, the breakdown of losses per year found the company losing $17 million in 2013, $145 million in 2014, and $39 million in 2015. The company did not make a specific report for its 2016 fiscal year. All this adds to the struggling retailer’s woes, which are mounting in other areas, as well. Last Friday, for instance, the company fired 40 higher level employees in its merchandising department at its Minneapolis headquarters, citing a new organizational plan meant to reverse its   slide into unprofitability. The change comes after four straight quarters of decline. For another example of the company’s fall from grace, a recent survey of Target’s customers found that customer satisfaction had fallen 383 basis points in the last few months. The survey of 2, 500 Target customers showed declines across the board, including customer service, merchandise selection, and overall quality. In addition, several weeks earlier the company cut the salary of CEO Brian Cornel due to the the four quarters of loss, fired or released several top executives, shuttered   projects meant to drive the company’s future, and other actions. All the problems began after Target announced its transgender bathroom policy last year, telling customers and employees alike that men “identifying” as women could use whatever bathroom or changing room they want. The policy brought a boycott that garnered over a million signatures in less than two weeks. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
24336,Analysts Predict Grave Future for Twitter Following Quarterly Earnings Report - Breitbart,"Analysts had grave predictions for the future of Twitter following the release of the company’s 4th quarter earnings Thursday. [Speaking to Bloomberg, Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, discussed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and the division of his time between Twitter and his other company Square. “The fact that they’ve tolerated having a shared CEO is remarkable given the situation they’re in,” he said, “Unfortunately, it’s a situation of investor indifference  —   everyone is used to Twitter’s troubles by now. ”  The company’s earnings for the fourth quarter were $717 million, falling short of Wall Street predictions of $740 million. Twitter’s sales growth of 1% slowed dramatically from the 48% gain for the same quarter last year. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral believes this will be a big issue for Twitter in the coming year: “Sales growth recovery for Twitter will be very challenging in 2017. Google and Facebook results show robust ad environment in the fourth quarter. ” Waral stated that Twitter’s sales growth “is showing their strategies are not working. ” Twitter has been relying on live video partnerships with larger brands such as Dick Clark Productions in recent months in an attempt to attract more users to their platform, a move that hasn’t seemed to yield much success. The company also introduced new video ad monetization features, allowing  to be played before videos.

24337,’Record-Breaking’ Number of Migrants Crossing Mediterranean This Easter,"An “unprecedented” number of people tried to cross the Mediterranean over the Easter weekend this year, a migrant charity has said. [The Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) said they went to the aid of between 1, 500 and 1, 800 men, women, and children on seven rubber and two wooden vessels over the weekend, picking up 453 on their own ship and providing life jackets and other provisions to around 1, 000 more.  Meanwhile, in the central Mediterranean, MOAS reported 2, 074 rescues conducted by “various    (SAR) assets on Friday, including 134 rescued by the Phoenix”. The charity said the situation had been a “24 hours marathon of continuous rescue operations” in what was “set to be the latest marker in the   escalation of this   humanitarian crisis at sea”. Christopher Catrambone, the group’s founder, said: “Nobody has ever seen anything like what we are witnessing this weekend. “It is a miracle that we have managed to rescue everyone with no casualties today. “We are still conducting operations with a new boat contact spotted early this morning. “The professional conduct and tireless efforts of our crew are to thank for the many lives saved today. ” So far this year, some 29, 000 migrants have arrived in Italy alone after being picked up by European ships and private charity vessels, with numbers expected to rocket as weather conditions improve during spring. The figures will cause concern that Europe’s migrant crisis will intensify once again this coming summer, as hundreds of thousands pour into the continent, putting European nations and institutions under increasing pressure. Breitbart London reported at the end of last month how migrant deaths in the Mediterranean have spiked by 42 per cent so far this year compare to this time last year. Deaths in the Mediterranean have even accounted for more than half of all migrant deaths worldwide in 2017, which totalled over 1, 000 by the end of March.",0

As for the rest, I present it for those who have the interest and stamina to decipher. To the Memory of Peacocks & the Hyena King by Aloysius Fozdyke — (henrymakow.com) I’m loving the American presidential election, the Global Election Management System and fractionalized or fictionalized voting. All sizzle and no steak. One of the better smoke and mirrors shows. American presidents are selected not elected! The sheeple are so easy to fool there’s hardly any fun in it any more. Donald is two-faced and adult diaper Hillary is genital-centred and unwell. ‘Did you just soil yourself?’‘Sure! Do you think I smell this bad all the time?’ It doesn’t matter if every American votes for Donald Trump, because the results will give the election to Hilary Clinton. It’s about sizzle without the steak. We let the sheeple vote so that they feel they still have choices that matter. The outcome is irrelevant, provided that the sheeple feel that they’re contributing and that they still have choices. For what it’s worth, have a look at ‘fractional voting’. We’re so close to conquering and getting the only thing we’ve ever wanted – everything! And honestly, in return we give the masses what they want, which in truth isn’t much at all, just illusions. We give them choices between two predetermined political outcomes, but allow them to select from a myriad of supermarket junk foods, television programmes and glossy magazines, because that’s what they deserve – inconsequential options and diversions. The social crash will be after the American presidential elections – even if Trump wins, which he won’t. The media has conditioned the masses to the predetermined fact that Hilary will win and being placidly obedient, Americans will accept that result. It’s not like our people have to be careful any more. As my mentor used to say, ‘The Lord is my shepherd and eventually, like all good shepherds he will lead you to the slaughterhouse’. Being herd animals, sheeple want safety, not freedom. They want to work harder and longer for less and less. They already live in fear of their own governments while constructing their own prisons. ‘We the sheeple…’ Yeah, right! Right hand path spiritualities – like Xtianity – are suffering and death centred. So we will give you what you want: suffering and death. The third world war is what’s needed to bring Old Numb-Nuts back, with all his egregious double standards. And remember, he came not to bring peace, but a sword, so essentially we’ll continue giving the masses what they want – just like we always have. Enjoy! ESOTERIC SATANICA",0

Flynn’s ouster was a soft coup (or political assassination) engineered by anonymous intelligence community bureaucrats. The results might be salutary, but this isn’t the way a liberal democracy is supposed to function. Unelected intelligence analysts work for the president, not the other way around. Far too many Trump critics appear not to care that these intelligence agents leaked highly sensitive information to the press  —   mostly because Trump critics are pleased with the result. “Finally,” they say, “someone took a stand to expose collusion between the Russians and a senior aide to the president!” It is indeed important that someone took such a stand. But it matters greatly who that someone is and how they take their stand. Members of the unelected, unaccountable intelligence community are not the right someone, especially when they target a senior aide to the president by leaking anonymously to newspapers the content of classified phone intercepts, where the unverified, unsubstantiated information can inflict politically fatal damage almost instantaneously. The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N. Korea etc?  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017, President Trump was roundly mocked among liberals for that tweet. But he is, in many ways, correct. These leaks are an enormous problem.

24356,Bad News For Republicans As Court Intervenes In Their Voter Intimidation Scheme,"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 12:30 am The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNC's poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for “voter fraud”. 
The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNC’s poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. 
The order demands affidavits from several parties, including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendant’s (RNC’s) efforts with the Trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country, “as indicated by Kellyanne Conway”. 
Affidavits are also demanded from several Republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide “voter fraud” monitoring and poll monitoring, such as RNC member Rob Gleason’s efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and RNC member Ronna Romney McDaniel’s efforts in Michigan to prepare a “massive, statewide anti-voter fraud effort”. 
The RNC must also answer for Governor Mike Pence’s comments that the Trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure “ballot integrity”. 
This is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante. 
Rick Hasen at Election Law Blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad, “Pretty broad discovery required in short order, with hearing on November 4.” 
However, “The judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the DNC given the time frame, but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes.” 
The DNC filed a lawsuit against the Republican National Committee for violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over Donald Trump’s claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters. 
Donald Trump’s urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own (often in “urban” areas) to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isn’t likely to stand for it. 
So now discovery has been court-ordered, which is just more bad news for Republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the White House. 
It’s exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote. Everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation. Don’t let anyone dissuade you from voting.

24359,Finland Will Become the First Country in the World to Get Rid of All School Subjects,"LIFESTYLE 
Finland’s education system is considered one of the best in the world. In international ratings, it’s always in the top ten. However, the authorities there aren’t ready to rest on their laurels, and they’ve decided to carry through a real revolution in their school system. 
Finnish officials want to remove school subjects from the curriculum. There will no longer be any classes in physics, math, literature, history, or geography. 
The head of the Department of Education in Helsinki, Marjo Kyllonen, explained the changes: 
“There are schools that are teaching in the old-fashioned way which was of benefit in the beginning of the 1900s — but the needs are not the same, and we need something fit for the 21st century.“ 
Instead of individual subjects, students will study events and phenomena in an interdisciplinary format. For example, the Second World War will be examined from the perspective of history, geography, and math. And by taking the course ”Working in a Cafe,” students will absorb a whole body of knowledge about the English language, economics, and communication skills. 
This system will be introduced for senior students, beginning at the age of 16. The general idea is that the students ought to choose for themselves which topic or phenomenon they want to study, bearing in mind their ambitions for the future and their capabilities. In this way, no student will have to pass through an entire course on physics or chemistry while all the time thinking to themselves “What do I need to know this for?” 
The traditional format of teacher-pupil communication is also going to change. Students will no longer sit behind school desks and wait anxiously to be called upon to answer a question. Instead, they will work together in small groups to discuss problems. 
The Finnish education system encourages collective work, which is why the changes will also affect teachers. The school reform will require a great deal of cooperation between teachers of different subjects. Around 70% of teachers in Helsinki have already undertaken preparatory work in line with the new system for presenting information, and, as a result, they’ll get a pay increase. 
The changes are expected to be complete by 2020. 
What do you think about all these ideas? We’d love to hear your opinion, so let us know in the comments.

That answer is in, according to the Wall Street Journal , which says they are turning away, that the “Republican nominee faces vocal backlash from evangelical women over lewd comments and sexual-misconduct allegations.”

Kimberly Ross wrote at Red State earlier this month that, 
I don’t believe that I, as an American woman, am oppressed. However, it is beyond disappointing that men who not only claim faith, but are in leadership roles, are so willing to dismiss a predator among them. Maybe Trump has promised them some future role? I don’t know. Regardless, they are lured away from doing their duty and instead join in with someone whose hobby is casting females aside. I’m disgusted by Trump and his male cheerleaders. You should be, too. Thankfully, women like Beth Moore and Rev. Lisa Sharon Harper won’t stay quiet on the sidelines as some Evangelical men have always wished they would. 
She is hardly alone, and more and more Evangelical women are joining the ranks of those who have heard enough misogyny from Trump. The reaction of Evangelical women, as Laurie Goodstein noted at The New York Times earlier this month, be a rift “that shapes politics for years.” 
It isn’t as if Trump hasn’t been saying these things all along. As David French protested at the National Review back in June, Trump “subverts all of our most cherished values.” The question is, what took them so long? 
Trump has already had an effect on the Religious Right, an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose. He has 70 percent support from Evangelical men, but while Evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny, there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women. 
If Trump wants to further shrink his already deflated tent by shutting out another demographic, he’s going about it the right way.",0
24365,NETHERLANDS has a new Muslim political party called ‘DENK’ (Think) created by Muslim colonizers for Muslim colonizers,"NETHERLANDS has a new Muslim political party called ‘DENK’ (Think) created by Muslim colonizers for Muslim colonizers Founded by 2 Turkish Muslims, Tunahan Kuzu and Selçuk Öztürk, after being booted out of the Dutch Labour Party, the Denk Partij (Think Party) is the first political force in Europe established by Muslims and is attracting controversy for its affiliation with the Turkish Islamist regime, rejection of the Armenian Genocide, and radical anti-Israel positions. DENK is also proposing a 1,000 strong ‘racism’ police and national anti-immigration registry which will target anyone who says anything ‘Islamophobic’ against Muslims. Legal Insurrection is reporting ( h/t Truth Revolt ) that the Netherlands’ pro-Muslim immigration Denk Party is pushing for a thousand-strong “Racism Police” to go after thought and speech crimes against Muslims which would result in a registry for offenders, fines, and re-education camps. The party, dominated by members of Turkish and Muslim origin was founded in 2014 by two former-socialist Turkish politicians but it already sits in the Dutch parliament and is hoping to mobilize the country’s million-strong mainly Muslim immigrant population (out of about 17 million overall) and growing Muslim population, currently at about 7 percent, in the parliamentary elections to be held early next year. Tunahan Kuzu and Selçuk Öztürk Among the Denk Party’s latest proposals are the renaming of streets and tunnels suggestive of Dutch colonial and slave trading history, changing the term “foreigner” to “Turkish and Surinamese Dutch person,” creating a thousand-man “Racism Police,” establishing stricter sentences for “racist and discriminatory behavior,” and listing offenders on a nationwide “Racism Register” — you know, just like child molesters. This multicultural champion has close ties to Erdogan’s Turkish-Islamist AKP party and it refuses to recognize the genocide of Armenian Christians. According to a recent Dutch poll, nearly 90 percent of young Turkish-Dutch sympathize with ISIS — 90 percent . This is the Denk Party’s political base. Denk Party stands in the tradition of George Galloway’s Respect Party in UK, a new mutant ideology taking root in Europe that fuses leftist “social justice” issues with political Islam, dipped in fierce hatred for Israel and Western heritage. Last month, the Denk Party attracted media attention when party’s leader and Dutch MP Tunahan Kuzu refused to shake hands with the visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu. What should worry the freedom-loving people — on the either side of the Atlantic — is not just the outrageous nature of Denk Party’s proposals, but the determined effort already underway in Europe to criminalize “undesired” speech and political dissident. The E.U. has long been pressuring its media to omit mentions of Islam when Muslims are involved in terrorism. UK Express DENK proposes a ban on words like ‘native’ and ‘immigrant’ would be introduced, alongside a national holiday to celebrate Muslim diversity. The party aims to reinvent Dutch national identity, and the program is geared towards tackling the institutional racism/Islamophobia it says is endemic in the Netherlands. And part of that is scrapping the government’s ideals of integration, claiming this should not be expected of Muslim migrants, but rather an atmosphere of ‘mutual acceptance’ should be adopted. (In other words, forcing Dutch natives to give up their customs and culture and accommodate the Muslim way of doing things) Tackling racism/Islamophobia should begin in schools, with pro-Islam attitudes promoted in the classroom through citizenship classes, and that students are regularly tested to see if they are meeting the required benchmark.",0
24368,Bombshell New Details Destroy Republican Hopes In FBI Clinton Email Investigation,"Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The FBI is examining how a Hillary Clinton aide handled emails. The examination has nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, her emails, or her email server. 
According to Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald, the “scandal” is related to the process Clinton aide Huma Abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read. 
Eichenwald reported: Because Clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen, emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home, where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent. Abedin, like many State Department officials, found the government network technology to be cumbersome, and she had great trouble printing documents there, investigative records show. As a result, she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified State Department account to either her Yahoo account or her account on Clinton’s server, and printed the emails from there. It is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husband’s campaign. 
Abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed Clinton needed to see and when the Secretary forwarded emails to her for printing. Abedin told the FBI she would often print these emails without reading them. Abedin printed a large number of emails this way, in part because, investigative records show, other staff members considered her Clinton’s “gatekeeper” and often sent Abedin electronic communications they wanted the Secretary to see. 
The entire scandal is about how emails were printed. It has nothing to do with how Hillary Clinton handled emails or classified information. The investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for Hillary Clinton to read. No wonder Comey didn’t provide more details in his letter to Congress. The details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the FBI. 
There is no evidence that Clinton’s aide committed a crime. For the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal, there must be evidence that Abedin intended to leak classified information. There remains zero evidence of criminal activity. 
The FBI examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the 2016 election , and Comey’s behavior is a disgrace to the US intelligence community. 
The new information destroys Republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat . Republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails, but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat. 
The emails won’t change anything in 2016, but they will give Congressional Republicans a reason to keep investigating Hillary Clinton in 2017 and beyond. In other words, James Comey is already delegitimizing Hillary Clinton’s potential presidency.",0

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/obama-pushes-fake-news-talking-point.html This piece can be seen as a continuation of "" Red Alert: The War on Alternative Media Has Begun ."" As Democrats and Hillary Clinton supporters come to terms with a Donald Trump administration, the ‘fake news won him the election’ talking point was pushed to new heights as the outgoing president suggested ‘fake’ media websites are undermining the political process. “If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not… if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” Obama said during a news conference in Germany. Obama suggested that ‘fake news’ affects voter opinions of candidates “in an age where there is so much active misinformation, and it’s packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or turn on your television.”Yes folks, the alternative or ‘fake’ media is now able to look the same as CNN, which interviews its own camera people and tells viewers that they are protesters. “If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect,” Obama said. “We won’t know what to fight for.” In other words, Obama is saying that the rigged playing field has now been leveled, and that’s a problem for the establishment. “Part of what’s changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information,” he went on to say, adding “It’s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we’ll figure it out.” Yeah, because the mainstream media certainly doesn’t engage in negative attacks or simplistic slogans. As we have documented, the ‘fake news’ talking point originated with a far left SJW writer , who spread around a list of websites to avoid if you want ‘real news’. The list included Infowars and Breitbart News. The idea is to attempt to force Google & Facebook to censor conservative websites. The talking point also dovetails with Twitter promising to purge numerous accounts belonging to members of the ‘Alt-Right’, egged on by partisan groups like The Southern Poverty Law Center. Other web tools, such as Quantcast jumped on the bandwagon and introduced tools to identify the so called ‘fake news’ sites. However, the move has rapidly backfired , as people quickly realized the whole talking point is part of a bitter backlash tantamount to censorship .

24379,’Jane Roe’ of Roe v. Wade Abortion Decision Dies in Texas Facility,"HOUSTON, Texas  —   A Texas woman who was the “Jane Roe” in the 1973 abortion case of Roe v. Wade died in a Katy assisted living facility on Saturday. [Although Norma McCorvey, her real name, became famous for the part she played in the landmark U. S. Supreme Court decision, she became a   Christian and spoke out against abortion.  “Texas Right to Life was honored to work alongside Ms. McCorvey for years,” Elizabeth Graham of Texas Right to Life told Breitbart Texas. “Jim and I were so blessed to work with her during the last decades of her life on   causes. ” Graham added, “Much later, she realized she was just a pawn in the system. ” Graham said it was important to note that McCorvey never had an abortion, saying she “choose life instead. ” “We are saddened to hear of Norma’s passing, yet we are eternally grateful for her courageous   witness that she fully embraced,” said Texas Values President Jonathan Saenz. “I had the honor of interacting with her over the years and I know she can now rest safely in the arms of our Lord. ” Her death, reported by the Washington Post early Saturday afternoon, was confirmed by Joshua Prager. Prager is a journalist who has been working on a book on the historic Supreme Court decision that has sparked decades of debate over abortion rights. The defendant in the case, “Wade” was   County District Attorney Henry Wade. She reportedly died from a heart ailment in an   facility in Katy, a suburb of Houston. The Washington Post reported: Ms. McCorvey was a complicated protagonist in a legal case that became a touchstone in the culture wars, celebrated by champions as an affirmation of women’s freedom and denounced by opponents as the legalization of murder of the unborn. When she filed suit in 1970, she was looking not for a sweeping ruling for all women from the highest court in the land, but rather, simply, the right to legally and safely end a pregnancy that she did not wish to carry forward. In her home state of Texas, as in most other states, abortion was prohibited except when the mother’s life was at stake. On Jan. 22, 1973, the Supreme Court handed down its historic    ruling, written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, articulating a constitutional right to privacy that included the choice to terminate a pregnancy. Since the ruling of the U. S. Supreme Court in the landmark case, approximately 50 million legal abortions have been estimated to have been performed in the United States, according to the New York Times.

24380,65 Test Positive for TB at Texas Border Senior Center,"An uncomfortably high number of positive tests results for tuberculosis came back to a west Texas border senior day care center, putting city health officials on alert as they monitor the cases to see if any show signs of active TB. [The City of El Paso Department of Public Health confirmed Wednesday that 65 TB tests came back positive following the preliminary testing of 199 individuals in April. The health department began testing people at a local adult day care after one person in the center’s care tested positive for the sometimes fatal pulmonary disease.  The venue where the swarm of positive TB diagnoses occurred is the La Victoria Adult Day Care Center, according to the El Paso Times. Officials believe all those tested may have had contact with patient zero. However, officials remain vigilant. More center members and workers could have been exposed to the bacteria. “While this is a relatively high rate of positivity, we must also consider, among other factors, that any elderly population will likely have higher positivity rates due to prior exposure,” said Robert Resendes, El Paso Public Health Director, in a prepared statement. He cautioned: “A positive test could be unrelated to this particular exposure event. ” So far, none of the the individuals testing positive exhibited active TB symptoms, say El Paso health department officials. Further testing will be conducted as part of an ongoing investigation to determine if others contracted the illness or if any of the 65 people begin to show active TB signs. “What we want the attendees and the community at large to know is that there is a systematic process in place to ensure everyone’s safety,” added Resendes. Those people who tested positive will receive detailed information on their results and undergo further health exams which include physical evaluations by Department of Public Health TB nurses along with chest   at no cost to them, say local health officials. TB is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria which attacks the lungs, but it can damage other organs in the body including the kidneys, brain, or spine. The disease spreads from the coughs, sneezes, wheezes, and other respiratory fluids of a person with an active infection. It tends to affect people who spend time with an infected person every day, although El Paso health officials indicate catching TB may require close contact for extended periods of time. Breitbart Texas reported TB can spread quickly once the bacteria becomes active because an individual will manifest symptoms like chest pain, muscle fatigue, weight loss, lethargy, and coughing up blood. Not everyone infected with TB gets sick if the bacteria remains dormant, considered latent TB. Previously, El Paso health officials commented that El Paso’s rates for tuberculosis is  “roughly double the nation’s’” and called this rate consistent with other “border communities. ” TB rates are higher along the   border.   with TB and diabetes is more common along the border than in the rest of the state, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). The World Health Organization (WHO)  lists TB one of the world’s top 10 causes of death, but it is curable with proper treatment. DSHS adds some TB strains are resistant to treatment drugs. In 2015, nine people in Texas were diagnosed with multidrug resistant TB but none of the state’s cases were extensively drug resistant, the most difficult form of the illness to treat. People with compromised immune systems are most   for contracting TB. That includes individuals with   diabetes, severe kidney disease, certain forms of cancer and cancer treatments, malnutrition, and drugs that treat ailments like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn’s disease, the Mayo Clinic reports. Infants, young children, and the elderly are part of the high risk group. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.",0
24381,FACT: People Who Cry During Movies Are Mentally Strong People,"Share on Facebook Pass me a tissue, please... I'll admit it: I cry during movies… and books, music, and podcasts. Depending on how my hormone levels are, I might preemptively grab tissues and just watch the movie alone. Though a lot of people smirk when they see me watch movies in tears, I'm really fine with it. Truth be told, people who cry over movies tend to have something that a lot of others haven't really cultivated: empathy . It takes a special type of person to have empathy. Many people out there — narcissists and sociopaths, for example — are born without it and live their entire lives without ever really putting themselves in other peoples' shoes. This means they can't really feel for other people. Though a lack of empathy could come in very handy for a used car salesman, it's not always a good thing. Actually caring about others' situations takes strength — a lot of it. Life is brutal to some people and if you're able to actually put yourself in someone else's shoes and feel that pain, it says something about you. You're strong enough to actually withstand that pain, but to feel it nonetheless. You're strong enough to be strong for others. You're strong to the point that you understand where they're coming from and are able to actually feel what they're feeling. It's never a wimpy thing to actually care for another person, even if that person is a fictional character in a movie. It shows that you actually have a heart, and that it's a heart that can break itself for others. Though it can be broken, by the end of the movie, you know it's been patched back together. Being able to recover that quickly says something else about people who cry during movies: they can bounce back like no one else's business , and are strong enough and smart enough to actually separate reality from fiction. Of course, that's not the only reason people cry at the movies. There are also tears that flow because you've been where a character has been — tears of memories that are painful. I have often found it cathartic to see movies that have people going through things I have, simply because it allows me to let some of my bottled up feelings loose in a healthier way. I'd like to see how anyone could doubt someone's strength when they actually confront things that have hurt them in the past. Then, there's the kind of tears that flow when you're really just overwhelmed with the artistic genius of a film. It's not just something pretentious people do, either. It's called Stendhal Syndrome in its more advanced forms and it means that a work of art moved you to the point that you're having both physical and emotional symptoms. Having gotten it after watching the movie Casshern , I can honestly tell you that it takes a lot of strength to jerk yourself out of that physically-altering sense of awe. For people who are really susceptible to the way that art moves them, actually viewing a seriously good movie, listening to a good radio show, or even reading the right comic can be a test of your ability to keep a straight face. It can also be a major roller coaster ride — one which forces you to face and embrace emotions most others choose not to look at . If you ask me, that's a lot of strength to shoulder. Maybe it's not the kind of strength that most people think about when they think of a strong person, but it's the most important kind of emotional strength: empathy. And to a point, intelligent acuity it takes to cry at a movie is something you really can't deny. Even if we aren't lifting 100 pounds, we are exploring our emotions, and that can lift our spirits higher than anything else out there. Related:",0
24386,"Politico Magazine: Despite Political Success, NRA Struggles to Attract Black Gun Owners - Breitbart","Although the NRA Annual Meetings were abuzz with excitement over a speech from President Trump, a growing number of women in leadership, and a diverse lineup of speakers, Politico Magazine suggests it is still struggling to make black gun owners feel welcome. [Politico Magazine reports that it was amazing “just the how white the crowd was” at the booths set up at the Annual Meetings. Yet they spoke to    Dwayne Williams  —   a black man who was at the meetings with this wife  —   as a way to show the NRA has a problem appealing to black gun owners.  The problem with this approach is that Williams told them how he has watched the NRA’s outreach to black gun owners change that he went from uninterested in joining the organization in 2012 to becoming a member in 2014. Williams spoke to the diversity of shooters and spokespersons in NRA ads and commercials. He said, “Now the NRA’s commercials are featuring different shooters. You don’t just see the white guy  —   you see the white women, the Asian guy, the Hispanic guy, the black guy not just the NRA, but the gun industry in general. ” In other words, in a column titled, “The NRA’s Struggle to Prove Black Guns Matter”  —   a column intended to show that the organization is struggling to connect with black gun owners  —   Politico Magazine highlighted a black gun owner who outlined how the NRA had connected with him. This is a very strange way of trying to show that the NRA is not connecting with black gun owners. It is even stranger when you consider that one of the NRA Leadership Forum’s featured speakers was Antonia Okafor  —   a black, female NRA member and concealed carry proponent. And her message was clear  —   the Second Amendment protects rights that belong to every   American, regardless of race: No matter the color of your skin, no matter where you come from, no matter your economic status or your education level, whether you’re young or old or a man or a woman, if you’re a   citizen of this country, you have a constitutional right to your Second Amendment and a   freedom to protect yourself and your family. There is no doubt the NRA is a political success. Truth be told, they are a political powerhouse. But it is equally true that the NRA is diverse, and those who walked the floors of the Annual Meetings this year saw not simply old white men, but old black men too. And there were women  —   black, white, and Hispanic  —   and entire families where parents were pushing their children in strollers or holding onto their hands as they walked the 15 acres of guns.

24387,"Ryan: We’ll ’Front the Money Up’ for Border Wall, Cost Is Between $8-14 Billion - Breitbart","During an interview aired on Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “For the Record,” House Speaker Representative Paul Ryan ( ) stated that while there are “a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute” to the construction of a border wall, and defining how Mexico pays for it, “we’re going to pay for it, and front the money up,” and stated the cost would be somewhere between $  billion.  Ryan said, “Well, first off, we’re going to pay for it, and front the money up, but I do think that there are various ways, of as you know  —   I know your   question is, ‘Is Mexico going to pay for the wall?’ There’s a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this, and there are different ways of defining how exactly they pay for it. Point is, he has a promise that he made to the American people, which is to secure our border. A wall is a big part of that. We agree with that goal, and we will be working with him to finance construction of a physical barrier, including the wall, on the southern border. ” Ryan was then given a cost estimate ranging between $  billion for the cost of the wall, which he said is “about right. ” (  Erica Werner) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
24389,Democrats to Kick-Off ’Resistance Summer’ to Trump with ‘House Parties’ Featuring Keith Ellison,"On the unofficial first day of summer, while most Americans are planning their barbecues and trips to the beach, the Democrats have only one thing in mind  —   ramping up their efforts to stop President Trump from enacting his agenda. [Less than a year after Democrats were still complaining about “Republican obstructionism,” the Democratic National Committee is now hyping events for what it is calling “Resistance Summer,” featuring “house parties” with DNC Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison.  “This summer, we’re investing in all 50 states and connecting with every single voter in real life on the issues that matter to them  —   from health care to education to jobs and economic opportunity,” an email to supporters says. It is the first major event by the Democrats since the election of Tom Perez to the role of DNC Chair. Perez called the summer “the starting point” for the Democrats plan to obstruct Trump’s agenda. The “Resistance Summer” will start on Saturday with “house parties” across the country. The event will feature a “kickoff livestream with Keith Ellison and some surprise guests!” according to the email. Keith Ellison was Perez’s main   rival for the nomination to DNC Chair, and was dogged by his ties to the Nation of Islam. “The best way for Democrats to turn the #Resistance into electoral wins is by doing one thing: organizing,” Ellison said in a press release earlier this month. “Resistance Summer is the starting point and will take the Democratic Party’s message of fairness and equality to activists on the front lines and all Americans looking to get engaged. ” The DNC won’t just be hosting   house parties, but will also be pumping money, in the form of grants, into state party programs.   activist group MoveOn. org is planning a similar path with their own “Summer of Resistance. ” A website for the event offers budding Bolsheviks the chance to become a “Resistance Summer MoveOn Mobilizer” and to “win tangible victories this summer against Trumpism and for a hopeful future. ” “Mobilizers” will be matched with 25 others, as well as “an expert Resistance Facilitator” and receive $150 a month for cell phone minutes, transportation, and snacks. The DNC will be hoping that the “Resistance Summer” will go smoother for them than the   “unity tour” featuring Perez and former presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). That tour was plagued by division, booing, and a host of its own awkward moments. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY",0
24391,The media are rigging the election … but against Hillary Clinton,"Republican nominee Donald Trump has claimed that the media is rigging this election against him. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
The media has made Donald Trump. Without the media, Trump would be nowhere in this election. The real rigging by the media is their shameless reporting on documents illegally leaked by the Russians to influence our election in Donald Trump’s favor. 
Trump is a creation of the media. He has expertly played the media in this campaign, gaining vastly more coverage than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . He even received some 20 minutes of free coverage when the media covered a purported announcement about his claim that President Obama was not born in the United States. 
Trump spent about 30 seconds on the birther issue and the rest of the coverage amounted to about $1 million dollars’ worth of free media advertising for his campaign and, incidentally, his new hotel as well. 
According to the TV News Archive, Trump has received about twice as many television mentions as Clinton: 1.1 million for Trump as compared to 571,485 for Clinton.",0

24401,"U.S., Mexico and Canada Likely to Affirm Joint World Cup Bid - The New York Times","Top soccer officials from the United States, Mexico and Canada have scheduled what they billed as a “historic announcement” for Monday in New York  —   the clearest indication yet that the countries will mount a joint bid to host an expanded   World Cup in 2026. For several years, plans for a joint bid have been the   secret in Concacaf, the regional confederation to which all three nations belong. The United States lost out to Qatar in bidding for the 2022 tournament when that vote was taken in 2010, and U. S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati has worked tirelessly in the years since to cultivate the support and the personal relationships inside FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, to bring the event back to the United States. The United States last hosted the World Cup in 1994, a   tournament that still holds the tournament’s attendance record (just over 3. 5 million) despite a later expansion of the field to 32 teams. The tournament will expand again for 2026, to 48 teams, under a plan approved by FIFA’s governing council in January. That plan has drawn scorn from critics who fear it will water down the field, and praise from countries that rarely get to take part. But nearly everyone agrees that an expanded event, especially one held in North America, would be the most profitable in the history of the world’s most popular sporting event. The United States, which had considered bidding alone, is expected to take a leading role in any 2026 campaign by virtue of its existing stock of stadiums, training facilities and infrastructure. Sites in Mexico and Canada most likely would host a smaller number of matches. It is unclear if all three countries would be granted direct entry into the field. Under a proposed allocation of the places for the 2026 tournament announced in late March, Concacaf’s allotment of guaranteed World Cup berths would double  —   to six from three. The proposal, which is subject to FIFA’s approval in May, would still give a guaranteed place to the host country, at the expense of its confederation’s full allotment. But in the event of   the decision of how many automatic places to give to host nations would be left to the FIFA council. Either path should be of little worry to the United States and Mexico: The Americans have played in every World Cup since 1990, and Mexico in every one since 1994. They routinely finish near the top of qualifying under the current format. But Canada last qualified in 1986, and its recent performances suggest that barring some drastic improvement, it may require a guaranteed place to take part in its own party. The bidding process will last about three years under a   plan announced in 2016. The process will culminate in a decision in May 2020, but the Concacaf bid will be an overwhelming favorite. Last year, FIFA affirmed rules that will bar Europe and Asia from bidding for the 2026 event because their confederations will host the next two tournaments. That rules out challenges from England and China, among other potential rivals, and FIFA’s other confederations  —   representing South America, Africa and Oceania  —   would be   to put together a plan that could challenge the resources available to a Concacaf campaign.",0
24402,How Facebook’s Fact-Checking Partnership Will Work - The New York Times,"To fight the spread of fake news, Facebook on Thursday said it was trying a series of tests to limit the false articles, including working with several news organizations like The Associated Press, PolitiFact and Snopes. Those groups have formed a coalition to   some of the items flagged as fake news across the social network. The Times interviewed James Goldston, the president of ABC News, which is one of the participants in Facebook’s   partnership, to learn more about the effort. How did the partnership with Facebook come about? James Goldston: We’ve been very aware of the talks about fake news through this whole election cycle. I think we regard this as a core tenet of our public service, which is to give the American people the real facts and information they can use to help make their decisions. When we heard Facebook was looking at ways to deal with the fake news issue, we were keen to get involved. And we have pretty deep links with our partners at Facebook. We’ve done virtual reality initiatives with Facebook we were the streaming source for the election. We have very good contacts there, and were eager to get on board. How will the partnership work? Obviously we have extensive   experience through numerous election cycles. So we’ve formalized that team. We’ve set up a team of about half a dozen people, and then they will draw on all of the ABC News verticals and our global reporting as needed to get to the bottom of what these stories draw on and what the American people need to know about them. It was set up in an ad hoc way during the election. Along with our assistance to Facebook, what we’ll be doing is putting out packages across all of our platforms  —   including live streams and short videos  —   content explaining what we’re finding. We’ll be collating and aggregating what we’re learning about fake news on any given week. The Pizzagate story, for example, we’ll be doing special pieces for those kinds of stories as well. Did you speak with Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, or who did you coordinate with at the social network? Our main partners are the people who run news partnerships at Facebook. There were certainly decisions within Facebook at a higher level about how they were going to approach this. Will there be any payment for this work?  No. I think it’s a genuine public service. We actually regard this as a big part of our core mission. If that core mission isn’t helping people regard the real from the fake news, I don’t know what our mission is. I think we all recognize that the reputation of the media isn’t all that great, and it’s been on all of us to address that and win that trust back. Do you think these moves will make a difference? It’s a first step. I don’t think any of us believe this alone will be the end of the fake news issue. But I think we’ll learn from it and iterate. Hopefully, over time, it will come to have a significant effect.",0

Las muertes tuvieron lugar entre los años 2007 y 2014 en residencias para personas de edad avanzada. Geoff Robins Reuters   
Elizabeth Tracy Mae Wettlaufer, una enfermera de 49 años, ha sido acusada de haber asesinado a ocho pacientes de edad avanzada en la provincia canadiense de Ontario, según ha declarado en una rueda de prensa este martes la Policía, citada por CBC News . 
Las muertes tuvieron lugar entre los años 2007 y 2014 en residencias para personas mayores en las localidades de Woodstock y Londres. Según los datos disponibles, las víctimas tenían entre 75 y 96 años. Siete pacientes fallecieron debido a una dosis letal de un medicamento, mientras que la causa del deceso de la otra víctima no ha sido revelada. 
Wettlaufer fue registrada como enfermera en la provincia en 1995 y renunció al Colegio de Enfermería de Ontario a finales del pasado mes de septiembre, después de que la Policía iniciase una investigación acerca de la muerte de ocho pacientes. 
Los amigos y vecinos de Wettlaufer quedaron en estado de 'shock' tras conocer la noticia. Según la vecina Karen Price, la enfermera "" era muy buena gente , y era fácil hablar con ella"". El enfermero que ""se aburría"" en Alemania y otro caso en Japón 
El pasado mes de junio fue abierta una investigación por la muerte de 33 personas en un hospital de Delmenhorst (Baja Sajonia, Alemania). Niels H., un antiguo enfermero que en el 2015 fue condenado a cadena perpetua por asesinar a dos de sus pacientes, podría haber estado involucrado en esas muertes. 
Durante el juicio, el acusado expresó sus condolencias a las familias de las víctimas y declaró que, ""por aburrimiento"" , inyectaba sobredosis de medicamentos a algunos enfermos para disminuir su presión sanguínea, con el objetivo de llevarlos al borde de la muerte y demostrar su capacidad para reanimarlos. 
El pasado mes de septiembre la Policía japonesa emprendió la búsqueda de un 'ángel de la muerte' que habría matado hasta a 48 pacientes de un hospital de Yokohama envenenando sus sueros intravenosos. Todas las muertes se registraron entre julio y septiembre, y todas las víctimas estaban internadas en la misma planta del centro médico.",0
24406,Child Injured Returning from Disneyland by Mexican Drunk Driver Deported 15 Times Prior,"Immigration officers deported a Mexican illegal alien 15 times before he allegedly drove drunk and crashed into a car severely injuring a small boy.

The Mexican national is alleged to have seriously injured a    boy when the family was coming home from Disneyland. [The collision occurred in San Ysidro, a district in San Diego, California, The San Diego   reported. San Ysidro is north of the U. S.  border and is an area where illegal immigrants frequently cross the border.  The family was just one block from their home when the crash occurred, the local Fox affiliate reported. Ben Lake, the young boy’s father told Fox5, “Right now he has a lot of swelling and can’t open either of his eyes so he’s scared about why he can’t see. ” “I just really care about bringing him home and making sure he’s happy again,” he said. The news outlet reported that Lake forced back tears during the interview. Immigration officers removed the    suspect, Constantino   most recently in January 2017. A U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said the illegal alien reported they removed the illegal immigrant 15 times over the last 15 years. They did not say if the prosecutors ever charged the man with illegal reentry after removal, a felony. The   reported that   was allegedly speeding when he ran a stop sign and ran into the family’s Honda Accord at 11:30 p. m. on Saturday. The uncle of Lennox, the little boy who sustained severe head injuries, posted this on a GoFundMe page: About 1030pm Saturday night, my brother Benjamin, his wife Ingrid and their son Lennox were headed to their home in California. Benjamin was driving, they were a block from their home. A guy driving an extended cab truck came flying around the corner, wheels squealing and slammed into them. They went through a guardrail and stopped facing the opposite direction. The truck smashed into the driver’s side, more fully on the rear passenger door. Unfortunately, this is where Lennox sat in his car seat. The uncle relayed that the boy sustained an open skull fracture, which necessitated surgery “opening the scalp at the hairline, peeling it off the skull to expose the damage, irrigating the area (which flushed out some small piece of bone but no debris.) They positioned the depressed bond and stitched him back up. ” He said the driver left the scene of the accident, but a Border Patrol agent swiftly arrived at the scene. Not only did the agent get an ambulance quickly, he said, but he summoned other Border Patrol agents to apprehend the suspected driver of the Chevrolet pickup truck. Police arrested the suspected drunk driver. Agents also arrested a passenger and took him to a Border Patrol station. That illegal alien is being processed for removal proceedings. The parents of the boy sustained minor injuries. The GoFundMe page, “Love for Lennox,” has raised over $10, 000.

24417,Early Voting Data Shows Trump Winning Election,"Romney won the county overall by about 17% (58-41) four years ago. So this is an area that is full of Republican voters. But let’s check out how the votes came in: 
EV = Early voting. This is people coming in to a polling place to vote before Election Day. Romney barely won among early voters by a 51-49 (2%) margin of the two-party vote. This represents a huge +15% Democrat advantage over the final outcome. 
AV = Absentee voters. These are people who mail in their ballots. Romney won among absentee ballot voters by a 60-40 (20%) margin of the two-party vote. This represents a small +3% GOP advantage over the final outcome. 
ED = Election Day voters. These are people who cast their ballots in person on Election Day. Romney won among Election Day voters by a 60-40 (20%) margin of the two-party vote. This represents a small +3 GOP advantage over the final outcome. 
So based on this data (and I have confirmed this when looking at other counties), Democrats are much better at casting early votes than they are at mailing in absentee ballots or showing up on Election Day. 
So. What are the 2016 election numbers for Lee County so far, you ask? Well, here you go – 
Early voting figures so far show a GOP advantage of 61-39 (22%) in the two-party vote. This is a 20-point pro-GOP swing over 2012. 
Absentee voting figures so far show a GOP advantage of 66-34 (32%) in the two-party vote. This is a 12-point pro-GOP swing over 2012. 
This data is indicative of a possibly huge Trump win in Florida, which is something that hasn’t been showing up in the statewide polls. This suggests that the polls are underestimating the turnout of Trump’s base. And if the polls are underestimating the turnout for Trump in Florida, then it is likely that they are likewise underestimating the turnout in other states as well. 
And note: Virtually all of this vote data came before news broke that Hillary is back under FBI investigation. So the numbers could move even more in Trump’s favor between now and Election Day. 
Some really good news about early voting numbers in Florida. Keep in mind that Obama won Florida in 2012 by less than 1% of the vote and that Democrats usually perform much better in early voting than they do on Election Day. 
Obama won Hillsborough County (Tampa) by 7 points in 2012. Early voting shows Dems outperforming GOP voters by a similar margin this year. 
BUT Obama won Pinellas County (St. Petersburg) by 6 points in 2012, while the GOP actually has a slight early vote advantage there so far this year. 
AND Romney won Brevard County (Melbourne/Cocoa Beach) by 13 points in 2012. The GOP currently holds about a 16% advantage over Dems in the early vote there. 
Point of the above data is this: Trump is on pace to significantly outperform Romney in the state of Florida, meaning he is quite likely to win the huge swing state and all of its Electoral College votes. 
Obama beat Romney by 1% in FL and 4% nationally in 2012. So, let’s call Florida 3% more pro-GOP than the country as a whole. It could well be that if Trump is beating Hillary by more than 3% in Florida (which is certainly possible given the early voting numbers), then that means he is actually AHEAD of Hillary nationally, and is on pace to win the popular vote, and is therefore quite likely to win the election.",0

Однако многие тайцы уверены, что самым лучшим способом почтить память почившего короля было бы усиление экономического благосостояния страны. В этом контексте, несмотря на год траура, объявленного по недавно почившему королю, в Бангкоке наблюдается рост экономической активности, который может достаточно быстро перекрыть эффект от тридцатидневного запрета на массовые развлечения. Однако западные СМИ продолжают твердить о том, что «траур длиной в год»— это угроза региональной безопасности, никак при этом не обосновывая свои заявления. Автор отмечает, что Вашингтон всегда бьет по наиболее уязвимым точкам того или иного государства, когда оно находится в наименее выгодном положении. И Таиланд в этом смысле не стал исключением.

24419,Planet Nine,"link I want to preface this by saying there is no ""Planet X"" IMO as pertains to the views of such a planet that many on this board hold. However, I have always felt there was a massive missing planet as we could never satisfactorily explain perturbations of a planet like Jupiter and the movement of outer objects. The view that there is a missing massive planet has always been on the table and NASA has always supported the idea and never stood in the way of people trying to find proof of it. We know planets, often many, orbit stars in this outer region, why should we be different? Link: Planet X Overview, Source: NASA Caltech researchers have found evidence suggesting there may be a ""Planet X"" deep in the solar system. This hypothetical Neptune-sized planet orbits our sun in a highly elongated orbit far beyond Pluto. The object, which the researchers have nicknamed ""Planet Nine,"" could have a mass about 10 times that of Earth and orbit about 20 times farther from the sun on average than Neptune. It may take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to make one full orbit around the sun. But this is all from January you might say, quite old and possibly already discussed. Fast forward to my news feed for today and what do I find? Narrowing the field for the 9th planet Batygin and Brown's work narrowed down the planet’s possible mass and orbit to areas where previous observations might have missed it. Their calculations suggest that it has a mass between five to 20 times that of Earth—a figure that is key to knowing the approximate size of the object they are looking for. They also suggest that its orbit is likely tilted about 30 degrees compared to the plane of the solar system—the relatively thin, flat zone in which the eight major planets orbit. They also propose that the planet is now likely near its farthest point from the sun, in the sky's northern hemisphere, and that it likely has an elongated orbit averaging between 380 and 980 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. (One AU is the average distance between Earth and the sun.) We are on the virge of finding a very real planet in our outer solar system. They previsouly released this model for what the orbit could look like: And they've created 100+ more of those which have not yet been published. n an as-yet unpublished set of about 100 new high-resolution computer simulations, Batygin says he and Brown have narrowed down Planet Nine's location to a roughly 600- to 800-square degree patch of sky. The biggest piece of proof has turned out to be the very tilt of our solar system from the perspective of the inner planets. Bailey and her colleagues ran computer simulations that suggest that the tilt of the eight official planets can be explained by the gravitational influence of Planet Nine ""over the 4.5-billion-years-ish lifetime of the solar system,"" Bailey told Space.com. This is fascinating stuff!",0

21st Century Wire says… 
One of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that Donald Trump had no support from women, latinos and blacks in the US. As it turned out, this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize Republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal Democratic mandate in America. In the end Trump gathered 29% of Latinos, 9% of African Americans and 49% of college educated white women. For months, mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for Hillary Clinton. How could they have got it so wrong? 
Psychologist and intenet radio personality Kiki Green explains how blacks were conned into voting for Hillary Clinton by the partnership between the Democratic Party, Hollywood and the Clinton campaign – by cynically using celebrities like Beyonce, Jay Z and Katie Perry…

24426,Obama Tells ILLEGALS to Go Out and Vote - SHOCK VIDEO,"
A NEW SHOCKING VIDEO is now leaving everyone stunned. Watch and see for yourself! Barack Obama is now openly calling on illegal aliens to vote in Tuesday’s election so they can help Hillary Clinton.
No one in the media is making a big scandal of out this! Let’s say the vast majority of those illegal immigrants would vote for Trump, would the media create a big scandal out of it then? Of course they would! What’s even more shocking is that this interview was conducted on November 4th, 2 days ago so we only learned about it now. The media is trying to hide this damning interview where Obama is openly calling on people to break the law!
Obama said when you vote you become a citizen! What the hell is wrong this guy?
Reporter: Many dreamers and undocumented are scared to vote, can they vote?
Obama: When you vote you become a citizen and no one will investigate you!
Imagine yourself going to Japan or South Africa to vote in their elections, what the hell is this a banana republic?
It is over folks this just shows how desperate the establishment is. Its either Trump or revolution. The American people can not accept the results of a stolen election where millions of illegals were allowed to vote.
This whole lawless administration is lies at every turn, Obamacare, Benghazi, Hillary’s private server and emails and now they are calling on illegal aliens to vote. This is the last chance the American people have to save their country and frankly the entire world. If Hillary wins now, Republicans would never stand a chance because she will bring tens of millions of more illegals who would always vote for Democrats.
Obama even has a website for illegals where he is teaching them how to vote: iwillvote.com
Gina Rodriguez asked Obama: 
“Many of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented, uhhh ‘citizens’ and I call them ‘citizens’ cause they contribute to this country are fearful of voting, so if I vote, will immigration know where I live, will they come for my family and deport us?”
Barack Obama then answered: 
“Not true! And the reason is, first of all when you vote, you are a citizen yourself and there is not a situation where the voting rolls are somehow transferred over and people start investigating, etc. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.”
Neil Cavuto of Fox Business was first to bring this video to the public on a major TV station, so we are eternally grateful about it because without him we wouldn’t have known that the Obama regime is planning to allow and not go after illegals voting in these elections!
There is no way in hell they can freaking spin this one out

24428,Rigged Election: US Blaming Russia For Future ‘Falsified Voter Fraud’,"Rigged Election: US Blaming Russia For Future ‘Falsified Voter Fraud’ by IWB · October 26, 2016 
by Baxter Dmitry 
US officials claim that if anybody produces evidence of voter fraud in the coming weeks, it will be a Russian plot to undermine people’s confidence in American democracy. 
Blaming Russia for the Democratic National Committee and Clinton Foundation hacks proved so successful at distracting Americans from the contents of the WikiLeaks emails that US officials are now attempting to blame future evidence of voter fraud on Russia too. 
The claims are being disseminated to the public via mainstream media pipelines as we speak. Reuters, operating as an organ of state propaganda, reported the claims by anonymous U.S. officials on Thursday: 
“ The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. 
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. 

They said that they did not have specific evidence of such a plan, but state and local election authorities had been warned to be vigilant for hacking attempts. “ 
The keyword in the second quoted paragraph is “ some. ” Truth mixed with lies. Reuters, in collusion with the state, are using confusion, paranoia and heavy-duty spin. Dizzy yet? 
The mainstream media has now laid the groundwork to ensure that if Clinton wins the election and is accused of voter fraud, any evidence provided to substantiate the claim can be instantly dismissed as fake Russian propaganda and not investigated properly. 
In essence, if the ruling party says that a specific document is false, then without question, it must be false. The Democrats will dismiss evidence of voter fraud as another “conspiracy theory” and “Russian plot.” 
The Democrat establishment has spent months attempting to deflect from the content of WikiLeaks emails by alleging the source of the hack was Russia. Now they are attempting to capitalize on the narrative by blaming future voter fraud evidence on Russia as well.",0

24441,Danish Father and Son Team Up on Homework and Turn In a German Warplane - The New York Times,"When Daniel Rom Kristiansen, a    student in northern Denmark, was given a homework assignment on World War II, his father had a jokey suggestion. Family legend had it that a plane crashed not far from their farm in 1944. “Go out and find the plane,” the father, Klaus Kristiansen, suggested. Much to his surprise, Daniel did. What began as a   attempt by a man to make history come alive for his son turned into   news this week when Daniel, aided by Mr. Kristiansen, discovered the wreckage of a German warplane, along with the remains of a man who might have been its pilot. After the discovery Monday, forensics police officers arrived to secure the site, along with bomb disposal experts and a representative from the German Embassy. Soon, the Danish news media descended on the farm, in the remote town of Birkelse in the north of the Jutland peninsula. Mr. Kristiansen told the Danish newspaper Politiken that his grandfather, who had lived on the farm, had told him years ago about the crash. But in 40 years of plowing the fields, Mr. Kristiansen had seen no sign of the plane. “My granddad was good at telling tall tales,” Mr. Kristiansen said. “But I doubted that this was anything more than just a story. ” After Daniel reacted enthusiastically to his fanciful challenge, Mr. Kristiansen said, he joined the boy in the field, armed with a metal detector  —   and more than a little skepticism. When the detector suddenly sounded, they started digging and found metal fragments, Mr. Kristiansen told Politiken. As their excitement mounted, they borrowed a mechanical excavator from a neighbor and dug about 16 feet into the ground. He said they were amazed to find buried a machine gun part, the remnants of an engine, a fighter pilot’s uniform, bones, a crew member’s ID and a wallet holding coins and a condom. “The plane had crashed into thousands of pieces,” Mr. Kristiansen told Politiken. “Everything was so well preserved that you could hardly see it had been laying there for nearly 75 years. ” The Kristiansens learned that they had found the wreckage of a Messerschmitt Bf 109, a warplane widely used by the Luftwaffe during World War II. An amateur historian from the nearby city of Aalborg told the local news media that a German warplane had taken off on Nov. 27, 1944, from the city, crashed into a swamp and had never been recovered. He speculated that the remains of the pilot who disappeared, Bruno Krüger, could be in Mr. Kristiansen’s field. While there are still many unanswered questions, Mr. Kristiansen told the Danish radio station DR P4 Nordjylland that Daniel had gotten a day off school to watch the teams examining the wreckage. “Luckily,” he said, “my son has something to write about in his assignment now. ”",0

More evidence of hedging Put/call ratio soars to upper end of bull market range 
With concerns about the looming election, overseas market volatility and stocks sinking to multi-month lows, options traders picked up their activity in protective puts. There were 143 put options traded on the CBOE on Tuesday for every 100 calls, among the highest amount since the bull market began more than six years ago (see chart below). 
A Contrarian Indicator High levels of put activity are often an early indication of bottoming action in stocks, and it’s no surprise that during this bull market, it has led to almost immediately higher prices. 
A week later, there was only one loss of more than 0.6%, and the risk/reward was skewed 3-to-1 to the upside. Other than the very short-term, returns across the various time frames suggested significance.”

Inspired by PM Modi’s gutsy decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes and by the generally positive reaction of the Indian public, Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif too decided to abolish high denomination currency notes and win back public favour. After a quick meeting with the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, PM Sharif, like his Indian counterpart, decided to announce his decision in a nationally televised address to the nation. 
“ Bhaiyon aur behnon! ” he roared, adopting a tone similar to Modi’s, “there comes a time in the history of a country’s development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step. For years, this country has felt that corruption, black money and terrorism are festering sores, holding us back in the race towards development. Terrorism is a frightening threat. Have you ever wondered how terrorists get their money? Enemies across the border – RAW agents to be specific – run their operations by printing fake Pakistani currency!” 
Nawaz paused to take a sip of water. 
“ Bhaiyon aur behnon! To break the grip of corruption and black money, we have decided that from midnight tonight, the Rs 5000 note and Rs 1000 note will no longer be legal tend…” 
At this point, Sharif’s address to the nation was rudely interrupted by army chief General Raheel Sharif who barged into the frame and landed a stinging slap on the PM’s face. 
“ Bhaag yahan se! [Get out of here!]” the army chief barked. 
Holding a hand to his reddened cheek, the shamefaced PM slowly got up and walked out. General Sharif turned to the camera.

24447,Amnesty Report Accuses Syria of Executing Thousands Since War Began - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The Syrian government has executed 5, 000 to 13, 000 people in mass hangings in just one of its many prisons since the start of the    uprising against President Bashar   Amnesty International contends in a new report. The report on the Saydnaya military prison, which Amnesty said was based on interviews with former detainees there, prison employees, judges and others, accuses the Syrian government of systematically executing perceived opponents after sham trials that lasted just a few minutes. Inmates are kept under conditions so dismal  —   including regular, severe beatings and deprivation of food, water, medicine and basic sanitation  —   that they amount to deliberate extermination, defined under international law as a crime against humanity, the report said. While inhumane prison conditions in Syria have been known for decades, the Amnesty report laid out what it described as new details  —   not documented by any human rights monitoring group to date  —   about the scale of the killings and the state systems required to facilitate them, including approvals by   officials. “We now know where, when and how often these hangings are taking place, as well as which elements of the Syrian government have authorized them,” said Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty researcher specializing in detention issues and one of the report’s authors. Mr. Assad, in an interview with The New York Times and other journalists last year, insisted that detainees were being treated according to Syrian law and that their families could locate them by appealing to the judicial system. But the report corroborates numerous accounts given to The Times by current and former detainees in several prisons across Syria, detailing regular torture and deprivation. It also echoes reports from families of detainees that the government has refused to provide even basic information such as where they are and whether they are alive. According to former officials cited in the report, detainees  —   most of them accused of nonviolent offenses, such as participating in demonstrations  —   are tortured into giving confessions, then taken to   military field courts, where they undergo trials lasting two to three minutes. At regular intervals, the Amnesty report said, they are gathered in the middle of the night from their cells and taken blindfolded to an execution room on the grounds of the prison near Damascus, where they are hanged. Some prisoners have managed to stand on toilets to look out windows and see bodies carted away, and the number of slippers left lying on the ground. “If there were 30 slippers, then we knew that 15 people had been executed,” Abu Osama, a former military officer detained in the prison, was quoted as saying. “There were usually between 30 and 80 slippers outside. ”",0

Chelsea Manning attempts suicide in for the second time: Transgender soldier ‘tried to kill herself again after being placed in solitary confinement’ 
 
Manning attempted suicide at Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas She was sentenced to solitary confinement after her first attempt in July Her attorneys say her deteriorating prison conditions are to blame Claim her time behind bars is an ‘assault on her health and humanity’ Was sentenced to 35 years in prison 2013 for leaking 700,00 secret military and State Department files to WikiLeaks Chelsea Manning attempted suicide for the second time in recent months, her attorneys have revealed.
The transgender soldier, who is serving a 35-year jail sentence for leaking confidential military documents, tried to kill herself at Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas last month.
According to The New York Times , she was beginning a week of solitary confinement.
Attorneys Vincent Ward and Chase Strangio declined to divulge details of Manning’s suicide attempt last month at a military prison at Kansas’ Fort Leavenworth.
Wayne Hall, an Army spokesman, said medical privacy laws barred him from discussing the matter.
Chelsea Manning attempted suicide for the second time in recent months, her attorneys have revealed. The transgender soldier (pictured), tried to kill herself at Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas last month
But Manning’s attorneys cited her prison conditions — including the solitary confinement that her legal team says she received as punishment for her July suicide attempt — as contributing to their client’s fragile mental state.
Strangio, in an email to The Associated Press, called her treatment since her 2010 arrest and subsequent time serving a 35-year sentence ‘demoralizing and destabilizing assaults on her health and humanity.’
After her July suicide attempt, I watched her begin to piece her life and spirit back together only to have that shattered by the disciplinary proceedings brought against her and then the unannounced initiation of her term of punishment last month,’ Strangio wrote. ‘She has repeatedly been punished for trying to survive and now is being repeatedly punished for trying to die.’
Strangio added he worries about Manning’s ‘ability to keep fighting under these relentless abuses.’
Manning, arrested in 2010 as Bradley Manning, was convicted in 2013 in military court of leaking more than 700,000 secret military and State Department documents to WikiLeaks.

24449,Scandalous VIDEO Footage From Anonymous EXPOSES Huma And Hillary,"0 comments If you think Anthony Weiner’s perverted antics were bad, wait until you see this! They have been together for decades, and while the truth has trickled out, technology has opened the floodgates. Enter Anonymous. The hard-to-define hacking group is doubted by many though they often get things exactly right. Their ideas about Huma Abedin, Hillary’s top assistant, have enough merit to be worth a look, though what you see may frighten you. Allegedly, Huma has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, as her mother is a member of the Brotherhood’s female counterpart. No question, she is tied to Saudi Arabia, as she was raised there. She was born in the United States, and at age two, her family moved to Saudi. Huma returned at age 18, then started her intern career with Hillary Clinton at the age of twenty. She worked for her mother’s magazine, a Jihadist publication that promotes Sharia law. The Muslim World League funds the Abedin family business, and they also funded al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Who is Human Abedin, in truth? The video below from Anonymous reveals more: 
With news of Huma’s estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, dominating the news recently, much is being presented in the news media on Weiner and Abedin’s connection to Hillary Clinton, with the ongoing FBI investigation being primary. 
As you may expect, Anonymous, as a group, joins WikiLeaks in their desire to expose the corruption of Hillary Clinton. Conflicts of interest, political scandals, money laundering, pay-for-play on an international scale, and more are the focus on Anonymous. 
The amount of information that is available on Hillary Clinton is intimidating, as her career has run for decades. 
Take a look at the video below, also from Anonymous, and consider how she and Huma Abedin have found themselves in their current set of controversial circumstances.",0
24450,Villanova Student Calls Peer Who Picked Up her Dropped Pencil A ’Racist’ in HuffPo - Breitbart,"In a column for The Huffington Post, this week, a student at Villanova University argued that being polite does not excuse the “racism” of those who are against illegal immigration. [“You heard me saying “oops” as my pencil fell, and you then took a break from writing your notes to help me pick it up. I said “thank you” with a smile you smiled back and said “no problem,” Villanova student Valeria Alvarado began. “When I was absent from class because I was sick, you let me look at your notes so I could catch up. You have even held the door open for me when we both walked out of the building together. I really appreciate the times you have helped me out when I needed it. ”  Alvarado’s column, “To the Racist Guy Who Picked Up my Pencil,” builds up to the thesis that polite acts do not excuse an individual’s underlying racism, which she claims could be seen in Facebook posts that her peer had made such as those that read “building the wall,” “#AllLivesMatter,” and “we cannot tell which refugees are terrorists. ” “This open letter goes out to every racist person who has ever picked up my dropped pencil said “bless you” after I sneezed stopped to ask me how my Christmas break was, has written “happy birthday” on my Facebook wall, has said “good morning” to me as we walk past each other on campus, or has asked me where I got my “cute shirt” from,” she continues. “No smile, compliment, or favor will erase the fact that I know you do not actually want my family and me in this country. ” Comments on the column were quick to point out that those that are against illegal immigration oppose the illegal entry of persons of all ethnic backgrounds. “Leftist (sic) often get criticized for an alleged “If you don’t agree with my views, you’re just a bigot” attitude, and this piece functions as an interesting case study in that mentality,” one commenter said. Another argued that if the author’s attitude was applied to other laws, it would seem absurd: “If I call for harsh penalties for tax fraud, it’s not personal. Learning that you cheat on your taxes doesn’t change my opinion about tax law  —   it changes my opinion about YOU. I can still be your friend, but I’ll think a little less of you. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

24453,A Small Victory at Standing Rock That Nobody’s Talking About,"
This past week, peaceful protesters were brutally arrested at Standing Rock in North Dakota attempting to protect their water from the Dakota Access Pipeline, which threatens the water of more than 18 million people in the US. Journalists and medics were arrested, cars were impounded and personal possessions were seized by police.
Once again, government officials brutalize and raise up arms against native people in a fight to steal yet more land and destroy it. It is clear to see that Morton County Sheriff’s office is the primary security protecting the construction of this pipeline.
However, amidst the chaos, many forgot a small victory that occurred last week; nearly 50 water protectors stood against more than 250 police on a bridge on County Road 134.
As Desiree Kane of Yes! Magazine reports:
It was a strategic juncture because police vehicles couldn’t cross the narrow embankments on their way to the raid. If they were stopped at this bridge from the east, they could only come from the north. In the morning, police did come, and from both sides. When I arrived, this blockade had already stopped an LRAD… Even as police numbers grew, eventually well beyond 200, the water protectors held their ground, fearless. Then the dancing began. People began dancing to a hand drum, entranced by the power of prayer.
One elderly man continuously proclaimed in a loud voice, “Send one unarmed like I am out here to negotiate. Please. We are protecting the water for our children and yours. Send one out here to negotiate. Let’s talk! Please!”
The police refused to negotiate, but after hours of this peaceful display of non-cooperation, the police retreated.
This means that those 250 jackbooted thugs could not make it from the east to join in the brutalizing of peaceful protesters. This is a victory, no matter how small. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

24456,"Even As Stocks Push Higher, Clouds Gather For The U.S. Economy - Breitbart","While President Donald Trump has said that he expects some “very good numbers” on economic growth shortly and stocks hit new highs, economic data suggests the economy is growing by less than expected. [The New York and Atlanta Federal Reserve banks both lowered their estimates of Gross Domestic Product Friday. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model forecasts seasonally adjusted real GDP growth is 2. 9 percent, down from its prior forecast of 3. 2 percent. The New York Fed’s Nowcast fell to 1. 9 percent, from 2. 25 percent a week ago.  The distance between the forecast indicates that forecasting economic growth is far from an exact science. For that matter, even calculating actual economic growth is not an exact science, as demonstrated by the fact that GDP numbers are frequently revised in the months that follow their initial release. The staffs of the Fed banks create the projections using economic models that can produce different results even when looking at the same data. But both the Atlanta and New York forecasts show a discernible trend toward slowing growth. Earlier in the quarter, the Atlanta Fed was producing growth forecasts above 3. 5 percent and even above 4. 0 percent. Forecasted growth declined steeply in late May and has not recovered as new data has come in. The June 16 forecast was the first to come in below 3. 0 percent for the second quarter. The New York Fed’s   forecast also started out near or above 3. 0 percent and has been mostly falling since then. It hit 1. 8 percent in early May, bounced back a little, but is now once again near its low. The most recent decline was driven by disappointing data on housing starts and export prices, indicating that residential investment and net exports will have a smaller contribution to GDP growth than earlier data suggested. Friday morning, U. S. consumer sentiment also unexpectedly declined. Bloomberg’s U. S. Economic Surprise, which measures whether incoming economic data beat or miss expectations, fell below zero for the first time this year. It is now at it lowest point since Trump was elected in November. This suggests the economy is losing momentum.",0
24458,Reince Priebus Urges G.O.P. Unity Behind Trump - The New York Times,"Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urged unity behind Donald J. Trump in a series of interviews on Sunday television shows and said that “people just don’t care” about recent negative reports about his tax returns and his treatment of women. During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Mr. Priebus defended Mr. Trump after an article in The New York Times on Saturday in which dozens of women who encountered Mr. Trump over his career told of unsettling conduct. Asked by Chris Wallace, the host, if he was bothered by the accusations in the article, Mr. Priebus at first said that “Well, you know, a lot of things bother me, Chris, and obviously I’m the wrong person to be asking that particular question,” but when asked again, Mr. Priebus said that voters were focused on other things. “I don’t think Donald Trump in his personal life is something that people are looking at and saying, ‘Well, I’m surprised that he has had girlfriends in the past.’ That’s not what people look at Donald Trump for,” he said. When pressed by Mr. Wallace, Mr. Priebus said, “yes, everything bothers me, Chris, but I don’t know the truth of these things, I don’t know other than reading an article whether or not these things are true. I think it’s something that Donald Trump is going to have to answer questions in regard to. ” But, the Trump campaign, Mr. Priebus added, “represents something much different than the traditional analysis of individual candidates” and that while such concerns were “legitimate,” he did not think they were “going to affect people’s view of who and what Donald Trump represents to them, given this election and the electorate. ” On CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Mr. Priebus said that whatever concerns Republicans might have, the party should rally behind Mr. Trump and he called efforts to draft a conservative for a   campaign a “suicide mission. ” “You are not only changing and throwing out eight years of the White House, but you are also throwing out, potentially, generations on the Supreme Court,” Mr. Priebus said. He was responding to an article in The Washington Post that outlined efforts among some Republican leaders, dissatisfied with Mr. Trump as the party’s   to recruit a third candidate to wage an independent bid. “Look, we could have up to three justices change over in the next eight years, and this is a suicide mission,” Mr. Priebus said. “It is not right. ” He repeated the argument on his Fox News appearance: “It’s a suicide mission for our country, because what it means is that you’re throwing down not just eight years of the White House but potentially 100 years on the Supreme Court, and wrecking this country for many generations,” he said. Mr. Priebus, who also appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” defended Mr. Trump’s resistance to releasing his tax returns. Asked on “This Week” if Mr. Trump should release his tax returns  —   an issue that dogged Mitt Romney in 2012, even after he eventually released them  —   Mr. Priebus repeated his argument that Mr. Trump operated under different political norms. “I don’t think the traditional playbook applies,” he said. “We’ve been down this road for a year. And it doesn’t apply. He’s rewritten the playbook. ”",0
24461,Trump and all the other far right leaders are Zionist stooges,"  Ian Greenhalgh is a photographer and historian with a particular interest in military history and the real causes of conflicts. His studies in history and background in the media industry have given him a keen insight into the use of mass media as a creator of conflict in the modern world. His favored areas of study include state sponsored terrorism, media manufactured reality and the role of intelligence services in manipulation of populations and the perception of events. Trump and all the other far right leaders are Zionist stooges By Ian Greenhalgh on October 27, 2016 Naming Trump, Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine Le Pen in France, the UN accused them of employing ""fear"" tactics similar to those of the Islamic State group. [Editor’s note: U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein has really hit the nail on the head here. Not only has he correctly pointed out that Trump, Nigel Farage, Marine LePen, Geert Wilders and the rest of the far-right leaders employ the tactics of fear and bigotry but he also correctly identifies their agenda as being the promotion of hatred with the eventual result that ‘colossal violence’ will ensue. However, he does not go far enough in exposing these scumbags, most likely because he knows he would be placing himself in the crosshairs of the Zionists who stand behind these puppets. What went unsaid is that all of these people are stooges for the Zionists and Israel, they are tasked with creating horrible divisions in our societies, turning white against brown and black, Christian against Muslim, indigenous against migrant. This is the Zionist agenda to weaken and enslave via the strategy of divide and conquer, as laid out in the Protocols of Zion. They want to destroy our nations by promoting inter-racial hatred and violence; they want to see the nation states of the west burn down in a wave of racially motivated violence; that is why Trump spouts such hateful and disgusting rhetoric against Mexicans, blacks and Muslims, it is to promote a race war that would devastate America.

24462,"Эх, мани, мани, были бы в кармане!","Эх, мани, мани, были бы в кармане! 22 ноября 2016 Экономика 
Как заявила в Госдуме глава Банка России Эльвира Набиуллина, модель экономики, в основе которой лежало потребление за счет доходов от экспорта сырья, себя окончательно исчерпала, хотя в ближайшие годы ее радикальной перестройки не произойдет. По ее словам, на смену изжившей себя потребительской модели поведения населения должна прийти «сберегательно-инвестиционная». 
Центробанк и иже с ними, устроив своей, мягко выражаясь, неумной политикой изрядное обнищание масс, теперь считает, что им, этим массам, недурно было бы изменить стратегию пользования деньгами. Какими? Может быть, теми, которыми распоряжаются чиновники на всех уровнях власти? Отнюдь! Госпожа Набиуллина советует нам с вами изменить свое потребительское поведение, урезав средства, которые отводятся на покупки. 
Для чего, спрашивается? А все для того, чтобы начать копить ни больше ни меньше как на черный день, как будто сейчас он для россиян какого-то другого цвета! Все-таки «страшно далеки они» там, в ЦБ, не только от народа, но и вообще от реальности: видят всё в каком-то своем цвете, кардинально изменяющем существующую картину на желаемую. 
Неужели глава Центробанка всерьез считает, что люди будут из тех скудных денежных поступлений, ручеек которых день ото дня все мелет, выделять какую-то часть, подкапливать и нести в банки? Да еще возлагать надежды на гигантский прирост сбережений? И это сейчас, когда и сберегать-то практически нечего — разве что всем дружно перейти на подножный корм, изредка разбавляя его самыми дешевыми крупами и макаронами. Народ и так сменил ассортимент продуктов на своем столе, предпочитая привычным недорогие аналоги. 
А потребность окладывать лишнее появится у жителей России не по щучьему веленью и хотенью Центробанка, а когда они сумеют удовлетворить насущные потребности. Какие? Да у каждого свои: одним квартиру для семейства надо бы попросторнее, у других назрела острая необходимость поменять машину, которая давненько на ладан дышит, третьим подросших детишек учить надо — да мало ли в чем нуждаются люди, не получившие в свое время кусок сладкого государственного пирога! 
Тем более что с подачи ЦБ процентные ставки по вкладам неуклонно падают. Поговаривают и о необходимости брать налоги с тех крох, что нарастают в банках на сбережения у обычного гражданина (не будем поминать всуе успевших наворовать или нажиться одним из «относительно честных способов»). 
Мы давно уже стали «сами себе банкирами» и не уверены, что нашим «сольдо» выгоднее полежать в ближайшие годы на вкладах, а не под матрасом или в собственной банке. Что у нас в стране скопище наивных буратин?

24465,“Homicides Up 55 Percent”–Chicago Stays Vibrant,"“Homicides Up 55 Percent”–Chicago Stays Vibrant > November 8, 2016, 10:44 am A+ | a- Warning   
With Black Lives Matter seemingly on ice until after the election, Hillary’s campaign made it through October without America’s monthly riot (although I’d forgotten the big black flash mob attack on white Temple University students in Philadelphia). But Chicago, America’s role model for one-party Democratic rule, remained vibrant. From the Chicago Tribune : 
Homicides up 55 percent in Chicago after another violent weekend 
For the second weekend in a row, more than 50 people were shot in Chicago as the number of homicides this year rose to more than 50 percent above the same period last year. 
More than 660 people have been killed in the city so far this year, according to data compiled by the Tribune. The number of people shot in Chicago this year is more than a thousand above what it was this time last year, from 2,620 to 3,795, according to Tribune data. 
Mayor Rahm released video of a dubious police shooting late last November. Ever since, blacks have been blasting away at blacks in vast numbers, because Black Lives Matter. Or something. 
From Friday afternoon to late Sunday, 10 people were killed and 41 others were wounded in shootings across Chicago, in addition to a man shot to death by police on Saturday, police said. 
Among the wounded was a 78-year-old man who was dragged out of a car in Englewood on Sunday and shot in the head. He was listed in serious condition. 
Five people were shot in a single attack in Uptown early Saturday morning, police said. 
I used to live in Uptown. It’s diverse! 
Two men, two women and a 17-year-old boy were shot about 1:35 a.m. in the 4800 block of North Winthrop Avenue. They were all taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in good condition. 
Law enforcement sources said none of them provided details of the shooting to investigators.",0
24466,GOP: We Will Be United Against Any Supreme Court Nominee Of Hillary Clinton (VIDEO),"GOP: We Will Be United Against Any Supreme Court Nominee Of Hillary Clinton (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler on October 27, 2016 
When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died last February, it threw the United States Supreme Court into chaos. The unexpected death meant that the Court was reduced to only eight members, making the likelihood of tie votes a real possibility. 
A tie means no decision, rendering the Supreme Court essentially powerless. 
President Obama quickly nominated a replacement for the super conservative Scalia. He chose the very moderate Judge Merrick Garland for the position. He hoped that his choice of a middle-of-the-road, white male might soften Republican opposition to the appointment. 
No such luck. As stiff necked as always, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) dug in his heels and refused to allow the Senate to even hold a hearing on Garland’s nomination. 
Why, you ask? Because Sen. McConnell and the rest of the GOP leadership insisted it would be better to allow the next President to choose the new Justice. 
Democrats were frustrated, but there was nothing to be done. The Republicans wanted to wait for the “next President,” so that’s what would happen. 
Now, however, to the surprise of absolutely no one in the word, the GOP is backing away from its own proposal. It looks more and more likely that the “next President” will be Hillary Clinton, and the Republicans want to eat their words. 
Last week Sen. John McCain (R-Az) said this : “I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up. I promise you.” That shocking statement was at first denounced by some in the GOP, but now it is gaining support within the Party. Some conservative legal scholars are giving their support to the outrageous idea. Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute says that the Senate would within its legal rights to simply refuse to approve any nominee of the Democratic President. He writes that the Constitution is silent of the question of whether or not the Senate is required to fill vacant seats on the Court. Other legal experts agree that the Constitution would technically allow the Senate to leave the Court essentially powerless, with eight seats divided between the two parties’ points of view. Most also agree that leaving the Court divided would be disastrous. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said : “ I t’s much more difficult for us to do our job if we are not what we’re intended to be ― a court of nine.” This level of obstructionism is completely unprecedented in American history. If in fact the Republicans chose to ignore any nominee, no matter who it might be, then they are stating an intention to upset the entire balance of power in this country. Republicans love to refer to the Founding Fathers, and they love to claim that they adhere to the principals those founders introduced. To eliminate one entire branch of our three branch government system would be far beyond irresponsible. It would be completely unAmerican. Watch here as CNN’s Jeffrey Toobin discusses the Republican threat.

24471,American Students on Spring Break Chant ’Build the Wall’ on Mexico Cruise,"A group of American spring break revelers reportedly chanted “Build that wall!” during a family show on an evening cruise in Cancun, SF Gate reported. [The Daily Mail reports that the group was aboard the Captain Hook Pirate Ship dinner cruise with other revelers when they broke out into the chants, shocking other tourists on board.  Anaximandro Amable Burga, a Peruvian tourist, was on board with his Mexican wife Suly when he witnessed the scene. “Today I was with Suly, my wife (who is a native of Mexico) watching an entertainment show off the coast of Cancun aboard a boat, and at the end of the show, a flock of Americans (maybe under the influence of alcohol, or maybe not) began to sing the infamous ‘Build that wall’ chant louder and louder,’” he wrote on Facebook. Mexican tourists aboard the ship reportedly complained about the chants, but the spring breakers did not stop. The Yucatan Times denounced the chanting in an editorial Friday saying it was an act of “xenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country. ” The paper also added that the “racist hymn” was “far from being an isolated incident” that has drawn the ire of tourism sector workers who say that the spring breakers’ actions were offensive and rude towards the Mexican people. This is not the only time chants of “build a wall” have been deemed racist by others. CNN called a video of children chanting “build a wall” at a Michigan middle school that went viral in December an example of “racism. ” Photo: file",0

Texas insurer drops push to let homeowners forgo right to sue Texas Tribune. Margarita: 
Not many (probably) remember that the largely successful effort to gut tort laws around the country started in mid-80s by insurance companies, after they lost money in the early 1980s real estate boom/bust. Not satisfied with the current tepid tort laws, they are at it again. 
And Adam Levitin via e-mail: 
I love that the arbitration is getting priced. This is a great example of what I’ve tried to teach in contracts for years: the law only looks at the one-off contract. But the insurer doesn’t give a shit about the individual contract. It’s all actuarial tables. And that creates a total mismatch. The consumer is a one time player, while the insurer is a repeat player. The consumer will rationally value the arbitration clause at basically nothing (there’s an optimism bias too–no one gets married thinking that they’re going to get divorced), because the odds of it being important are so low and there’s only one contract. But because the insurer is doing multiple contracts, even low odds matter. As a result consumers will never properly price for arbitration clauses and the like. 
Notice, btw, that the CFPB cannot stop this because it doesn’t have authority over home insurance. That’s all state level regulation.

24479,Report: Speaker Ryan Says Tom Price Plan Will Outline Obamacare Replacement,"Speaker Ryan told OppCast that the Republican Obamacare replacement plan will parallel the Empowering Patients First Act introduced by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. [Speaker Ryan said, “We’re basically putting into law the Price plan as our replace plan. It’s very similar to the bill that Tom Price has worked on for so many years, that many conservatives   last year. ”  Secretary Price served as the House Budget chairman in Congress and sponsored his bill every congressional term since the Affordable Care Act became law. Speaker Ryan explained that despite concerns about the political will to repeal Obamacare, Congress progresses toward repealing Obamacare. He said, “We’re moving to this next right now in Congress. We’re on track. We’re on our schedule. Our plan was always this spring to take on the repeal and replace of Obamacare, so we haven’t changed a thing. I notice there’s a lot of white noise in the press on this, but we’re as committed as ever before. ” The Empower Patients First Act mirrors many of the details of the Ryan plan leaked in a bill previously reported on last month. The bill provides refundable tax credits for health insurance coverage and health insurance accounts (HSA) contributions. The Department of Health and Human Services would provide state “innovation grants” that would create   pools for people with   conditions. The OppCast interview provides the first official details of Obamacare’s replacement plan. Congressional staffers denied Senator Rand Paul ( ) from viewing the Obamacare secret draft in the Capitol building. Paul submitted his bill to replace Obamacare. Senator Paul and Congressmen Mark Meadows ( ) and Jim Jordan ( ) pledged to oppose any legislation that does not fully repeal Obamacare. The Ryan plan does not fully repeal Obamacare. Congressman Mark Meadows told Breitbart News about his concerns about the Ryan plan. He explained, “We are concerned about a new federal plan that will only increase premiums and lead to higher prices. We are not going to fix health care by replacing Obamacare with another plan that won’t work. ”",0
24481,CNN’s Chris Cillizza Begs People to ‘Stop Talking’ About Anthony Weiner,"CNN    Chris Cillizza urged readers Friday to “stop talking” about disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, arguing that “there’s literally no reason to write or talk about [him] anymore. ”[“Can we now stop talking about Anthony Weiner? Like, forever?” says the headline of Cillizza’s piece.   Weiner pled guilty Friday to a charge of sending obscene material to a minor. The    girl alleged that he sent her nude photos, discussed his “rape fantasies,” and encouraged her to engage in sexually explicit conduct. Weiner will have to register as a sex offender and could face jail time. On the same day, his wife and top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin reportedly filed for divorce.  The plea appears to mark the end of the saga commonly known as “Weinergate,” which began in 2011 when the late Andrew Breitbart reported that Weiner  —   then a New York congressman  —   had been sending explicit pictures of himself to women online. Breitbart was mocked and derided by mainstream media commentators, some of whom initially called on outlets to ignore his reporting. Weiner’s “sexting” led to his resignation from Congress and later torpedoed a 2013 New York mayoral comeback run when similar messages emerged. In 2016 yet more images emerged, as well as the allegation he had sent messages to the minor. The FBI opened a probe into Weiner’s behavior and in the course of that investigation discovered emails on his laptop sent to Weiner by Abedin that originated from Hillary Clinton’s private email server. This, in turn, led   Director James Comey to announce in a letter that the agency was revisiting the probe into Clinton’s homebrew server on Oct. 28, throwing her presidential campaign into turmoil.  Clinton has dubiously blamed that letter, along with alleged Russian interference, for her election defeat. If one believes Clinton’s assertion, it makes the   “Weinergate” one of the most important political scandals in modern history. Yet, Cillizza says, on the same day Weiner pled guilty, that it is time for everyone to move on and never talk about the disgraced Democrat again. Cillizza’s argument centers on the claim that Weiner has ultimately always sought attention. Here’s the thing: We know that Weiner craves attention  —   even the negative kind. What else would explain his decision to allow documentary cameras into his   trainwreck mayoral campaign?  Cillizza says it’s time to refuse him that attention. Now that Weiner is “irrelevant politically,” it’s time to stop. Let’s not get back on that ride. No matter what he says or how much remorse he expresses, it’s clear that attention fuels Weiner. It’s his lifeblood. So let’s not give it to him. The legal proceedings are now closed. Weiner is totally irrelevant politically. His wife, who remains a major player in Hillary Clinton’s orbit, has filed for divorce, according to CNN’s Dan Merica. There’s literally no reason to write or talk about Anthony Weiner anymore. It isn’t the first time Cillizza has sought to end discussion on a difficult political subject for Democrats. Writing for The Washington Post in 2016, Cillizza wrote a piece, “Can we just stop talking about Hillary Clinton’s health now?” which complained about “wacky theories that emerge out of the fever swamps on the very fringe of the conservative movement. ” Less than a week later, at a Sept. 11 memorial, Clinton collapsed and was pictured being dragged into a van by aides. The same day, Cillizza wrote a new hot take: “Hillary Clinton’s health just became a real issue in the presidential campaign. ” Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

24483,PROFESSOR WHO PREDICTED LAST FIVE ELECTIONS SAYS TRUMP HAS 87% CHANCE OF WINNING,"Paul Joseph Watson Political science professor Helmut Norpoth, who has accurately called the results of the last five presidential elections, still asserts that Donald Trump has an 87% chance of defeating Hillary Clinton despite Clinton being ahead in the polls. Norpoth’s model has correctly predicted the outcome of the popular vote for every election since 1996, including the 2000 race where Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Bush took the presidency. “It usually turns out that the candidate who does better in his party’s primary beats the other guy who does less well,” said Norpoth, adding that Trump’s margin of victory in New Hampshire and South Carolina compared to Clinton (who lost in New Hampshire) was crucial to his model. The other factor is the “swing of the pendulum,” which makes it far more likely for a change of government if one party has been in power for two terms. Norpoth said he",0
24484,Secretary Carter to enter therapy over national guard veterans fiasco plus delirium over middle east,"Wednesday, 26 October 2016 Mr. Carter's therapy scheduled for the hanger bay of undisclosed aircraft carrier 
Spoof Investigations has just learned that the requirement US veterans pay back bonuses, given by mistake, has been suspended by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. 
Mr. Carter has also been ordered into ""therapy"" by CIC Mr. Obama due to this problem with the veterans, which has been going on for years, plus other matters. 
Therapy will take place inside the hanger bay of an undisclosed aircraft carrier, where a special section next to the aircraft and other equipment will be roped off and equipped with a couch. 
Hanger bay ops will proceed at the same time. 
The California National Guard have been particularly hard hit in this veterans fiasco, lured to bonuses ten years ago when military enrollments were declining. 
Many were then found ineligible--a mistake by the military, not the veterans--and forced to pay back bonuses they had accepted, often crippling their household finances. 
It took news coverage for the government to finally act in the form of Mr. Carter's order to suspend these re-payments. Congress has ignored the problem for years. 
Veterans who had risked their lives received letters stating they would face ""debt collection action"" if they did not re-pay. 
How this problem has affected mental health amongst veterans is now under study. 
Mr. Carter is reported already troubled with the ""confusion"" of Syria and now Mosul, as to which group of allies he is supposed to be coordinating. 
Both battle scenes, specifically in Aleppo and Mosul, are currently causing ""dizziness"" in Secretary Carter at this time, an ongoing problem. 
""I have trouble standing up straight,"" he said yesterday. 
This additional veterans' problem, finally sinking in to Mr. Carter and the Military Establishment, with the news of this veterans abuse spreading, was ""the last straw"" in his confusion-dizziness problem. 
A spokesperson for Mr. Carter stated that what with al qaeda, al nusra, ISIS, and other militant groups fighting Assad and supporting the US position, his confusion over Syria keeps growing. 
Then there's Turkey involved with a lot of bitterness over the Kurds who are effectively fighting ISIS but wanting their own territory in northern Syria. 
And generally the problems in the middle east not only involve the US but Russia, Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Yemen, Israel and who knows who else. 
To throw this veterans abuse on top of the overall chaos of US foreign policy has nearly overwhelmed the Secretary. 
Accordingly, a session in the bowels of an aircraft carrier, with top psychiatrists smoothing the way on top of the noises of aircraft and machinery screaming here and there, will be just the ticket to put the Secretary back to his right mind. 
He could also be bunked just below the flight deck if he needs to stay on a day or so as part of his treatment. Make joseph k winter's  ",0

THE US election has been put into perspective by Britons reeling from a life-changing alteration to Toblerone bars. 
Across Britain all election-watching has been immediately curtailed by a nation struggling to understand why their chocolate has changed and who allowed it to happen. 
Nathan Muir of Dumfries said: “Give Trump the nuclear codes now, I don’t give a shit. 
“Have you seen what they’ve done? The vast, barren plain of chocolate between each delicious honey-and-nougat peak? 
“Not only are we losing chocolate, how can that be fairly broken and shared? Someone’s always going to get too much. This will destroy marriages. 
“I suppose sometimes you need to be reminded of what’s really important. I remember that from when Cadbury relaunched the Snowflake in September 2001.” 
Toblerone manufacturer Mondelez said: “We have no control over the frequency of Toblerone chunks, which occur naturally according to the rhythms of the cosmos. 
“These new Toblerones show that the universe is slowing to a halt. It’s deep stuff.”

24491,An Election of Evolutionary Proportion,"Leave a reply Maureen Moss – Not a typical newsletter from me, these are words that flowed forth this morning. 
Clearly the week ahead for the United States and those across the world will be one of the most significant in history. The Presidential election is historic in and of itself, though the weeks to follow may prove to be more so. Nothing is as it appears to be. 
We are in the beginning times of an entirely new civilization, as was humanity some 200,000 years ago. Everything not harmonized with this new civilization will be dismantled… not sometime in the future… in the weeks directly in front of us. 
Hundreds of thousands of years and billions of people will be shaped by who we become individually and then collectively and how this Earth is restructured by the events unfolding now. 
We must trust we are being brought into harmony under the impulse of One system of operation. 
Long knowing that a new humanity and new global reality would be born… in this our lifetime… certainly we had little idea of how that would occur. 
Not all that long ago we came to know the responsibility we personally held to lift and stabilize our consciousness, open wide our hearts and free ourselves from the captivity of a deceptive, fearful lower nature having multiple realities. 
Certainly we started becoming aware of our desire to know ourselves authentically, thus beginning the journey to return to a singular loving nature no longer conflicted by dual pillars of truth nor at odds or war with ourselves. 
All this, in Divine right time and in preparation for a new reality to be born on Earth. It had to begin within ourselves. 
Certainly not as instinctively, was how an entire distorted external reality (politically, socially, economically and more,) operating in reverse truth, riddled with deception, lies and manipulation would come to find its true nature. 
Few would have considered how much could potentially come to Light under the glare of so much darkness, or that it would come through a Presidential election… far from over on election day regardless of the seeming winner…in the United States of America. 
This election is a seismic evolutionary event . 
In this week ahead, and those to follow… through the flurry and activity of the end times and the beginnings… as you witness the distorted psychology of the human system exposed and broken down from every angle… breathe, stay in your center and with an open heart, open mind and love… be in observance of this most profound display of activity on behalf of humanities evolution… and that of the Earth. 
Hold each other close and stay in your center . We will get through this…it has already been written.

24495,US and Turkey Split Over Kurds' Involvement in Upcoming Raqqa Operation,"Get short URL 0 108 0 0 In a further sign of growing tensions between the United States and Turkey, Pentagon officials revealed on Wednesday that the Kurdish YPG militia will play a major role in the upcoming attack on the Daesh-held city of Raqqa, and it’s not good news for Ankara. 
As coalition forces continue retaking the Iraqi city of Mosul from Daesh, US officials are looking ahead to Raqqa, the terrorist group’s Syrian stronghold. © REUTERS/ Zohra Bensemra US Detects No Actions by Turkish Troops Interfering With Mosul Operation - White House 
American forces are currently on the ground in Syria to train opposition fighters, including Kurdish YPG militia fighters operating within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), according to Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend. However, a key US ally isn’t happy about it. 
""Turkey doesn’t want to see us operating with the SDF anywhere, particularly in Raqqa. We’re having talks with Turkey and we’re going to take this in steps,"" Townsend told reporters . ""The only force that is capable on any near-term timeline are the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG are a significant portion. We’re going to take the force that we have and we will go to Raqqa soon with that force."" 
Townsend underlined the importance of liberating Raqqa, saying US officials believe the city is where the terrorist group plans most of its international attacks. 
""We think it’s very important to get isolation in place around Raqqa to start controlling that environment on a pretty short timeline."" © REUTERS/ Nour Fourat US-Led Coalition to 'Move Soon to Isolate Raqqa' 
As the eastern flank of the NATO alliance, Turkey is a vital ally to the United States and its Western partners. Tensions have been high through the administration of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Under Erdogan, Ankara has launched a crackdown on Kurdish communities in the country’s southeast. 
In what may have been an effort to appease Turkish leadership, US officials stressed that, while the YPG will play a role in the offensive, it will not be directly involved in taking Raqqa. Townsend added that the US will also play a smaller role in the Raqqa operation than it has in Mosul. ""We’ll have fewer coalition troops there, less combat capability there, we’ll have to apply coalition combat support in a different way than we are doing here in Iraq,"" he said. 
Expected to coincide with the Mosul operation, the Raqqa offensive is expected to begin soon.

24496,"British welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims Calais deputy mayor","British welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims Calais deputy mayor British welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims Calais deputy mayor By 0 151 
A French politician has blamed Britain for the crisis in Calais, claiming it was the UK’s welfare system that drove so many migrants to gather in the border town. 
Philippe Mignonet, the deputy mayor of Calais, believes the demolition of the ‘Jungle’ refugee camp will not stop the thousands of migrants from congregating in the French port town in the hope of crossing the English Channel. 
Read more 
“The UK government says it does not want any more migrants but it never expels migrants who get there,” Mignonet told the Daily Mail . 
“They claim benefits and housing, and all we get is the British-funded wall and fences.” 
For Mignonet, the £2 million (US$2.4 million) British-funded wall being built around the loading area of the Eurotunnel, which allows goods trucks to come from France into Britain, is simply not enough. 
“What English city would accept a fence and a wall being built by another country on their land? If the British government want to improve matters, they should come and talk to the city of Calais,” he added. 
Mignonet invited Prime Minister Theresa May to visit the town, and even offered to give her a covert ride from the airport. 
“I have a car with dark windows, so she doesn’t have to be seen,” Mignonet said. 
“Calais was once part of England, and we have often worked together in the past. We can work together again. The people of Britain made their choice about Brexit, and some of those choices mean they will face difficulty, but putting walls and fences up here is not right.” 
The wall, which is seen as a blight on the coastal town, could also affect the price of the land once occupied by the Jungle camp, which will soon be ready for private development. 
“This is at the door of England, and near to the shuttle terminal for trucks,” Mignonet said. “What better place for British businesses to come?” Tighter border 
The British public appears unmoved by French concerns. A new poll suggests most Brits would rather see their borders tightly secured than stay in the single market. 
According to a poll commissioned by ITV, 58 percent of Brits approve of May’s Brexit strategy of prioritizing immigration controls over the negotiation of the UK’s access to the single market. Only a quarter were against. 
Just over 40 percent of those asked insisted EU trade benefits should be prioritized throughout the divorce. However, a similar Sky News poll found the opposite to be the case. 
A breakdown of the data, however, showed twice as many older Brits support May’s ‘hard Brexit’ and immigration control policies as the younger demographic.

24499,"Melania Trump Meets Queen Rania, as White House Grapples With Crises - The New York Times","A billionaire, a queen and an American first lady walked into a public charter school on Wednesday, collecting bouquets, examining owl pellets and hugging students amid the   clicking of cameras. The visit to Excel Academy, an   charter school, by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Queen Rania of Jordan and Melania Trump, the first lady, was meant to emphasize the Trump administration’s stance on school choice. But it was also part of a day of photo ops intended to cast a softer lens on a presidential administration grappling with several international crises, and provide another glimpse of a first lady whose sporadic appearances in Washington have revealed relatively little about her own leadership style. Earlier in the day, Mrs. Trump and Queen Rania stood behind President Trump and King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House. It was just one item on Wednesday’s agenda, which was also packed with a news conference to condemn a chemical attack in Syria and meetings to discuss brokering a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. At the news conference in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said his position on the civil war in Syria and his opinion of the country’s president, Bashar   had changed. Mr. Trump did not offer details on any shift in policy. King Abdullah is viewed as a moderate voice among Arab leaders and has established himself as a willing partner to Mr. Trump. This was his second visit to Washington since Inauguration Day. The day’s visits offered the American public another look at Mrs. Trump, who has revealed relatively little about her approach to the role of first lady. As a woman who has been in the public eye for decades, Queen Rania might have provided a template of sorts for Mrs. Trump: She is an education activist and a member of Jordanian royalty, and her public presence is   with bilingual updates on her trips to schools, family events and hospitals. At the short listening session with students at Excel Academy, Queen Rania asked   questions about the coursework and curriculum. Mrs. Trump stuck to the basics, asking the students for their names and grade levels, but later elaborated on the visit in a statement relayed by the White House. “Education is critical to our efforts to shine a light on the topic of gender equality and empowerment of women,” Mrs. Trump said. “Hearing directly from teachers and the students who attend the school was an important step in the dialogue needed to further my agenda as first lady of the United States. ” The meeting between Queen Rania and Mrs. Trump was quickly framed on social media as a battle of the stylish. Both women appeared in structured looks: Mrs. Trump in a kelly green dress with a center slit and belt, and Queen Rania in a black ensemble with a high neck. Vanessa Friedman, our chief fashion critic, offered her analysis: “They both seem to have dressed for business:   and suited (or in Mrs. Trump’s case,  ). It’s a very safe look, for both women, if not one that conveys fun or relaxation  —   or even modernity. Rather, both looks respect the office, and the idea of a state visit. Though interestingly, there is also something subtly militaristic in the tailored lines of each outfit. ” Because Americans know little about her, the curiosity surrounding Mrs. Trump is sometimes focused intensely on her aesthetic: Her official portrait, released this week, instantly spawned debate over what she was wearing, her makeup, her airbrushing choices, her outfit’s designer and her physical stance. Her meeting with Queen Rania, whose outfits are often featured in tabloids for those seeking to replicate her choices, is likely to prompt a similar reaction.",0

24501,А не стоит ли оставить США наедине со своими «избранными представителями» | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: США в мире Как отмечает в своей новой статье американский режиссер и журналист Андре Влчек, странная ирония есть в том, что голосовать на выборах президента Соединенных Штатов могут только американцы, однако мириться с последствиями этих выборов должен весь мир. И хотя победу одержал Трамп, который не считается «явным представителем» западных элит, он все равно имеет к ним самое прямое отношение. Автор напоминает, что в переводе с греческого «демократия» означает «власть людей», но отнюдь не «власть элит». А потому даже то «меньшее зло», которое сегодня будет править Соединенным Штатами — все равно остается злом. Автор отмечает, что за последние десятилетия мир достаточно натерпелся от «последней империи на Земле». А потому не пора ли последовать примеру британцев, которые заявили о брексите, и объявить «вордсит» т.е. полное игнорирование США со стороны всех суверенных государств.

Phoenix’s Democrat Mayor Greg Stanton made the motion to deny the City from becoming a sanctuary jurisdiction, citing the 2010 immigration law, but then denounced President Donald Trump’s efforts of deporting criminal illegal immigrants. “We cannot allow this to continue to happen,” Phoenix resident Maria Castro said told the City Council, also noting that her mother is an illegal immigrant. “Deportations are happening every day. You are leaving orphans at home every single day. ” Others, though, took issue with illegal immigration. “We must be living in the ‘Twilight Zone,’” Tim Rafferty said. “This is the United States of America, we were built on laws. This isn’t about being mean or being hateful. This is our immigration law. ” A wide range of residents spoke before the city council, with sanctuary supporters invoking the detainment of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, an illegal alien in Phoenix, who was deported to Mexico. Garcia de Rayos had been living in the U. S. illegally since she was 14 and is married to another migrant. In 2008, she was detained by ICE after she found to be illegally using a Social Security number to work at a theme park. In 2013, a judge ordered her to return home to Mexico, but she instead was required to periodically meet with immigration officials due to lax enforcement policies under former President Obama. Now, Garcia de Rayos’ deportation is routinely used by the open borders lobby to advocate in favor of illegal immigration, as Breitbart News reported.

24511,Buchanan on ‘Russiagate’: Only Known Crimes Committed Are Leaks to Media,"Columnist Pat Buchanan asks why greater emphasis isn’t being placed on the leaking of classified intelligence to the media concerning the investigation of alleged connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. If FBI director Comey is unwilling to investigate these illegal leaks, Buchanan suggests a special counsel should. [From Buchanan’s latest column:  Is the FBI investigating the intelligence sources who committed felonies by illegally disclosing information about the Trump campaign? Comey would not commit to investigate these leaks, though this could involve criminal misconduct within his own FBI. Again, the only known crimes committed by Americans during and after the campaign are the leaks of security secrets by agents of the intel community, colluding with the Fourth Estate, which uses the First Amendment to provide cover for criminal sources, whom they hail as “whistleblowers. ” Indeed, if there was no surveillance of Trump of any kind, where did all these stories come from, which their reporters attributed to “intelligence sources”? Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any role in the Russian hacking scandal. But the Justice Department should demand that the FBI put the highest priority on investigating the deep state and its journalistic collaborators in the sabotage of the Trump presidency. If Comey refuses to do it, appoint a special counsel. Read the rest here. ",0
24513,Berlin to See First ’Jewish Campus’ Since Holocaust,"BERLIN (AP)  —   Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal doesn’t get much sleep these days, but says it’s well worth it. The community rabbi and head of the Jewish outreach group Chabad in Berlin has been campaigning relentlessly to turn his dream of creating a Jewish campus in Germany into a reality. [For years, he’s lobbied the German authorities, raised millions of euros (dollars) in funds and bought a 3, 000 square meter (32, 000 square feet) plot of land next to Chabad’s synagogue in the German capital’s Wilmersdorf district.  More than just a new facility, Teichtal sees the center as a step toward Chabad’s goal of   a vibrant Jewish community in the former Nazi capital, in part by welcoming and integrating Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union and encouraging interactions with  . “Everyone in Europe talks about fears and uncertainties, we’re talking about going forward,” said the    orthodox rabbi, looking across the large empty plot where a few containers have been set up as a temporary extension of Chabad’s kindergarten. The planned   building will be dedicated to Jewish education, culture and sports, the first of its kind in Germany. If all goes to plan, the groundbreaking is scheduled for September and the entire campus is slated to be finished in late 2019. German authorities approved some of the   permissions earlier this month. “With all the challenges we’re facing today, building this campus is a signal: We’re here to stay  —   otherwise we wouldn’t build,” says Teichtal, who wears a traditional beard, a velvet kippah and a black caftan. Germany has experienced a strong influx of Jews in recent decades and Berlin has the biggest Jewish community in Germany, with about 40, 000 members. Those numbers are still a far cry, however, from Germany’s flourishing Jewish community of more than 500, 000 before the Nazi period, with some 120, 000 Jews in Berlin alone. Overall, some six million European Jews were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Because of its history, Germany took in some 200, 000 Jews from the former Soviet Union since the fall of communism in 1989  —   most of them secular and with only little knowledge about their own religion. When Rabbi Teichtal and his wife Leah set out from Brooklyn to Berlin 20 years ago, they came with the goal of reaching out to this group, but also to the established German Jewry. Though New York based, Chabad members are sent out as “Jewish messengers” around the globe with the aim of getting mostly unaffiliated Jews in touch with their religion. In the last two decades, the Chabad community in Berlin has kept growing and there are now around 600 to 700 families who regularly take part in the community’s offerings, Teichtal said. Chabad has a synagogue, an educational center, a kindergarten, an elementary and high school  —   but the facilities are spread over the city and so popular that the Jewish group can’t offer places to all the applicants. With the establishment of the new 7, 000   (75, 300  ) campus, all Chabad schools will all be united under one roof and also offer more facilities, including a library, cafeteria, movie theater, concert hall and a ballroom for weddings and other festivities. The sports center will include an indoor basketball court and opportunities for soccer and other ball games. Outside, there’ll be a playground and a garden. The cost of the entire campus is projected at around 18 million euros ($20. 3 million). It’s being funded by the federal government, Berlin’s state government, several German foundations and private donations. Unlike most Jewish institutions in Germany, which are behind fences and tightly guarded against   attacks, Teichtal says he wants the Jewish campus to be open to everyone. “It should become a place where Jews and   can come together and meet,” he said.",0

24515,ZeniMax Seeks to Block Oculus from Using Crucial Code in VR Headsets - Breitbart,"ZeniMax has asked a judge to ban Oculus from using their code in virtual reality headsets. [Earlier in February, a court awarded ZeniMax a combined $500 million from the   Oculus and other defendants in a case that alleged a breach of   agreements and even outright theft. Oculus spokesperson Tera Randallcalled the verdict “legally flawed and factually unwarranted,” and has stated that the company is continuing to appeal the decision.  Now, ZeniMax seeks to cripple the Oculus Rift with a potential block to code vital to both the hardware and many of the games that employ it. In its verdict, the court did agree that ZeniMax code was infringed upon, though it stopped short of saying that trade secrets had been stolen. If the code is deemed unusable, it will be a major blow to both the Oculus Rift and the developers supporting it. The Facebook subsidiary is already suffering from a critical lack of consumer interest, prompting the closure of hundreds of its demo stations across the United States.   IP lawyer Mark Romeo says that this decision could put an “incredible amount of pressure on Facebook to enter into some sort of settlement” with ZeniMax. EIP lawyer Matt Jones was even more explicit: It could be a very big deal. If they are granted the injunction, it will stop Oculus from using the code. It could get around that by writing new code but that would be   and expensive. Will this push Facebook towards a settlement? Quite possibly, as often injunctions hurt businesses more than damage settlements.

Stocks fell after Comey’s announcement, CNBC reported.
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case.
“Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,” he said in a statement. “The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.” 
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September.

In mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least “four new hearings” after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public.
“This is a flashing red light of potential criminality,” Chaffetz said.
The new evidence points to a “quid pro quo” arrangement between the FBI and the State Department, he noted.

24518,Whole Foods in Deep Financial Trouble: Sales Plummet Following Deceptive Anti-Labeling Position with Monsanto,"by David Gutierrez 
The financial outlook for Whole Foods Market continues to look grim, as consumers seeking natural and organic products continue to take their business elsewhere. 
As far back as 2014, then-CEO John Mackey admitted that the company was hurting due to an explosion in the number of stores selling organic groceries. 
“The growing demand for fresh, healthy foods , the offering of natural and organic products is expanding everywhere [in] new stores, existing stores and online,” Mackey said. 
The company has also been hit by several recent scandals, including allegations of price-gouging, and more recently, of colluding with Monsanto to ensure the passage of a bill that bans the labeling of foods made with genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ). Company profits tanking 
Whole Foods was in a vulnerable financial position even before the recent scandals erupted. Organic and natural food sales have exploded in the United States in the past decade, largely due to the entry of new players into the organic grocery market. This broke what had been an all but de facto monopoly for Whole Foods. 
Organic food sales were $11 billion in 2004. By 2014, they had more than tripled. The combined organic and “natural” foods market had grown to $48 billion by 2012 – from just $6 billion in 1998. 
A watershed moment for organic foods availability – and perhaps the beginning of the end for Whole Foods – came when Walmart entered the market in 2014, introducing a store-brand organics line priced 25 percent lower than its other organic products. 
Then, last year, New York regulators accused Whole Foods of price gouging and cheating customers with false weights and measures. The company settled the charges, but the scandal only increased its image as an overpriced store that eats up your “Whole Paycheck.” 
The company’s same-store sales have fallen every quarter for the past year, with another 2.1 percent drop expected for this quarter. Overall company earnings are predicted to fall both this year and next year. And the company’s stock has tanked, falling in 2014 and 2015 to a current level of 50 percent below the 2013 high. This year, the stock has fallen more than 10 percent more. 
These factors left the company in a vulnerable position when food prices as a whole fell, causing an across-the-board drop in profits for all grocery stores. Are consumers rejecting ‘organic traitors?’ 
A factor overlooked by many financial analysts, but potentially significant for the Whole Foods customer base, is the company’s collusion in the recent passage of the Denying Americans the Right to Know (DARK) Act 2.0. Posing as a GMO labeling bill, the DARK Act 2.0 actually banned all GMO labeling initiatives passed by state or local governments. Within two years, the government is now supposed to roll out a completely voluntary labeling initiative that requires consumers to call a 1-800 number or use a smartphone to scan a QR code for GMO ingredient information. 
To top it off, the bill defines “GMO” so narrowly, that 95 percent of GMO products currently on the market are allowed to be labeled as non-GMO – including products made with corn or soy with the Bt or Roundup Ready traits. 
Where does Whole Foods come in? According to the Center for Food Safety and small organic farmers groups, the DARK Act 2.0 would never have passed if major organic foods companies – including Whole Foods – had not lent their support to the bill, joining forces with Monsanto and the Grocery Manufacturers Association. 
Other major “organic traitors” include UNFI (the country’s largest organic and natural foods wholesaler) and the Organic Trade Association, which represents companies such as Organic Valley, White Wave and Smuckers. 
Ninety percent of U.S. residents support mandatory labeling of GMO foods.

24520,"FBI Makes Stunning Reversal, Reopens Clinton Investigation After Discovery of New Documents","Posted on October 29, 2016 by Claire Bernish 
In a thoroughly stunning development, the FBI has announced the relaunch of an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and personal server , after learning of “ the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation ,” as Rep. Jason Chaffetz tweeted Friday afternoon. FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened 
— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
With just ten days to go before the presidential election, this development could knock the Clinton campaign for quite the loop — particularly amid growing controversy in revelations from campaign chair John Podesta’s emails , which continue to be published by Wikileaks on a daily basis. 
FBI Director James Comey penned a letter to Congress Friday, noting the bureau had learned additional documents had become apparent that could have bearing in the investigation of Clinton, stating , in part, via NBC News : 
“Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.” 
Although Comey did not initially make it apparent the content nor source of the documents, Federal Law Enforcement officials did acknowledge that the content originated from devices owned by one of Mrs. Clinton’s top aides, Huma Abedin and her husband, Anthony Weiner . After consulting with the team of investigators, Comey “agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to asses their importance to our investigation.” 
Comey made no suggestion whether or not the documents could be “significant,” but the fact the investigation has now been reopened certainly piques additional questions about both the new items as well as how they might have originally escaped the FBI’s attention. 
“There are outstanding questions . . . regarding a possible conflict of interest into this case,” stated House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz in a letter to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, as cited by the Washington Post . Chaffetz requested McCabe provide documentation concerning his wife’s 2015 bid for the Senate, which, as the Post notes, received financial support from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is close to Hillary Clinton. 
Chaffetz requested documents from McCabe concerning “when you first became aware the State Department was pressuring the FBI to reverse its decision regarding the classification of one of Secretary Clinton’s emails,” and, “when you first became aware the FBI had opened an investigation into Secretary Clinton’s email server.” 
Indeed, Chaffetz notes several discrepancies in interdepartmental interactions during the course of the prior investigation, such as: 
“In the spring and summer of 2015, the FBI interacted with multiple agencies regarding Secretary Clinton’s emails. In April or May of 2015, Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy began contacting officials in the FBI’s National Security Branch, which you headed prior to serving as the head of the Washington Field Office. Under Secretary Kennedy pressured FBI officials to reverse a decision regarding an email deemed by the FBI to contain classified information. …” 
Considering the increasingly embattled campaign of Hillary Clinton, and the late date for initiating further investigation, one wonders whether the abrupt discovery could be related to the putatively missing 30,000 emails which have been the subject of both consternation and ridicule for months. 
Although Comey did not reveal, well, much of anything about the decision to relaunch the investigation, it’s clear this will have a direct and resounding impact on Hillary Clinton’s contentious bid for the White House.

24526,What Rembrandt Did as a Teenager: 4 of His ‘Sense’ Works Are Reunited - The New York Times,"AMSTERDAM  —   For the first time, the four paintings still known to exist from Rembrandt’s series depicting the five senses are being displayed together. The works, completed when he was still in his teens, are presented in the exhibition “Sensation: Rembrandt’s First Paintings,” on view at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England, until Nov. 27. This   Dutch master’s allegory of smell, “The Unconscious Patient,” was discovered only a year ago at an auction in New Jersey, after being found in someone’s basement. The small auction house had given it an initial sales estimate of $500 to $800. Two Rembrandt experts suspected that it might have been an original and drove the bidding up to $870, 000. The painting has since been authenticated and is now part of the Leiden Collection in New York, a private grouping assembled by Thomas S. Kaplan and Daphne Recanati Kaplan, a married couple. The collection already contains two works in the series, depicting the senses of hearing and touch. These three were exhibited together at the Getty Center in Los Angeles in May. Now they are joined by the allegory of sight, on loan from Museum De Lakenhal in the Dutch city of Leiden, Rembrandt’s hometown. Created from 1624 to 1625, while Rembrandt was living there, these early paintings fit into a tradition of northern European genre painting. They sometimes play on the double meaning of the word for the sense that each depicts. For example, in Rembrandt’s “A Pedlar Selling Spectacles” (sight) an elderly couple with poor eyesight browse through a box of eyeglasses held by an untrustworthy street vendor. The image explores both meanings of sight: vision and observation. “These earliest of paintings by Rembrandt are fascinating in what they tell us of the young artist’s abilities and his precociousness,” An Van Camp, curator of Northern European art at the Ashmolean Museum, said in a statement. “The paintings show that at the age of just 18, Rembrandt already has a genius for representing human character and emotion, and for packing in amazing amounts of detail into the briefest of brush strokes. ” A fifth panel, which would depict taste, is missing from the exhibition, as it has not been seen for almost 400 years. Ms. van Camp said that it might be lost or destroyed. An empty frame in the exhibition space invites visitors to reflect on what it might have looked like, and, Ms. van Camp said, it might encourage them to look for it in their attics.",0

The FBI on Friday announced it is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, another shocking October surprise for the Democrat candidate days from the presidential election. 
In a letter to committees and lawmakers relevant to the matter, FBI Director James Comey cited “recent developments” for the bureau’s decision to look into new emails which may contain classified information and how they may relate to its previous investigation. 
“In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,” Comey wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC . 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
“Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be signifcant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,” Comey stated.

Back in July, Comey announced the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state would not result in a recommendation to the Justice Department to pursue charges. 
“Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,” the FBI director stated in a speech at the time.

“The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s investigation. And they are reopening their case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.” 
“Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.”

[Describing Obama’s final address to the nation as a “tepid farewell” Kassam slammed his “hour long,   snooze fest”:  “Unlike Reagan at 20 mins, Carter at 18 minutes, Clinton at 10 minutes, or Eisenhower at 15 minutes, President Obama decided to genuflect towards himself for almost an hour last night, weeping into his hanky while lauding other people’s achievements: the Navy Seal’s killing of Bin Laden, the worst economic recovery in seven decades, the Supreme Court’s decision on   marriage. “The    is a man desperate to end his presidency by being able to use the phrase ‘Yes we did’  …     More accurately, however, would have been his own phrase that he once levelled at the hard working people of this country: ‘You didn’t build that. ’” Campaigning his “legacy of mediocrity” in Chicago, Illinois, Obama was quoted as saying, “I’ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were ten, or twenty, or thirty years ago”. Kassam hit back at the claim, pointing to the racial tensions happening concurrently to the outgoing president’s final days where “a U. S. Attorney General [was] being heckled during a confirmation process by Black Lives Matter activists, and while an infantile spat takes place in Congress over a painting depicting police officers as pigs”. The Breitbart London EIC then tore into Obama for invoking the Constitution as an outdated document, the president saying, “Our constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But it’s really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own.

24532,‘Suspicious object’ at Daily Mail offices identified as a piece of factual journalism,"Monday 14 November 2016 by Davywavy and Spacey ‘Suspicious object’ at Daily Mail offices identified as a piece of factual journalism 
The offices of The Daily Mail were evacuated earlier after a suspicious object later identified as a piece of journalism was discovered in the building. 
A spokesman for the Daily Mail & General Trust confirmed they had no idea how the fact came to be at Northcliffe House and it definitely wasn’t theirs. 
Chief Ad salesman Simon Williams told us how he made the discovery. 
“My suspicions were first aroused when I saw this bit of research that included actual data and verified citations on it just lying about, and I thought ‘There’s no reason that should be here’. 
“Clearly nobody at the newspaper would have something like that nowadays, so it must have been brought in by an outsider.” 
The owner of the factual journalism has not been identified, although police are confident it did not originate in the offices of rival outlets such as the Guardian or the Canary. 
Security services are understood to be wanting to talk to a man they describe as ‘suspicious’ as CCTV footage shows him doing some actual research and speaking to experts before writing an article. 
Police described the evacuation of the offices as extremely orderly. 
“It was dead easy,” we were told. 
“We just turned on the BBC news and everyone just covered their ears and ran from the building.” 
The accurate reflection of events was discovered at around 1.30pm, and staff were told to wait in the street outside while the Mail’s specialist team of fact disposal experts investigated its contents. 
As one member of the fact disposal team explained, “We have spent thousands of man-hours perfecting the art of taking dangerous facts and making them safe for consumption by our readers. This was no different, and we were ready.

Susan Sarandon blew apart the entire gender card being played by a paniced Hillary Clinton, and her surrogates like President Barack Obama. 
Trying to shame people to vote for a candidate who is completely corrupt and misguided because of her gender is sexist and insulting…and Sarandon calls it out during this BBC Newsnight interview. 
“I don’t vote with my vagina,” Susan Sarandon answered when asked about backing Hillary Clinton simply because she is a woman. 
Sarandon did not limit her criticisms to just the BBC. 
When interviewed by CNN’s Carol Costello, Sarandon had this to say about the “completely corrupt” Hillary Clinton and the DNC… 
“After my experience in the primary, it’s very clear to me the DNC is gone.” 
“Every superdelegate is a lobbyist. The way that the system is set up in terms of trying of having superdelegates — you could win a state and not get the delegates. It’s crazy.” 
Sarandon was a big Bernie supporter during the primary elections. She told CNN that she she still respects Bernie Sanders even though he endorsed Hillary Clinton… 
“Look, Bernie has said ‘don’t ever listen to me if I tell you how to vote,.’” 
“What [Sanders] did is show people that they counted. He brought them hope. He’s supporting a lot of candidates. It’s very important to go and vote down the ticket.” 
The Hill reports that Sarandon is now clearly behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein… 
Sarandon predicted a surge in third-party support on Election Day, calling Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump “untrustable.” 
“I think we’ve been voting the lesser of two evils for too long. The good news is everybody’s so frustrated that at least we’re awake.” 
Sarandon on Monday endorsed Green Party nominee Jill Stein. 
“It’s clear a third-party is necessary and viable at this time,” she said in a letter posted on Stein’s campaign website. “ And this is the first step in accomplishing that end.” 
Stein has about 2 percent support nationally, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls.",0

Ten months ago, Ammon and Ryan Bundy caused a stir when they, along with a number of their supporters, seized control of a federally owned wildlife sanctuary. For six weeks, they occupied the land, demanding that the government surrender the nearly 200,000 acre preserve to the locals. 
After the weeks-long standoff ended peacefully, federal weapons and conspiracy charges were filed against both Bundys and 5 additional members of their group. 
Their trial , which lasted nearly as long as their attempted insurrection, ended Thursday with all parties (Ryan Bundy, Ammon Bundy, Brian Cavalier, Peter Santilli, Shawna Cox, Ryan Payne, and Joseph O’Shaughnessy) being acquitted. 
The New York Times reports: 
""The defendants never denied that they had occupied and held the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters for nearly six weeks, demanding that the federal government surrender the 188,000-acre property to local control. 
But their lawyers argued that prosecutors did not prove that the group had engaged in an illegal conspiracy that kept federal workers — employees of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management — from doing their jobs."" 
The Washington Times provided some additional information about the individual charges: 
All seven faced charges of conspiring to impede federal employees, while four were also charged with possession of firearms at a federal facility and two had an additional charge of theft of government property. 
The jury had not yet reported on one undisclosed charge, according to the Associated Press."" 
The trial was not without its exciting moments — Judge Anna J. Brown of the U.S. District Court ordered that one juror be dismissed just one day before the verdict was returned. Attorneys for the defendants called for either the juror's removal or a mistrial after he was accused of bias. 
One of the defendants, Brian “Booda” Cavalier, was sentenced on Tuesday to time served, or nine months, for “conspiring to impede federal workers through intimidation, threat or force, as well as possession of a firearm at a federal facility.” 
Immediately following the trial, Ammon Bundy was placed under arrest again.

24542,Is Who Hacked Podesta’s Emails the Issue or the Fact they are True?,"Print 
Ever notice how the criminals deflect from the real issue? That has been done by the Democrats and their useful idiots in the media. In the last debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , there were mixed views about who was behind the Wikileaks release of Democrat emails, specifically those of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta . While Trumps said he wasn't sure, Clinton claimed it was the Russians, but the real question is not who was behind the leaks, but whether or not the emails are true. 
This is the question that investigative journalist Ben Swann posed on Reality Check . 
Clinton cited 17 agencies that claim that hacks were made by Russia. Among those she referenced are the following: CIA State Department Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
Each of the agencies have credibility issues. Swann also pointed out that every one of those agencies also said the Iraq had weapons of mass destruction too, even though they didn't have them. 
Trump was right to point out that those agencies don't actually know for sure if Russia was behind the hack or not. However, the issue is not really who is behind the leaks, but whether the information being leaked is true. 
As of the report, 26,000 emails from John Podesta have been released by Wikileaks. Among those emails are many that point out the Clinton State Department and the Clinton Foundation engaged in pay-to-play schemes. 
Swann referenced an email from Clinton's chief deputy adviser Huma Abedin who said that Moroccan authorities donated $12 million to The Clinton Foundation 's global initiative in order to gain access to Clinton while she was at the State Department. 
Additionally, there have been numerous emails that demonstrate a collusion between the Clinton campaign and major media outlets. Boy, no one saw that one coming, did they? In fact, emails released by Wikileaks show at least 65 mainstream reporters working close with the Clinton campaign. 
If that wasn't enough, Glenn Thrush, who is a senior staff writer for Politico, allowed John Podesta to proofread and edit his article. In writing to Podesta, Thrush said, ""Because I have become a hack [sic] I will send u the whole section that pertains to u [sic]… Please don't share or tell anyone I did this."" Now, we know you can't trust one word that Thrush puts out. 
Also, Podesta's emails indicate that they were attempting to deceive Bernie Sanders supporters at the Democrat Convention earlier this year. 
Additionally, Clinton's staff also discussed which e-mails to release and delete. 
So, while the Clinton campaign attempts to deflect from the real issue by pointing to Russia as being engaged in hacking emails, the reality is that she is not wanting to discuss whether the information contained in the emails is true. 
Swann asks, ""If they are [true], who cares where they came from? Who cares why? Because if the accusation is that the Russians are trying to influence this election by telling the truth, then what does that tell us about how American media is trying to influence the election?"" 
I couldn't agree more. The American media has been bought and paid for, and it's not just on the Democrat side either. Several media outlets are just as guilty of hiding the truth about their own political heavy weights. It's up to Americans to be able to research for themselves and then come to a proper conclusion. However, with the way things have stacked up in the email releases, there is no doubt that the truth has been exposed. The real question is, will the American people do anything about the criminal activity that has taken place concerning Hillary Clinton and her minions? Well, if Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah is any indication , we can expect absolutely no justice from Congress or the Justice Department. shares",0
24544,Illegal Immigrant Accused of Murdering Teacher,"An illegal immigrant has been charged with the murder of a Massachusetts public school system employee. [Jose Melendez, 54, allegedly killed Sandra Hehir by strangulation in her Worcester apartment, where she was found, the Boston Globe reported.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials confirmed to Breitbart Texas that they have placed an immigration detainer on Melendez. Melendez, according to police, also used the aliases “Alvarado” and “Segura” and had a long criminal history, with most recently being arrested in a neighboring region of the state. In 2014, Melendez defaulted on probation after being convicted for breaking and entering, according to the Globe, and is currently charged in two   crimes after he allegedly used a false name with Worcester police.

24546,"""Full Spectrum Dominance"", a mirage?","License DMCA 
Russian S-500 Anti-ballistic missile system Question #1. Is ""Full Spectrum Dominance"", the Pentagon's ambitious plan to have military control over the land, sea, air and outer space, a mirage? Question #2. Has the plan been effectively neutralized by Russia's advanced technology in missile defense systems and superior early warning detection capability? Reading Pepe Escobar's latest, ""Russia Calls the War Party's Bluff"" [1] , he doesn't refer directly to the Pentagon's plan to exercise ""Full Spectrum Dominance"" yet he does mention the S-500 anti-missile system effectively seals Russia's air space . Escobar quoting a US intel source, ""The United States has lost the arms race, indulging in trillions of dollars of worthless wars...no longer a global power as it cannot defend itself with its obsolete missiles, THAAD, Patriot, and Aegis Land Based Ballistic Defense System, against Russian ICBM's, even as the Russian's have sealed their air space. The Russian's may be as much as four generations ahead of the US"". Hmm...""Full Spectrum Dominance""? Back to that in a bit. Escobar's primary focus is on Syria and the Russian S-300, 400 missile systems brought to Syria now operational on land and sea which he says, ""Russia has basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria; and a US no-fly zone is now impossible to achieve"". That effectively neutralizes any future plans the Obama administration has in mind as well as a new Hillary Clinton regime in waiting contemplating such an idea; something she's been pushing during the presidential campaign against Trump. This much seems clear. Russian President Vladimir Putin has chosen to make a stand militarily and diplomatically -the latter shouldn't be forgotten-to support Syrian President Bashar Assad's government against the assorted Pentagon, CIA, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, GCC backed proxy mercenary jihadist terrorists trained and supported by them then brought to Syria to bring about regime change. - Advertisement - With Russia entrenched in Syria regime change isn't going to happen. The current siege against the terrorists by Assad's Syrian Arab Army supported by Russian air power in eastern Aleppo continues. Meanwhile over the border in Mosul, Iraq a battle is raging to extricate IS terrorists that have controlled the city since 2014 when it routed the Iraqi army. Now an unlikely conglomeration of Shiite militia's, Sunni tribesmen, Peshmerga Kurds, Turkish army, Iraqi army, US special forces supported by US planes are besieging the city. In all likelihood when IS loses control of Mosul its remaining forces will retreat into eastern Syria becoming a new force presumably used by the US as the newest proxy force to take on Assad. This hasn't occurred yet so the focus by Assad's SAA forces is retaking and freeing the Syrian people in besieged Eastern Aleppo. Back to the original premise of this piece, the Pentagon's Full Spectrum Dominance, FSD. Nothing is really secret anymore. - Advertisement - Russia and China had to know the Pentagon's FSD plan from its inception. They had to know it was mandatory to develop and upgrade their ballistic missile technology to effectively neutralize any US plan to initiate a nuclear first strike-something that's still on the table while Russia and China have rejected the idea. Regrettably, we're in a new cold war with Russia and China. And despite some fiery rhetoric from Hillary Clinton, ""Putin's the new Hitler, wanting a no-fly zone over Syria"" and her generalized disposition to show how tough she is, there should be enough reality based resistance coming from the military, intel agencies that should short circuit any aggressive moves she has in mind that would bring any direct confrontation with Russia and China, whether in Syria, Ukraine, the South China Sea or anywhere else that could escalate into a nuclear confrontation. In conclusion the madness of initiating a nuclear first strike against Russia and China is being effectively neutralized by Russian ABM, ICBM superiority now evidenced in Syria making the Pentagon's Full Spectrum Dominance a mirage, including for Hillary ""mad dog"" Clinton.",0

24550,"Bill Cosby’s Testimony on Drugs Can Be Evidence in Sexual Assault Trial, Judge Rules - The New York Times","A judge ruled Monday that deposition testimony from a civil lawsuit in which Bill Cosby acknowledged obtaining quaaludes as part of his efforts to have sex with women can be admitted as evidence in his coming criminal trial. Prosecutors have described the testimony, given by Mr. Cosby in a 2005 lawsuit and portions of which became public in July 2015 as crucial evidence that led them to reopen the investigation into an accusation by a former Temple University staff member that he had sexually assaulted her. The Montgomery County, Pa. district attorney’s office charged Mr. Cosby last year with drugging and molesting the former staff member, Andrea Constand, at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. Mr. Cosby’s lawyers had argued that the deposition should be suppressed because, they said, he had been induced to sit for the deposition, and waive his Fifth Amendment rights against   by an alleged promise by a former county district attorney not to prosecute him. The former district attorney, Bruce L. Castor Jr. had testified during a hearing in February that he hoped the promise would lead Mr. Cosby to testify in the civil case that had been brought by Ms. Constand. But in a   ruling, Judge Steven T. O’Neill of the Court of Common Pleas in Montgomery County said he found no evidence that there had ever been such an agreement. “This court concludes that there was neither an agreement nor a promise not to prosecute, only an exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Judge O’Neill said. Mr. Cosby’s   criminal trial is currently scheduled to begin next June. In the deposition, Mr. Cosby never admitted to nonconsensual sex, but nevertheless presented himself as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women. The profile was at odds with the popular image he so long enjoyed of father figure and public moralist. Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for Mr. Cosby, declined to comment on the judge’s decision. In a statement, Kevin R. Steele, the current district attorney, said the ruling was “another step forward in this case and will aid the jury in making its determination. ” Mr. Cosby gave his testimony in the civil case over four days in September 2005 and March 2006. Ms. Constand eventually settled the lawsuit on undisclosed terms, but agreed to help in the prosecution of Mr. Cosby last year when approached by prosecutors. The decision is the latest in a series of setbacks for Mr. Cosby’s lawyers as they have sought to have the charges thrown out, or shape the evidence to be admitted at trial. Last month, Judge O’Neill rejected their argument that the delay of more than 10 years in bringing charges against Mr. Cosby denied him the right to a fair trial. At a hearing before Judge O’Neill next week, his lawyers are scheduled to argue against an attempt by Mr. Steele to introduce testimony by 13 other women who say they were also assaulted by Mr. Cosby.",0

President-elect Donald Trump is giving a lucky 3 million people the unique chance to escape the United States before it resembles the sequel to Mad Max Fury Road, WWN can reveal. 
Speaking to CBS, Trump confirmed his intention to deport over 3 million illegal immigrants who have a criminal record when he assumes office in January, prompting many American citizens to curse illegal immigrants’ good fortune. 
“Many desperate people who are currently living in fear will not be as lucky as these deportees,” confirmed political expert Conor Franken, outlining just how fortunate some illegal immigrants are. 
The fallout from the announcement has already been met with widespread derision coming from Trump’s political opponents as he revealed the figure of 3 million was plucked directly from his arse. However, signs are emerging that many people have welcomed the news. 
“How do I get deported?” querzied US citizen and LA native Max Schulmann, “Do you think I’ll be one of the lucky ones if I just rip up my passport, get a parking fine and start speaking Spanish?” 
Large queues of people seeking to win big with deportation have already begun forming at the Mexican and Canadian borders. Sadly, many have been turned away for not meeting the minimum requirement Trump has placed on qualifying for deportation which requires people to be a murderring rapist drug dealer from Mexico who bleeds the economy dry by signing up to Obamacare. 
In the wide ranging interview with CBS, Trump also took the time to row back on over 200 elections pledges he made including stances on a border wall, Hillary Clinton and Obamacare. 
“The days of politicians lying and cheating the American people are over, it’s now Donald’s turn,” Trump said, concluding the interview.",0

Health Impact News Editor Comments 
As we have previously reported here on Health Impact News, U.S. courts are increasingly becoming skeptical of the “science” behind the pediatric medical diagnosis of “shaken baby syndrome” (SBS) which has been used to take many thousands of children away from their parents, and in some cases incarcerate the parents based on the SBS designation. Just recently, the University of Michigan’s Innocence Clinic, part of the University’s law school, was awarded $250,000 to train attorneys to fight wrongful shaken baby syndrome convictions. See: 
This week, the Swedish Council on Technology and Social Evaluation and the Swedish National Medical Ethics have also come to the conclusion that the “science” behind SBS is very weak. Shaky evidence of shaken-baby syndrome 
DH.se 
Excerpts: 
The diagnosis of “shaken baby syndrome” has previously been questioned both medically and legally. Now comes the SBU and Smers investigative report that argues that the evidence of skakvåld does not measure up. 
The Swedish Council on Technology and Social Evaluation and the National Medical Ethics have jointly investigated the scientific basis for the diagnosis skakvåld to infants or in English “shaken baby syndrome”. 
After reviewing the scientific literature, explains the SBU and Smers report, there is not sufficient scientific evidence to establish that the typical damage is certainly caused by skakvåld. Skakvåld challenged in the Supreme Court 
The SBU and Smers investigation comes as a result of the diagnosis skakvåld being questioned, especially in law. 
In 2014, the Supreme Court concluded that the scientific evidence was not strong enough to judge anyone after a diagnosis of skakvåld. This was after experts testified that the children’s symptoms just as well have been caused by birth trauma and not skakvåld. Several parents have subsequently cleared of suspicions that have harmed their child with skakvåld.

24565,Investigation Finds Phillips Andover Faculty Engaged in Sexual Misconduct With Students - The New York Times,"Five former faculty members at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. including a   writer, engaged in sexual misconduct with students in the 1970s and ’80s, the head of the school reported on Tuesday. It is the latest in a string of such revelations involving elite prep schools. Three of the faculty members were identified through an investigation this year, after the school asked former students who had been abused to step forward, the head of school, John Palfrey, wrote in a message to alumni, staff, students and parents. In addition, Mr. Palfrey disclosed that there were “a small number of cases, each dating from the 1980s, in which Phillips Andover previously learned of sexual misconduct or boundary violations by faculty members. ” “In each of these cases, we have notified the relevant state officials,” he wrote, but the cases appear unlikely to result in prosecution. At least one of the former teachers is dead, and Massachusetts law states that for most crimes, a person cannot be charged more than 27 years after the encounter, or until after the victim turns 16. Accusations have come to light in recent years of sexual abuse of children by adults at Horace Mann School in the Bronx, Fessenden School in Massachusetts, St. George’s School in Rhode Island and Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, among others. Some of the accusations have been followed by startling admissions by educators of acts they committed, often decades earlier. After a spate of revelations and during a broader investigation by The Boston Globe into dozens of prep schools, Andover asked people to pass on information about abuses there. The school hired an outside firm that specializes in such cases, the Sanghavi Law Office, to investigate. Three cases it found were serious enough, Mr. Palfrey wrote, that they warranted going public with the faculty members’ names. The law firm “concluded that Alexander Theroux, formerly a    engaged in sexual misconduct toward a student in the 1970s,” Mr. Palfrey wrote. “During this investigative process, the school received multiple concerns related to Mr. Theroux’s behavior toward students. Mr. Theroux has denied these allegations. ” Investigators also found that “Stephen Wicks, while a Phillips Academy faculty member, engaged in sexual misconduct toward a student in the 1980s,” Mr. Palfrey continued. Mr. Wicks and Mr. Theroux, both in their 70s, did not return calls seeking comment. The school said that both men had been barred from campus and from Andover events, and that Mr. Wicks, a longtime art teacher who retired in 2010, had been stripped of his emeritus status. Mr. Theroux, whose short tenure at Andover ended in the early 1980s, is a novelist, poet and essayist who has taught at prestigious colleges and universities. The third former teacher who was named was H. Schuyler Royce, who died 25 years ago. The investigation revealed that Mr. Royce “engaged in multiple incidents of sexual misconduct toward a student in the 1980s,” Mr. Palfrey wrote, and raised “additional concerns related to Mr. Royce’s behavior toward students. ” Mr. Palfrey raised the prospect of more evidence coming to light and more findings being made public. “For those who have suffered past abuse, the trustees and I hope that this process provides, at the very least, acknowledgment of, and apology for, the harm they have endured,” he wrote.",0

There was one problem, however. The flight’s captain was passed out in the cockpit, apparently from drinking. The police in Calgary, Alberta, arrested the pilot, Miroslav Gronych, 37, on Saturday and have charged him with two   offenses. “This is a new one, and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane,” Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference. “There’s just so many checks and balances, it just doesn’t surprise me that he got caught before this plane was able to leave the gate. ” Nevertheless, Inspector Ken Thrower, the commander of the Calgary Police Service’s traffic and airport unit, said his officers, along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada, the aviation regulator, will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints, including airport security, while obviously inebriated. Mr. Gronych was charged with two criminal offenses: having care and control of an aircraft while impaired, and having care and control of an aircraft while testing for more than 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. “He was pretty high,” Sergeant Stacey said, adding that it was inconceivable that the pilot had followed Transport Canada regulations that bar drinking or drug use by pilots within eight hours of a flight. The aircraft was operated by Sunwing Airlines, a   carrier based in Toronto. Sunwing’s gate agents found the pilot’s behavior to be unusual and alerted the  . The   then discovered the pilot slumped in the captain’s seat and “severely impaired by alcohol,” Sergeant Stacey said. Transport Canada, which did not respond to requests for comment, is conducting a separate investigation, which is likely to result in additional charges, the police said. Inspector Thrower said Mr. Gronych is from Slovenia and is in Canada on a work visa. He will appear in court again on Thursday. After some delay, the flight did take off with a new crew. Sunwing did not respond to requests for comment. Janine Massey, a spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the carrier was “very apologetic for any upset that this has caused and would like to assure our customers that safety remains our utmost priority. ”",0

Mr. King spoke during a panel discussion, led by the MSNBC host Chris Hayes, about the racial makeup of the Republican Party on the first day of the party’s convention. “If you’re really optimistic, you can say this was the last time that old white people would command the Republican Party’s attention, its platform, its public face,” Charles P. Pierce, a writer at large at Esquire magazine, said during the panel discussion. In response, Mr. King said: “This whole ‘old white people’ business does get a little tired, Charlie. I’d ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about? Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?” “Than white people?” Mr. Hayes asked. Mr. King responded: “Than Western civilization itself that’s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America, and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world. That’s all of Western civilization. ” Frantic yelling ensued, with the panelists speaking over one another. “What about Africa? What about Asia?” April Ryan, a reporter on the panel, said. “We’re not going to argue the history of civilization,” Mr. Hayes said. “Let me note for the record that if you’re looking at the ledger of Western civilization, for every flourishing democracy you’ve got Hitler and Stalin as well. So there’s a lot on both sides. ” Some Twitter users said Mr. Hayes should have allowed a response instead of going to a commercial break, and he said on Twitter that they might have a point. Mr. King, who was first elected to Congress in 2002, did not immediately return a message seeking comment. In 2013, he attracted criticism after saying that for every child of illegal immigrants “who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. ” In June, he moved to block an effort to put Harriet Tubman, the abolitionist, on the $20 bill. On Twitter, Ms. Ryan called Mr. King “mentally stunted” and said she had wanted to respond but had not been able to get her word in. “Steve King you need to learn about race and contributions by other societies in this country,” she tweeted.

Hannah Laurison of Philadelphia had this to say: And here’s Jessica Wilbanks from Houston: “There is so much wrong with this piece that it’s hard to know where to start. How is it a hardship that wealthy men in a privileged community are taking care of their own offspring for less than 24 hours?” Not to be left out, people chimed in on Twitter, including this dad: The Huffington Post beat me to my job with a good piece on the matter that it posted this afternoon. Check it out here. There is pretty much nothing about this piece that I think was wisely considered, for all the reasons readers already articulated. The staff produced some strong, readable coverage of the march in New York, but this wasn’t among it. Here’s the silver lining, and the part I found exhilarating. The Metro editor, Wendell Jamieson, whose section produced the piece, unequivocally acknowledged that it was a mistake. “It was a bad idea from the ” Jamieson said. “It was conceived with the best intentions, but it fell flat. And I regret it. ” Classy. Needless to say, I agree.",0

24575,Civil War in the GOP: Trump Leading “Long Experiment in Populism… New Republican Party”,"
Win or lose, Trump has left his mark, and America has changed.
On the eve of the election, many Republican insiders and loyal commentators are acknowledging what has become apparent – that rise of Trump signals not just a different 2016 cycle, but an entirely new constituency – one defined by populism, by trade, by class. by the impact on jobs and economics.
Charles Krauthammer stated on Fox News that Trump is the new power broker in the GOP and the de facto “king maker” – regardless of who wins the election. The demographics of the party have changed:

Interestingly, Bill Clinton also gets it. The former president has been on the stump – ostensibly to differentiate his wife from President Obama – pointing out the fact that the middle class has been abandoned, and that these desperate people are turning to populist because they have lost something tangible in the last eight years.
As The Daily Sheeple reported :
A leaked Democratic fundraising speech Bill Clinton gave back in 2015 shows the former president telling donors that thanks to Obama, lower-income whites have lower life expectancies because they “don’t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning” now.
Bill is tacitly acknowledging the impact that terrible trade deals have had on the American economy and jobs over the last 30 years…
Not only is Bill trying to sound like a straight-talking mix of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, he is acknowledging the same new party identities that voters have assumed.
While Hillary may take the electoral college votes handily enough, the popular votes will reflect a sentiment of anger and unrest in the population.
As the NY Times noted :
[Democrats/Hillary campaign] have effectively swapped much of their working-class white base for the so-called rising demographic of millennials, nonwhite voters and suburbanites clustered near cities such as Denver, Miami, Las Vegas and Washington.
From watching these communities, it will become clear on Tuesday why Mrs. Clinton’s party enjoys a structural advantage in the Electoral College. But this election may also hasten the day when more of the heartland becomes out of reach, illustrating what Democrats lost as much as what they gained. 
The common thread is that a combination of trade deals and economic policies has destroyed the wealth of “everyday Americans” – shrinking the middle class and piling pressure onto the lower and working classes who must increasingly depend upon government assistance for their survival.

Sarah Palin condemned comedian Kathy Griffin for photographing herself holding up President Donald Trump’s severed head on Tuesday, saying Griffin is “sick. ”[“No one should be shocked at the sick audacity of sick characters. Kathy is a hurting individual. She needs help,” Palin told Breitbart News. “Can you imagine if the subject of such an outrageous visual was a liberal? Obviously, media would be unhinged and uncontained in response. ”  Griffin told a   blogger she had herself photographed holding the president’s   and severed head because she was upset about comments he made during the GOP primary season. “She said they were putting together a Trump mask and that led her to think of Trump’s infamous statement early on in the primary,” blogger Yashar Ali tweeted Tuesday. “The ‘blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her ears, blood coming out of her wherever’ statement. ” After the attempted assassination of Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 in a shooting that left six dead, the Left launched a   assault on Palin, trying to blame her for “inspiring” the severely   shooter’s actions.  A political action committee supporting Palin had released a Facebook graphic displaying crosshairs on congressional districts where Tea Party candidates could compete in the 2010 midterm elections. “We never imagined, it never occurred to us that anybody would consider it violent. We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights,” SarahPac spokeswoman Rebecca Mansour, now senior West Coast editor at Breitbart News, told ABC News at the time. Palin blasted the media and the Left for trying to smear her as an enabler of a  . “If you don’t like a person’s vision for the country, you’re free to debate that vision. If you don’t like their ideas, you’re free to propose better ideas. But, especially within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible,” Palin said. Despite further Democratic backlash against Palin’s use of the term “blood libel,”   Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said Palin’s comments were not at all “improper. ” “There is nothing improper and certainly nothing   in Sarah Palin using the term [blood libel] to characterize what she reasonably believes are false accusations that her words or images may have caused a mentally disturbed individual to kill and maim,” Dershowitz told Breitbart News’ Big Government. “The fact that two of the victims are Jewish is utterly irrelevant to the propriety of using this   term. ” Griffin said she does “not condone” violence Tuesday while joking about displaying the president’s severed, bloodied head. “I caption this ‘there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his  …     wherever’ Also @tylershields great   maker,” Griffin tweeted Tuesday.",0

Among Khan’s radical beliefs: • A woman should ask her husband permission before leaving the home… she should take care to seek permission from her husband before going out of the home that he has provided her . • The Muslim prophet Mohammed’s marriage to a nine-year-old is somehow instructive.

24585,"Wikileaks May Release Hillary's 33,000 Deleted Emails: Kim Dotcom","
Internet security expert Kim Dotcom says that Hillary Clinton is in “serious trouble,” with new information set to leak that some speculate could be a Wikileaks release of Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 deleted emails.
“There’s unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble,” the Megaupload founder tweeted last night.
Kim Dotcom’s promise is worthy of attention given his long standing relationship with Wikileaks and Julian Assange. During an interview with Bloomberg in May 2015, Dotcom (real name Kim Schmitz) acknowledged, “I love to talk to them”.
He also predicted that Julian Assange would be Hillary’s worst nightmare in 2016 “because he has access to information,” a forecast that very much came true.

There's unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble.
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) November 1, 2016 

This is not the first time that the entrepreneur’s tweets have prompted speculation to swirl. Schmitz has hinted on a number of occasions that Wikileaks is in possession of Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 missing emails.
Last week, Schmitz tweeted at Wikileaks with a video of himself reacting to “you’ve got mail” audio. Hours before, he also sent out another tweet which stated, “Bleachbit(ch) can’t bleach it,” a reference to the software tool used by Hillary to hide traces of her deleted emails.
“I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally,” Schmitz tweeted on October 27, adding that they “are all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah.”
I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump . 100% true. Retweet. pic.twitter.com/eir8r0FJ8M 
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 26, 2016 

As far back as December 2014, Schmitz also tweeted that he was “Hillary’s worst nightmare in 2016!”
Radio host Rush Limbaugh picked up on the issue during his radio show on Friday, speculating that Kim Dotcom could have been the hacker that handed Hillary’s deleted emails to Wikileaks.
“In all of these Podesta emails there’s not a single Hillary Clinton email in the bunch, if you have noticed. It’s Podesta emailing everybody, the DNC, everybody in the Hillary campaign, but there are no Hillary Clinton emails in this Podesta dump,” said Limbaugh.
“Along comes Kim Dotcom who’s got an axe to grind with the U.S. government, the Obama administration. He knows Assange. So the people — nobody knows — this is all speculation. What’s going on here is that Kim Dotcom has worked with Assange and is really the hacker. It’s not the Russians,” he added.
Is Kim Dotcom working with Wikileaks to release Hillary’s 33,000 deleted emails right before the election?
If it’s going to happen, it has to happen this week.

24587,Kurdish Politician Who Vanished in Turkey Turns Up in Iraq - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   A Kurdish politician who had been missing from southeastern Turkey since May resurfaced in Iraq on Friday after months of speculation that the Turkish authorities had detained him. The politician, Hursit Kulter, 33, a provincial leader of the Democratic Regions Party in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern town of Sirnak, disappeared on May 27. The area was under a curfew imposed by the Turkish government as part of a counterterrorism military campaign against Kurdish militants in the region. “I won’t get out,” Mr. Kulter wrote in a text message to his family on that day. “Give my greetings to everyone. ” Hours after he was reported missing, Twitter accounts that claimed to be associated with Turkish special operations teams in the area said he had been taken into custody and was being interrogated. The Turkish government denied those claims. Violence surged in Turkey’s volatile southeast after a fragile peace process broke down in July. Kurdish militants have waged an insurgency in the region for more than three decades as part of a campaign for more rights and autonomy. Mr. Kulter’s case led some human rights advocates to accuse Turkish security forces of reverting to the practice of forced disappearances that was used during the earlier years of the Kurdish conflict in the 1990s. The last reported cases were in 2001, before the Justice and Development party came to power. Mr. Kulter surfaced in Kirkuk Province in Iraq on Friday and apologized for his absence, saying security conditions had not permitted him to speak out until now. He said he had been detained by the police on May 27 and held in a basement and tortured for 13 days before he escaped. “They forced me to be an informant,” Mr. Kulter said during a news conference in Iraq, according to local news reports. “They wanted to me to make a statement against the struggle for autonomy and continuously threatened to execute me. ” The Turkish government rejected accusations of foul play, said a senior government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with government protocol. The official called Mr. Kulter’s disappearance a publicity stunt orchestrated by Kurdish militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P. K. K. to discredit the Turkish government’s counterterrorism efforts.",0
24588,U.S. Arming Syrian Rebels amid Looming Threat from Iran-Allied Militias,"The United States and its allies are expected to send more weapons to   dictator Bashar   rebels to try to repel a new push to open a supply route between Iraq and Syria by   Shiite militias fighting alongside local fighters. [According to human rights watchdog Amnesty International and news reports, citing the American armed forces, the U. S. military is arming both the   Syrian rebels and     Shiite militias in Iraq.  “[Syrian] Rebels said military aid has been boosted through two separate channels: a program backed by the U. S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) known as the MOC, and regional states including Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and one run by the Pentagon,” reveals Reuters. “This has coincided with a march toward the Syrian border by Shi’ite militias from Iraq,” namely the Badr Organization, which is part of the   Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) currently fighting alongside U. S.  Iraqi forces, adds the news outlet. Amnesty International and news reports have accused the U. S. military of arming the   PMU, also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and Hashd   to fight against the Islamic State ( ). Meanwhile, the American armed forces are reportedly providing weapons to Syrian rebels fighting against the   dictator Bashar  . The article notes: While in Iraq the United States has fought alongside   Iraqi government forces and Shi’ite militias against Islamic State, in Syria Washington has lined up against Assad’s   government and wants to block a further expansion of Iranian influence, with its regional allies, points out Reuters. “The stakes are high as Iran seeks to secure its influence from Tehran to Beirut in a ‘Shi’ite crescent’ of Iranian influence through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, where Sunni Arab states have lost out in power struggles with Iran,” it adds. Reuters learned from the Badr militia, linked to the U. S.  PMU, that its advance to the Syrian border would benefit the Assad forces. “The Americans will not be allowed to control the border,” Badr leader Hadi   told   TV. Iran has deployed tens of thousands of Shiite troops to fight on behalf of Assad in Syria, including members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) terrorists from Hezbollah, as well as fighters from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan. “Syrian rebels say the United States and its allies are sending them more arms to try to fend off a new push into the southeast by   militias aiming to open an overland supply route between Iraq and Syria,” reports Reuters. In Iraq,   PMU fighters are advancing towards the Syrian border, capturing territory along the way. American law prohibits the U. S. military from providing assistance to Iraqi groups affiliated with the government of Iran. The U. S. military has praised the   Shiite PMU for its contribution in the ongoing fight to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul, considered ISIS’s last major bastion in Iraq. Tension is reportedly building between Assad forces backed by   Shiite militias from Iraq and Syrian rebels supported by the Syrian dictator’s enemies, which includes the United States. U. S. President Donald Trump’s administration is reportedly trying to form a predominantly Sunni Arab coalition against Iran. Iran and Russia are ardent supporters of the Assad regime in Syria.",0

Twitter has been under pressure to diversify its company and board. Until 2013, the San Francisco company’s board was  . It was all Caucasian until last year. That has attracted criticism for a lack of representation of the diverse ethnic groups that use Twitter. Ms. Lee is the first   and the third woman, to serve on the company’s board. Twitter has shaken up its board since Jack Dorsey, a Twitter   returned as the chief executive last year. Omid Kordestani, a former Google executive, joined Twitter as executive chairman last year. Last month, Twitter appointed Hugh Johnson, vice chairman and chief financial officer of PepsiCo, and Martha Lane Fox, an Internet entrepreneur, to the board. Mr. Dorsey has pledged to continue the appointments of ethnically diverse candidates in prominent positions. In December, the company named Jeffrey Siminoff, previously head of diversity at Apple, as the company’s vice president for diversity and inclusion.

24591,KANSAS: Republican Mailer asks voters “Have you met the new neighbors?” (your ‘Muslim terrorist’ neighbors),"KANSAS: Republican Mailer asks voters “Have you met the new neighbors?” (your ‘Muslim terrorist’ neighbors) The Kansas Republican Party is sending out mailers in legislative races around the state depicting ISIS fighters and explosions from MUSLIM terrorist attacks. A mailer going to homes in east Wichita’s House District 88 shows an ISIS fighter holding a machine gun with a message that reads: “Have you met the new neighbors?” Wichita Eagle The other side of the mailer touts Republican Rep. Joseph Scapa’s support for funding to train Kansas law enforcement officers to “recognize and deal with foreign and domestic threats to our state, from those who support ideologies that are in conflict with the U.S. Constitution and our Kansas values.” Clay Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said similar mailers are being sent out around the state. “We did polling and focus groups, and the one issue that got overwhelming positive response and was associated with Republicans was safety,” Barker said. “You know, Gitmo, that article that came out back in August that ISIS had named soldiers for assassinations, police being shot and those knuckleheads in Garden City, it all kind of added up to a security issue … the whole feeling that’s there violence out there. And it’s a positive issue for Republicans.” The Republican mailer specifically depicts ISIS, the Islamic terror group that controls parts of Syria and Iraq. Robert McCraw, director of government affairs for the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) in Washington, D.C., called the mailers “a shameful example of scare mongering tactics that I hope the Republican Party can learn to move away from.” He said it was appalling for the state party “to falsely insinuate that the state’s Muslim population is linked to terror groups like ISIS.” “This flier verges on incitement of violence to Muslims.” The Republican-controlled Legislature has passed resolutions opposing the possible transfer of Guantanamo detainees to Fort Leavenworth. Barker said there are several variations of the mailers. One depicts an explosion from a terrorist attack. “It’s one of the few (issues) that was a clear, like high 80 percent positive and associated with Republicans,” Barker said. It’s not only Republicans who don’t want Gitmo terrorists in Kansas Barker also said the party is sending out mailers highlighting Republicans’ support for ousting four of the sitting Kansas Supreme Court justices, portraying Democrats who support retaining the justices as soft on crime. Rep. Joseph Scapa, who said he saw the mailer before it was sent out, focused his comments about the mailer more on Muslim refugees, who he says pose a potential security threat. “We have people coming into our state from parts of the world who believe in ideologies that are incompatible with the United States Constitution and our Kansas values and that poses a threat,” Scapa said. “We know for a fact that we cannot vet the people that are coming into our state from other parts of the world … where they believe in ideologies that we don’t.” 20-year-old Kansas Muslim convert John T. Booker, Jr., could face life in prison for allegedly plotting to bomb a U.S. military base. Scapa’s opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Bishop, criticized the mail campaign, saying the mailers could contribute to animosity toward Muslims in Wichita. (One can only hope) Led by Republican Governor Sam Brownback the state of Kansas informed the Obama administration this week that it is defying its dictates for Kansas to cooperate in the resettlement of refugees from Syria. In a letter to Robert Carey, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Brownback wrote, “The State of Kansas hereby withdraws its Refugee Resettlement Program State Plan and terminates its participation in all federal refugee resettlement grants and programs, effective at the earliest possible date.” Hopefully, they are the last Brownback added that he was taking his action to “protect the safety and security interests of the State of Kansas.”",0
24592,Media Hysteria: WaPo Treats Kevin McCarthy Joke as Proof of Trump-Russia Link - Breitbart,"The Washington Post released the latest salvo in the media’s effort to take down President Donald Trump on Wednesday: a joke made last year by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) suggesting that Russian President Vladimir Putin pays Trump. [The joke occurred during a private conversation involving the House Republican leadership. The conversation was recorded. The exchange  —   from the transcript alone, since the Post has not made the audio available  —   is as follows:  McCarthy: The Russians hacked the DNC and got the opp [sic] research that they had on Trump. McCarthy: laughs, [Crosstalk] Ryan: The Russian’s [sic] hacked the DNC  …     McHenry:   …    to get oppo  …     Ryan:   …    on Trump and like delivered it to  …    to who? [Unintelligible] McCarthy: There’s  …    there’s two people, I think, Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump  …    [laughter]  …    swear to God. Ryan: This is an off the record  …    [laughter]  …    NO LEAKS  …    [laughter]  …    alright?! [Laughter] Ryan: This is how we know we’re a real family here. The full context of the conversation is unclear, but the House leadership appeared to be discussing the crisis in the Ukraine, and Russian efforts to spread disinformation there. The apparent target of the joke is Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) whom the Post describes uncharitably as “a fervent defender of Putin and Russia. ” The Post‘s Adam Entous does not explain why he did not post the audio of the conversation, but two reasons seem possible: one, the laughter on the audio would underline the fact that McCarthy’s comments were intended to be humorous two, the volume of different voices might reveal who had made, and leaked, the recording. Though it is obvious from the transcript alone that the remark is a joke, the Post treats it as a serious scoop, claiming in the first paragraph that McCarthy “made a politically explosive assertion in a private conversation on Capitol Hill with his fellow GOP leaders. ” Later, the Post adds: “It is difficult to tell from the recording the extent to which the remarks were meant to be taken literally. ” No, it is not.

24594,Media Freak out over Trump’s ’Travel Ban’ Tweets - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump fired off a series of tweets on Monday morning defending his executive order suspending travel from several   countries, referring explicitly  —   and defiantly  —   to the order as a “travel ban. ”[The media pounced on Trump’s use of the phrase “travel ban,” with CNN and others declaring that Trump had undermined his own legal case, which may soon come before the U. S. Supreme Court for a decisive ruling.  Trump tweeted: People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017, The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S. C.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017, The basis of the legal challenges to Trump’s executive orders is the argument that his executive order is really an effort to exclude Muslims from the U. S. on religious grounds, and is therefore a violation of the First Amendment. But Trump’s tweets said nothing about religion. In fact, they arguably strengthen his argument that the executive orders are not motivated by religious bias, because they refer specifically to a “travel ban” and not a “Muslim ban. ” The government has argued that the travel restrictions would apply equally to people of all faiths from the countries subject to the temporary suspension. Only the word “ban” is common to both phrases. While that word suggests the president might have intended more permanent restrictions, nothing in the wording of his orders provides for that. In a Washington Post article titled “Trump’s latest tweets will likely hurt effort to restore travel ban,” correspondent Matt Zapotosky notes that the tweets “made clear  —   despite his own press secretary’s past remarks to the contrary  —   that the executive order is a ‘ban,’ not a pause on some sources of immigration or an enhanced vetting system. ” But the press secretary’s comments are irrelevant to the case, and so is the difference between a “pause” and a “ban. ” Zapotosky provided no further explanation as to how “travel ban” conveyed religious bias against Muslims. Zapotosky argues that Trump’s new endorsement of the first version of the “travel ban” also helps build a case that it was motivated by religious bias  —   but again, he fails to explain how. A federal court in Boston actually upheld that first version of the order on the grounds that the president had sweeping authority to designate classes of aliens that could be excluded from the country, and that the courts did not have authority to dictate national security policy. What appears to have happened is classic confirmation bias. Journalists and political critics of the president seem to have read “Muslim ban” into the phrase “travel ban,” confusing wishful thinking on their part for legal analysis. Joel B.

The Baian-Kara-Ula Mountains – situated in the wilderness of China – has terrain that is treacherous at best. They discovered a vast cave system during their journey. In them Chi Pu Tei discovered strange circular stone discs that appeared to have a mysterious spiralling message in unknown hieroglyphics.

24600,A New Verb in Mexico: Trumpear (From ‘to Punch’) - The New York Times,"In the state of Chihuahua in Mexico, an eatery is churning out Donald Trump tacos. They’re made with a lot of tongue, a dash of pig snout and just a little bit of cow brain. Masks of Mr. Trump’s face, topped by tufts of artificial blond hair, are rolling off the lines at a factory in Cuernavaca  —   a recent batch numbered 10, 000. At the town of Otumba’s annual May Day celebration, 40, 000 visitors were treated to a donkey dressed as him. This is Mexico’s return volley in its informal war of words with Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who fired the opening salvo the day he began his campaign, calling Mexican immigrants “rapists. ” Where Mr. Trump brought bellicosity, many in Mexico have responded with humor. As the campaign in the United States grinds on, south of the border you can buy Trump piñatas, watch the candidate be skewered in a satirical play, throw shoes at him in a video game, or purchase a special version of the classic    game balero, with Mr. Trump as the cup (you can guess where the stick goes). There are too many cartoons to count. Dámaso Morales Ramírez, a political science professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said Mr. Trump had helped stir up feelings of Mexican nationalism as “people have seized their traditions and popular expressions to defend themselves. ” “What a Mexican says through caricatures is, many times, what they wouldn’t dare say out loud,” he said. “It’s a Mexican way of expressing anger. And expressing something they don’t like. ” Mr. Ramírez pointed to a new word, Trumpear, a play on the Spanish verb trompear, which means “to hit” or “to punch. ” The exact definition of the neologism is still being debated. A Mexican reporter suggested on Twitter that it meant “to hit, to vilify, to polarize, to revile, to terrorize as an electoral strategy. ” An academic defined it as “the act and effect of proposing stupid things that are impossible to realize. ” A technology businessman wrote that it meant “to do the ridiculous and then contradict yourself afterwards. ”",0

Some of her policies include a referendum on France’s membership of the European Union, taking tough stances on radical Islamism, as well as implementing a   “France First” form of economic nationalism.

24605,Exclusive—Freedom Caucus Chairman: ‘We Will Repeal Most Aspects of Obamacare by the End of May’ - Breitbart,"House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows ( ) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he expects an Obamacare repeal bill to pass by the end of May. [Rumors started spreading last week that House Republicans were close to a deal on repealing Obamacare, and now Congressman Mark Meadows says a repeal bill will pass by the end of May. The agreement, brokered by the House Freedom Caucus chairman and Tuesday Group   Tom MacArthur ( ) would allow states to eliminate Obamacare’s community rating system  —   a rule that prohibits health insurers from pricing health care plans based on age, gender, or health status. States that repeal Obamacare’s community rating rules would have to join a federal   pool or establish a local   pool to obtain the waiver.  The deal, known as the MacArthur amendment, would also reinstate Obamacare’s Essential Health Benefits, although states could waive Obamacare’s Essential Health Benefits if they were to prove that eliminating those regulations would lower premiums, increase the number of people insured, or “advance another benefit to the public interest in the state. ” Meadows told Breitbart News that the waiver serves as a conservative compromise to repeal Obamacare. He said, “I think the waiver, while not a perfect solution, does provide an option to find common ground between more moderate and conservative elements of the Republican conference. ” Meadows added, “The waivers give states the authority and the flexibility to do what they need to do. That’s a critical component of what we need to do to fix health care and give the states the ability the instill more of the free market in health care and drive prices down. I’m encouraged by it and hope that we can get the 216 votes for it. We can certainly look back at the involvement of the White House on behalf of all Americans and give them access to affordable health care. ” The House Freedom Caucus chairman added that he will be working with conservative senators to continue to push an even more conservative repeal bill in the Senate. “I am having conversations with my colleagues in the Senate,” he explained, “where we can push for even more conservative solutions, because it was more difficult to push amendments procedurally in the House. ” Meadows commended the actions of President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Congressman Tom MacArthur for bringing the Obamacare repeal package this close to passage. He said: Not only have we made good progress, we have to get give a good shout out to Tom MacArthur and the President and the Vice President for their efforts in the last couple of weeks. It would be a mistake to suggest that had Tom MacArthur, the President, and the Vice President have not gotten involved in this process, then we would not have the options now for everyone to consider. Tom has worked closely hard with Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden and the committee to make sure that what we do is keeping in line with repealing and replacing Obamacare and drives down premiums and keeps   conditions. Meadows told Breitbart News, “I fully expect that we will repeal most aspects of Obamacare by the end of May. It may have been a deterrent in the first 100 days, but by the end of the first 120 days or so it will be seen as a significant accomplishment. It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish, as the as song used to say. We will have an excellent finish. ”",0

24608,Bus in Crash That Killed 6 in Chattanooga Had Strayed From Route - The New York Times,"The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that the school bus that crashed on Monday in Chattanooga, Tenn. killing six students, was not traveling along its regular route when it wrecked. “In the course of looking at the history of Talley Road, we just ascertained that Talley Road was not on the designated route for that school bus,” Christopher A. Hart, the board’s chairman, said, referring to the crash site. Mr. Hart, addressing reporters in Chattanooga, said investigators had not determined whether the driver had previously strayed from his assigned route. The Police Department also said on Wednesday that the death toll in the crash had risen to six children. The Police Department’s announcement on Twitter came hours after the chief executive of Durham School Services, the busing contractor for the school district in Hamilton County, Tenn. offered an emotional apology for the crash, which has prompted rigorous scrutiny of a company that transports more than a million schoolchildren in the United States each day. “I can’t fathom the anguish of the parents whose children were involved in this horrific accident and that involved one of my company’s buses,” the executive, David A. Duke, said in a video that Durham published on YouTube. “Nothing that I can say can take away the pain and the grief for these families. What I can say is I’m deeply sorry for the children that were taken from their families with so much life before them. ” Until Wednesday, Durham had issued only a terse written statement, and the video did not answer the mounting questions about the company’s safety record or hiring practices. Federal statistics, which were published last month, showed that Durham’s drivers had been involved in 142 injury crashes in 24 months, but the government’s figures did not say whether the company’s employees had been at fault in the wrecks. Mr. Duke, whose company is headquartered near Chicago, said Durham would “cooperate fully” with the National Transportation Safety Board’s inquiry into the accident in Chattanooga, a city of about 177, 000 people. The Chattanooga police are conducting a separate criminal investigation, and the bus driver, Johnthony K. Walker, has already been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, as well as reckless driving and reckless endangerment. The police said Wednesday evening that they intended to file an additional count of vehicular homicide. Mr. Walker, whom some parents said they had complained about in the months before the wreck, had “no trace” of alcohol or drugs in his system at the time of the crash, Sgt. Austin Garrett of the Chattanooga police said at a news conference on Wednesday. Sergeant Garrett, whose department did not identify the child who died on Wednesday, said that local investigators had begun reviewing video footage from the bus’s cameras. But he said that officials had not interviewed any of the children who were aboard Bus No. 366 when it crashed along Talley Road not long after leaving Woodmore Elementary School carrying 37 students. In an arrest affidavit that was released on Tuesday, a police officer said that Mr. Walker, 24, had been driving “at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 m. p. h. ”",0
24609,Controversial Proposal for Nurses Could Expand Access to Care for Veterans,"‹ › Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist. He has worked as a community organizer and activist. Controversial Proposal for Nurses Could Expand Access to Care for Veterans By Arnaldo Rodgers on October 26, 2016 Veterans By Melissa Quinn 
For years, state and federal policymakers have discussed proposals to expand the role of advanced practice registered nurses, with major physician groups like the American Medical Association squaring off against nurse organizations like the American Nurses Association. 
But a proposed rule from the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists to practice independently of physicians has brought the debate to the national spotlight and sparked an unprecedented response from the public. 
“To use advanced practice registered nurses to their full authority, it improves access and enables the delivery of high-quality care, and that’s good for everybody,” Marla Weston, CEO of the American Nurses Association, told The Daily Signal. “It’s good for the health care system, and it’s good for people in all sorts of ways.”

Hacked Messages of #BlackLivesMatter Leader Reveal Obama Admin’s Plan for ‘Summer of Chaos’ and Martial Law July 8, 2016 
“On June 11, 2016, a Twitterer who calls himself The Saint (@TheSaintNegro) tweeted a direct-message conversation on June 10 between KcKesson and another BLM leader Johnetta Elzie (Netta), in which the two discussed talking with Attorney General Loretta Lynch about plans to bring on martial law by causing chaos at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, PA, so as to keep Obama in office. JE: “Have you spoken with Mrs. Lynch [Attorney General Loretta Lynch] recently about the plan for the summer and fall leading up to the elections.” 
DM: “We spoke two weeks [ago] and they want us to start really pushing how racist Trump is now instead of waiting so the others can start getting the protesters ready to shut both conventions down.” 
DM: “If we can get both conventions shut down for messing over Bernie and for having racist Trump, then get martial law declared so Obama can stay in office we will win. Call you soon when I get to my dads so I can use his landline and we can talk more on this.” 
DM: “We have to make sure that we use our voices to keep people disrupting Trump all summer and through the fall so martial law can be declared.” Kingdom Ambassador 
QUESTION: Had the18th-century founding fathers (like their 17th-century Christian Colonial predecessors) established government and society upon Yahweh’s moral law (including biblical qualifications for civil leaders), would any of those in Crime Hill’s den of thieves (donkeys and elephants alike) be in office today? 
ANSWER: Of course not! 
Consequently, there must be a definitive moment in America’s history when her Christian character and biblical course were formally altered. That point was in 1787 when the constitutional framers replaced the 17th-century Colonials governments of, by, and for God established upon His immutable moral law for their own humanistic government of, by, and for the people based upon capricious man-made Enlightenment and Masonic traditions.
