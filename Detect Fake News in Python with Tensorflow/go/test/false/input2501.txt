25557,The Rice-Size Fly That Hits the Bull’s-Eye Every Time - The New York Times,"Despite being just the size of a rice grain, robber flies, which live all over the world, are champion predators. In field experiments, they can detect targets the size of sand grains from nearly two feet away  —   100 times the fly’s body length  —   and intercept them in under half a second. What’s more, they never miss their mark. A team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge has started to unveil the secrets to the robber fly’s prowess. In a study published Thursday in Current Biology, the team outlined the mechanics of the fly’s pursuit, from its impressive eye anatomy to how it makes a successful catch every time. Notably, the researchers observed a behavior never before described in a flying animal: About 30 centimeters from its prey, the insect slows, turns slightly and brings itself in for a close catch. “This ‘ ’ phase and change in behavior during a flight is quite remarkable,” said Sam Fabian, a graduate student at Cambridge and an author of the study. “We would actually expect them to do something very simple  —   just accelerate and hit the target. ” The scientists surveyed robber flies in the field using a “fly teaser,” which consisted of beads on a rapidly moving fishing line controlled by a motor. As the flies charged at the bait, the researchers captured their movements using   cameras. At the start of the robber fly’s conquest, it sits on a perch and scans the sky for passing prey. When it glimpses a potential meal, it takes flight, maintaining a steady angle between itself and its target. This proactive strategy, using a “constant bearing angle,” is also employed by fish, bats and sailors, Mr. Fabian said. Maintaining a constant bearing angle gets the robber fly in the ballpark of its prey. Then, at the   mark (how the fly judges this distance is still unclear) it subtly changes course so as to approach its target from behind. “We think this second proactive phase allows the animal a higher probability of catching its prey,” said Paloma   a lecturer at Cambridge and another author of the study. In the same way that it’s easier to pass a baton by running to someone from behind versus   looping around makes it easier for the fly to align itself with its kill. Next, the scientists wanted to understand the robber fly’s startling visual capabilities. Whereas we have a single lens in each eye, the robber fly has several thousand lenses per eye, which range in size. In the center of each eye, the researchers found, is a concentration of large,   lenses. This central area, called the fovea, is extremely high resolution and is what allows the flies to see their prey from a distance equivalent to more than one and a half soccer fields for humans. “They basically have permanent binoculars,” said Trevor Wardill, a research fellow at Cambridge and an author of the paper. Rob de Ruyter, a professor of biophysics at Indiana University, who was not involved in the study, said, “The extent to which this fovea is specialized is unusual. ” Other flies, like the house fly, have localized areas of high resolution in their eyes called love spots, but these are not nearly as exaggerated as the robber fly’s fovea. Dragonflies also have impressive foveae, but their bodies are 10 times larger and can more easily accommodate many large lenses in their eyes. These adaptations that make the tiny robber fly a   hunting machine are an example of how insects must develop highly specialized strategies to survive in this world, Dr. de Ruyter said. “Insects die at such high rates, and have such short generation times,” he said. “As a result, they try out new evolutionary solutions much faster than we can. ”",0
25558,People Shocked At What Hillary Brought With Her To Speech During Scandal,"People Shocked At What Hillary Brought With Her To Speech During Scandal Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton landing and speaking in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Friday 
Hillary Clinton is attempting to forge through the FBI investigation, which she hopes people will soon forget, as she refuses to accept defeat at the hands of Donald Trump. As she carries on with her sparsely-planned campaign stops in the final days of the election, Iowans were shocked to see what she brought with her to her speech right after the investigation was announced. 
No matter how hard Hillary tries, everything she hides seems to have a way of coming out. Karma is certainly working in favor of the American citizens who deserve to know the truth about this woman trying to bully her way into the White House. 
When she was in Iowa this weekend, just hours after the FBI announced they are re-opening the investigation into her e-mails thanks to her right-hand woman’s dirty husband, Hillary brought a familiar “friend” that the public couldn’t ignore, which is why photos of it have now gone viral. During the second presidential debate, we were first introduced to Hillary’s ironic nemesis, which wasn’t just her opponent Donald Trump. 
A fly pestered the Democratic candidate on live TV as she spoke, sticking to her and never touching Trump in what seemed symbolic since she stinks of lies and everyone knows flies are attracted to garbage. As embarrassingÂ as this may have been for Hillary, she can’t pass it off as a random event since it happened again in a completely different state. That’s right â while she was in Iowa, a fly once againÂ wouldn’t leave her face. Can't even make this up. How many times has a FLY landed on Crooked Rotten Hillary now?! Today at Cedar Rapids, Iowa. pic.twitter.com/tu0Ivw8rFa

Apparently, there’s something about Hillary’s face that flies flock to. and it’s probably the same thing most Americans find so repulsive. It’s not coincidental that this has now happened twice to this candidate in less than a month, and perhaps the fly is just a sign of what the FBI investigation is about to uncover. 
Like a crow symbolizing death, the black fly during this election represents the end of Hillary’s campaign since it seems to sense everything she’s trying to hide.",0

25565,Parrots: The Highlight Reel - The New York Times,"In March, Natalie Angier reported some of the latest findings about parrots, nature’s most colorful birds in more ways than one. Along with the article, we asked readers to submit videos of their feathered friends showing what makes them unique. We received hundreds of replies. Many of the videos demonstrated a longstanding fascination with the capabilities and intellects of these amazing birds. As it turns out, that fascination has a long history in The Times. A tour of our archives shows that journalists here have been reporting on what parrots can do since the   century. In 1859, a look at a book called “An Illustrated History of the Animal Kingdom” noted the capabilities of parrots. Some birds could recite the Lord’s Prayer and the Apostles’ Creed, The Times reported. In 1876, an article headlined “Anecdotes of Parrots” recounted the tale of a parrot who died in Britain in 1802 after years spent impressing her owner with her musical ability. She “beat time with all the appearance of science. ” You’ll see these capabilities echoed in the videos submitted by readers, as birds warble tunes they’ve heard people sing and keep beats as steadily as that celebrated musical prodigy. But it wasn’t always the case that parrots were thought of favorably in The Times. An article on the editorial page in 1877 attacked parrots the way the birds themselves tear into food. The polemic was prompted by a Philadelphia man’s proposal to gather the most intelligent parrots and to breed them in a program that sounds a bit like avian eugenics. “There are few persons or things that are more objectionable than the parrot,” the article began. The editorial continued, “That offensive style of bird is either kept by misanthropic old ladies or by malignant persons with a special grudge against their neighbors. ” After watching the videos submitted by readers, it’s hard to believe such charming birds could belong to people so terrible. Consider our opinion of parrot owners to be fully reformed.",0

Militant groups once again targeted West Aleppo's Hamdaniya district, as they continued to shell residential areas controlled by the government forces. Tuesday's attack came just a day after three people were killed, including a child, and 28 more injured in another attack on Hamdaniya and Salahuddin neighborhoods. The latest shelling occurred about 10am local time (07:00 GMT), reported Murad Gazdiev, RT's correspondent at the scene. He also visited Aleppo University hospital, where the victims of the most recent militant attack were being treated. Militants and terrorists that took up positions in eastern Aleppo have been constantly and indiscriminately shelling the western part of the city. On October 18, at least three people were killed and dozens injured when the Jamiliya neighborhood was shelled. The attacks come as Russia and Syrian government forces initiated a humanitarian pause by halting their air strikes a week ago. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the city did not witness any Russian or Syria air strikes for a week. Officers from the Russian reconciliation center and Syrian authorities also helped 48 women and children to leave the rebel-held area on Monday and provided them with necessary aid. Meanwhile, militants repeatedly sabotaged the ceasefire efforts by shelling humanitarian corridors and killing civilians. Moscow has been assisting Damascus in its battle against Al-Nusra terrorists, who have turned eastern Aleppo into a militant stronghold. Comment: See also:",0

Crazy Uncle Joe is at it again. Vice President Joe Biden, and potentially secretary of state should Hillary Clinton be elected (let that sink in for a minute), claimed that Clinton didn’t understand “the gravity” of using private servers to send and receive classified information as secretary of state. 
Social media users pointed out the obviously ridiculous nature of this defense, as many have throughout the whole email debacle. Clinton is either pathetically inept of dangerously corrupt — I’d argue that there’s a lot of both in the equation. Both options mean that she should be behind bars and not running for president.

Twitter user “The H2” pointed out that Clinton very likely understood the gravity just fine; it’s probably why she set up the servers in the first place. The H2 tweeted: “Ummm, she did it specifically to evade FOIA. I’m quite certain she “understood the gravity.” 
Absolutely. Clinton almost certainly set up the servers to “evade FOIA,” and the inevitable failures/corruption (such as the pay-to-play operation) she would need to cover up as secretary of state. 
The thousands of emails deleted from Clinton’s servers weren’t just yoga schedules and wedding planning — the State Department admitted there were Benghazi-related emails in there. 
Clinton is responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, and it is almost a certainty that emails pointing to her involvement were scrubbed — in addition to what we already know that points to her responsibility. She understood ""the gravity"" she just thought she could ""get away with it"" #Corruption #draintheswamp #newsisback https://t.co/TrN0xUSbaX

Jesse Eaton tweeted: “She understood ‘the gravity’ she just thought she could ‘get away with it.'” 
That about covers it. She knew what she was doing, but since she also knows where all the bodies are buried she gets to play by a different set of rules. 
We found out that President Obama, using a pseudonym, communicated with Clinton via her private email server — not her state.gov address — even though he claimed not to know about the servers until the scandal came out in the press. Why would he do that if he thought things were on the up and up and didn’t know a thing about the private server? 
That might have been part of Clinton’s insurance here as well. She may have figured that if she goes down, so does Obama. That would be pretty stupid considering Clinton found out where she sat on the totem pole in 2008, but no one ever said the woman was a genius. 
The FBI announced on Friday that it reopened the investigation of Clinton’s email scandal, and hopefully Clinton will finally be brought to justice. Not likely, but who knows?",0
25571,Israel Opposition Leader: Trump Brings ’Aura of Optimism’ to Region - Breitbart,"Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog told the Jerusalem Post conference in New York on Sunday that President Donald Trump’s support for peace “gives an aura of optimism to the region   …     a spirit of change that needs to be seized. ”[Herzog, who leads the Zionist Union party, was commenting on Trump’s recent commitment to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, which has proceeded through visits by the administration’s emissaries to the region, a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House, and a similar visit last week by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.  “The realities are the realities,” Herzog said, arguing that while the Palestinians were “extremely difficult” to deal with, there was no alternative. Regarding Netanyahu’s own commitment to peace, Herzog said that the Israeli leader’s intentions were unclear, and vowed to build a political bloc to oppose him politically if he did not follow through. Herzog was viewed as close to President Barack Obama, who used the State Department to send funds to Israeli opposition groups in an effort to defeat Netanyahu in the 2015 elections. Trump has been praised by other Arab leaders in the region, as a broad, if tacit, alliance emerges between the Sunni Arab states  —   particularly the monarchies  —   and Israel. All are facing the common threat of a potentially   Iran, and some are grappling with the dangers caused by its terrorist proxies.

Something serious appears to be happening in Russia, as well as at the Russian Consulate in New York. 
Speculation abounds as multiple events taking place in the last few hours indicate that either a very coincidental set of events just happened, or an attack has been initiated against Putin’s government. 
Here’s what we know right now. 
On the heels of a previous announced pre-positioning of cyber warfare assets last week and some 300,000 NATO troops preparing for battle in Europe, we learn this morning from RT that a massive blast at an electrical substation in Murmanks, Russia has left part of the region without power. 
What makes this outage particularly interesting is that Murmanks is the main administrative base for the entire Northern Russian Fleet . 
The northern Russian port city of Murmansk, with a population of 300,000, has been partly left without electricity following an emergency at an energy facility. Eyewitnesses captured a bright flash, after which the lights went out. … 
There have been eyewitnesses’ reports of a “ huge blast ” at one of the city’s electrical substations, according to SeverPost news agency. 
… 
There is apparently no electricity in government headquarters in the city center , FlashNord reported citing its correspondent in the area. Lights have been off in both central areas and in the outskirts, according to SeverPost. 
An incident happened at one of the facilities of the Kolenergo regional energy company, its press service told RT, without specifying what exactly happened. 
The causes of the “ incident ” are now being investigated by a special commission, the company said, adding that specialists are now working on damage control and recovery.",0

EU  (@LeaveEUOfficial) May 5, 2017,  Later in the speech, Mr. Juncker accused Britain of “abandoning” the European project but also admitted the bloc’s deficiencies played a part in people supporting Brexit. The English language jibe comes as tensions between the EU’s Brexit negotiation team and the UK Government peaked this week. Prime Minister Theresa May accused the EU of attempting to meddle in the UK’s general election, after a series of inflammatory leaks about private meetings last weekend. Reports in the German press claimed Mr. Juncker said Mrs. May was “delusional” about Brexit and that he was “10 times more sceptical” about a successful deal being reached following a dinner with the prime minister. There were also surprise claims the EU had dramatically increased the size of the “divorce” bill it is demanding the UK pays before leaving the bloc, to 100 billion euros. Mr. May hit back Wednesday, accusing European officials of threatening the UK in a deliberate attempt to influence the outcome of the June 8th snap election. “Whoever wins on 8 June will face one overriding task: to get the best possible deal for this United Kingdom from Brexit,” she said. “And, in the last few days, we have seen just how tough these talks are likely to be. “Britain’s negotiating position in Europe has been misrepresented in the continental press. The European Commission’s negotiating stance has hardened. “Threats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials. All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election that will take place on 8 June. ”",0

Donald Trump responded to Biden’s statement very literally. Stating he “would really love” to accept the challenge to a fistfight.

Asked if he wished he could debate Trump, a furious Biden replied that he wished he were in high school so ‘I could take him behind the gym.’

25586,’Conan Exiles’ Won’t Have Customizable Penis Sizes on Xbox One - Breitbart,"The Xbox One port of Funcom’s fantasy survival simulation Conan Exiles will not feature a “penis slider” in the character creation tools. [If you’re feeling a wee bit insecure about your prospective Xbox barbarian, I have some bad news. Microsoft is reportedly forcing the creators of Conan Exiles to castrate the character creation system in the upcoming port of their popular survival game. No, you will not be able to ensure you are as   (or not) as you imagine your shirtless savage should be. In fact, you very well might not have a visible penis at all.  Funcom Creative Director Joe Bylos said that “Xbox has been pretty clear with us that it’s not going to fly. ” Even so, there remains hope that the oily, burly manly men of the greater Cimmerian zip codes won’t be entirely neutered. According to Bylos, “It’s just going to be off by default I think. I don’t know if partial nudity might be OK. ” He’s a little bit more hopeful for the continued existence of bare breasts, but the developers “haven’t spoken to Xbox” about them specifically. “They do allow breasts in some of their games, but the penises definitely won’t be there. ” The game is already facing a possible ban in Japan due to the depiction of uncensored genitalia, but they “haven’t heard anything” definitive yet from the region. Bylos played coy about the popularity of the game’s naked avatars, expressing surprise at “the attention, the viralness[sic]” of the game’s customizable full nudity. He claims that the developers thought that players “would just sort of see it and laugh and move on,” in clear defiance of all known laws of the Internet. To be fair, we don’t definitively know that any of them have used the Internet before. Will the team be forced to tuck, or will the offending members be removed entirely? For now, the fate of their collective virtual manhood rests firmly in Phil Spencer’s hands.

BCRP: ¡dinamita en el camino! por Herbert Mujica Rojas Socios | 3 de noviembre de 2016 BCRP: ¡dinamita en el camino! ¿A quién favorece el caballazo del Congreso con los tres directores nuevos en el Banco Central de Reserva? No es sólo la violación evidente de la ley orgánica de esa entidad sino –como lo demostró ayer Julio Alba Bravo- también la trasgresión de la propia ley del profesional economista cuando tiene vinculación con el Estado, datos que grafican la circunstancia sino que el Parlamento ha sido fautor de dinamita en el camino para quien debiera evitar esta naturaleza de fracturas: la señora Keiko Fujimori.
¿Qué clase de demostración fue la exhibida por la mayoría congresal del fujimorismo? Velocísima, expeditiva. No pareciera ser el mejor camino el de la provocación porque recuerda los años atroces de cuando el país navegaba en toneladas de robos, crímenes, inconductas y que terminaron con la administración de Alberto Fujimori en ruinas morales. Que algunos pretendan olvidar no es raro. Pero habemos quienes guardamos invicta la posibilidad de recordar esos aciagos hechos.
Han transcurrido apenas algo así como 100 días de la nueva administración y mientras que el gobierno del presidente Kuczinski también incurre en errores monumentales y hasta bobos, el Congreso no le va a la zaga. Pero ¿no debiera cautelar esa mayoría, la tercera candidatura presidencial de su aspirante Keiko Fujimori? Arriesgaría decir que con esas actitudes pioneras y tempranas, van a conseguir efecto contrario.
¿Son o no legítimas las protestas en las calles? La virulencia de calificaciones sobre las mismas y provenientes de reaccionarios huérfanos de ideas o frescura cuanto que honestidad, dan la razón a los muchachos y validan el voto con los pies.
El miedo a la juventud que expresará su desacuerdo con el caballazo congresal, al margen de si se enmienda el error en el BCRP o no, da cuenta del pavor cerval que sienten los grupos políticos anquilosados en viejas prácticas y vicios.
El relevo generacional fresco, pundonoroso, limpio, capaz de inventar sus propias respuestas sin necesidad de robar o estafar el bolsillo y la fe públicas, ha empezado a sonar sus campanas. Y esos decibeles serán la música que tanto anhela Perú.
Recordemos a Manuel González Prada:
“En esta obra de reconstitución y venganza no contemos con los hombres del pasado: los troncos añosos y carcomidos produjeron ya sus flores de aroma deletéreo y sus frutas de sabor amargo. ¡Que vengan árboles nuevos a dar flores nuevas y frutas nuevas!”

25592,Ashley Judd: Trump’s Election Victory Worse than Being Raped,"Actress and   activist Ashley Judd says the “tragedy” of Donald Trump’s election victory is far worse than an experience from her childhood in which she was raped. [“It remains for me the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my lifetime,” Judd said of Trump’s successful election. “Raped as a child  —   bad.   by a political system that ordains a clown  —   really bad. ”  The Divergent star made the claim in a Huffington Post video titled, “Ashley Judd describes being triggered by Trump. ” Sporting a   “Pussy Hat” popularized by feminist activists, Judd said the same male family member who failed to protect her from being sexually assaulted as a child betrayed her again by voting for Trump.  “And the fact that there were adult men in my family  —   who failed to protect me as a child  —   voted for him, was really   in saying, ‘You’re gonna put me out there again. And the idea that you would protect me has evaporated.’ And it was incredibly painful. Incredibly painful,” she said. “Immediately I began to weep, because it’s not ok. It’s not ok,” Judd added. “For me it’s not about the wall, it not about any of that stuff. It’s about, you voted for a pussy grabber. You voted for someone who calls his wife a piece of ass, whose daughter is his favorite sex symbol. It really boils down to me to the sexual assault and the misogyny piece. ” Last month, at the Women’s March in Washington, DC, Judd bashed Trump by suggesting that he has sexual fantasies about his daughter, Ivanka Trump.  “I am not as nasty as your own daughter being your favorite sex symbol, like your wet dreams infused with your own genes,” Judd said.

[French voters living in London is an important demographic in French elections, with an estimated 300, 000 citizens living in Britain’s capital.

London’s Evening Standard reports of the French citizens in London, 100, 000 are registered to vote. The tens of thousands expected to vote at the French embassy in Kensington today have been met by a high presence of armed British police officers, with the Metropolitan Police command perhaps wary of the high concentration people outside the embassy following the recent Westminster terror attack.

25600,Reuters Donald Trump’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star vandalized on video,"Reuters Donald Trump’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star vandalized on video 10/27/2016 
REUTERS 
Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was defaced by a vandal wielding a sledgehammer and a pick-axe on Wednesday in an act captured on video, police said. 
Los Angeles police expect to arrest someone for the vandalism, which left Trump’s name scratched out of the star, the emblem in the middle dislodged and chips missing. 
A video posted at Deadline.com, a Hollywood media industry website, showed a man wearing a hard-hat and reflective vest swinging a sledgehammer and pick-axe in the pre-dawn darkness. 
The area had been cordoned off with traffic barriers and cones, giving it the appearance of a legitimate work site. 
The Republican presidential nominee, real estate developer and reality TV star has faced several large protests during his campaign appearances in California, where polls show him far behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
The former host of the NBC show “The Apprentice,” Trump received his Walk of Fame star in 2007. A spokeswoman for Trump could not be reached for comment. 
Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado at the scene confirmed investigators have video capturing the vandalism attack and she said police expected to arrest whoever was responsible. 
Los Angeles-based City News Service reported a man identifying himself as James Lambert Otis said he damaged the installation “to make a point.” 
City News reported the man said he had family members who were victims of sexual assault and had intended to remove the star, which he was unable to do, and auction it off to benefit women who have alleged Trump groped them. Trump has denied the allegations. 
Otis could not be reached for comment on the report. 
Trump drew widespread condemnations from voters and a number of Republican elected officials after a 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. 
His star on the Walk of Fame was previously targeted. 
In the summer, a street artist erected a tiny wall around the star, complete with miniature American flags and barbed wire. The art piece, which was later removed, made light of Trump’s campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. 
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the hundreds of star plaques on sidewalks in the Los Angeles neighborhood. They are purchased for $30,000 each. 
Leron Gubler, president and CEO of the chamber, said in a statement the star would be covered for several days during repairs.",0

Как сообщает РИА Новости, ссылаясь на представителя городского УМВД, было установлено, что в полицию звонили братья — один учится в первом классе, второй в пятом. Ранее дети на учете не стояли, они из благополучной семьи. 
Сотрудникам полиции ученики пояснили, что просто хотели пошутить и о последствиях не догадывались. 
Мальчикам еще нет 14 лет, поэтому ответственность за поступок будут нести родители. Мать уже вызвана в полицию, на нее составлен административный протокол о ненадлежащем воспитании несовершеннолетних. Родителям грозит штраф, все документы передадут на рассмотрение в суд. 
Отметим, звонки от неизвестных о, якобы, заложенных бомбах в учебных заведениях, нередки. Проблема безопасности в российских школах поднималась много раз, но положение дел, по большей части, оказывается неизменным. Брешь в безопасности не позволяет утверждать стопроцентно, что в школе нет бомбы. 
Несколько лет назад, прямо перед Днем знаний, корреспонденты ""Правды.Ру"" испытали "" школьную безопасность "". Тогда мы пронесли в учебное заведение пустую коробку с надписью ""бомба"" и оставили ее неподалеку от классов. Нам не препятствовала ни охрана, ни педагоги. Причем, также легко и непринужденно мы забрали коробку обратно. 
Частными охранными организациями осуществляется контроль 20 тысяч школ по всей стране. И безопасность детей напрямую зависит от ЧОПа, который коллегиально выбрали родители и педагоги. Если где-то охранники являются настоящими профессионалами и не допустят никаких внештатных ситуаций, то в некоторых фирмах на пост в школе сажают человека, у которого от охранника — лишь надпись на груди. Естественно, что в первом случае услуги обходятся дороже, чем во втором, и выбор зачастую очевиден. 
Если разобраться, то компетентность школьного охранника прямо пропорциональна его стоимости. За небольшие деньги нельзя требовать от сотрудника уникальных способностей. Ведь по большому счету, один человек должен быть экспертом по комплексной безопасности зданий и сооружений, вахтером, личным телохранителем, обладать некоторыми навыками в психологии общения с детьми, быть не агрессивным и образованным. Что и говорить, список внушительный, чего не скажешь о зарплате. На деле школьный охранник, зачастую, вялый молодой человек, которому мало до чего есть дело, а желание отсидеть смену и сбежать ""из этого ада"" является приоритетным. 
Единственное место, которое контролируется такими секьюрити — входная дверь. Во время летних ремонтов в школу можно завезти хоть целый арсенал, а во время учебного года в некоторых школах под носом у охранника торгуют различными наркотическими веществами. 
Загвоздка в том, что, опять же, в тендере на охрану школ выигрывают те, кто просит за свои услуги самую низкую цену. И как бы не убеждали ЧОПы, где охрана действительно чего-то стоит, что их цена оправдана, выбор останавливают на самых недорогих.

As Donald Trump continues his campaign, it seems that a few keen eyes picked up on something rather peculiar. Taking place as Trump arrived in Ohio, something downright “insane” was spotted in the crowd – and many are saying it proves that Hillary Clinton is done for good. 
The incident actually took place back in September but is most recently proving true on a daily basis now. According to reports, Trump showed up in Columbus, Ohio earlier in his campaign, and when he opened his limo door, something incredible was waiting for him . Donald Trump draws massive crowd in Columbus, Ohio (Source: Liberty Writers News ) 
As Liberty Writers News puts it, “the crowd went insane for America’s 45 th president.” It goes without saying that there is a huge enthusiasm difference between the two candidates for president and their supporters. Although this was proven true back in September, it’s being demonstrated even more so today.

In fact, BizPac Review reports that Hillary’s running mate, Tim Kaine, can’t even muster up a crowd with triple digits – heck, even 50 people is hard to come by.

Of course, his staff is blaming it on “scheduling issues,” but it’s happened more than once at this point, proving a pattern here. Mike Pence, on the other hand, is having the exact opposite problem as the venues he’s speaking at don’t have room for the thousands of people who are showing up.

Between the FBI reopening her email investigation and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promising that his next leak will land her in prison , things aren’t looking good for Hillary. Put that in combination with the fact that Trump and Pence are bringing people in by the thousands, where Hillary and her running mate can’t seem to manage bringing in supporters by mere the hundreds – well, it’s safe to say that this goose is just about cooked. 
Hillary Clinton is done, and this nation is going to make that perfectly clear come Election Day. We the People are done with the politically corrupt government elites that have poisoned our country. I can’t wait to see the look on Hillary’s face when she realizes that she’s going to prison for a very long time, just like Trump promised.",0
25612,NASA Admits: Someone Took Control Over Space Probe Voyager 2 And Sent Data In An Unknown Language,"NASA have revealed that a curious incident in 2010 might be firm evidence that an alien species is attempting to create communication links with humanity.


In 2010, Voyager 2 became the first spacecraft powered by human beings to leave the known solar system. According to NASA expert Kevin Baines, at the time that the craft entered interstellar space, it became to send communications to the base on Earth in a language that was totally incomprehensible to the scientists who received it.


NASA spacecraft hijacked by aliens? 

Baines said that the team immediately assumed that the spacecraft was malfunctioning in some way and proceeded to run a full assessment of its systems. However, they could find nothing wrong with it except that one component in the binary code system had been changed from 0 to 1. After running further investigations, they were left with no alternate explanation except that someone or something had taken temporary control of the spacecraft . 

The minute change in the binary code suggested that someone or something deliberately tried to alter aspects of Voyager 2’s computer system. This suggested to the team on the ground that the spacecraft had been temporarily taken over by computer hackers. However, they didn’t think it was likely that the hackers were of terrestrial origin as they would not have been able to make contact with the spacecraft at such an enormous distance.

WATCH THE VIDEO: 
It took the experts at NASA three weeks to be able to reassert control over the spacecraft’s computer system and correct the era. Officially, NASA has conceded that they have absolutely no idea about who or what could have taken temporary control over Voyager 2 and sent the incomprehensible message to their team on the ground. However, German scientist Hartwig Hausdorff has not been so coy in revealing what he thinks was behind the incident – he is confident that the message was sent by an alien species.

25617,Fortune: $141M to Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer Despite SEC Investigation,"Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is set to receive nearly $141 million merger pay following Verizon’s purchase of the company, despite the SEC launching an investigation into whether Yahoo intentionally covered up a widespread hack and leak of its users data for nearly two years.  In December, it was revealed that over one billion Yahoo users had been affected by a hack, just months after a previous hack was announced and reportedly covered up by the company. In both incidents, users had their names, email addresses, dates of birth, security questions and answers, phone numbers, and hashed passwords stolen by hackers, including the details of over 150, 000 government employees. Yahoo was reportedly aware of the first large hack, which led to over 500 million account details being stolen, in 2014. However, they failed to announce the incident to the public until late 2016. “The SEC’s investigation looks into whether Yahoo disclosed information about the data breaches in timely enough fashion,” wrote USA Today on the subject. “SEC rules require companies to disclose data breaches and cyberattacks as soon as it is determined the incidents could have an effect on investors. ” “As part of its investigation, the SEC last month requested documents from Yahoo,” they continued. “The agency has been seeking a model case for cybersecurity rules it issued in 2011. ” Mayer’s reign as CEO of Yahoo has often been controversial, with the CEO facing a lawsuit last year that claimed she purposely purged male employees, and with several employees of Tumblr, the popular   platform owned by Yahoo, also claiming that Mayer and her management were responsible for the decline of the social network. In January 2016, Mayer also faced a backlash after making a joke to employees about the number of layoffs at the company. “No layoffs  …     this week!” joked Mayer, in response to questions raised by concerned employees. A New York Times report also claimed that Mayer had denied repeated requests for additional investment in Yahoo’s cybersecurity, with the security team allegedly derisively referred to as “paranoids” inside the company. Following both hacking incidents, and the revelation that Yahoo had been secretly scanning user emails for U. S. intelligence agencies, Verizon reportedly sought a significant discount on its purchase of the company, though the exact figure is currently unknown. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

That's quite an endorsement . And if there's anything top FBI officials now, it's crime families. Certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that Hillary can claim in any field. 
“The Clintons, that’s a crime family, basically,” former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said. “It’s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.” 
“Kallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a “pathological liar.” 
He also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton’s private server. 
“The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,” he said. “That’s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I’m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.” 
Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI’s leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau.

25628,"Trump: After Obamacare Explodes, We’ll Put Together ’a Great Healthcare Plan for the People’","President Trump addressed the failure of the Obamacare replacement bill for the first time on Twitter after Congress pulled the bill from the House floor. [Trump tweeted:  ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017,  “ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!” Trump wrote on Twitter. The House pulled the American Health Care Act from the House floor Friday after it became clear that the House was not able to secure enough votes for the bill’s passage. Trump told the media Friday afternoon that the bill’s failure would help Congress put together a better healthcare plan, but he also blamed the Democrats for opposing the bill. “Certainly for me it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it’ll be an experience that leads to an even better healthcare plan,” Trump said. “We were very close. It was a very tight margin. We had no Democrat support, no votes from the Democrats,” he added. Trump specifically singled out House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as the reason for the bill’s failure. “The losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because they own Obamacare. They 100% own it,” Trump said. “They have Obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. ” Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said Friday that the failure of the Obamacare replacement bill will make tax reform harder but not “impossible” after the White House sent a message that President Trump’s tax reform and infrastructure agenda will not be affected by the failed healthcare bill.",0
25629,Hundreds of Migrants Protest in Paris over Their Treatment by French Authorities,"Hundreds of Migrants Protest in Paris over Their Treatment by French Authorities Julian Robinson and Peter Allen, Daily Mail, November 3, 2016 
Migrants have staged a mass protest in Paris over their treatment by French authorities following the destruction of their makeshift camps. 
Hundreds of refugees sleeping rough in the French capital joined local activists to demonstrate close to their encampment near the Stalingrad Metro station. 
One man held up a sign saying ‘human, no beast’ as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march, which happened late last night. 
It came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs. 
The fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. 
It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. 
There had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. 
It followed thousands of migrants arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. 
While some 5,000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. 
Up to 3,000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. 
Shortly before Monday’s clearance French president Francois Hollande said: ‘We won’t tolerate the camps any longer.’ 
Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: ‘We are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.’ 
CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a ‘gradual operation’ which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone. 
Meanwhile, the first ever official centre for refugees in Paris is due to be opened by the city’s Socialist council later this week. 
The £6m facility is also close to the Eurostar hub, and will have beds for 400 men. 
But local residents and business owners say it will attract people smugglers, and other criminals. 
Jean Brossard, who has been living in the area for 30 years, said: ‘None of us asked for an immigrant centre on our doorsteps. 
‘Everybody in the area is complaining. If these men want to go to England, then send them to England.’ 
Others have accused the Socialists of tokenism, saying they are simply opening the camps as a humanitarian gesture that will have no long term effect on Europe’s immigrant crisis. 
The official centre, which will include a football pitch, will only allow residents to stay for between five and 10 weeks, and is likely to shut down within two years. 
Another centre for women with children will also open in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine later this year, or early next, but it too will only have a limited capacity of 350 temporary places. 
Meanwhile, French authorities have started transporting migrant children out of Calais to processing centres around France, amid tensions around the closure of the vast Jungle camp. 
Three buses carried a group of unaccompanied boys, mainly teenagers, out of the camp on Wednesday morning. 
French authorities transferred more than 5,000 adult migrants out of Calais last week, but the fate of its 1,500 unaccompanied children remained unclear. 
Migrants from the Middle East and Africa converged on the Jungle in hopes of crossing the English Channel to Britain. 
President Francois Hollande said this week that the children would be transferred within days to ‘dedicated centres’ where British officials can explore whether they have the right to UK asylum. 
Mr Hollande said the others would be put in the care of French child welfare services.",0
25630,Кто что хочет видеть — то и видит,"Кто что хочет видеть — то и видит 20 ноября 2016 Политика 
Российское посольство в Швейцарии направило в МИД страны ноту после сближения швейцарских истребителей с бортом специального летного отряда «Россия», который обслуживает первых лиц государства. На борту Ил-96 в этот момент находились журналисты кремлевского пула, которые направлялись на саммит АТЭС в Перу. 
Наконец-то россияне доподлинно узнали для каких целей российскому президенту не один Борт № 1 (тот самый, на котором перевозят его бесценное тело), а целых пять. Еще два заказаны и поступят в полное распоряжение Владимира Владимировича (кто-то сомневается, что его?) в 2018 году. А так как венценосный не может пока еще использовать несколько средств передвижения одновременно (или может?) он предоставляет их во временное пользование самым важным и нужным людям. 
А кто это у нас? Нет, воздушному флоту российских олигархов и высокопоставленных чиновников, позавидует любой арабский шейх. А вот своевременная доставка в нужные точки земного шара президентского пула журналистов – это задача государственной важности, стратегическая, так сказать. И то верно. Стоит только представить себе, какой коллапс случится в стране, если вдруг Владимир Соловьев в своей обязательной ежевечерней проповеди не сможет доверительно рассказать зрителям, как многозначительно перемигивался с ним или покашливал президент или, не дай бог, Дмитрию Киселеву придется готовить свои еженедельные эскапады на основе данных, опубликованных в зарубежных источниках. 
И неважно, что только на перевозку пассажиров президентского авиаотряда в 2014 было выделено из федерального бюджета, сформированного, в том числе из налогов граждан, даже не имеющих телевизора в доме, более 2-х миллиардов рублей. Главное, чтобы журналисты из президентского пула вовремя оказались на месте и с честью выполнили свой патриотический долг. 
Полетела было вся эта камарилья в Перу, чтобы своими глазами увидеть, как, может быть, Владимир Владимирович «случайно» встретится «на полях» форума «Азиатско-Тихоокеанского экономического сотрудничества» с «хромой уткой» Бараком Обамой. Но веселая поездка за океан не задалась. Сперва где-то в районе Швейцарии за ними увязался местный истребитель (и чего бы ему в небе своей страны делать?). Журналисты — люди тонкой нервной организации — повскакивали к окнам, стали готовиться к тому, что их собьют или захватят в заложники, силой принудят всю оставшуюся мучиться, живя в Швейцарии и страдая по Родине. Понятно, что МИД переполошилось, стало ноты с протестами разбрасывать. На святое, на народное достояние покусились проклятые швейцарцы. 
Потом, правда, швейцарским пилотам скучно стало, улетели они по своим швейцарским делам. А вот Борт № 1 перепугался не на шутку, да так сильно, что, приземлившись на дозаправку в Лиссабоне, вновь взмыть в небо не смог. Что-то там жизненно важное сломалось, и запчасти — опять же спец-бортом — будут доставлены в столицу Португалии. Из-за этого (вот где настоящий кошмар!) наш президент проведет полдня под прицелом только вражеских телекамер и будет отвечать только на каверзные вопросы, на которые у него нет подготовленных помощниками и советниками ответов. 
Так это всего лишь вполне миролюбивое Перу и исключительно экономический АТЭС. А представьте себе, что такой кошмар случится, если он отправится в самое логово – в США или некогда дружественную Германию! Тут-то без своих прикормленных журналистов впору самый главный Борт № 1 разворачивать и возвращаться домой. То-то конфуз случится.",0

A new study found that women have caught up with men as the heavy drinkers over the past 100 years. 
BMJ Open released their journal that came to the conclusion that women are drinking more alcohol than men and it is having health ramifications. The study, which looked at over 4 million people over a period of over a century, suggested that this is a result from “successful marketing campaigns” and sweeter alcoholic products being designed for younger women. 
“These results have implications for the framing and targeting of alcohol-use prevention and intervention programs. Alcohol use and alcohol-use disorders have historically been viewed as a male phenomenon. The present study calls this assumption into question and suggests that young women in particular should be the target of concerted efforts to reduce the impact of substance use and related harms,” the researchers stated in the news release.",0

LOCAL fucking hero Martin Dooley has thwarted the efforts of US police today by checking in to the Standing Rock Sioux Native American reservation, forcing them to restart a lengthy count on the number of people at the site. 
The champion of the people outwitted North Dakota police investigators by pretending he was at the location, when he actually wasn’t, and is just one of the many geniuses who did the same from the comfort of their home. 
“I was told this would stop police from doing something or other,” the full grown male explained, who even watched a 30 second video of the protest on the Guardian, “I’m not really sure of the in’s and out’s of what I’m supposed to be doing, but it looks great online for me and the rest of the protesters,” adding, “We’re like hackers or something”. 
More than 1.5 million people have so far “checked in” on Facebook to support protesters fighting against the new oil pipeline in Standing Rock. The protesters believe the local police department were using Facebook’s location feature to compile a list of activists who are protesting about the pipeline, and requested people to check in to ‘confuse’ investigators. 
“They really got us there,” admitted one police officer at the scene, who was busy macing faces, “We were on number 1,234,786 when some guy from Ireland checked in, forcing us to start again. Now we have no idea who’s protesting. We’ve been outsmarted, and outwitted. All we can do now is fire some rubber bullets and hope for the best. God, you people are so clever”. 
Meanwhile, a county Mayo man’s check-in to the Corrib gas pipeline has so far accumulated 28 fellow protesters.",0

We know that the FBI reopening its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails couldn’t have been good news for the presidential hopeful, but the fact that it took her a whopping 30 minutes to exit her plane after landing speaks volumes on the matter. However, it seems that Hillary made sure to do one dirty thing before walking down those stairs. 
Crooked Hillary is a cowardly schemer – and her recent actions go to prove just that. Mad World News reported Friday that after the news broke of FBI Director James Comey reopening their investigation, Hillary was seen rapidly exiting her plane and ignoring reporters before darting into her SUV.

However, recent reports indicate that her dodging the matter at hand began far before that point . In fact, Hillary’s staff made sure to disable the plane’s Wi-Fi after the news broke so that the reporters onboard wouldn’t learn of the matter until they got on the ground.

WASHINGTON D.C. – USA – America is dawning on a new era, a new volksgemeinschaft as proposed by its charismatic leader Donald Trump, a man with deep Germanic roots, and a vision that brings forth strength through Aryan supremacy. 


Already the troops and militia have been designated zones specific to their skills, and the plans to move forward in purging the swamp that is America today, will be conducted with great haste and urgency. 
Having pulled off a great feat through a general election, the Trump movement has followed a legitimate legal path to power, and have not utilised the violence of previous fascist movements to gain power. 
“We had to gain power through the legal American constitution, and once in power we will need to unite the American people under a singular cause. As much of a Pearl Harbor event, a 911, or Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, this event we are waiting for will be cataclysmic and a profound unitary force amongst the population,” a Trump adjutant, revealed on Thursday. 
Unity in the American people is key, as there are many elements within the populace who do not wish for Trump and his movement to be in power. There will be a purge of the system immediately after inauguration, and all negative elements will be flushed away back into the sewer. 
The Bolsheviks within American politics and society have been routed in the general election, however there are many elements still at hand, lest we forget the Marxist socialist swine Soros and his cohorts of troublemakers. This is why Trump is mobilising the Einsatzgruppen to counteract this threat and to neutralise it once and for all. 
As in every fascist movement, there always has to be a common enemy, and these are primarily Muslims, who are now the new Jews, and after many years of media incitement and hatred sanctioned by governments worldwide, as well as engineered atrocities in the name of that religion carried out by black operation sanctioned Jihadists, the Trump movement has a very explosive adversary. 
Illegal immigrants, are also to be designated as Untermenschen, and designated a common enemy to the American people. 
In accordance with the American constitution, the new president will adhere to the constitution by amending it for his needs. This change will be necessary for the survival of the American Aryan cause, and will be administered as a new improved constitution, a new American Reich for the next thousand years. Share on :",0

Did Putin just out the world’s political and financial elite as cold-blooded hybrid human reptilians? Did he really just go there?

Speaking at a behind closed doors forum for the highest echelons of government and staff in his home city of St. Petersburg, Putin responded to questions about the Panama Papers leak by pointing out who was behind the plot: the U.S. government, their spy agencies, and George Soros’s OCCRP.

Putin slammed his fist on the table and exclaimed, “George Soros, you sly dragon, this is war,” according to sources close to the President. Putin then vowed to ramp up sanctions against Soros’s Open Society even further.

When questioned by a top aide as to what he meant by “dragon” (an unusual word in Russian), Putin sighed heavily and fixed the assembled group with his trademark stare before explaining that all is not what it seems in regards to how the world is run.

Resisting gentle attempts by close aides to stop the President ‘going there,’ Putin said that the evidence was everywhere, and that he personally had intimate knowledge of their dealings. He said that he was not one of them, but they are afraid of him and have attempted to lure him into their “ancient Babylonian cult.” 

“The evidence, ancient and modern, is enormous,” he said. 

Putin said that mankind has been manipulated to become “unconscious” through the use of programming by media and politics, the perfect example of which was the recent Panama Papers leak.

China has warned Donald Trump that he will be defying the wishes of the entire planet if he acts on his vow to back away from the Paris climate agreement after he becomes US president next January.
The election of climate change skeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China.
“It is global society’s will that all want to co-operate to combat climate change,” a senior Beijing negotiator said in Morocco on Friday, at the first round of UN talks since the Paris deal was sealed last December. The Chinese negotiators added that “any movement by the new US government” would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy.
China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in France's capital.
By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obama's measures to combat climate change.

China is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing South-South partnership, particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change.
China is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change, a gesture that has received wide welcome.
Speaking to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, Moroccan Foreign Minister and Climate Change Conference (COP22) President Salaheddine Mezouar said that China has an “extremely important role to play in accompanying, reinforcing and boosting South-South partnership and support sustainable development policies in the African continent”.
Xie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to the ongoing 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22), said on Nov. 7 that China has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climate-resilient. ""We will help build up ten low-carbon pilot zones, launch 100 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and offer training programs for 1,000 climate-related professionals,"" he said.
What Xie called the ""10-100-1000"" project is part of the effort that China has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change. The country has earmarked a total of 580 million yuan (about US$85 million) since 2011 to help developing countries, according to Zhang Yucheng, deputy director of the International Cooperation Division of the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).

We expect when article 50 is triggered it will bring another level of discontent,” Barbara Drozdowicz, of the East European Resource Centre (EERC) told the Commons Home Affairs Committee. Ms. Drozdowicz fingered criticism of mass migration as a driver of ‘hate’ in response to a question by fierce Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna. The Labour MP pointed to “Leave. EU, UKIP obviously” when he asked the EERC director whether she believes the “Leave campaign” and   figures “bear a responsibility” for   attacks. “The campaign was built on controlling migration. ‘Controlling migration’ is not a neutral term,” she told MPs. When Conservative David Burrowes noted that most examples of ‘hate’ are expressed online, community leaders admitted they’ve neither seen nor had reports of content on the internet that’s abusive to migrants from Europe. Tadeusz Stenzel, the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, suggested there might be a language barrier which prevents European migrants from being able to understand abusive posts and report them. MPs heard that European migrants began reporting ‘hate crimes’ in around April of last year as the referendum campaign got into gear, but that only after Britons voted to leave the European Union (EU) was the resource centre inundated with an “explosion of calls”. Ms. Drozdowicz said migrants from Eastern Europe reported being told to “go home” and hearing ‘casual hate speech’ on public transport and that the centre heard about violent incidents including a Polish child being beaten up at school. Chairman of the committee, Yvette Cooper, said the details of incidents that were talked about in the session were “appalling”. “Hate crime is appalling,   and should have no place in our country,” she said. Heading the government’s inquiry into ‘hate crime’ in November, Ms. Cooper accused the campaigns of both Leave, during the EU referendum, and Donald Trump, in the U. S. presidential race, of having incited hatred.",0
25653,Democrats & Republicans Just Joined Forces To Condemn Comey’s Partisan Smears,"Comments 
I learned exclusively tonight that the Democratic Coalition Against Trump is being joined by University of Minnesota Law Professor Richard Painter in a non-partisan joint campaign to mount a public campaign against an expedite a response to their parallel complaints against FBI Director James Comey for his partisan witch-hunt of Hillary Clinton. 
Painter is a former Bush Administration White House Counsel who served as ethics counsel to the President. 
“Richard Painter and I connected this evening, and we are sending out the message clearly that the FBI Director’s behavior is a non-partisan issue, and we will be sending out a joint press release tomorrow morning accordingly,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Adivsor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. 
Both parties seek to prevent future political interference by America’s top federal law enforcement agency into partisan elections. 
“We plan to make joint television and other media appearances together with Professor Painter,” said Dworkin who plans to participate in the broadcasts, “or alongside other members of the DCAT.” 
Each independently made similar complaints to Department of Justice’s Office of Special Counsel’s ruling about the FBI Director’s recent memo . 
Because the memo has intruded on this year’s presidential election, DCAT and Painter are alleging that FBI Director Comey’s violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits pernicious partisan use of office by federal employees or officials. 
The FBI Director ignored Justice Department policy guidance which proscribes public investigatory actions within 60-days of an election. It’s a policy that has been respected across parties and administrations for decades to keep justice and elections un-entwined. 
Justice officials specifically advised Comey of the policy . 
He sent a mea culpa letter to other FBI agents just hours after the election-impacting memo. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed the first reported Hatch Act complaint against FBI Director Comey in the wake of his unusual memo Friday afternoon. 
Yesterday, Professor Richard Painter filed his own Hatch Act and ethics complaint against the FBI Director and an ethics complaint over the same memo, which is also drawing the ire of the career professionals at the top federal investigatory agency.",0

25658,Will The Real Donald Trump Please Stand Up?,"Saturday, 12 November 2016 Could Donald Trump really be part of an elaborate hoax for a US reality TV show? 
In early November 2016, Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, expressed more clearly than many other world leaders the hope that Donald Trump, when in office, would be very different from the Donald Trump she had witnessed on the presidential campaign trail. 
Comments attributed to Mr Trump while campaigning have led many to accuse him of being racist, sexist, and discriminatory towards people with disabilities - to name just three character traits that have met with liberal-minded disapproval. 
If Ms Sturgeon and others are to have their wish fulfilled, however, Mr Trump, after entering the White House on 20th January 2017, will need to consistently demonstrate liberal, tolerant, non-discriminatory opinions and behaviour. 
Suppose this did indeed occur. Imagine that the first act of the new president was to personally champion the cause of disabled, Mexican, Muslim women. Many would wonder what could possibly have led to such an apparent transformation. 
In such circumstances, the following might be rationales to consider - doubtless all would be proposed: 
1 - The CIA - or the shape-shifting, lizard-like aliens who control the world - had replaced Donald Trump with a liberal look-alike. 
2 - A divine messenger had shown up in the Oval Office, pointed out that Mr Trump was in his latter years and explained that God remained undecided about whether the president's final elevator journey should be up or down. 
3 - Donald Trump had been part of an elaborate hoax for a US reality TV show. The writers had constructed a character from a composite of least desirable presidential characteristics. Then, somehow, it had all got out of hand. 
4 - Donald Trump had been a really nice guy after all and had wished to be president to do good in the world. He had lied to get elected as he had correctly calculated that only a racist, sexist bigot could hope to win the hearts and minds of more than half the US population. Also, the Ku Klux Clan vote could have been a clincher.This scenario has an interesting corollary in that Mr Trump's alleged threats to go after his opponents after the election could transform into him targeting his own supporters. He might passionately castigate those who elected him, saying how disgusted he was by their behaviour and telling them that their appalling attitudes had no place in the modern world. 
5 - Donald Trump had always been the ideal president. He had been targeted with a misinformation campaign by a biased media - a media that had been supporting a political elite who had become out of touch with, and had ceased to care about, ordinary US citizens. 
6 - Donald Trump had really been as bigoted as the liberals had feared. He had discovered, however, that, as president, the pragmatics of balancing complex political factors, both at home and overseas, constrained his words and actions. He had been forced to concede that a president is not nearly as powerful as one might think.

25659,"Pelosi: Case Being Made ’In a Very Scientific, Methodical Way’ to Impeach Trump - Breitbart","Monday in Washington, D. C at the National Press Club during a news conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said while she has not seen a completed case for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, a “very scientific, methodical way” was being made.  Pelosi said, “The case is being made about the emoluments clause and you have to have evidence and the rest, but the case has not fully been made. The fact is that when I was speaker after we won in ’06  —   in ’07 people wanted me to impeach President Bush because of the war in Iraq. I never recovered with the left on this subject for not impeaching President Bush because of the war in Iraq. You don’t impeach somebody because you don’t like their policies. When they break the law, that’s when you have grounds for impeachment. And at the time of the war, I said, as a top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, ‘The intelligence does not support the threat,’ and so did Senator Bob Graham. ” “But the administration was making this strong case with the American people. And perhaps misrepresenting the American people could be a cause for impeachment,” she continued. “If so, there’s plenty of grounds right now with the current president, but it just isn’t the case. That doesn’t mean nobody is listening to cases that are being made in a very scientific, methodical way as to whether there are grounds for an impeachment. But the fact is that we’re trying to unite the country. Many of the President’s supporters are just not ready to accept the fact that their judgment might not have been so great in voting for him. And by the time the case is made, perhaps they’ll be ready to accept that. It’s very hard, impeachment. It’s very hard. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

25663,TRUTH DIED at the Hands of Katherine Frisk,"TRUTH DIED at the Hands of Katherine Frisk By Katherine Frisk on October 29, 2016 Or did the Truth die at the hands of Wikipedia’s Editors? 
As of the 26th Of October ( GMT) the editors of Gaven MacFadyen’s profile chose to add this addendum to his personal profile: 
Personal life 
He was born in Greeley, Colorado in 1940 as Gavin Hall Galter; he eventually took on the surname of his stepfather.[13] MacFadyen lived in the Pimlico district of London with his wife, Susan Benn. He died of lung cancer in London on October 22, 2016 at the age of 76.[5]….Truth died at the hands of Katherine Frisk.. 
Here is a screen shot: Screen Shot 26th October GMT 
On the 24th of October I read about Gavin MacFadyen’s death on RT which you can read HERE, and immediately went to Wikipedia to find out more details on his life. Under his personal life this is what I found: 
Personal life 
MacFadyen lived in the Pimlico district of London with his wife, Susan Benn. He died at the hands of Evan McMullin, a CIA operative, after MacFayden allegedly discovered information relating to numerous scrubbed black-ops missions linked to the assassination of multiple Third World heads of state. 
Here is a screen shot, which by the way, was not only witnessed by myself but many other people. I did not edit this or add or subtract anything from it. It was as you see it: Screen Shot 24th October (GMT) 
I then went in search of a person called Evan McMullin. I found a detailed biography on Esquire Magazine which you can read HERE. 
I then wrote up an article about it for Veterans Today which you can read HERE . 
To the editor’s of Wikipedia, a site that is considered by many to report the “facts” and to which millions go for background information on a daily basis, please note, in the article I asked the following questions: 
Was he involved in MacFadyen’s death and if so what proof does anybody have that he was? 
All it says is “He died at the hands of Evan McMullin.” Is Evan McMullin aware of this “fact” on Wikipedia and has he made any statements in this regard? 
Did Evan McMullin kill Gavin MacFadyen as claimed? Or is this a stunt? 
I would like to know which part exactly does Wikipedia think caused “ the Truth to die ” at my hands? 
On the morning of the 26th of October, I was alerted to the fact that Gavin MacFayden’s personal profile had changed again. 
This time it read: 
Personal life He was born in Greeley, Colorado in 1940 as Gavin Hall Galter; he eventually took on the surname of his stepfather. MacFadyen lived in the Pimlico district of London with his wife, Susan Benn. He died of lung cancer in London on October 22, 2016 at the age of 76. 
Here is a screen shot: Screen Shot 26th October 
On further examination I found another screen shot of more editing that had been done on Wikipedia on 24th of October. As you can see, it is typical of politics in the USA today where nobody misses a chance at mudslinging, disinformation, “poisoning the well,“and muddying the waters of all journalism : 
I would like to ask the editors of Wikipedia: By whose hand did the truth die? Mine or your own? 
Please read your own prospectus where it says: 
Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous or harmful 
And to “ lidcombe, australia with telstra “, although, no doubt, this is not who you really are, and who posted that “ ….Truth died at the hands of Katherine Frisk” I suggest that you remove it.

( ) concerning oil spills near its tar leases in California. The company is fighting back in the case  —   and, in the course of its defense, exposed the State of California’s destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence, a scandal that local media have dubbed “Targate. ”  Now, the EPA is faced with accusations of racism and homophobia, the   reports: The racist and homophobic statements came to light in depositions of Andrew deVegvar, former president of Greka  —   now known as HVI Cat Canyon Inc.  —   and Rob Wise, the Environmental Protection Agency’s   cleanup coordinator in a    civil action that could cost the company millions in fines. Some of the spills date back to 2005.

25665,Designers Lining Up to Dress Melania Trump for Inauguration,"A number of iconic fashion designers are reportedly chomping at the bit for the chance to dress future First Lady Melania Trump for Inauguration Day. [New York socialite and philanthropist and Trump family friend Jean Shafiroff, who sits on the Couture Council of The Museum at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology, took a poll to determine how interested designers were when asked their thoughts on dressing Mrs. Trump.  Shafiroff told the New York Post that Zac Posen, B. Michael America, Victor de Souza, and Zang Toi are among the designers who say they’d be willing to dress the First Lady  . “Any designer who dresses her will get enormous press,” Shafiroff told the outlet. The news comes after several   designers, including Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs, publicly declined to design clothing for Mrs. Trump. “‘I have no interest whatsoever in dressing Melania Trump,” Jacobs told WWD in November. Shortly after Trump’s victory in November, designer Sophie Theallet urged her colleagues in the fashion world not to design clothing for or associate with the new First Lady in any way. “The rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by her husband’s presidential campaign are incompatible with the shared values we live by. I encourage my fellow designers to do the same,” she said. Designer Stefano Gabbana,   of fashion house Dolce  Gabbana, has proudly posted photos on his Instagram of Mrs. Trump wearing his clothing. The photos caused a stir on social media, and Gabbana fired back at critics threatening to boycott his designs. “How many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram! !!” Gabbana wrote back in one of several comments taking aim at the negative posters. “Please if you don’t like my post unfollow me  …     thank you. ” Last month, designer Calvin Klein said “of course” he would dress Melania Trump. “She’s beautiful,” the designer told TMZ.

25672,"Inside the Invisible Government; War, Propaganda, Clinton & Trump","Inside the Invisible Government; War, Propaganda, Clinton & Trump Inside the Invisible Government; War, Propaganda, Clinton & Trump By 208 
The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. 
The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term “public relations” as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. 
In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade – behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” 
Bernays’ influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was “engineering the consent” of people in order to “control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it”. 
He described this as “the true ruling power in our society” and called it an “invisible government”. 
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. 
Imagine two cities. 
Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. 
But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters…",0
25673,Carrot Top To Give Nobel Awards At Drive Thru Window,"Friday, 4 November 2016 Nobel Prize recipients will be able to go to the drive thru window to get their awards. 
After accruing millions of dollars in debt, the Nobel prize committee will forgo a lavish award ceremony in favor of a webcast hosted by Carrot Top from a drive thru coffee kiosk. 
Nobel Committee head Jørgen Myklebust is putting his experience in marketing for Supermac's to the task with the new drive thru format for this years award ceremony. He explained the decision when he talked to reporter Rance Penning of the Daily Maul. 
""This will be the first year in a decade we don't lose money: the webcast costs us virtually nothing and Carrot Top has agreed to MC the award ceremony in exchange for a Nobel prize in chemistry. And having Carrot Top as the host is already giving us a boost with advertisers."" 
Myklebust further explained: 
""The nominees will be able to stream the webcast while in the parking lot at NK Stockholm, and the winners will drive up to the kiosk window to get their awards."" 
When Penning asked if the entire Nobel operation was moving to the kiosk, Myklebust dismissed the question as silly. 
""You know, it's not serious to ask if we are keeping our offices in the kiosk, of course our whole staff will not fit in a kiosk. For those who are curious, we'll continue to maintain our office space in a camping tent outside Tom Schuyler's house."" 
This reporter visited with Carrot Top to talk about the new gig. I had a few minutes with him in his Las Vegas dressing room as his assistants made him up for that nights show. 
""I can't wait to go to Sweden,"" said Scott Thompson (Carrot Top's real name). ""I can go incognito, you know, I don't stand out as a ginger there."" 
When asked about props for the webcast, the beloved orange one jumped up and grabbed some vials and a butane torch from a toy box. 
""Oh, yeah! Since my Nobel prize is in chemistry, I'm bringing my Meth Lab Jr.™ chemistry set, I should probably save that for the end of the show in case I blow anything up!"" 
""And for sure I'm bringing my tip jar!""

In his victory speech Tuesday evening, it was that “the only card she has is the women’s card. ” He said that “if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she would get 5 percent of the vote. ” In his telling, the women’s card confers an enormous advantage. Indeed, current    polls between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have her with 55 percent of the   vote, suggesting that he believes the women’s card is worth 50 points. That’s nearly enough to assure any female candidate of victory. Yet this appears to be inconsistent with available data. Over the past decade, women have been elected to 17. 5 percent of House seats, meaning that they’re outnumbered by men by roughly five to one. In fact, the women’s card appears to be particularly unhelpful in the United States. Women’s success in politics  —   at least as measured by the proportion of seats they hold in the House compared with equivalent lower chambers in other nations  —   ranks below that of nearly every other rich country. The United States is positioned between Greece and Bangladesh. Of course, Mr. Trump might object that he’s not talking about House seats, but rather the presidency. Even there, the women’s card appears quite unhelpful, as The Upshot’s extensive search through United States data failed to locate a single woman who had ever been president.",0

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is imploding, and it’s so bad that she was caught having a mini meltdown after her press conference as she tried to explain this new email investigation by the FBI, thanks to Anthony Weiner’s laptop. As Hillary lost it, her campaign was caught red-handed, doing dirty tricks to pictures, and you’ll love just how desperate they have become as they see this election sinking like the Titanic. 
Rumors are flying after Hillary Clinton responded to the latest bomb dropped on her campaign, that thousands of government emails are on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Everyone knows Hillary should have been indicted before, and she had a meltdown of sorts when Kristen Welker of Fox News asked, “Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton?” 
While Hillary was walking away from the short press conference after the Weiner email story broke, she stopped and threw her head back and let out a creepy maniacal laugh . Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin found it really weird, saying it was like Hillary had lost it. She described Hillary “stopping and throwing her head back and laughing, it was really odd.” ""Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton,"" a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh. 
— Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) October 28, 2016 
However, Hillary Clinton was not really laughing. That was a public meltdown, and she is pissed off that an idiot like Anthony Weiner just cost her this election. It’s so bad that the Clinton campaign was caught photoshopping the crowd at a recent Ohio rally, where Bill Clinton spoke. Bill Clinton rally Oct. 29th, red arrow shows a man (left) who was duplicated in photoshopped pic put out by Clinton campaign, indicated with red circles (right) 
Then, if all of that isn’t bad enough, the Chicago Tribune, one of the most liberal papers in the country, had this headline yesterday: “ Democrats Should Ask Hillary To Step Down ,” which was written by John Kass who was speaking from Hillary’s real home state of Illinois. 
“FBI director James Comey ‘s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious .” [via Chicago Tribune ] 
If we are agreeing with the Chicago Tribune, you know what happened on Friday with James Comey and the FBI is so devastating that this election is over for Hillary. However, that doesn’t mean we can let up and sigh with relief just yet. 
However, we can be extremely optimistic that, after eight years and two elections that caused utter destruction for our country, we have an extremely good chance that Americans will reject Hillary and her criminal cabal.

25686,Наблюдатели ОБСЕ выявили ряд нарушений при подготовке к выборам в США,"  
Как пишут Вести.ру, стало известно, что в голосовании не смогут принять участие 3,2 миллионов человек, находящихся под следствием или судимых, и 2,6 миллионов уже отбывших наказание. 
Об этом в своем заявлении сообщил директор Бюро по демократическим институтам и правам человека (БДИПЧ) ОБСЕ Михаэль Георг Линк. 
Со своей стороны, наблюдатель ОБСЕ за американскими выборами от Германии Юрген Клинке указала на несоответствие американских выборов международным нормам. 
В частности, из-за разницы часовых поясов результаты выборов в одних штатах будут объявлены тогда, когда голосование в других штатах еще не завершится. По словам Клинке, это является ""неоправданным влиянием на избирателей"". 
Следить за ходом выборов в США российские наблюдатели могут по линии БДИПЧ ОБСЕ , заявил пресс-секретарь Белого дома Джош Эрнест. Прочие запросы американские власти считают ""подозрительными"", учитывая ""действия России в киберпространстве"". 
Отвечая на просьбу прокомментировать сообщения о недопуске российских наблюдателей на выборы в некоторых штатах США, Эрнест сказал: ""Неясно, что именно в этом случае русские собирались делать. Понятно, что люди могут быть подозрительными относительно их мотивов. Или эти мотивы могут отличаться от тех, о которых объявлено публично, с учетом их активности в киберпространстве"". 
Как пояснил Эрнест, после получения таких запросов от иностранных государств Госдепартамент перенаправляет их властям того или иного штата, оставляя решение на их усмотрение. 
Ранее в ряде СМИ появились сообщения о том, что Россия направила запрос официальным властям США с просьбой разрешить наблюдателям из РФ присутствовать на выборах в Луизиане, Оклахоме и Техасе, однако получила отказ. 
""Есть также процесс, организованный по линии ОБСЕ, которая наблюдает за американскими выборами. В прошлом мы успешно сотрудничали с ними. У России была возможность отправить лиц для наблюдения за выборами в США в качестве членов делегации ОБСЕ. Россия отказалась участвовать в таком формате"", - сказал Эрнест.

25687,Mark Cuban Wants Constitution Changed to Make Health Care a ’Right’ - Breitbart,"Ever ready to spout off about things political, Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire Mark Cuban now wants to shore up Obamacare, pushing the idea that the U. S. Constitution should be changed to proclaim health care as an American “right. ”[Speaking to reporter Nicholas Ballasy of PJ Media, Cuban tried to explain his desire to implement nationalized, single payer health care. While on one hand Cuban doesn’t agree with   hospitals, on the other he thinks people should have a “right” to health care.  “I think health care should be a right. If there’s a legitimate way to modify the Constitution, I literally think there should be an amendment to the Constitution for healthcare for chronic illnesses and serious injury. We all play the genetic lottery,” Cuban said according to Ballasy. “I think all of the talk about Trumpcare vs. Obamacare really just avoids the ultimate question, which is, is health care a right or not?” Cuban added. “But I’ve had friends who have had cancer, we’ve all had people who have had severe illnesses and if they didn’t have insurance. In a couple cases, I’ve since paid for them because they didn’t have insurance or enough insurance. I think that’s wrong  —   that’s a cost we all should share. ” Unfortunately for Cuban, the idea of turning healthcare into a “right” works against the whole concept of rights. In the American system, a right is the inviolable ability to act without the permission of other people. In addition, one may exercise his rights as long as the rights of another person are not violated in the doing. A right is something available equally to all citizens, something that can’t be taken away by government. But it is also something that isn’t granted by government. In the American tradition, a right is something given to individuals by God, not government. And, since a right is something that does not require action by others to be fulfilled, therein lies the rub when it comes to health care. If health care became a right, it would require the labor of doctors, nurses, and other care providers. Therefore, we would essentially turn healthcare providers into slaves of the state, forcing them to care for people despite their personal desires and feelings on the matter. After all, if it is our right to get health care, how can any doctor refuse us? Therefore, health care simply cannot be a right. Your right of free speech does require me to do anything for you to exercise it. Your right to life only requires that others don’t try and kill you. Your freedom of religion only demands that everyone else just leave you alone. But, if healthcare became a right, your “right” would force others to make sure you stay healthy. Compelling others to do something violates the very idea of a right. Indeed, as a nation we had this discussion way back in the 1940s when President Franklin Roosevelt tried to pass his “Second Bill of Rights” to make education, housing, health care, and other things a new American right. Even in 1944 people realized that forcing health care workers to take care of people despite their personal desires would be a form of servitude to the state.

In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war.
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters, thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks.
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia’s border.
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia’s borders as part of a huge military deployment.
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia’s borders since the Cold War.
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time.
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war.",0
25689,Splash! Jerry Brown Says California’s Drought Is Over - Breitbart,"California Gov. Jerry Brown declared Friday that the drought in his state is officially over, with a formal declaration to an end of the drought state of emergency in most counties. [In a statement released by his office, Brown said:  Following unprecedented water conservation and plentiful winter rain and snow, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today ended the drought state of emergency in most of California, while maintaining water reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices, such as watering during or right after rainfall. “This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,” said Governor Brown. “Conservation must remain a way of life. ” Executive Order    lifts the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies. Today’s order also rescinds two emergency proclamations from January and April 2014 and four drought —  related executive orders issued in 2014 and 2015. The governor’s proclamation comes after one of the wettest and snowiest winters in the state’s recorded history. Initially, after last winter’s El Niño brought moderate rains to Northern California, the state was expected to suffer through a dry winter, thanks to the La Niña effect. But one “Pineapple Express” storm after another blew in off the Pacific, bringing atmospheric rivers to drench Northern and Southern California alike and coat mountains in snow. Earlier this week, the Sacramento Bee reported that Californians are still conserving water, in spite of the heavy precipitation. State water authorities likely hope that the habits formed during the drought will be retained  —   though some local agricultural water authorities are currently pumping water to farmers as fast as they can to keep dams from overflowing.

25695,Trump: Hillary Clinton may be 'most corrupt person ever' to run for president,"Email 
Donald Trump’s campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through “pay-to-play politics.”The TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her family’s foundation, stating that “staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America” and that “Hillary cut deals for donors.” 
Clinton’s charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation’s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton “sold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.”“Hillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,” its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband’s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.“It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,” he tweeted on Tuesday.",0
25696,False Reports of Gunfire at LAX Airport Prompt Panic and Evacuations - The New York Times,"Unconfirmed reports of gunfire at Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday caused panic in the airport and on social media as passengers fled outside and the police raced to respond. About an hour after the first panicked reports appeared on social media, Andy Neiman, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, wrote on Twitter that the reports had been caused by “loud noises only. ” Terminals 1, 2, 3 and 5, as well as the Tom Bradley International Terminal, were evacuated by the police, the airport said. There was a “self evacuation” from Terminal 4, said Rob Pedregon, a spokesman for the airport police, who referred to those who fled as “panicked passengers. ” The airport said in a statement that it had closed several levels of its central terminal area, though it had not confirmed the reports of shooting. The episode was remarkably similar to one that occurred two weeks earlier, when unconfirmed reports of gunfire at Kennedy International Airport in New York led the police to evacuate two terminals there, causing hysteria among passengers whose fears were exacerbated by unconfirmed reports spread on social media. Video from the airport posted to social media from Los Angeles on Sunday showed travelers running outside the airport as police cruisers rushed by in the opposite direction. The interior of the terminal appeared to have been abandoned by civilians as the police searched for any sign of a shooter. Just as at Kennedy, the fear felt by travelers in Los Angeles was a reminder of recent attacks at airports in Istanbul and Brussels, and the way those episodes can prompt a panic response to the threat of violence in public spaces. Responding to the episode at Kennedy, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York asked last week that the Department of Homeland Security conduct a formal investigation. “In the age of     terror attacks, it is a national priority to make sure targets, like our airports, are best prepared to recognize, diffuse and professionally handle the very real threats that confront us,” he said.",0
25697,Comment on WikiLeaks Shocker: Clinton Camp Considering Paul Ryan Relative as Supreme Court Nominee by Richard Johnson,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by Paul Joseph Watson Another reason as to why Ryan tried to sabotage Trump’s campaign? Hillary Clinton’s campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryan’s relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the House’s dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Hillary’s foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent – that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair),” reads the email. “Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.” Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominee’s campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan – who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment – has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?",0
25698,"Lindsey Graham: Trump Needs to ’Back Off’ Russian Investigation, Stop Tweeting - Breitbart","On Sunday’s broadcast of NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) said President Donald Trump should “back off” and stop tweeting or comment about the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.  Partial transcript as follows: GRAHAM: Well, I think we need to have Comey come before the Judiciary Committee and clear the air. Did the president ever say anything to the director of the FBI that would be construed as trying to impede the investigation? The president called me about the firing and he referenced the Comey testimony last week and the judiciary committee about how bad it was. So, that’s all I know. But I think it’s time to call the FBI director before the country at large and explain what happened at that dinner. If there are any tapes, they have to be turned over. You can’t be cute about tapes. If there are tapes of this conversation, they need to be turned over. I doubt if there are. But we have to clear the air there also. TODD: Let me put up that tweet where the president put the word tapes in quotes. so, we don’t know quite what that means. but did  —   did you think that constituted a threat to Comey? GRAHAM: I think it was inappropriate. I think it requires somebody like me, a Republican, to call Comey before the Judiciary Committee to let him explain that conversation. Right now, I do not believe President Trump is a target or subject of any investigation regarding collusion with the Russians. That’s what I believe. But this tweet has to be answered. I would advise the president not to tweet or comment about the investigation, as we go forward. The russians did interfere in our election. I don’t think they changed the outcome. I have no evidence of collusion. But the president needs to back off and let the investigation go forward. (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

Auch die Facebook-Seiten der Fake-News-Seiten Bild ( https://www.facebook.com/biId/ ) und Focus ( https://www.facebook.com/focus-onIine/ ) wurden gelöscht und sind nicht mehr erreichbar. ""Desinformation ist kein Kavaliersdelikt"", so Facebook-Boss Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zwei der schlimmsten Sünder haben wir aus dem Verkehr gezogen. Weitere werden folgen.""

November 2016 Schlagstöcke und Pyrotechnik sichergestellt: Polizei löst unerlaubte Kinderdemo auf Köln (Archiv) - Dem beherzten Eingreifen einer Hundertschaft der Kölner Polizei ist es zu verdanken, dass am Freitag eine nicht angemeldete Demonstration in Köln-Bickendorf innerhalb weniger Minuten aufgelöst werden konnte. Bei den Beteiligten wurden Dutzende Schlagstöcke sowie Pyrotechnik in großem Umfang sichergestellt. Nach Angaben der Polizei nahmen rund 50 Minderjährige im Alter zwischen drei und sechs Jahren an der Kundgebung teil. Augenzeugen berichten, dass die Beteiligten lautstark Sprüche wie ""Sankt Martin, Sankt Martin"" und ""Rabimmel, rabammel, rabumm, bumm bumm!"" skandierten und dabei Schlagstöcke vor sich hertrugen, an denen Brandsätze befestigt waren. Wasserwerfer gegen Pyrotechnik: Kölner Polizei beim Einsatz Ob es sich bei den Demonstranten, die sich als Besucher der Kindertagesstätte ""Blaue Zwerge"" ausgaben, um Mitglieder eines extremistischen Bündnisses handelt, wird derzeit noch geprüft. Die 43-jährige Leiterin der Gruppe wurde festgenommen und sitzt derzeit noch in Untersuchungshaft. Ein weiterer Mann auf einem Pferd, der die Demonstration anzuführen schien, konnte sich in vollem Galopp dem Zugriff durch die Beamten entziehen. Wie die Polizei mitteilte, werden zudem mehrere Dutzend von den Demonstranten mitgeführte Kekse auf Drogen untersucht; das Ergebnis steht noch aus. Da mehrere Beamte von widerspenstigen Kindern gekratzt und laut Polizeibericht teilweise fies ans Schienbein getreten wurden, ergingen insgesamt 32 Strafanzeigen wegen gefährlicher Körperverletzung und Widerstandes gegen Vollstreckungsbeamte. 17 Polizisten wurden krankgeschrieben. ssi, dan; Foto rechts: Marek Peters / www.marek-peters.com , GNU 1.2 ; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 11.11.14 Artikel teilen:",0
25702,If You Have One Of These Old VHS Tapes It May Be Worth Over $1000,"posted by Eddie Got VHS tapes collecting dust on a shelf somewhere? Maybe you already reclaimed the space and they’re sitting in an attic long-forgotten. Hopefully you didn’t throw them out, though, as it turns out there might be quite the market for some old tapes. Modern directorial practice for movie releases and re-releases tends to include adding or editing the film from the theatrical version. While some people don’t mind or even enjoy these changes, for others, the original cut is worth a hefty price tag. This translates to listings on eBay for certain tapes at astronomical prices, like one particular Beauty and the Beast tape going for $9,999. The original Beauty and the Beast did not include the song “Human Again”; it was cut for space reasons, then re-added to the 2002 special edition. However, Disney tapes in particular might be valuable to collectors for other reasons. Reddit user Reddit_Executive speculates that, because of the specific branding on original releases, these movies could go for quite a bit: “On the spines of some VHS (and BetaMax) tapes is a black diamond with Walt’s signature on it. This was Disney’s first attempt to market their videos to homes. Because of this, certain Disney collectors are convinced that these VHS tapes are worth something.” While it’s possible some tapes are indeed worth quite a bit, many of the movies listed are actually selling for much less. Still, if your plan for your old VHS tapes begins and ends with “trash them,” there’s no harm in doing your research on what they might be worth.

25703,Why Clam-Chowder Pizza Is the Best Kind - The New York Times,"Some winter nights when my heart is tight, I take the F train from work to stand on the sidewalk in front of the   window at Lucali, the famed, candlelit pizzeria on Henry Street in Brooklyn, and watch Mark Iacono make pizza. His movements are slow, deliberative. They resemble a jungle cat, grooming. The dough moves back and forth in his hands, slowly growing in circumference. Iacono barely looks at it. He looks at the people in the dining room, though his gaze is   unfocused. His   is a meditation.   should be a meditation. I go home and make pizza. On other suffering evenings, I walk down the echoing corridors and ramps of Grand Central Terminal and make my way to a stool in the Oyster Bar for a pan roast. I like the cherrystone version better than the oyster one and, especially, the rich interplay of the clam juice and the cream, the way it soaks into the toast points floating in the center of the bowl. I do not make pan roasts at home. Pan roasts should be made only in the steam kettles of the Grand Central Oyster Bar. But I do make clam chowder, and I float toast points on top of it, and that is what John Cheever called a triumph over chaos, every time. Lately I’ve been doing both, at once:   pizza, a balm against the pain of the world. It was probably Frank Pepe who invented the clam pizza, in New Haven, scattering freshly shucked littlenecks onto a round of dough, then pecorino cheese, garlic, oregano, black pepper and a torrent of olive oil. That was in the 1940s, according to his family, which still operates Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana on Wooster Street there. Clam pizza moved south in the decades that followed, to New York City. Lombardi’s put one on the menu. Franny’s made one, makes it still. Otto. Motorino. Moto. Most recently, Pasquale Jones. Some are built on the Frank Pepe model. Franny’s omits cheese altogether. Moto adds potatoes. Motorino’s is dressed with fior di latte mozzarella in addition to the clams. They are all the best pizza. Clams are on them. Quibble all you like, but a clam pizza is the very best pizza in the world. My recipe honors no one particular preparation of the pie. It honors all of them, and the teachings of Iacono and the Oyster Bar as well. It uses as sauce the building blocks of a classic clam chowder  —   alliums slowly fried with bacon, then infused with clam juice and wine, reduced to a glaze and thickened with cream  —   and tops it with chopped clams, lemon zest and a spray of hot pepper flakes. I spread these elixirs across homemade pizza dough, a recipe I learned from another pizza guru, Anthony Falco, until recently the pizza czar at Roberta’s in Bushwick. But you could use them on   dough and still have a good pizza. Or on slices of sourdough bread, or an old running shoe. Just work slowly as you make it, being present in the moment of creation. Cooking is a practice, a kind of devotion, a form of mindfulness. Practice. Recipe:   Pizza",0
25704,Obama Says Colin Kaepernick Is ‘Exercising His Constitutional Right’ - The New York Times,"President Obama said Monday that Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, was “exercising his constitutional right” by refusing to stand during the national anthem, a decision that has fostered considerable controversy since he first took the action on Aug. 26. While noting the significance of the flag and the national anthem, the president said there was a long history of sports figures making political statements. “I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about,” President Obama said during a news conference in China. “And if nothing else, what he’s done is he’s generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about. ” It was the first time that the president had weighed in on Kaepernick’s actions, which many have criticized as being disrespectful to the United States. Kaepernick, who is biracial and was adopted by white parents, first caused an uproar late last month when he remained seated before a 49ers preseason game with the Green Bay Packers. He said afterward that he would not “stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. ” Last Thursday, before the team’s final preseason game, in San Diego, Kaepernick chose to kneel during the anthem. He later said he intended to continue his protest into the regular N. F. L. season. The 49ers play their first   game next Monday. “Once again, I’m not ” Kaepernick said Thursday. “I love America. I love people. That’s why I’m doing this. I want to help make America better. I think having these conversations helps everybody have a better understanding of where everybody is coming from. ” Not long ago, Kaepernick was one of the game’s top players, leading the 49ers to the Super Bowl in the 2012 season and to the N. F. C. championship game the next year. But he was benched halfway through last season and will start the 2016 season as the backup to Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick was frequently booed during the team’s final preseason game, and the police union in Santa Clara, Calif. has threatened to stop working 49ers home games this season because of Kaepernick’s actions. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is among those who have denounced him. Nevertheless, his stance has also led to numerous expressions of support, with backers arguing that his protest is a worthy statement on the troubled status of race relations in the United States. And even though he is a backup quarterback, his jersey is now the   seller at the N. F. L. ’s official online store. Seattle defensive back Jeremy Lane said he would continue to sit for the national anthem when the Seahawks’ regular season begins Sunday at home, The Associated Press reported. After Lane sat during the anthem in the Seahawks’ preseason game last Thursday, he said, Kaepernick reached out to thank him for his support and his gesture. Megan Rapinoe, one of America’s most prominent soccer players, knelt during a National Women’s Soccer League match on Sunday in support of Kaepernick. She told espnW that she was disgusted by how Kaepernick has been treated, and would continue to kneel throughout the season. “Quite honestly, being gay, I have stood with my hand over my heart during the national anthem and felt like I haven’t had my liberties protected, so I can absolutely sympathize with that feeling,” she said. Tim Kaine, the Democratic   nominee, told ABC News that Kaepernick’s rationale “didn’t really make that much sense to me,” but supported his right to protest. “You’ve got to respect people’s ability to act according to their conscience, so I wouldn’t presume to tell him what to do,” he said.",0

In four days, the unprecedented political chaos that is the 2016 presidential election will ( hopefully ) come to a close. Looking back on the past year, we see innumerable instances of political turmoil that may shape Tuesday’s outcome. 
Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has faced his share of obstacles. Most notably, a leaked tape from Access Hollywood almost derailed his campaign in October. Hillary Clinton’s campaign, meanwhile, has been marred by the FBI’s investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state—a topic that has yet again become a focus of national attention because of FBI Director James Comey’s timing . 
Outside the two main-party candidates’ own woes, other crucial issues have absorbed the nation throughout the election season: The battle over the Dakota Access pipeline . The changing role of third-party candidates . A renewed focus on racial inequality . And of course, the trove of information given to us by WikiLeaks.

25712,BIGGEST ELECTION FRAUD IN HISTORY DISCOVERED IN THE UNITED STATES: BREAKING NOW,"Home › POLITICS › BIGGEST ELECTION FRAUD IN HISTORY DISCOVERED IN THE UNITED STATES: BREAKING NOW BIGGEST ELECTION FRAUD IN HISTORY DISCOVERED IN THE UNITED STATES: BREAKING NOW 1 SHARES 
[10/31/16] INFOWARS – Bev Harris, the country’s leading vote fraud expert, joined the Alex Jones Show Monday to reveal the results of a bombshell investigation into “vote shaving” software. 
Used in precincts all across the country, the software – deemed “the most devastating election theft mechanism yet found” – allows votes to be fractured and rounded up or down to sway the results for any candidate. 
According to Harris, a member of the non-partisan Black Box Voting investigative team, this latest discovery constitutes the “missing piece” that blows the lid off of wide-scale voter fraud. 
“It was put in the system in 2001 but it came into wide use in 2006,” Harris said. “It took someone with a special set of skills to know what to look for.” 
A mini-documentary by Black Box Voting on the discovery shows real-time demonstrations with the secretive software. 
“It can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses,” the video’s description states. “All political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors.” 
“It runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing.” 
Further analysis on the malicious software provided by Alex Jones reveals how this revelation ties into the 2016 presidential election.

25715,Top doctors: Chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to 'give no benefit',"Top doctors: Chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to 'give no benefit' 
Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Vicki Batts Tags: cancer , chemotherapy , ineffective medicine (NaturalNews) Chemotherapy is arguably one of the medical industry's biggest frauds . Perhaps that's why it recently landed on a list of ineffectual treatments drawn up by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC).The list was created by 11 top specialists, who were each asked to think of five treatments they felt provided little to no patient benefits. And surprise, surprise – chemotherapy was one of them. Doctors from the AMRC said that chemotherapy cannot cure terminal cancer, and may bring unneeded distress in the final months of life. The Guardian reported:""The treatment is 'by its very nature toxic', the college said. ""Therefore, the combination of failing to achieve a response and causing toxicity can 'do more harm than good.'""Do more harm than good? You don't say.Research has shown that in some hospitals, up to 50 percent of cancer patients are dying, not from their disease, but from chemotherapy drugs. For the first time ever, researchers actually looked at the numbers of patients who were dying within 30 days of chemotherapy administration , which could indicate that the treatment was the cause of death rather than the cancer. What they found was horrifying.The study, which was conducted by Public Health England and Cancer Research UK, found that the average 30-day mortality rate across England was about 8.4 percent for lung cancer and 2.5 percent for breast cancer. But, in some hospitals, those numbers were much higher. For example, at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals, the 30 day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was 28 percent. In Milton Keynes, the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to 50.9 percent.The research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several areas, including Blackpool, Coventry, Derby, South Tyneside, Surrey and Sussex.The data also revealed that about 1-in-5 people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at Cambridge University Hospitals died because of chemotherapy treatment.Of course, the industry was quick to defend their practices, with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data problems, noting that even a few deaths could skew statistics.However, no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin. It doesn't discriminate; it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells – and therein lies the rub. It may kill the cancer, but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the future.A 2004 study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survivors' 5-year survival rates. The research, which was led by scientists from the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Northern Sydney Cancer Centre of the Royal North Shore Hospital, located in Sydney, Australia, raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and adjuvant chemotherapies.What they found was that in Australia chemo only contributed 2.3 percent to the 5-year survival rate in adults, and in the U.S., that number dropped to 2.1 percent. These findings suggest that overall, chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patient's survival. In their conclusion, the study authors wrote, ""As the 5-year relative survival rate for cancer in Australia is now over 60%, it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival. To justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a rigorous evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required.""The AMRC urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary. After all, unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine . Sources:",0
25716,Friday Mailbag: News Cycles That Won’t Stop Spinning - The New York Times,"Marches have been the theme of the past couple weekends. There was the women’s march in Washington and around the world two weekends ago. And last weekend there was the March for Life, an annual protest against abortion. The Times called the people who marched in the latter march, “  marchers” in two headlines, to the ire of several readers. On the home page, the link to the briefing of the story read: “Pence Addresses March for Abortion Foes. ” We went to Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, for his reply. Last weekend there were also protests in response to President Trump’s executive order to ban refugees. The headline for The Times’s first story initially read: “Trump Bars Syrian Refugees Indefinitely to Keep Terrorists Out. ” It was then changed, 30 minutes later, to: “Trump Bars Refugees and Citizens of 7 Muslim Countries. ” We asked Peter Blair, a copy desk supervisor, for a reply. The public editor’s take: A clear, straightforward reply from the copy desk. (More on how the machinery of editing works in my Sunday column.) In describing Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s remarkable new role on the National Security Council, The Times used a word that a reader felt was gratuitous. We went back to Corbett on this point. The public editor’s take: I think the standards editor describes well the challenges of finding the right phrases and avoiding the wrong ones. And I think for the most part editors and reporters work hard to do that. In the case of “hatch,” though, I think it does carry a negative tone, not just of secrecy but something rather sinister too.  Last October, the public editor’s column addressed The Times’s purchase of a website called The Wirecutter and its sister site The Sweethome, which are in the business of recommending products to customers and making money when customers purchase those products through “affiliate links” like, say, Amazon. com. Through its purchase of these websites, The Times hopes to tap a new source of revenue as print advertising rapidly declines. The column argued that this model could be of value to The Times, but urged the paper to proceed carefully. “I hope The Times will move cautiously, not merely assuming readers will view this as a useful new service but actually asking them whether they do,” it said. “The Times has a lot to gain. And also to lose. ” This week, our office received our first email as the new arrangement began to make itself seen on The Times’s site. We asked Sam Sifton, the food editor, for his response. The public editor’s take: Hopefully, Sifton’s answer helps explain the arrangement to readers and answers concerns about potential conflicts. My earlier post gives my thoughts, but as this is more fully implemented, I will be watching closely, and I welcome comments from readers. Since November, several dozen readers have asked us if there is any way they could contribute extra money to The New York Times, in addition to purchasing a subscription. Friday The Times announced a new program for doing just this: Subscribers, and others who are interested, can now sponsor subscriptions for students in public schools. Those interested can find more information here. Finally, some readers, understandably, are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of news the past few weeks. The Times’s Christopher Mele tried to tackle this growing issue in a story this week. “If all else fails, and you still feel bouts of news fatigue,” he concluded, “you can turn to Twitter for photos of cute animals. ” That’s what we’re doing.",0

Former US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced Republican nominee Donald Trump as a “political coward” over a voter suppression report. 
Sanders condemned Trump after a report that the Republican’s presidential campaign has three “voter suppression” drives intended to lower turnout for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to help Trump winning the White House. 
“Anybody who is suppressing the vote because they know that those people will vote against them is a political coward,” the Vermont senator tweeted. 
“If you don’t have the guts to run for office on your ideas @ realDonaldTrump , then you shouldn’t run for office at all,” he said in another tweet. 
A senior adviser to Trump acknowledged in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that the Republican team has “three major voter suppression operations underway.”

25718,“Well It Was Nice While It Lasted” – Democracy,"0 Add Comment 
THE AGE old system of government, Democracy, has formally announced its retirement stating ‘well, it was nice while it lasted’. 
“I now pass the baton into the incapable and tiny hands of a man who embraces xenophobia, misogyny and the hatred of all things he is simply too impatient and ignorant to bother understanding,” the clearly tired and battle weary ideology confirmed. 
While many around the world had presumed Democracy would continue in its current position as the dominant political ideology in the West despite a change in management, it is thought its growing unpopularity amongst sections of the US electorate has seen it make the decision to vacate its profession entirely. 
“You have to know when it is time to hang up your hat, and you guys seem quite fond of the man who doesn’t pay income tax and insults war veterans and war veterans’ families,” the descendent of Cleisthenes stated. 
Many political experts have speculated that democracy has retired preemptively as it believes president elect Donald Trump will seek to have it deported, owing to the fact that Democracy emigrated from mainland Europe via Greece some years ago. 
Democracy has a number of international franchises which may be wound down in the coming years too. 
“I think a lot of people are really, really angry with me, so the time to step aside has come. When people question your ability and purpose, you begin to make for the exit sign,” Democracy confirmed. 
Despite stating its intention to leave, Democracy is required to give at least 6-months notice, have a hand in training in its successor, All Out Chaos, and going through an awkward exit interview which will see it field questions from over 57 million people who didn’t vote for this.",0
25721,‘I Buried My Own Children’: A Syrian Father’s Grief - The New York Times,"Aya and Ahmad,    twins, were among the 86 people killed in Tuesday’s gas attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria. Their father, Abdul Hameed   asked a photographer to take pictures as he held their bodies. He turned the babies’ faces toward the camera and said, “tell them, ‘goodbye dad. ’” In an interview with a local activist, Mr.   described the start of the airstrikes at 7 a. m. “I took my wife and children and left the house,” he said, through choking sobs. “As we were leaving, just about five minutes later, we started to smell nasty smells. ” He said his children began to cough and he handed them to their mother and told her to flee the town. He went to check on his brothers and their children. They were struggling to breathe. He saw people fall in the street and begin foaming at the mouth before losing consciousness himself. Later, he found out his wife and babies had died. And he buried them. He walked through the graves, calling out the names of other family members who were also killed and buried in the graveyard, pausing at each, and sobbing. After the burial, “I saw Ahmad and Aya, and carried them close to my heart,” Mr.   said in the interview. “We buried them, I took Ahmad and Aya and buried them. I buried my own children. ” He said he had lost at least 25 members of his extended family in the attack.",0
25723,‘Tone Down Your Gayness’: St. Louis Police Officer Files Discrimination Suit - The New York Times,"An   police sergeant in Missouri has filed a discrimination lawsuit against his employer, alleging that he was told he would not be promoted unless he toned down his “gayness. ” The sergeant in the St. Louis County Police Department, Keith Wildhaber, said that over the years his performance reviews have said he “exceeds standards” or is “superior” in all categories. But in 2014, the suit says, after Sgt. Wildhaber became one of nine top candidates eligible to move up to lieutenant, he and another officer, who had disciplinary and performance issues, were the only ones denied promotion. That same year, the lawsuit says, the sergeant was told by John Saracino, a member of the St. Louis County Board of Police Commissioners, which supervises the department, that the command staff “has a problem with your sexuality. ” “If you ever want to see a white shirt (i. e. get a promotion) you should tone down your gayness,” Mr. Saracino said, according to the suit. Mr. Saracino could not be reached by telephone on Friday. But he told The St. Louis   which reported on the suit: “I never had a conversation like that. I would never say anything like that. That’s not me. ” The lawsuit, filed on Jan. 10 in Circuit Court, names St. Louis County as a defendant and seeks compensation, back pay, promotion and other damages. Sgt. Wildhaber was hired by the Police Department as a security officer in 1994 after he served for four years in the Army, according to the lawsuit. He attended the Police Academy, became a patrolman in 1997 and rose through the ranks. He became a detective in 2006 and a sergeant in 2011, the lawsuit says. He was given a Medal of Valor for saving a man trapped in a burning car in a commuter parking lot in November 1998, when he was still a rookie, according the St. Louis  . Last April, Sgt. Wildhaber filed a discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, alleging employment discrimination based on his sex or gender, the lawsuit says. A month later, he was transferred to a different precinct and put on night shift. The suit says St. Louis County believes that Sgt. Wildhaber “does not fit the stereotypical norms of what a ‘male’ should be” and it has “failed to take any action to investigate or take corrective action” in response to his multiple complaints. Sgt. Wildhaber could not be reached by telephone or email on Friday, but his lawyer, Russell C. Riggan, said in an email, “Until the case goes before a jury, we will allow the petition to speak for itself. ” A spokeswoman for St. Louis County, Allison Blood, referred questions to a Police Department spokesman, Sgt. Shawn McGuire. He did not immediately reply to a voice mail message on Friday.",0

Oct 20-24, LVs 
— Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) October 26, 2016 
The AP-GfK Poll has Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 14 points nationally 51%-37%, “The AP-GfK poll finds that Clinton has secured the support of 90 percent of likely Democratic voters, and also has the backing of 15 percent of more moderate Republicans. Just 79 percent of all Republicans surveyed say they are voting for their party’s nominee.” 
Earlier in the day, two Bloomberg polls that had Trump leading Florida by 2 points, and cutting Clinton’s New Hampshire lead in half gave Republicans a bit of hope that the presidential election might be tightening, but the reality is that voting is already underway in 37 states. There are very few undecided voters remaining. 
Outside of tracking polls, Donald Trump hasn’t had a polling lead since July . Besides his brief July bump, Trump hasn’t led Clinton in national polling since May. What the media and Republicans don’t want to tell you is that this presidential election has been remarkably consistent. 
There is nothing in the polling to suggest that the election is tightening, or that Trump has significantly improved his odds of winning.

25740,The First Space Photo Of Earth - Shot From A Third Reich Rocket In 1946,"« Previous - Next » The First Space Photo Of Earth - Shot From A Third Reich Rocket In 1946 
Prior to 1946, the highest pictures that had ever been taken of the Earth were from the Explorer II balloon in 1935. At 13.7 miles up, the photos were understandably vague. At this point, our view of Earth was largely based on science, with a bit of support from the Explorer II photos. However, nothing was clear enough to be confirmed. 
In October of 1946, the ideas of many scientists were confirmed, as new heights were reached. Something astonishing occurred at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Using a V2 rocket that had been captured from Nazis and brought to White Sands in 300 rail cars after the war, a camera was shot into space. The first rocket reached what is now a measly height of 65 miles. At nearly five times the height of previous photos, researchers now had their first view from space. While the camera was destroyed, plummeting back to earth at nearly 500 feet per second, the film had been protected by a steel case, completely untouched . 
Fred Rulli recalls after the recovery of the film, “when they first projected them onto the screen, the scientists just went nuts”, speaking of the photos in 1946. He speaks of his friend, who realized the importance of the day, saying “Do you realize what’s going on here?” Many may not have. They had no idea that in the years following that spectacular day, the V2 rockets would reach even greater heights, traveling over 100 miles up. Hundreds of photos were taken and researchers were ecstatic at what they had discovered. 
Today, when millions of people watch pictures of the Earth from cameras in outer space every day, it seems a perfectly natural thing. Since the V2 rockets, photos have been taken from the moon during the Apollo 8 mission, from space beyond Neptune in 1990 from the Voyager 1, and more recently from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. It seems as though there is not much left to discover when it comes to the surface of the Earth and the photos we have captured of it. However, there will always be something greater. There will always be something new to be found, always a new way to capture beautiful, more technological photos of the surface of our Earth.

25745,Merkel Tells Germans: Be Grateful You Have Free Speech,"Angela Merkel warned Germans should not take freedom for granted, in a speech aimed at countering a rising tide of populism on Friday night. [Speaking at a party conference in Saarlouis, the chancellor called on Germans to show respect for other people’s opinions, but said right wing groups opposed to mass migration have no right to “exclude” anyone from the benefit of belonging to the nation.  Putting a twist on “We are the people” a chant popular with   movement PEGIDA, Merkel said “All of us, we are all the people”. The chancellor, under whose rule German police have raided homes and made hundreds of arrests for online posts critical of mass migration, urged people to back values of ‘freedom and democracy’. Merkel said freedom of speech and religion, freedom of the press and freedom of travel are “not gifts that you don’t have to work for”. “Sometimes you have to make it clear that you are in favour of freedom” she added, warning, “I am convinced that we are again living in such a time”. Looking ahead to the general election due to be held in Germany later this year, Merkel said the notion of  “prosperity for all” will be central to her campaign. “We want as many people as possible in Germany to be able to have a job with fair pay” Merkel said, and underlined that companies should operate in such a way that they “invest in Germany and not elsewhere. ” Since the chancellor opened Germany’s borders in 2015 to nearly two million migrants, most of whom are from the Middle East and Africa, the populist and Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany has eroded support for Merkel’s   Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party. Public anger at the decision to house the influx of newcomers at taxpayers expense triggered a crackdown on ‘hate speech’ with the state using an organisation run by a former Stasi agent to patrol Facebook in  bid to stamp out “xenophobic” comments.",0
25748,Amazon to Begin Accepting Food Stamps - Breitbart,"  retail giant Amazon is among the seven online food retailers that will soon start accepting food stamps, as part of a pilot program instituted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). [The   program, set to launch this summer, will test online ordering and payment methods.  The USDA, which oversees the $74 billion food stamp program, also known as SNAP or the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, says it plans to expand the online program nationwide and eventually add more retailers. Participating retailers include Safeway, ShopRite,   Hart’s Local Grocers, and Dash’s Market, and will serve  food stamps recipients in seven states: Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, Iowa, and Oregon. However, Amazon is by far the largest online food distributor participating in the federal government’s new program. “Amazon is excited to participate in the USDA SNAP online purchasing pilot,” the Seattle,   company said in a press release. “We are committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers the lowest prices possible. ” For years, government watchdog groups have demanded tighter regulations as food stamp fraud remains a common and costly problem. The USDA, seemingly aware of the risks for fraud, says “online payment presents technical and security challenges that will need to be examined and fully addressed before it is offered nationwide. ” News of the USDA’s pilot program comes as a new report reveals Americans used food stamps to buy more than $600 million worth of “sweetened beverages,” and bought hundreds of millions more of junk food and sugary snacks. Overall, $1. 3 billion in food stamps were spent on “sweetened drinks, desserts, salty snacks, candy, and sugar,” which accounted for about 20 cents of every dollar spent on food items purchased by 26. 5 million households in 2011, according to a recently released report from the USDA. What’s more, the USDA’s plan to allow tens of millions of food stamps recipients to purchase products from Amazon is the latest example of   profiting from poverty. Big banks like J. P. Morgan have made millions providing electronic benefits transaction (EBT) services for state governments and their respective food stamps programs. “Since 2004, 18 of 24 states who contract with J. P. Morgan to provide welfare benefits have contracted to pay $560, 492, 596. 02,” an investigation by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) found. Christopher Paton, the company’s former managing director of treasury services, told Bloomberg News in 2011: This business is a very important business to JP Morgan. It’s an important business in terms of its size and scale. We also regard it as very important in the sense that we are delivering a very useful social function. We are a key part of this benefit delivery mechanism. Right now volumes have gone through the roof in the past couple of years or so   …     The good news from JP Morgan’s perspective is the infrastructure that we built has been able to cope with that increase in volume. Walmart, which wasn’t selected to participate in the USDA pilot program, hopes to be added to the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service online purchasing program in the future. “We look forward to working with FNS as they continue to explore this opportunity,” the company said, CBS reports. “We’ve expanded our highly popular online grocery service from five markets to more than 100 markets over the past 18 months in both large and small communities across the country. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0
25749,"Red Wine Hot Chocolate Is a Thing, and It’s (Surprisingly) Delicious - The New York Times","Frosé? That’s a summer drink. Hot toddies, eggnog, mulled wine? Please, those are for your parents. No, no, the   drink of winter 2016, at least according to a small but dedicated circle of food blogs, is red wine hot chocolate. A post this fall on Martha Stewart’s official Facebook page called it “spectacular. ” Soon after, Cosmopolitan magazine called it “the best of both worlds. ” The Kitchn, a popular recipe site, called it “the answer to your   blues. ” And last month, The Daily Mail had an “exclusive” on a version of the recipe that had grown popular on Pinterest. The basic idea is not new. Most versions follow the same formula as the one posted in 2014 on Imma Eat That, a food blog that has frequently been cited as the recipe has rocked around the internet in the past few years. It’s pretty easy to follow: Depending on your thoughts on hot chocolate, on red wine and on the trend of mixing two separate foods together in heretofore unimagined and occasionally unholy ways, this sounds like either the best idea or the worst idea. And when you can already easily add rum or whiskey or any other spirit to hot chocolate, what else can red wine really bring to the table? The first reaction most people had when they heard about this story? A crinkling of noses and the occasional “eww. ” It was definitely mine. The key is to start with a good hot chocolate, said Jacques Torres, a New York pastry chef whose public identity is so fused with chocolate that he is known as “Mr. Chocolate. “You’re going to use real chocolate,” he said, not cocoa powder, and warm it with milk and a bit of condensed milk for extra silkiness. “Finished chocolate has all the flavor you want,” he said. “It’s smooth and silky it doesn’t have any bitterness. ” Mr. Torres also suggested an important deviation from most of the recipes out there: Do not heat up the wine and the chocolate together. Make your hot chocolate and separately make some mulled wine only then should the two be combined. “If you don’t get the spices, it’s not going to be that good,” he said. “But it can be good with the spices. ” He suggested mulling the wine with allspice, and ancho and chipotle chiles “so you have a little bit of heat with it. ” And so one cold Sunday I set about making this strange Frankendrink. I followed Mr. Torres’s advice, using two especially dark chocolate bars for the hot chocolate. The mulled wine was a simmered mix of what was on hand: orange slices and sugar, water and an entire bottle of cheap red wine (I used a $9 malbec, minus a glass for drinking just in case this whole chocolate thing didn’t work).

25753,Trump on Iran ship behavior: ‘They will be shot out of the water’,"By wmw_admin on November 2, 2016 Introduction — Oct 31, 2016 The following report only serves to underline how the U.S. political system is no longer fit for purpose. It is totally corrupt and serves ‘special interest groups’ that put their own aims over and above those of the American people. What follows is nearly two months old but it is also a timely reminder that Trump, like Clinton, is more than ready to lead America into war. Although unlike Clinton, Trump prefers a less direct route. So instead of directly challenging Russia Trump has saved his belligerence for Iran. Threatening that Iranian military speed boats would be “shot out of the water” if they made moves “that they shouldn’t be allowed to make” near U.S. warships. Given the growing military ties between Russia and Iran, this could easily result in the U.S. facing what the WSJ refers to as the Moscow-Tehran-Damascus axis: a rebranded “axis of evil”. Trouble is neither U.S. presidential candidate is offering a valid alternative to this confrontational scenario. Both are advocating two entirely different approaches on foreign policy that would ultimately lead to the same end — military confrontation with Russia. The only difference is that Americans would be more likely to follow Trump into conflict than the increasingly discredited Clinton. Ed. Trump on Iran ship behavior: ‘They will be shot out of the water’ Daniella Diaz and Johhny Diamond — CNN Sept 10, 2016 
Donald Trump vowed Friday that if Iran inappropriately approached US ships, they would be “shot out of the water.” 
“And by the way, with Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures that our people — that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,” he said at a rally here. 
Taking such action would have tremendous ramifications and would likely be considered an act of war. The comments, even given Trump’s penchant for tough language, are unusual for a presidential candidate. 
Trump appeared to be referring to a series of close encounters between the US and Iran in international waters in the Persian Gulf. 
An Iranian ship came within 100 yards of a US Navy patrol ship earlier this week in what the US Navy described as an “unsafe and unprofessional” action involving “harassing maneuvering.” 
And late last month , a US Navy patrol craft fired three warning shots at an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps boat after US officials said it had harassed two US ships. Another US patrol craft and a Kuwaiti Navy ship were also harassed in the northern end of the Persian Gulf. 
Iran has also flown drones over US ships and in one of the most intense confrontations between the US and Iran, Iranian troops took US sailors into custody in January after the US naval ship accidentally strayed into Iranian territorial waters. 
The US has condemned Iran’s actions but hasn’t responded militarily to the provocations.",0
25754,Lin-Manuel Miranda: Trump Refugee Order ’Deeply Un-American’,"Hamilton creator   Miranda came out against President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program, calling it “deeply  . ”[“I keep seeing ‘Immigrants, We Get The Job Done’ on placards at every march, at every protest. I can’t tell you what that does to me as a writer to see a line [I wrote]. And what it means for the conversation, in this moment in history,” Miranda told The Huffington Post on Thursday.  The     also said Trump’s order is “against the fundamental freedom of religion in our constitution. ” President Trump signed an executive order last week which suspended the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days. The order prohibits the arrival of Syrian refugees into the United States and halted entry of citizens from failed state,   countries including Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya. Miranda, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, also pledged his support for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) a   agency Trump has promised to defund. “The importance of the NEA ― I can not tell you how many studies and findings find that arts lift up every other score in education,” Miranda said. “When you learn music, you use both hemispheres of your brain. It helps you with the math and it helps you with the arts. It’s so important that the arts have attention in our education. It certainly saved my life. I don’t know where I would be without the amazing arts education I got at a public school. I certainly wouldn’t be talking to you. So, we’re going to have to fight to protect it. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0
25756,"Trump accuses Obama, Hillary Clinton of founding Daesh","Email US President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton “founded” the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in the Middle East region, according to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Addressing supporters at a rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump said Daesh is ""honoring President Obama."" “He’s the founder of ISIS. He's the founder! He founded ISIS,” the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. “I would say the co-founder would be ‘Crooked’ Hillary Clinton,” Trump added. He went on to criticize Obama’s decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. “We should never have gotten out the way we got out,” he said. “We unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East."" “Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out,” he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians. In a statement last week, Mike Pence, Trump’s vice presidential candidate, also said that the policies of Obama and Clinton led to the rise of Daesh. He blamed Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the “disastrous decisions” that led to the death of Captain Humayun Khan in Iraq. On July 28, Captain Khan’s father, Khizr Khan, addressed the Democratic National Convention, denouncing Trump as unpatriotic and selfish over his statements against immigrants and Muslims.",0
25760,Instagram Introduces New Features That Mimic Twitter and Snap Tools - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   For the last six years, Instagram has been a repository for users’ most picturesque moments. But 2016 has been a year of reinvention for the   social network, which has broadened what it lets people do with their images. Now Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, is rolling out two more new features. On Monday, the company is unveiling one feature focused on live video and one on ephemeral messaging. Both tap into a type of sharing popularized in recent years by companies like Snap Inc. which runs Snapchat, and Twitter, in its   video app Periscope. “We want Instagram to be a place where you can share all of your moments, to create a   space to do so,” Kevin Weil, head of product at Instagram, said in an interview. Mr. Weil said this philosophy, and the feature choices that stem from it, would encourage people to use Instagram for more than the selected, highly polished feeds for which it is known. The new features thrust Instagram more directly into competition with Twitter and into a heightened rivalry with Snap, which is particularly notable as Snap recently filed paperwork to go public. Instagram has steadily been introducing features to compete with Snap. This year, it unveiled a feature called Instagram Stories, which mimics a Snapchat feature called Snapchat Stories, in which people can organize their photos into a story line. Instagram’s   feature will be released to a small test group on Monday a wider rollout is planned for the weeks to come. The feature lets Instagram users broadcast live video to their followers through the Stories section of the app. Much as in Twitter’s Periscope, friends and followers watching Instagram live videos can comment and send cartoon hearts to the broadcaster during the stream. But live Instagram videos are meant to be fleeting and cannot be saved to watch later. That gives broadcasters room to express themselves more fully, Mr. Weil said, without the added pressure of the raw video sticking around indefinitely. Instagram’s other new feature, disappearing photos and videos within the company’s private messaging tool, will be available to all its users. While an ephemeral live broadcast may be seen by many, disappearing messages are for the few, usually friends or family in a tighter circle than the wider audience of followers. Disappearing messages were made famous by Snapchat, which was able to draw a generation of young regular users. Snapchat rose to prominence in a   era of social media, one in which people grew fond of the idea that their digital history did not have to follow them around the internet in perpetuity. Mr. Weil defended the company’s move into ephemeral sharing and pointed to improvements and product adjustments that he said highlighted Instagram’s innovation with the format. “The format is definitely something that Snapchat innovated on,” Mr. Weil said. “But it’s just like how hashtags started on Twitter and are used everywhere. I think this particular format is one that we will see adopted everywhere else. ”",0
25767,World’s Life Expectancy Cut By 4 Billion Years,"0 Add Comment 
THE WORLD’s leading scientists have hastily revised Earth’s life expectancy after taking on board new data which has just come to light in the last 24 hours. 
Huge, cataclysmic tremors felt on North America faultlines have led scientists from leading institutions to report that the planet, once estimated to live on for some 4 billion years in one form or another, may not live as long as once predicted. 
“We are compelled to alter our projections for Earth’s life expectancy dramatically,” explained lead researcher at the Institute of Studies, Professor Thalia Ambrosio. 
“While Earth’s vital signs initially looked normal enough, we’re now looking at 4 years tops,” Prof. Ambrosio added. “We’re raising the end of the world alert level from red to a tanned, leathery orange”. 
This startling news has had a profound effect on the Earth’s population, with many asking what they can do to prolong the life of the planet. 
However, scientists were quick to point out that the cut in life expectancy is not something that is likely to change. 
“We know people are keen to help, but honestly, some people are under the impression moving to Canada will somehow help the planet which we must point out doesn’t really do anything,” Prof. Ambrosio concluded. 
The group of scientists confirmed they could go into specific details about just how the world will come to an end in the coming years, but will resist doing so because ‘you look worried enough as it is’.",0
25768,В Екатеринбурге коллекторы избили пенсионерку,"0 комментариев 3 поделились Фото: АР 
Как сообщили ТАСС в пресс-службе надзорного ведомства, подробности дела уточняются. В ходе надзорных мероприятий прокуратура выяснит, в какой организации пожилая женщина взяла заем, и какой фактический долг установлен на текущий момент. Ведомство также оценит действия сотрудников коллекторского агентства на предмет соблюдения законодательства. 
Прокуратура взяла на контроль результаты доследственной проверки по факту нанесения телесных повреждений женщине. 
Угрозы и нападения коллекторов на Урале происходят не впервые. В августе коллекторы довели жительницу Челябинска до отравления уксусной кислотой из-за кредита в 732%. По словам уполномоченного по правам человека в Челябинской области, из-за угроз Фарида Ибрагимова отравилась уксусной кислотой и скончалась в больнице. 
""Равиля Ибрагимова и ее внучка Эльвира уже два года подвергаются давлению со стороны коллекторов. В июне 2014 года жительница Челябинска Фарида Ибрагимова в одной из местных микрофинансовых организаций взяла 5 тысяч рублей. Через две недели она должна была вернуть 6 500 рублей. Процентная ставка по кредиту составила 2% в день или 732% годовых. Погасить долг полностью Ибрагимова не смогла,"" — сообщает омбудсмен области Маргарита Павлова. 
После чего начались телефонные звонки с угрозами на телефон женщины, на домашний телефон матери, а затем и дочери Эльвире в социальных сетях начали поступать сообщения с угрозами. Несколько раз коллекторы стреляли по окнам квартиры Ибрагимовых. Семья трижды обращалась в правоохранительные органы, но в возбуждении уголовного дела им отказывали. 
В 2015 года Фарида попыталась покончить с собой, выпив 70% уксусную кислоту. Ибрагимова целый год провела в больнице, но поправиться не смогла. После смерти Фариды коллекторская фирма требует уже более 200 тысяч рублей у матери и дочери погибшей. 
Ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что вступление в силу закона, который обязывает коллекторов с 1 января 2017 года состоять в государственном реестре, могут отложить на полгода из-за того, что чиновники до сих пор не могут договориться с Минфином о выделении бюджетных средств на регулирование деятельности по взысканию долгов. Как сообщал ""Коммерсантъ"", работа по формированию реестра так и не начата, нет официально установленного перечня критериев, которым должны соответствовать участники рынка взыскания долгов. Минюст не сможет приступить к составлению списка, пока не выйдет соответствующее постановление правительства и на него не выделят деньги. 
Напомним, в июле Владимир Путин подписал закон о коллекторской деятельности. Документ устанавливает правовые основы деятельности по возврату просроченной задолженности граждан и порядок их взаимодействия с кредиторами и взыскателями долгов. 
Закон запрещает коллекторам применять физическую силу и угрожать ее применением, причинять вред здоровью и имуществу, оказывать психологическое давление и вводить в заблуждение. 
Звонить должнику коллектор сможет не чаще двух раз в неделю, а проводить личные встречи — не чаще одного раза в неделю. Общение с должником ночью — с 22.00 до 8.00 в будни и с 20.00 до 9.00 в выходные — запрещено. Взыскатель долгов при взаимодействии с должником не вправе скрывать информацию о номере телефона и адресе электронной почты, с которых он звонит и отправляет сообщения.

25770,Kellogg’s Latest Mass Layoffs Hit Kansas City,"The latest round of mass layoffs for cereal maker Kellogg’s has hit Kansas City, where nearly 200 workers will lose their jobs, the company says. [The layoffs of 185 workers are part of a program euphemistically labeled “Special K,” a scaling back of distribution centers all across the country, the Kansas City Business Journal reported.  “As the distribution shifts from our network to our retailers’ networks, so too will the work,” Kellogg’s spokesman Kris Charles said, adding: We’ve been actively engaged in conversations with some of our biggest retail partners who have expressed strong interest in hiring these employees for   roles once the transition is complete. As a result, we are optimistic that our employees will find similar employment once this transition is complete. The new distribution model is already in use for many of Kellogg’s snack product lines, including Pringles,   crackers, its frozen foods products, and others. “The new model will be transformational for Kellogg, reducing complexity and cost structure while driving growth and profitability for the company and its retail partners,” Charles added. “While this is the right move for the company to achieve our   objectives, it was a difficult decision because of its impact on employees. ” Kellogg’s has been struggling the last few years, and customer confidence in its brand name has fallen from sixtieth to   place during the last four years. The layoffs in Kansas City are but a small part of the string of job losses the company announced. Just last week, a distribution center in Florida was informed that 246 employees were going to lose their jobs, nearly 300 were fired in facilities in New York early in May, and only a week later, another 219 lost their jobs in Minnesota. The cuts came on the heels of several announcements by the cereal maker that it was slashing its workforce. The company’s financial struggles coincided with Kellogg’s decision last year to cease advertising with Breitbart News, whose 45, 000, 000 readers, Kellogg’s said, are not “aligned with our values as a company. ” While Kellogg’s decision to cease advertising had no impact on Breitbart. com’s revenue, it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled President Donald Trump into the White House. After the cereal maker turned its back on conservative customers, Breitbart News launched its #DumpKelloggs petition, which more than 450, 000 people signed. Finally, according to advertising industry watchdog Adweek, Kellogg’s decision to pull advertising from Breitbart News and the ensuing controversy over the move inflicted   damage to the cereal company’s online brand.

25774,"Fleeing U.S. for Asylum, and Handcuffed in Canada - The New York Times","They drag their luggage, carry their young children in their arms and join hands to help one another over rough terrain and along snowy roads. They are immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers who are streaming across the border from the United States into Canada in higher numbers. For those who cross illegally, handcuffs await. They are detained, interviewed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and turned over to the Canadian border agency. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said last week that there had been a significant increase over the past few months in the number of people illegally crossing the border, mostly in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia. The police did not provide figures, but they said the largest uptick was recorded in Quebec. In the last week alone, images of families and solo travelers from countries like Sudan and Turkey have emerged as they encounter police officers, politely waiting, at a crossing in Hemmingford, Quebec. Cpl. François Gagnon, a spokesman for the Mounted Police, said that the authorities started noticing an increase in the last few months of 2016 for reasons that were “not clear cut” but that might be related to the election of Donald J. Trump and his executive order on immigration in January. “It might be one of the reasons,” he said. The order, targeting immigrants from seven   countries and indefinitely suspending refugees from Syria, was blocked by various courts. On Friday, President Trump said a new executive action would be issued soon. Corporal Gagnon said that as soon as the   asylum seekers cross the border, they are advised that they would be arrested. “It is a criminal activity to cross the border illegally,” he said. “It is the same as when I arrest a drunk driver on the road. We are going to do it for security purposes. ” He added: “The basic process for the R. C. M. P. is to handcuff everybody, based on the fact that it is criminal. Based on risk assessment, we are not going to handcuff women and children. This is a new humanitarian thing for us, as well. Those people have been through a lot and we don’t want to put more pressure on them. ” Once they are in custody, the migrants and asylum seekers are taken to police stations, where the handcuffs are usually removed and they are asked about their identification and country of origin. An investigation is conducted into whether they are in a Canadian intelligence database or wanted for a crime, Corporal Gagnon said. “If nothing pops up, they are going to be turned over to the Canadian Border Services Agency and then they apply for asylum,” he said. There are no criminal charges once they establish a demand for asylum, but they could be fined, he added. The New York Times has been tracking the effect on Canada of Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration. In January, as the order stranded people at airports, upended immigration plans   and provoked global condemnation, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada took to social media to restate the country’s   policy.  “To those fleeing persecution, terror  war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith,” Mr. Trudeau wrote on Twitter. “Diversity is our strength. ” The Quebec crossing is the most active, Corporal Gagnon said. This month, a Times report noted that over the last couple of years, a small number of people had been crossing the border at Manitoba from the United States and then filing for asylum. But as the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty grows as immigrants fear arrest on “any corner” in the United States, refugee workers in Winnipeg say there has been a noticeable surge in border crossings.",0
25775,The Calculus in Six Crucial Senate Races - The New York Times,"A look at the political math in six states where tight races could determine control of the Senate: NORTH CAROLINA Senator Richard Burr, a Republican, was thought to be a safe bet for   against Deborah Ross, his Democratic challenger, who is a former state representative and head of the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. But North Carolina has been roiled by a fight over bathroom rights for transgender people that has affected almost every campaign. The national Republican Party has swooped in to try to save Mr. Burr’s bid. _____ PENNSYLVANIA  Katie McGinty, a Democrat, is trying to become Pennsylvania’s first female senator with a bid to unseat Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican who has managed to keep a moderate image around the state because of a (failed) gun safety bill that bore his name. Hillary Clinton’s coattails  —   and Donald J. Trump’s anvil  —   have made a difference here. _____ NEW HAMPSHIRE  Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is suffering from an uncomfortable association with Mr. Trump, most notably when she had to release a statement walking back her suggestion during a debate that Mr. Trump was a role model for children. Gov. Maggie Hassan, her Democratic challenger, is getting major assistance from national party figures like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders in what is widely viewed as the closest Senate race in the country. _____ MISSOURI Senator Roy D. Blunt was on no lists of endangered incumbents. Then his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, an Afghanistan veteran who is Missouri’s secretary of state, conjured up an ad in which he assembled an assault rifle blindfolded while speaking of gun rights. It was a clever way to both fend off attacks over gun control and underscore Mr. Blunt’s Vietnam deferments in a very   state. Mr. Blunt’s decades of service in Washington are also out of style this year. _____ INDIANA  Evan Bayh, a Democrat, is trying to reclaim his Senate seat but is finding that his time as a Washington insider is a serious liability. Representative Todd Young, with the help of millions of dollars in outside money, is painting a dark picture of Mr. Bayh as a greedy lobbyist who abandoned his voters, and Mr. Bayh’s   lead has shrunk significantly. Indiana is Trump country, and Mr. Bayh, who was once a very popular governor, is going to need Republican voters who remember him fondly to split their tickets. _____ NEVADA For a while, it did not seem that Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who is a former state attorney general, would catch up to Representative Joe Heck, a Republican who seemed a good fit for his state and this cycle. But Mr. Heck, by turning away from Mr. Trump after the presidential candidate was heard bragging about sexual assault in a 2005 recording, began to lose some of his base support, living every Republican candidate’s nightmare. The Hispanic vote, important here, is hard to poll. But Ms. Cortez Masto is now narrowly ahead in the race, a battle for the seat of Senator Harry Reid in which the retiring Democratic leader has unleashed his political machine in support of her.",0
25779,Officer Who Killed Ramarley Graham Leaves New York Police Department - The New York Times,"A New York City police officer who five years ago chased an unarmed teenager into his Bronx home and fatally shot him resigned from the Police Department on Sunday. The officer, Richard Haste, 35, quit after he was found guilty on Friday in a Police Department disciplinary review in connection with the shooting of Ramarley Graham, 18, the police said. A deputy commissioner who oversaw the case ruled that Officer Haste, who had been on the force since 2008, had used poor tactical judgment and recommended his dismissal. In a hearing in January on departmental charges, police prosecutors said Officer Haste had made many mistakes when he and other officers in a narcotics unit followed Mr. Graham from a bodega into his apartment building in February 2012. Mr. Graham locked himself in his apartment, at which point, the prosecutors said, the officers should have retreated. But they barged into his home. Officer Haste spotted Mr. Graham at the end of a hallway, followed him into a bathroom and fatally shot the teenager. At the hearing, the officer said he had had no choice but to fire his gun after Mr. Graham ignored commands and reached into his pants. Officer Haste faced accusations of wrongdoing only from the Police Department he was not charged with a crime. A grand jury indicted him on manslaughter charges in 2012, but a judge later dismissed those charges, and another grand jury decided not to charge him, causing tensions to flare and stirring accusations of racism. Mr. Graham was black, and Officer Haste is white. Mr. Graham’s mother, Constance Malcolm, said Sunday night that it was wrong that Officer Haste had not been fired previously. She placed the blame on the Police Department and Mayor Bill de Blasio. “This is just another example that the de Blasio administration doesn’t care about justice and accountability,” Ms. Malcolm said in a statement. Mr. de Blasio said in a statement that he agreed with the judge’s ruling in the disciplinary hearing and that the Police Department had taken steps to try to reduce similar shootings. Officer Haste was informed of the ruling by the deputy commissioner, Rosemarie Maldonado, through his lawyer, Stuart London, who received a call on Friday from her office. “Officer Haste’s actions were all performed with a good faith basis,” Mr. London said in an email on Sunday. “He should have never be forced to resign based on tactics alone. ” Officer Haste previously rejected a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid the disciplinary hearing and resign with a small pension. In 2015, the city settled a   lawsuit with Mr. Graham’s family for $3. 9 million.",0

25786,Donald Trump Signals ’Big Fat Beautiful Negotiation’ on House Healthcare Bill - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump told reporters that a “big fat beautiful negotiation” was underway on the proposed house health care bill, after a growing number of conservatives have voiced dissent with the effort. [“We’re negotiating with everybody,” Trump said. “It’s a big fat beautiful negotiation and hopefully we’ll come up with something that’s going to be really terrific. ”  Trump made his remarks during a meeting with his cabinet at the White House  —   although four of them have yet to be confirmed by the Senate. During remarks to reporters, Trump thanked Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for working “around the clock” on the effort to replace the Obamacare bill. “I think that ultimately the big beneficiary will be the American people,” Trump said. A handful of Republican Senators have signaled that they will not support the bill, raising questions about the bill’s ability to pass. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have also signaled that they will not vote for the bill as it currently stands. Trump spent the morning meeting with Americans affected by skyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, and less coverage from Obamacare. “It’s not okay, it’s a disaster, and people understand that. It’s failed and it’s imploding,” Trump said, adding that if it was allowed to continue, it would “doubly implode. ”",0
25787,Flashback: Clinton cheered 11th-hour indictment that doomed Bush re-election,"Print 
Whispers of “payback” are being directed at Hillary Clinton after she decried as “unprecedented” the surprise FBI revival of its probe of her email scandal. 
That’s because 24 years ago, as former President George H.W. Bush was surging back against challenger Bill Clinton, a special prosecutor raised new charges against Bush in the Iran-Contra probe, prompting Clinton to claim he was running against a “culture of corruption.” 
Many Republicans claimed that the indictment made by special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh against former Reagan-era Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger the weekend before the 1992 election cost Bush a second term. The indictment, later thrown out, challenged Bush’s claim that he did not know about a controversial arms-for-hostages deal that dogged the Reagan-Bush administration. 
When it came, Clinton seized on it, saying for example, “Secretary Weinberger’s note clearly shows that President Bush has not been telling the truth when he says he was out of the loop.” Clinton added, “It demonstrates that President Bush knew and approved of President Reagan’s secret deal to swap arms for hostages.”",0

25790,"Woodward Warns ’Smug’ Media: Trump Will Probably Be President for Full Term, Maybe Even More - Breitbart","Wednesday during an Axios interview, veteran Washington Post reporter of Watergate fame Bob Woodward said the press has a “kind of smugness” about President Donald Trump.  When asked about press “smugness,” Woodward said, “Yes. I think that is a giant problem. On television particularly, you will see a White House correspondent deliver a report and then say ‘the Trump White House said  …    ’ and then there’s a kind of smug smile, which is the correspondent undermining what the White House says. And there may be grounds for that, but it should be reported. It should be straight. ” He added, “I think there are so many people that are treating the Trump presidency as if it’s a tryout —  as if it’s provisional. I was reading a column this morning that said Trump half won the presidency because he did not get the popular vote. He is president. Odds are he is probably going to be president for a full term, four years and maybe even more. There is hyperventilation. There is this kind of sense of too many people writing things like —  when is the impeachment coming, how long will it last, will he make it through the summer, and so forth. No, there may be stuff that comes out, but it has to be hard evidence. I worry for the business and I worry for the perception of the business by people, not to just Trump supporters, but people that see that kind of smugness that they are talking about. You know, he was elected, the Constitution says he gets a full term. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

25795,Privacy Group Sues NYPD over Freedom of Information Request on Facial Recognition Program - Breitbart,"The New York Police Department (NYPD) is being sued by a privacy group for failing to disclose information about a “secretive” facial recognition program. [The Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law filed the lawsuit after the NYPD allegedly refused to comply with a Freedom of Information Law request.  “As of 2016, the NYPD is reported to have conducted ‘8, 500 facial recognition investigations, yielding 3, 000 possible matches, and leading to almost 2, 000 arrests.’ In January 2016, the Center sent a FOIL request to the NYPD seeking records relating to the department’s acquisition and use of face recognition technology,” explained the group in a press release. “Despite extensive evidence of an advanced and frequently used face recognition system, the NYPD disclosed only a single document responsive to the request for procedures relating to facial recognition technology. The department refused to disclose contract and purchasing records, and claimed that no other records could be found. ” Despite the fact that there are currently no laws against the use of facial recognition by law enforcement in New York, the Center claims that it is illegal for the NYPD to keep the records surrounding it from the public. “Face recognition is too powerful, and its price on privacy and civil liberties too high, to not be controlled by robust policies and training guides,” said the Center’s Clare Garvie, who filed the original request. “If these records do in fact exist, it is against both New York law and the interests of the public to keep them secret. ” “The NYPD has been using face recognition for over five years. New Yorkers have a right to know how it’s using face recognition technology,” added David Vladeck, the Faculty Director of the Center. “The department’s claim that it cannot find any records about its use of the technology is deeply troubling. ” “If no records exist, that means that there are no controls on the use of face recognition technology and we ought to worry about that,” he continued. “If there are records, then why did the Police Department say that it couldn’t find them? The lawsuit we’ve filed aims to get to the bottom of those questions. ” The lawsuit can be viewed in full online. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

25796,IS Jihadist on Eilat Attack: ‘The Jewish Enemy Should Anticipate More’,"TEL AVIV  —   Wednesday’s rocket fire on the Israeli resort city of Eilat was “a natural reaction” to  alleged Israeli involvement with the Egyptian army’s clampdown on Sinai militants, Abu Baker Almaqdesi, a   jihadist who fought for the Islamic State, told Breitbart Jerusalem in an interview. [Late on Wednesday, four rockets were launched toward the southern city, three of which were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. No damage or injuries were reported. Earlier on Thursday, the Islamic State Sinai Province posted an online statement taking credit for the rocket salvo aimed at Eilat.  Almaqdisi previously fought for IS in Syria and Mosul in northern Iraq, where he says he was injured. Without offering evidence, Almaqdesi claimed that in recent days Israel Air Force drones have taken part in raids on chapters of Wilayat Sinai, the Islamic State’s Egyptian affiliate. Some of the casualties, he claimed, were Gazans. Breitbart Jerusalem submitted a request to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the allegations of drone strikes in the Sinai. Using   language, Almaqdesi, who spoke to Breitbart Jerusalem in Arabic, claimed that “the Jewish entity”  —   referring to Israel  —   “never stopped assisting the Egyptian army of infidels in their war against the mujahedeen, and tonight’s salvo on Umm Rashrash [Eilat’s Arabic name] was a natural reaction to those crimes. ” The jihadist claimed the Eilat rocket attack wasn’t a precedent. “Earlier this month, we fired at the Elojah crossing [between Egypt and Israel]. Our brothers are determined to continue to react to the crimes of the Jews, and we’ll continue to launch rockets at Israel despite their airborne operations and despite the strain of the Egyptian army of infidels. ” Almaqdesi claimed that only three days ago, an Israeli drone fired at a house in the Egyptian Sinai, which happened to be empty and therefore no injuries were caused. “The Jewish enemy continues its attack on the mujahedeen and innocent civilians, so they should anticipate more from our brothers the Sinai mujahedeen. ” Asked whether they plan   attacks on Israel, Almaqdesi said: “It’s the decision of the brothers in the leadership, but it is clear to all that the Jewish entity is just one player in the war on Islam. Though a major one. Therefore, no option is off the table. It’s true that the Jewish police arrest our mujahedeen even inside Palestine and the forces of the treacherous collaborator Abu Mazen do it too, and even those who are falsely called Muslims in Gaza fight against us. But our organization proved that we could strike anywhere in the world. I can tell you that our weapons are now aimed at Israel more than ever before. ” The Islamic State Sinai Province on Thursday released a statement taking credit the Eilat rocket attack: “A military squad fired a number of Grad rockets at communities of Jewish usurpers in the town of Eilat. ” The group said the rocket attacks were meant “to teach the Jews and the crusaders a proxy war will not avail them of anything. ” “The future will be more calamitous with Allah’s permission,” the statement said. In a   interview last March, Abu     a Salafist movement senior official in the Gaza Strip allied with IS, threatened that it is only a matter of time before the Islamic State’s branch in the Egyptian Sinai carries out a “big operation” in the Israeli resort town of Eilat and other parts of southern Israel. Ansari was speaking on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio. ” He has since been arrested by Hamas and is reportedly in a jail in the Gaza Strip.

25800,Moronic Trump Campaign Thinks Reopened Clinton Email Investigation Will Save Them,"The Trump campaign is so desperate that they are openly celebrating the reopening of the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted: A great day in our campaign just got even better. FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe @CNNPolitics https://t.co/WBltG2lAK6 
— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 28, 2016 
The problem with the idea that the emails will save Donald Trump and the Republican Party is that Clinton was beating Trump while the FBI did their first investigation into her emails. Clinton has led Trump all through the Congressional hearings into her emails. She led Trump throughout the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton won the Democratic nomination with her emails being a story. 
The point is that Hillary Clinton’s emails aren’t a big issue to the majority of voters. The people who aren’t Republicans in this election don’t care about her emails. 
When compared to Trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. 
There has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. 
Republicans can’t get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy. 
Hillary Clinton is facing Donald Trump in this election, and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day. 
The voters are speaking, and they don’t care about Hillary Clinton’s emails.",0
25802,"'If Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket,' former congressman tweets","Email 

Former Illinois congressman and conservative radio host Joe Walsh appeared to invite armed insurrection when he tweeted that he was ""grabbing his musket"" if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in the presidential election. 
""On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump,"" Walsh tweeted. ""On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."" 
""@WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean?"" CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted in reply. 
""@jaketapper It means protesting,"" Walsh tweeted. ""Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back."" 
Walsh's rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trump's insistence that the election is ""rigged,"" and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America ""in suspense"" about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome. 
More than half of Americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday. 
Walsh dismissed another Twitter user's concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the Secret Service saying, ""They understand that a musket hasn't been used in battle in almost 200 years."" 
""I'm serious,"" Walsh tweeted later. ""I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right."" 
Walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to NBC's Chicago affiliate. ""We're talking about a musket,"" Walsh said, according to NBC 5 Chicago. ""I could've said grab your slingshot and let's go. Metaphorically, I meant grab your muskets, if Trump loses, man, we're going to do what we have to do. We're going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience. We may start a third party."" 
This wasn't the first time Walsh, who served one term before being defeated by Rep. Tammy Duckworth in 2012, drew criticism for an incendiary tweet. In July he got national attention for telling President Obama to ""watch out"" after five police officers were killed by a shooter in Dallas. 
""3 Dallas Cops killed, 7 wounded,"" Walsh tweeted in a post that has since been deleted. ""This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.""",0

[Stelter appeared aghast after Carney suggested that there was no reason for reporters to “panic” at the idea of a Donald Trump presidency.  Should Americans panic over @realDonaldTrump? Watch @carney and @brianstelter discuss  &gt pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 3, 2017,  “I think that this is the best beginning of a presidency that I have experienced in my adult life,” Carney said, pointing out that Trump was delivering on his campaign promises. As an example, Carney pointed out that despite what cable news channels reported about Trump softening his position on immigration, he repeated his promise during his joint speech to Congress earlier in the week. “There’s not going to be a real wall,” Stelter protested. “This is what people say all the time,” Carney replied. “I believe there will be a real giant wall, and maybe it just got ten feet higher because he might have heard you say that. ” New York Times Washington Bureau Chief Elisabeth Bumiller boasted that they were increasing their staff of journalists in Washington D. C. to hold the administration accountable. “I think it’s extraordinary that the press sort of ‘woke up’ after Donald Trump’s election to a moment of clarity about its job,” Carney replied. “I think that is one of the things that actually people find alienating. ” Carney suggested that Trump’s worldview was fundamentally opposed to by many journalists who were tasked with covering the administration. “They can’t hear the word or phrase ‘economic nationalism’ without thinking that is bad. They come from, I would say, a globalist secularist point of view and the idea of a president who uses the phrase ‘America First’ strikes them as disturbing,” he said. Turning to the New York Times editor, Carney asked, “Do you think you have enough people who understand and sympathize with Trump’s worldview in your news organizations or do you think that you are predominantly staffed by people who view Trump’s view as not just wrong but probably also evil?” Bumiller shot back, “Do you have enough people in your news organization who disagree with Trump’s point of view?” During the panel, Carney explained why he moved to Breitbart News from the Wall Street Journal. “Breitbart is the most innovative and exciting source of journalism in America today,” he replied, referring to the familiar “entrepreneurial spirit” at Breitbart that he experienced when he helped create Business Insider.

25806,"UK Jobs Market Can Be ""Self-sufficient"" After Brexit, Says Green","The Lords have been told that there is no need to guarantee employers permanent access to a large pool of   foreign labour after Brexit, as investment and higher wages can make the country “ ” in workers. [“We have 1. 5 million unemployed, and one million   looking for   work,” the former diplomat and chairman of Migration Watch, Lord Andrew Green, has told the Lords Economic Select Committee. “It’s not as if the barrel is empty. ”  Lord Green emphasised that “strong public demand to reduce immigration” made achieving a substantial reduction a democratic imperative. The present government remains committed to a target of bringing net immigration down “from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands” which was first set in 2010 but has been missed by a wide margin every year. “I would say that even 100, 000 [migrants] a year would add about nine million to our population over the next   years” Green noted, suggesting that controlling population growth, reducing strain on public services and encouraging community cohesion should be the government’s policy focus. Also providing evidence at the hearing was Philippe Legrain, a visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics European Institute and an adviser to former European Commission president José Manuel Barroso. Legrain expressed outrage that Lord Green could suggest that   was desirable. “  is clearly feasible,” the economist conceded. “I mean, Robinson Crusoe scraped by on his island. But the idea that it’s desirable is insane!” “What is   if not ‘British jobs for British workers’?” Legrain asked again later, clearly incredulous. Paradoxically, the   “citizen of the world” has claimed elsewhere that a substantial reduction in the Swedish population between the 1870s and 1910s “relieved pressure on the land, drove up the productivity and wages of those who remained, and helped catapult Sweden from grinding rural poverty to prosperity within fewer than 50 years. ” His own favoured policy on migration is global free movement. He argues that any controls at all are “economically stupid, politically unsustainable, and morally wrong”. Legrain’s extreme open borders advocacy was briefly picked up by Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, the former Secretary of State for Scotland, at the hearing: “Basically what you’re advocating is a complete  ” he pointed out. “The problem we have is that people can’t get GPs appointments the National Health Service is under enormous pressure there’s huge opposition to building on the green belt. Isn’t this an idealistic economic model which is completely impractical in terms of the real problems that we face?” Legrain countered that “any strains that emerge on public services are not due to [immigration] but rather due to the failure of public services to be flexible or adapt to change”. The hearing comes just week’s after Migration Watch revealed that British businesses would not face a shortfall of workers  .",0
25807,"Trump Elected President, Thanks to 4 in 5 White Evangelicals","November 9, 2016 Trump Elected President, Thanks to 4 in 5 White Evangelicals 
Exit polls suggest that “Never Trump” was never a likely outcome for white evangelical voters, who showed up to support   Trump at their highest margin since 2004. Despite reservations expressed by many evangelical and Republican leaders, white born-again/evangelical Christians cast their ballots for the controversial real estate mogul-turned-politician at an 81 percent to 16 percent margin over Hillary Clinton. Evangelicals of color—who represent 2 in 5 evangelicals, but aren’t segmented out in most national political polls—largely preferred Clinton leading up to the election. But she ultimately underperformed among Hispanics and African Americans compared to President Barack Obama before her. “The story here continues to be continuity in the strength of evangelical support for GOP candidates, rather than greater intensity,” said Kevin den Dulk, political science professor at Calvin College. “I suspect there’s some underlying changes in polling responses that would make Trump’s evangelical support seem greater than it has in the past.”",0
25808,Education System Broken: Let’s Try ‘Ed-Exit’,"Written by Ron Paul   Maryland Governor Larry Hogan recently signed an executive order forbidding Maryland public schools from beginning classes before Labor Day. Governor Hogan’s executive order benefits businesses in Maryland’s coastal areas that lose school-aged summer employees and business from Maryland families when schools start in August. However, as Governor Hogan’s critics have pointed out, some Maryland school districts, as well as Maryland schoolchildren, benefit from an earlier start to the school year. Governor Hogan’s executive order is the latest example of how centralized government control of education leaves many students behind. A centrally planned education system can no more meet the unique needs of every child than a centrally planned economic system can meet the unique needs of every worker and consumer. Centralizing education at the state or, worse, federal level inevitably leads to political conflicts over issues ranging from whether students should be allowed to pray on school grounds, to what should be the curriculum, to what food should be served in the cafeteria, to who should be allowed to use which bathroom. The centralization and politicization of education is rooted in the idea that education is a right that must be provided by the government, instead of a good that individuals should obtain in the market. Separating school from state would empower parents to find an education system that meets the needs of their children instead of using the political process to force their idea of a good education on all children. While many politicians praise local and parental control of education, the fact is both major parties embrace federal control of education. The two sides only differ on the details. Liberals who oppose the testing mandates of No Child Left Behind enthusiastically backed President Clinton’s national testing proposals. They also back the Obama administration’s expansion of federal interference in the classroom via Common Core. Similarly, conservatives who (correctly) not just opposed Clinton’s initiatives but called for the abolition of the Department of Education enthusiastically supported No Child Left Behind. Even most conservatives who oppose Common Core, federal bathroom and cafeteria mandates, and other federal education policies, support reforming, instead of eliminating, the Department of Education. Politicians will not voluntarily relinquish control over education to parents. Therefore, parents and other concerned citizens should take a page from the UK and work to “Ed-Exit” government-controlled education. Parents and other concerned citizens should pressure Congress to finally shut down the Department of Education and return the money to American families. They also must pressure state governments and local school boards to reject federal mandates, even if it means forgoing federal funding. Parents should also explore education alternatives, such as private, charter, and religious schools, as well as homeschooling. Homeschooling is the ultimate form of Ed-Exit. Homeschooling parents have the freedom to shape every aspect of education — from the curriculum to the length of the school day to what their children have for lunch to who can and cannot use the bathroom — to fit their child's unique needs. Parents interested in providing their children with a quality education emphasizing the ideas of liberty should try out my homeschooling curriculum. The curriculum provides students with a well-rounded education that includes courses in personal finance and public speaking. The government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty. However, unlike government schools, my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education.

25812,Kellogg Layoffs Now Hitting Florida,"Breakfast food giant Kellogg’s is continuing mass layoffs, this time focusing on its distribution center in Weston, Florida, where up to 246 workers have now lost their jobs. [The workers will be laid off starting early in July and continuing until the first week of August, according to a notice filed with Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity, the South Florida   reported.  The layoffs come as Kellogg’s decided to end its    distribution model and to switch to a   system. The new plan included the closing of 39 distribution centers around the country and the elimination of over 1, 000 jobs. “While this is the right move for the future of the company, it was a difficult decision because of the impact on affected employees,” John Bryant, chairman and chief executive of Kellogg, said in a statement. “We are doing everything we can to help our employees manage through this transition. ” “Eliminated positions based at the facility include 179 merchandisers (including 119 employed part time) two merchandise managers, four district sales managers, 34 sales representatives, 15 truck drivers, eight warehouse operators, a distribution center manager, a transportation manager, a warehouse manager and a zone scheduler,” the   reported. The layoffs in Florida are but a small part of the string of losses announced recently. Among other announcements, nearly 300 were fired in facilities in New York early in May, and only a week later another 219 lost their jobs in Minnesota. The cuts came on the heels of several announcements by the cereal maker that it was slashing its workforce. Kellogg’s has been struggling over the last few years, so much so that by 2016 customer confidence in its brand name had fallen from 60th to 84th place. The company’s fall from grace coincided with Kellogg’s decision last year to cease advertising with Breitbart News, thereby snubbing Breitbart’s 45, 000, 000 readers. In November of last year, Kellogg noted that the conservative readers at Breitbart News are not “aligned with our values as a company. ” While the decision by Kellogg to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com. it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House. After the cereal maker turned its back on conservative customers, Breitbart News launched its #DumpKelloggs petition, which has been signed by more than 450, 000 people. Finally, according to advertising industry watchdog Adweek, Kellogg’s decision to pull advertising from Breitbart and the ensuing controversy over the move inflicted   damage to the cereal company’s brand online.

25813,52% Voters Approve Trump Job Performance — Stat Buried in 2nd-to-Last Graph of Story - Breitbart,"A   Consult poll released on Wednesday shows 52 percent of voters approve of President Donald Trump’s job performance, but that statistic is in the    paragraph of the Politico article about the poll. [The article states:  Public opinion of the new health care proposal is limited thus far, though the   Consult poll does show less fervent opposition to the bill than a SurveyMonkey poll of adult Americans released on Tuesday. Similarly, the   Consult survey also shows more positive opinions of the job Trump is doing as president. In the new poll, 52 percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance, more than the 43 percent who disapprove. But, on balance, most polls show more disapprove than approve of the job Trump is doing. Politico chose instead for its article, entitled “Poll: Voters Wary of GOP Health Care Bill,” to lead with the divide among voters on approval of the GOP’s American Health Care Act: Nearly half of voters support the new Republican health care bill but the elements they like best are holdovers from the Affordable Care Act, according to a new   Consult poll. The new survey  —   conducted in the days following release of the bill by House GOP leaders  —   underscores the political thicket that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans face in taking on the issue. While Americans are open to the GOP proposal, there is pessimism that rolling back Obamacare will improve quality, price and coverage. Overall, 46 percent of voters approve of the GOP health care proposal, more than the 35 percent who disapprove. Nineteen percent of voters say they don’t have an opinion of the bill. But any support is shallow: Only    voters say they either ‘strongly approve’ or ‘strongly disapprove’ of the bill, with strong disapproval (22 percent) slightly outpacing strong approval (18 percent). “Given the wave of criticism from both parties following the rollout of the bill, this is a relatively strong starting point for GOP leaders and the White House,” Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult’s   and chief research officer, is quoted as saying in the article. “However, it will be important to track how public opinion stands up as more information is released in the coming weeks. ” The article notes that the poll was conducted before the Congressional Budget Office released its score of the GOP bill, “but voters were already leaning toward doubt that the House GOP bill would increase the number of Americans on the rolls: Only a quarter thought more Americans would have insurance, fewer than the 38 percent who thought fewer Americans would be enrolled. ” The   Consult poll surveyed 1, 983 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. “Morning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides   research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy,” the article’s tag states.",0

Greg Hunter – America faces the biggest election in the history of the country. The outcome will have huge implications for the rest of our lives. The desperation is so thick, with the Democrats and the Clinton campaign, you can’t cut it with a hacksaw.

25817,Scientists Discover A Lake Under The Sea: Those Who Swim There Never Come Back Alive,"posted by Eddie A strange ‘lake’ of super salty dense water is discovered on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, where salt deposits bubble up along with methane. Scientists have found an alien, inhospitable world not in the far reaches of the galaxy, but on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico — about a day’s boat ride from New Orleans. Dubbed the “Jacuzzi of Despair,” this pool of super-salty brine kills any unfortunate creature that happens to wonder in — mainly benthic crabs, amphipods and an occasional fish. The circular pool — about 100 feet in circumference and about 12 feet deep — lies nearly 3,300 feet below the surface of the Gulf. 
Everyone who enters this pool at the bottom of the sea will suffer horribly. Erik Cordes, associate Professor of Biology at Temple University, has researched the pool and described his findings in the journal Oceanography . 
“It was one of the most amazing things in the deep sea. You go down into the bottom of the ocean and you are looking at a lake or a river flowing. It feels like you are not on this world”, Cordes told Discovery News . 
“ It feels like you are not on this world” The water in the “lake within the sea” is about five times as salty as the water surrounding it. It also contains highly toxic concentrations of methane and hydrogen sulfide and can thus not mix with the surrounding sea. 
For animals (and people) who swim into it, these toxic concentrations can be deadly. Only bacterial life, tube worms and shrimp can survive those circumstances. For scientists this “lake” is like a playground for their research. They can explore how certain organisms can survive in extreme habitats. “There’s a lot of people looking at these extreme habitats on Earth as models for what we might discover when we go to other planets” Cordes said to “seeker”.

25818,Peinlich: Terrorist vergisst Koffer mit Sprengstoff am Bahnhof,"Mittwoch, 2. November 2016 Peinlich: Terrorist vergisst Koffer mit Sprengstoff am Bahnhof Köln (dpo) - Es sollte sein erster Auftrag für eine ausländische Organisation sein – und er wäre beinahe in die Hose gegangen: IS-Terrorist Samir K. (21) hat seinen Sprengstoffkoffer im Kölner Hauptbahnhof vergessen. Nur der Aufmerksamkeit eines Bundespolizisten ist es zu verdanken, dass der schusselige Fanatiker das Gepäckstück letztlich wiederbekam. ""Uff! Das ist ja gerade nochmal gutgegangen"", stöhnt Samir K. erleichtert und legt eine Hand auf den so wichtigen Koffer. ""Hoffentlich erfährt nie einer meiner Mitjihadisten davon, sonst werde ich zum Gespött meiner ganzen Schläferzelle."" Der Vorfall ereignete sich bereits gestern Abend: Der 21-jährige Islamist kam gerade mit dem Zug aus Berlin, als er im Ausstiegstrubel versehentlich seinen prall mit Sprengstoff gefüllten Koffer mitten auf dem Bahnsteig stehen ließ und sich in Richtung Ausgang begab. Kurzzeitig herrenlos: Gepäckstück Ein Bundespolizist sah das Missgeschick glücklicherweise via Überwachungskamera auf seinem Monitor und schritt kurzentschlossen ein. Er lief zum Gleis, schnappte sich den Koffer und brachte ihn dem verdutzten Terroristen zurück. ""Der Mann - ich schätze, er ist Elektriker, weil aus seinem Koffer Kabel hingen - war ganz überschwänglich und bedankte sich mehrmals bei mir"", berichtet der Polizeibeamte Martin Ferber. ""Ich selbst würde auch erstmal schlucken, wenn plötzlich der Koffer mit allen meinen Arbeitsmaterialien weg wäre."" Dank dem beherzten Einschreiten des Bundespolizisten kann die bereits weit fortgeschrittene Anschlagsplanung von Samir K. und seinen Kollegen jetzt weitergehen: ""Wir müssen den Sprengstoff nur noch in ein unverdächtiges Behältnis füllen, einen geeigneten Ort mit vielen Menschen finden, wo dieses nicht weiter auffällt und dann kann es auch schon losgehen."" pfg , ssi, dan; Foto oben: Shutterstock/ EduardHert , CC BY-SA 3.0 , Foto unten: Shutterstock Artikel teilen:",0
25820,Israel’s Lieberman Threatens Gazans With Genocide,"in: Human Rights , War Propaganda , World News Minister of war Avigdor Lieberman is part of Israel’s lunatic fringe – ruthless, lawless, racist, militant, extremist and nightmarish for Palestinians. A former nightclub bouncer in Moldova before moving to Israel in 1978, he heads the ultranationalist Israel Beiteinu party. Its agenda includes no concessions, no settlement freeze, no Palestinian self-determination (except maybe on worthless, isolated bantustans), no peace process whether or not he admits it. On Monday, Lieberman said Israel’s next war on Gaza will be its last “because we will completely destroy them,” adding: “As minister of defense (sic), I would like to clarify that we have no intention of starting a new war against our neighbors (sic) in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, Lebanon or Syria.” “But in Gaza, like the Iranians, they intend to eliminate the state of Israel…If they impose the next war on Israel, it will be their last. I would like to emphasize again: It will be their last confrontation because we will completely destroy them.” Destroy means genocide. Two million Gazans are trapped by illegal siege and blockade, unable to seek safety next time Israel preemptively attacks them – virtually certain to be worse than last time based on Lieberman’s threat alone. How much death and destruction is too much? How much suffering must Palestinians endure to be free from a gangster, Arab-hating Jewish state? How long will Americans tolerate Washington funding its killing machine with their tax dollars – used for mass slaughter and ruthless persecution? How long will Israelis put up with racist, fascist governance threatening their security and well-being? Israel waged three wars of aggression on Gaza since December 2008/January 2009 – Cast Lead, Pillar of Cloud in 2012 and Protective Edge in 2014, each exponentially more destructive than the previous hostilities. Further conflict is certain, likely far more severe than earlier, based on the trend of the last three, exacerbated by lunatics like Lieberman in charge of warmaking, along with leadership under Netanyahu just as bad.

25824,Israel Just Sent Trump VERY Clear Message Just Weeks From Election!,"0 comments 
Trump has made is very loud and clear that once he gets into the White House, he will be executing “OPERATION: DRAIN THE SWAMP OF D.C.” He wants to take out the corrupted trash that presides there and of course…make America great again. 
Now in a surprising move by Israel, we are learning exactly who they are rooting for. Something like probably has Hillary shaking in her pantsuit! 
Trump supporters are popping up all across the world. 
Check out the scene that unfolded in Jerusalem’s Old City this week. 
On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel’s best friend if elected. 
Wearing “Make America Great Again” baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn’t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. 
“Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that’s what I like,” David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. 
“He’s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He’s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he’s not going to support the two-state solution,” he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. 
Trump has noticed the support he is getting in Israel. 
He even had a message for the people over there. 
This is a far cry from the attitude Obama has had all this time towards Israel. There are many things that Obama should be ashamed of from the past 8 years. He’s ruined America. Cops are criminals, criminals are victims, and people are confused on whether they are a woman or a man, and much much more. 
However, the way he has poisoned the relationship with our very STRONGEST ally in the middle-east and has done so, as arrogantly as he has…is one of the top reasons why Obama has never been and will never be fit for leadership. 
We must ensure, his female counter-part…doesn’t find her way back into the White House come November, and Israel agrees Related Items",0

How can we wake people up to the ongoing global climate engineering assault when so many have been so completely conditioned to deny this most dire issue? Shocking and compelling visual images are the most effective approach. The one minute video below contains extremely eye opening time-lapse film footage of a massive atmospheric aerosol spraying assault. Up close footage of a jet aircraft spray dispersion is also captured. Visual proof is the most powerful key to raising awareness. 
Waking someone up to something they don't want to hear and don't want to know is an extremely difficult task, programmed denial is epidemic in our society.

25827,Trump’s Far-Right Supporters Turn on Him Over Syria Strike - The New York Times,"Some of President Trump’s most ardent campaign supporters were among his most vocal opponents on Thursday after he ordered the missile strike against Syria, charging him with breaking his promise to keep the United States out of another conflict in the Middle East. Prominent writers and bloggers on the far right attacked Mr. Trump. They accused him of turning against his voters by waging an attack that he had for years said would be a terrible idea. They also criticized him for launching the strike without first seeking congressional approval  —   something he said on Twitter in 2013 would be a “big mistake. ” The most vocal in their outrage were leaders from the small but influential white nationalist movement. Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at the conspiracy theorist site Infowars, said on Twitter that Trump “was just another deep   puppet. ” He added, “I’m officially OFF the Trump train. ” Richard Spencer, a   activist and white nationalist who coined the term “” said he condemned the attack and hinted at supporting another presidential candidate in 2020: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democrat. Ms. Gabbard met with President Bashar   of Syria in January and on Thursday criticized the missile strike as shortsighted and reckless. For some on the far right, particularly those who are   Mr. Trump’s strike crossed a line. But others praised the president for his quick military decision, which came three days after the Syrian government’s deadly chemical weapons attack on its own people, including children. The radio host Hugh Hewitt said the missile launch was “justice for these children. ” Mark Levin, another conservative host, agreed. “We’re proud of you,” he said of the president. Laura Ingraham, a conservative commentator, noted that the strike brought together three frequent critics of the president  —   the Republican senators Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain of Arizona, as well as his Democratic opponent last fall, Hillary Clinton. The schism among the president’s   supporters had been building since Mr. Trump said his attitude toward Syria had “changed very much” after the chemical weapons attack. His comments signaled a discernible shift in White House policy, and from his stance during the presidential campaign. Some of those supporters claimed, without evidence, that the chemical weapons attack was a hoax carried out by the “deep state”  —   what they believe to be a nebulous network of military officials working behind the scenes  —   to drag the United States into war. Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created Dilbert, wrote on his website on Thursday before the missile strike that the chemical weapons attack appeared to be a “manufactured event. ” A few hours before the missile strike, the   blogger Mike Cernovich warned his followers in a live video that the United States was going to attack Syria. “Remind Trump who supported him,” he told his viewers. “We got to stop him. ”",0

Mattis said, “We’ve obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard. I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open. He was curious about why others were in the position they were in  —   his counterparts in other nations  —   and I’m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

25835,Amazon Claims Web Shutdown Was Due to Typo - Breitbart,"Amazon claims that the shutdown on Tuesday of over one million websites who use the company’s   service was due to an employee “typo. ”[“At 9:37AM PST, an authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process,” explained Amazon Web Services in a post on their website. “Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended. The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems. ”  “We are making several changes as a result of this operational event. While removal of capacity is a key operational practice, in this instance, the tool used allowed too much capacity to be removed too quickly,” they continued. “We have modified this tool to remove capacity more slowly and added safeguards to prevent capacity from being removed when it will take any subsystem below its minimum required capacity level. This will prevent an incorrect input from triggering a similar event in the future. We are also auditing our other operational tools to ensure we have similar safety checks. ” Amazon finished off their post apologizing to those who were affected by the outage. “Finally, we want to apologize for the impact this event caused for our customers. While we are proud of our long track record of availability with Amazon S3, we know how critical this service is to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses,” Amazon concluded. “We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further. ” The outage on Tuesday affected several large sites, including Quora, Trello, Wix, Snap, and Alexa. Some government agencies were also hit by the unexpected shutdown, as well as Isitdownrightnow. com  —   a service used to see what other sites are down.

25844,'Rebel' snipers shoot at 40 civilians trying to flee Aleppo while Russia facilitates large-scale humanitarian efforts,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 17:19 UTC © Abdalrhman Ismail / Reuters Terrorists in eastern Aleppo opened sniper fire on around 40 civilians who were trying to escape the rebel-controlled area of the city , the Russian Ministry of Defense announced, confirming that no airstrikes have been conducted in the area for nine days. ""Because of the sniper fire from the militants, another attempt of the Syrian authorities and the Russian reconciliation center to evacuate around 40 people from eastern districts of Aleppo to safe regions of the city was derailed,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Thursday, adding that the incident happened overnight . The general also said that Russian and Syrian planes have stayed at least 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away from Aleppo for nine days, after the sorties were halted on October 18. Two days after the strikes ceased, Damascus and Moscow organized safe passage corridors for those wishing to leave the besieged neighborhoods. Six safe routes are now being offered to civilians, while two have been designated for armed rebels. The jihadists, however, refuse to surrender and constantly shell escape routes and government-controlled parts of the city. ""The terrorists continue indiscriminately shelling residential districts of the city with makeshift rocket launchers, blocking the civilians from leaving using the humanitarian corridors,"" the general said. While air raids are suspended, Russia continues to facilitate aid deliveries to Syria's second largest city. On Wednesday, some 15 tons of aid was delivered to residents of Aleppo's Kurdish-run Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood, located close to the demarcation line, the Russian reconciliation center announced. The nine kilogram (19.8 pound) packages included rice, macaroni, and cooking oil. The humanitarian rescue mission was discussed at the UN Security Council meeting earlier on Thursday, where the Russian envoy accused UN teams on the ground of failing to negotiate safe passage for civilians aiming to escape eastern Aleppo. In response, the UN's under secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Stephen O'Brien, blamed the parties involved in the conflict for their failure to provide adequate security guarantees. Comment: Jan Egeland, special adviser to UN special envoy de Mistura, was more honest, simply stating : ""It was very clear today that the Russians want to help us,"" Jan Egeland said after a meeting in Geneva on the relief effort in Syria. ""They would like to help us get access to east Aleppo."" O'Brien on the other hand, was moved to American-like heights of pseudo-indignation. Egeland added: ""The United States and the like-minded pledged to help us in our humanitarian diplomacy with the armed opposition side, which is difficult and which in the case of medical evacuation was not satisfactory . We lost a lot of time because of all of the conditions that were raised also on that side,"" he said. Egeland added that ""there simply was too little trust, there simply was too much fear, there were too many misunderstandings, there were too many confusing messages for this very complex and very dangerous operation... to take place."" The ICRC also welcomed Russia's humanitarian efforts, guaranteeing to do everything possible to protect civilians and evacuate Aleppo. Comment: Murad Gazdiev continues his on-the-ground reporting from Aleppo. In his latest, he speaks to Emenour, Aleppo's only female taxi driver, about life before the war.",0
25845,Uncensored Truth: Here’s What Really Happened at #NoDAPL Protests Yesterday,"( SSC ) Cannonball, ND — Over 300 police officers in riot gear, 8 ATVs, 5 armored vehicles, 2 helicopters, and numerous military-grade humvees showed up north of the newly formed frontline camp just east of Highway 1806. The 1851 Treaty Camp was set up this past Sunday directly in the path of the pipeline, on land recently purchased by DAPL. Today this camp, a reclamation of unceded Dakota territory affirmed as part of the Standing Rock Reservation in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851, was violently cleared. Both blockades established this past weekend to enable that occupation were also cleared. In addition to pepper spray and percussion grenades, shotguns were fired into the crowd with less lethal ammunition and a sound cannon was used (see images below). At least one person was tased and the barbed hook lodged in his face, just outside his eye. Another was hit in the face by a rubber bullet.
A prayer circle of elders, including several women, was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road. A tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled, despite promises from law enforcement that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it. A group of water protectors was also dragged out of a ceremony in a sweat lodge erected in the path of the pipeline, wearing minimal clothing, thrown to the ground, and arrested.
A member of the International Indigenous Youth Council (IIYC) that had her wrist broken during a mass-arrest on October 22nd was hurt again after an officer gripped her visibly injured wrist and twisted it during an attempted arrest. At least six other members of the youth council verified that they had been maced up to five times and were also shot and hit with bean bags. In addition to being assaulted, an altar item and sacred staff was wrenched from the hands of an IIYC member by police. Several other sacred items were reported stolen, including a canupa (sacred tobacco pipe).
Two medics giving aid at front line were hit with batons and thrown off the car they were sitting on. Then police grabbed another medic, who was driving the car, out of the driver side while it was still in motion. Another water protector had to jump into the car to stop it from hitting other people.",0
25848,Donald Trump Rebukes Ruth Bader Ginsburg for Deriding His Candidacy - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump on Tuesday assailed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court for speaking out on the presidential race, calling her disdainful remarks about his candidacy “highly inappropriate” and suggesting that she owed other justices an apology. Mr. Trump’s remarks came in a telephone interview with The Times two days after Justice Ginsburg was quoted as saying she was frightened about what the nation would look like if he were elected. “I can’t imagine what this place would be  —   I can’t imagine what the country would be  —   with Donald Trump as our president,” Justice Ginsburg told The Times in an interview published Sunday. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be  —   I don’t even want to contemplate that. ” She even joked ruefully about moving to New Zealand. Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said he found those remarks unbefitting a member of the high court. “I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it. ” He continued: “That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible. ” Mr. Trump also said he expected to announce his choice of a running mate by Friday, winding down a process that has been closely watched as in all likelihood the most significant decision he will make in his campaign. “I have five candidates, plus two, two that are unknown to anybody,” Mr. Trump said from Chicago, where he was raising money for his campaign. “I will be making a decision over the next   to   period of time, and I think it will be a decision that will be a very good decision for a lot of people,” he added. Mr. Trump said that he was not basing his   selection on   prowess or potential, and indicated that he had had enough experience with many of those he has been considering for the job that their tryouts on the campaign trail would not necessarily be determinative. “I’ve been with these people for a long time  —   I know them,” Mr. Trump said, specifically invoking Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. “Christie was excellent yesterday and Newt is excellent. ” Mr. Trump will appear on Tuesday night in Indiana with Gov. Mike Pence, who has risen in the estimation of many of the nominee’s advisers. Mr. Trump said his decision was largely coming down to instinct. “A lot of is gut. A lot of it is,” he said. “My whole life has been about gut. ” He also suggested that he would consider polling in states like heavily Democratic Connecticut, which he again said he believed he could put in play in November. Asked for quick thoughts about each of the candidates he is known to be considering, Mr. Trump played along. Governor Christie? “Strong,” he said. Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn? “A patriot. ” Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa? “A terrific, exciting person. ” Governor Pence? “Solid as a rock. ” And Mr. Gingrich? “Newt is Newt. He’s a good guy. ”",0

25857,Israeli Minister sparks Scandal after showing Satisfaction for Italy's Earthquakes,"
Two earthquakes, which struck Italy this week, were “retribution” for the country’s support of the UNESCO resolution disregarding the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara said.
“I’m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision,” Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews website reported.
Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people.
Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem – called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims.
The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution.
Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site.
Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church.
According to Kara, Pope Francis “strongly disagreed” with the resolution.
“He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel,” the deputy minister stressed.
As for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that “going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe.”

25875,Recall the 'Kremlin Opponent' Putin Whacked in a Washington Hotel? American Investigators Find He Actually Drank Himself to Death - Paul Robinson,"About Reality check media Recall the 'Kremlin Opponent' Putin Whacked in a Washington Hotel? American Investigators Find He Actually Drank Himself to Death 
Clear evidence that Washington Metropolitan Police Department, the FBI and the US Attorney for the District of Columbia are working for the Russians   Irrussianality 
In November last year, Mikhail Lesin was found dead in a hotel in Washington, DC. From 1999 to 2004, Lesin was Minister of Press, Broadcasting and Mass Communication of the Russian Federation, and from 2004 to 2009 he was adviser to the President of the Russian Federation for mass media relations. Thereafter, he occupied a number of other senior positions, including head of Gazprom Media from 2013 to 2015. 
Reports that Lesin had died of ‘blunt force trauma’ led many commentators to surmise that he had been murdered on the orders of Russian president Vladimir Putin. The Daily Beast, for instance, reported that the American authorities had been investigating Lesin for ‘corruption and human rights abuses in Russia’, and that : 
The mystery surrounding Lesin’s death had fueled speculation that Lesin was murdered after coming to Washington to cut a deal with the FBI. The conspiracy theories are arguably well-founded, because it wouldn’t be the first time someone who posed a political threat to Putin wound up dead under unusual circumstances. 
Similarly, in an article entitled ‘Another Defector Dead in Washington’, former NSA analyst John Schindler claimed that Lesin and the Kremlin had had a ‘major falling out’, and that Lesin was ‘believed to have been cooperating with the FBI’. Schindler compared Lesin’s death to those of Alexander Litvinenko, who was murdered in London in 2006, and Soviet defector Walter Krivitsky, who died in mysterious circumstances in Washington in 1941. Schinder concluded : 
While he certainly may have taken his own life in despair, Mr. Krivitsky’s murder by Soviet agents appears at least equally plausible. It would be a terrible fate if the eerily similar death of Mikhail Lesin goes unsolved too. If Kremlin agents are conducting assassinations on American soil, brazenly in our capital, the public has a right to know. 
Robert van Voren, Professor of Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas (Lithuania) and Ilia State University in Tbilisi (Georgia), likewise remarked that, ‘an increasing number of people from Russia’ were ‘dying under rather suspicious circumstances’, and that the Lesin case was ‘rather suspicious, and one has increasingly the feeling that Putin is getting rid of people who know too much.’ Van Voren said, ‘It is not unusual behaviour: being the Al Capone of a gangster state, he [Putin] must be constantly worried about everything people know about him, his past and his corrupt businesses.’ 
Without directly accusing Putin of murder, various mainstream media outlets have implied it by including Lesin in lists of ‘opponents’ of the Russian ‘regime’ whom the Kremlin has allegedly ordered killed. In August of this year, for instance, the New York Times mentioned Lesin in an article entitled ‘More of Kremlin’s Opponents Are Ending Up Dead’. And National Public Radio (NPR) included Lesin in a broadcast called ‘The Curious Deaths of Kremlin Critics’. According to NPR: 
Evelyn Farkas, who served until recently as the top Russia official at the Pentagon, says she’s never seen proof that the Kremlin is ordering hits on people. Still, she says, ‘The fact that someone like Mikhail Lesin all of a sudden shows up dead in a Dupont Circle hotel, to me, is fishy. The message is to all the other people who are Putin cronies, who are oligarchs, that these kinds of things could happen to you.’ 
It turns out, however, that Putin did not kill Lesin. On Friday, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia issued the results of a joint investigation with the FBI and Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department. Lesin died of a combination of ‘acute ethanol intoxication’ and falls caused by ‘days of excessive consumption of alcohol.’ The case is now considered closed.",0

During a recent campaign stop in New Hampshire, Jeff Sessions, the majestic Senator from my adopted state of Alabama was gearing up (with apparent pleasure) to talk about Ann Coulter’s most recent article when he was interrupted by a woman who was, judging by the sound of her voice, an immigrant. 
The interruption was a happy one, however, since the woman was down from Massachusetts, where she said Trump has a lot of support. Sadly, Sessions did not recover his train of thought regarding Coulter’s article, but immediately began to talk about immigration, which more than made up for the loss. 
I think he must be the very best Senator. So noble and sincere. And the fact that he reads Ann Coulter adds to his charm.",0
25884,Times Journo Calls for Assassination of President Trump,"Times columnist and author India Knight has called for the assassination of U. S. President, Donald J. Trump.

Watching the joint press conference held by Mr Trump and the British Prime Minister Theresa May, in which they heralded a rebooting of the Special Relationship between their two countries, Knight retweeted a post by Buzzfeed political editor Jim Waterstone which implied that the American Secret Service were so incompetent that they couldn’t understand the British conventional way of rendering dates into numerical format (  ).

But Knight’s opposition to Mr Trump  —   and in particular her call for his assassination  —   has not gone down well with fellow Twitter users.  Members of the public tweeted back to call her a “horrible person” and a “psychopath” for wishing death on anyone, while one person mused that she was typical of   “tolerant” liberals. @HeimishCon @indiaknight if the only way to get your way, involves murder, you might be a psychopath,  —   existino (@existino) January 29, 2017,  @indiaknight Wow.

A number of people have been jailed in the past for tweeting abusive messages most notably student Liam Stacey who in 2012 was jailed for 56 days for tweeting racist comments while drunk  —   a sentence which the judge said must be imposed due to the level of “public outrage”. Knight’s comment comes days after a German newspaper editor suggested on television that “murder in the White House” could be a way to end the “Trump catastrophe”.",0

‘She Wants To Be First Woman President For Selfish Reasons’ – Macy Smit 
The Daily Sheeple – Hillary Clinton can’t even convince her own family members to vote for her. The only daughter of Bill Clinton’s druggie brother explained to Radar Online that she will be voting for Donald Trump instead of her “selfish” aunt. 
Macy Smit, a hairstylist from Tampa, Florida said, “I support Donald Trump — 100 percent! I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now — somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books — to be the first woman president for selfish reasons.” 
Macy’s husband Derrick Smit is a meteorologist with the US Air Force and is currently on active duty in Kuwait, where he assists with air operations into and out of Iraq. 
Macy’s mother, Martha Spivey, agreed with her daughter about Hillary Clinton’s selfish nature. In an interview with Radar, she said, “The Clintons are all talk! Hillary says she’s all about family, but she’s got a niece she’s never met and never acknowledged. The Clintons have never helped us out.”

25886,Who Will Be In Trump's Cabinet? A Few Possibilities    :," Rotten To The Core Who Will Be In Trump's Cabinet? A Few Possibilities By David M Jackson
November 10, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" USA Today "" - After a stunning win that upended the American political landscape, President-elect Donald Trump and his top advisers now must put together a White House staff and Cabinet  a group that may well include some of those same advisers.
Here are a few possibilities for some of the most powerful roles in a new Trump administration :
Rudy Giuliani The ex-New York City mayor became one of Trump's highest-profile surrogates. The former prosecutor could now be in line for attorney general.
Newt Gingrich The ex-House speaker became a top adviser and television spokesperson for Trump during the campaign and was even among the real estate mogul's finalists for running mate. He is said to be interested in becoming secretary of State.
Bob Corker The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also be a possibility to lead the State Department.
Ben Carson A onetime Trump rival, Carson emerged as one of Trump's most steadfast surrogates. The renowned physician would be an obvious candidate to be surgeon general.
Mike Flynn The retired general emerged as Trump's most visible military adviser. He could be in line for Defense secretary or some other national security position.
Jeff Sessions During the primary campaign, Sessions became the first sitting member of the U.S. Senate to endorse Trump's campaign. Now, the Alabama senator could be another possibility to lead the Pentagon.
Reince Priebus The chairman of the Republican National Committee  which ran the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operation  could wind up as Trump's White House chief of staff.
Steve Mnuchin Trump's finance chairman, formerly of Goldman Sachs, is in line to possibly become Treasury secretary.
Chris Christie Though shadowed by the recent Bridgegate trial, the New Jersey governor has been a fixture at Trump's side since endorsing him in February and will likely have his eye on a spot in the new administration at the Justice Department or in the White House.
Steve Bannon The Breitbart News executive became Trump's campaign CEO in August. He could be in line for a spot as a White House adviser.
Mike Pence
While his job is already known  vice president  the Indiana governor and former congressman is expected to play a large role in the Trump administration as a partner to the new president, who lacks any experience serving in government.",0

25888,Mom's Punishment for 13-Year-Old Daughter Who Was Sexting Has People Horrified Over 'Bad Parenting',"
No parent ever wants to find out that their child is sexting. 
But if happens, how far is too far when it comes to teaching them a lesson? 
Last week, a 13-year-old girl from Riverside, California, could be seen “bawling her eyes out” on the corner of a busy intersection as she held a handwritten sign that read: 
“I'm 13 and I ask for d*ck pics.” Image Credit: Screenshot/ NBC LA 
According to NBC LA, the teen was forced to be publicly humiliated by her parents after they found out she was sexting. 
Witnesses said the teen had been standing near the busy street for hours while her mother kept watch from a nearby car. 
The teen had to hold the sign up for so long, in fact, that local resident, Krista Wilson, called the police to complain about possible child abuse : 
Wilson also stated that as people drove by the teen, she could see ""tears running down her face,” while “grown men were reading it [the sign] and laughing.” 
Wilson wasn't the only person who complained. 
A witness snapped a photo of the girl then posted it to a Facebook news page and, in no time, it received countless views and comments. 
Many were completely outraged by the parents' actions: 
“This is so horrific! That poor little girl; she is 13! This is NOT the way to teach a child appropriate behaviour. She is a product of a hyper-sexual culture and doesn't deserve public humiliation like this. I'd be surprised if this doesn't contribute to actual trauma.” 
While another wrote: 
“It certainly was a teachable moment, instead her so called parents have shamed her. 13 is such an impressionable age for self esteem and the like. Way to go crappy parents ????” 
One commenter simply said: 
“Exploitation and abuse.” 
On the other hand, there were those who defended the mother's punishment, stating that something worse could have happened if the child's sexting continued: 
“I'm with the mom! Great job all the people who say oh it's bullying and etc etc get over it! This girl was being taught a lesson. Most parents don't give two shits these days what their kids are doing. I don't care about all the haters either. GOOD JOB MOM!!! Keep up the good work.” 
Another supporter of the parents' decision said: 
“Stop judging the parents, they are doing what they feel is the best course of action given the situation! If the teenager wasn't embarrassed to show her body and ask for the same in return, than she shouldn't be embarrassed for the punishment her parents gave her either!” 
Another suggested this could have been the last straw for the parents: 
“Maybe the parents tried a different approach and Lil kid tryna to be grown didn't learn so now shes learned the hard, embarrassing way.” 
During the incident, police did arrive on scene to assess the situation. 
They spoke to the mother and concluded that the punishment, while extreme, was not enough to warrant child abuse charges. 
So far, no legal action has been taken against the mother. However, it has been reported that a social worker would be contacting the mother to help her with parenting strategies. ",0
25889,Washington Post Flips Out over Conservatives with WH Access,"Paul Farhip, a    objective reporter for the extremely   ideologically unbridled Washington Post, frets about “partisan” news outlet The Daily Signal being part of the White House press corps  —   quite literally stating that conservatives gaining White House access evinces a slippery slope where “extremist or racist organizations” could do the same. [From the Washington Post:  In an age of partisan media, the lines between “partisan” and “media” can sometimes blur. Case in point: The pool reporter covering Vice President Pence on Thursday  —   that is, the reporter who supplied details about Pence’s daily activities as proxy for the rest of the press corps  —   was an employee of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank. In other words, the news that reporters received about the vice president came from a journalist employed by an organization with a vested interest in the direction of White House and federal policy. The development is unusual the reporter, Fred Lucas, is the first member of his organization to take on pool reporting duties, which are typically handled on a rotating basis by mainstream news organizations. Lucas also covered Pence as the pooler two weeks ago. Lucas writes for the Daily Signal, a news and commentary site started nearly three years ago by Heritage, one of Washington’s leading policy shops. The Signal covers issues that are a focus of Heritage’s conservative agenda, such as an Obamacare repeal, tax policy and illegal immigration. While there were no objections to Lucas’s pool reports on Pence, some journalists suggested the presence of the Signal as a member of the pool crossed a symbolic line, into greater legitimacy for the partisan press.

25890,Лишь бы не подумали чего…,"Лишь бы не подумали чего… 30 октября 2016 Происшествия 
Принято считать, что для родителей здоровье и жизнь их детей – это чуть ли не высшая ценность, для сохранения которой они пойдут на всё. В нормальных семьях именно так дело и обстоит, но, к сожалению, в нашей стране достаточно много семей неблагополучных. С такими родителями дети никогда не могут быть уверены в том, что их интересы будут соблюдены. Очередной случай, доказывающий эту печальную истину, недавно произошёл в Санкт-Петербурге. 
В ночь с 28-го на 29-ое октября текущего года на пульт дежурного сотрудника Главного управления МЧС России по г. Санкт-Петербургу поступило сообщение о том, что в доме №24 по Белградской улице необходима помощь. Информированные источники сообщали, что в этом доме из окна выпал девятилетний ребёнок Мальчик получил травмы, однако его родители вовсе не озаботились вызовом медиков. Случайные прохожие вызвали «скорую», но пока она ехала, родители сами подняли ребёнка обратно в квартиру и закрылись в ней. Открывать дверь приехавшим по тревожному сигналу врачам мать и отец пострадавшего мальчика категорически отказались. 
Поэтому медики обратились к правоохранителям, правоохранители – к спасателям, и все вместе, дружной командой, представители этих ведомств отправились на место происшествия. Увидев такую процессию, родители упавшего ребёнка сменили тактику и поспешили открыть дверь. Мальчика доставили в больницу в тяжёлом состоянии, врачи борются за его жизнь. А в отношении его матери и отца проводится проверка по факту травмирования ребёнка и недостаточного выполнения родительских обязанностей. 
Некоторые источники сообщают, что при падении мальчик получил множественные переломы костей скелета, сопровождавшиеся повреждениями внутренних органов и внутренними кровотечениями. Стали известны и подробности «неблагополучности» семьи пострадавшего мальчика: его родители – алкоголики. 
Будем надеяться, что ребёнок все же сможет выкарабкаться и продолжить свою только начавшуюся жизнь. И что рядом с ним окажутся люди, которые если и не будут стремиться сделать для него как можно больше хорошего, то хотя бы не станут ему вредить.",0
25891,WikiLeaks releases more emails on eve of election,"
WikiLeaks has released the 34th batch of emails from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, on the eve of the election. This latest tranche includes 888 communications.
Much of the latest emails’ content repeats from previous WikiLeaks releases, because entire email threads are not always released at once.
‘Needy Latinos’ considered for VP 
In one leaked email, dated August 21, 2015 with the subject line ‘Needy Latinos and 1 easy call,’ Podesta writes to Clinton, “A few calls you might consider making,” apparently in relation to potential vice president choices.
Podesta then names Federico Pena, Bill Richardson and South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges. The first two are presumably the “needy Latinos.”
Pena, former secretary of the US Department of Transportation under President Bill Clinton, endorsed Barack Obama over Clinton for the 2008 election and served as his campaign chair. He is covered extensively in the email.
Podesta goes on to say that Pena’s “Cabinet stints ripped up his family,” and that Pena “gave everything to the cause and no time to his family, he went through a messy divorce in the late 90’s and was left really down and felt like no-one reached out to him then so he felt pretty cut off from Clinton World.”
Podesta, passing along all of this information after speaking with former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, gives Clinton four steps in completing a call with Pena, writing: “1) you really enjoyed seeing Cindy at the Chambers event and appreciate her support. 2) ask him how he’s been doing 3) ask about his views on the race and what she should be doing in Colorado 4) ask that he consider publicly supporting you.”
An email reply from Hillary Clinton herself reads: “Agree about calls. Just a few additional points: several Latinos have asked that I consider Pena for VP.”
On Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico and US ambassador to the UN under President Clinton, Podesta writes that a recent phone call between Bill Clinton and Richardson went well, “not withstanding the fact that [Richardson] can be a dick.”
“He had a good conversation with the President and has been good in his interviews since,” Podesta says of Richardson, telling Hillary that a call to Richardson ahead of his upcoming appearance on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ might seal an endorsement.
Donna Brazile 
The extent of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN was revealed in an email from the former head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, which contained, almost verbatim, the wording of a question Clinton was to be asked at a town hall in Ohio.
Sent the day before the televised event, which aired on March 13, 2016, Clinton is given the wording for a question she will be asked regarding discrimination amongst trade unions.
Also included is the wording of a question her opponent Bernie Sanders is to be asked on income inequality.

25893,Feminists Sue University for Failing to Protect Them from Mean Internet Comments - Breitbart,"A feminist student group at the University of Mary Washington has filed a Title IX lawsuit against the institution for failing to protect them from mean comments on the internet. [Feminists United, a student group at the University of Mary Washington, has claimed in a recently filed lawsuit that the administration failed to protect them from posts made on the anonymous social media app, Yik Yak.  The suit alleges that the university failed to protect the students by refusing to ban access to the app via the university’s wifi system. The complaint ignores the reality that most students have access to the app via LTE internet service on their cellular devices, which would render a ban on the university’s wifi system almost worthless. The students claim that the university’s decision to allow students to access the app via the school’s wifi network fostered a hostile environment in which the students were subjected to “overtly    ” anonymous messages. Writing on the lawsuit for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) Susan Kruth argued that the university did not violate Title IX policies by refusing to act on comments made on the anonymous app, Yik Yak, which was recently shut down in May.",0
25895,Typical FBI Swaggering Far Away Resonates its Lies Lies Lies in DC,"Christopher Manion https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/typical-fbi-swaggering-far-away-resonates-lies-lies-lies-dc/ 
The good news from the Bundy trial includes a mention of the Orwellian tactics they use on law-abiding Americans – but won’t use on Hillary. 
Almost 25 years ago I was at my cabin in northern Idaho on Gold Ridge, one ridge south of Ruby Ridge. 
When I arrived a neighbor told me that the FBI was “looking for a right-winger hiding out on a ridge north of town.” 
Uh-oh. Should I turn myself in? 
Well, Ruby Ridge: that’s where FBI’s infamous legal murderer Lon Horiuchi shot and killed Vicki Weaver while she was holding her infant daughter Elisheba – and I got there during the FBI “operation.” 
We all know how that intentional killing went down (Horiuchi shot her at a range of some 200 yards; a trained sniper, he could have hit her at 1000). 
My neighbors in Idaho demanded Horiuchi be prosecuted. Idaho tried but the feds pulled the case into their compliant courts and decided that Horiuchi was “just following orders.” (He’s from around here and I’ve had to be near him in church – yes, he goes to church – a couple of times. Had he been a Nazi prison guard, just following orders, he’d have hanged long ago…. I was tempted to ask him if that kill shot was really unintentional …. but I digress). 
What really bugged me was the FBI army that invaded nearby Sandpoint. They were everywhere – boozing, swaggering, and bragging: “We’re gonna get him on my shift!” one lout shouted in a restaurant, to the horror of the locals who worked there (Sandpoint residents stayed home during those dismal days, hoping to avoid the determined killers…. a harbinger of dark days and occupations to come). The waitresses had to walk on eggshells (Idahoans love their guns and are pretty good at using them – something a gal doesn’t want to mention to a heavily-armed drunken boor far from home.) 
Idaho’s senior senator at the time, Steve Symms, had it right. “We have the election box and the jury box. If they don’t work, we have the cartridge box.” 
This time the jury box worked. 11:36 am on October 28, 2016",0
25898,BREAKING: We Caught Obama Spending 30 Million Dollars Against Trump To Rig This Election | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print It’s no secret that Obama and his puppets are doing everything they possibly can to rig the election against Trump. Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it’s all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary. Obama’s latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he’s spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it. From Judicial Watch : Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it’s dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they’re known as “citizenship integration grants.”[…] Judicial Watch went on to say… The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. “We intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,” the agency’s grant announcement states. “If you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.” Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[…] Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing “new workforce programs” for the “new Americans” and the Department of Education is promoting “funding opportunities” to assure that the immigrants “are provided the tools they need to succeed.” The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on “immigrant-focused career-pathways programs.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have “meaningful access to housing programs” subsidized by American taxpayers. Obama likes to pretend that he’s doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it’s just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.

25905,Northamptonshire named Britain’s first Area of Outstanding General Mediocrity,"October 29, 2016 
It was the award a few wanted but only one could have. In the end, it was disappointment for Buckinghamshire, the borough of Chorley and everywhere within a five-mile radius of Motherwell as Northamptonshire won the nomination as the UK’s first Area of Outstanding General Mediocrity (AOGM). 
‘Neither quite vile enough for it to be funny, nor possessed of anything that might induce visitors to stay longer than it takes to use a toilet, this most nondescript of counties was a natural choice,’ said Lord Melvyn Bragg, chairman of the judging panel. ‘Its highest point is a mundane 738 feet. Its county flower is the cowslip. Even when Corby ceased to be the largest town in Britain without a railway station in 2009, Irthlingborough succeeded to the title. I could go on, but, you know, life’s too short, isn’t it?’ 
Classification as an AOGM enables a region to apply for EU grants in order to preserve itself from the commercial pressures that might otherwise make it slightly less shit. Many local luminaries had feared that Northampton Saints’ victory in last year’s Rugby Premiership, coupled with Princess Diana being buried there, might draw in the odd few hundred visitors, some of whom might even have settled and complicated the local gene pool. Now, those fears have been allayed. 
‘Northamptonshire is synonymous with shoe-making, except fortunately the last factory closed down in the 1980s, otherwise we might have had to open a museum about it,’ said John Caswell, Mayor of Northampton. ‘Now we just make Weetabix and being the largest settlement anywhere in Britain without a unitary authority is the most interesting fact I can think of about this God-forsaken hellhole. And if you think we’re crap, try hanging out in Kettering for an evening. Fucking hell.’ 
The county’s seven metropolitan authorities are now thinking about meeting some time before the end of the year to discuss how to spend the £20,000 grant. Corby, a former steeltown that attracted thousands of Scottish migrants but which is now ranked Britain’s ninth worst place to live, wants to use it to bribe Alex Salmond into annexing it, while Northampton itself wants to put a blue plaque on the site of the first car chase involving the police in 1899 and Wellingborough will only turn up if the meeting doesn’t clash with Corrie.

25908,Israel Refuses Participation In Paris Peace Conference,"Israel Refuses Participation In Paris Peace Conference Israel said the peace conference is a distraction from the goal of direct negotiations with the Palestinians.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walks out following a press conference at his Jerusalem office on Tuesday, July 14, 2015. 
A French government effort to hold a Middle East peace conference in Paris next month is off to a rocky start, with Israel summoning the French Ambassador to inform him that they oppose the effort and will not attend the Paris meeting under any conditions. 
France has been talking up the idea of trying to get a new peace process going for months, with Israeli officials expressing serious concern that the United States might not veto a French resolution on the peace process at the UN Security Council. Israeli officials today accused the conference of being a “distraction.” 
Palestinian officials had already endorsed the conference before Israel rejected it, and Palestinian spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah insisted that they remain in favor of holding the conference to discuss ideas for getting the peace process going whether or not Israel attends. 
French officials have not commented on Israel’s refusal to participate, but probably will go ahead with the planned conference, as Israel’s rejection is not a surprise. Indeed, much of the current far-right government has reacted negatively to the idea of a peace process in general, and has been particularly hostile toward the French effort throughout.",0

25910,Bill Cosby’s Books Join ‘Most Challenged’ List - The New York Times,"Bill Cosby’s “Little Bill” children’s book series was among the 10 “most challenged” books in 2016, according to a list compiled by the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom. A book is “challenged” when someone, like a parent or other community member, complains and tries to get the book removed from a library or a school curriculum. It’s the first time the Cosby series has attracted a complaint, the organization said. The “Little Bill” books, first published in 1997, tell the adventures of Bill Jr. a    Philadelphia boy, and were the basis for an animated TV series. The series’ appearance on the list is unusual because it’s the first time since the office started to compile data in 1990 that a book made the list because of its author, rather than its contents. The complaints arose because of the recent sexual allegations made against Mr. Cosby, according to the association. Over the last few years, Mr. Cosby has faced accusations of sexual assault made by numerous women, which he denies. In June, he is to stand trial in Pennsylvania on sexual assault charges. The office reported 323 challenges to books last year, a slightly higher number than in 2015, many arising because of sexually explicit themes. The book that received the most complaints, “This One Summer,” by Mariko Tamaki, is a young adult graphic novel that was challenged because it “includes L. G. B. T. characters, drug use, and profanity, and it was considered sexually explicit with mature themes. ”",0

25915,"Hillary is So Unpopular, She Has to Pay Off Youth Voters and Fabricate Her Rallies","Posted on October 30, 2016 by Tim Brown 
Among the many Wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer, it was clear that Hillary Clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe. In fact, it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her. 
The Gateway Pundit reported : 
She’s the astroturfed candidate. Hillary is SOOO unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies. 
5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks WikiLeak 
Wikileaks released nearly 20,000 hacked emails it says are from the accounts of Democratic National Committee officials on Friday. 
The emails are devastating for Hillary Clinton. According to at least one hacked email Hillary Clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online. She also pays millennials to show up at her rallies. 
Hillary’s support is all a lie. It’s all astroturfed. Everything this woman does is all a lie – even her rallies are fabricated. 
If Attkisson’s explanation were not enough, how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about Donald Trump. 5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks https://t.co/vmTiepsPkj

This should have come as no surprise. 
If you remember when her campaign kicked off in 2015, I reported on the fact that more than 50% of her Twitter followers were either completely fake or inactive . 
Additionally, when she had her Iowa kickoff event, a whopping 22 people showed up . The majority of those were reporters! 
Hillary Clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid anti-American liberals, and even then, it looks like she’s having to pay them to actually do anything to support her. In other words, her candidacy is completely contrived.

25917,"Life: 6 Pieces Of Meat I Have Seen, Held, And In One Case, Gone On Vacation With","I know all of these meats. 1.This slab of bacon has felt the warmth of my hands and the beauty of my gaze. 2. I can remember the moment as if it happened only an hour ago. I was young, having just been asked to leave the seminary after I repeatedly refused to chip in for Wi-Fi, and walking through downtown Kansas City when I came across this sirloin steak. Never before had I seen something so special. I took the meat up into my hands and eyed it for a solid three minutes before I set it back down on a manhole cover and continued on my way. A chance meeting, sure. But an unforgettable one. 3. I’ve seen and held raw meat, as well! This pork chop, while raw, is still deserving of human touch, and I provided that comfort for it. Anyone would have done the same. 4. When you win a one-day, two-nights cruise to Stamford, CT on a radio call in sweepstakes, you think you have it made. But I was a bit nervous when I took this succulent rack of St. Louis ribs onboard with me. It was my very first cruise, and I didn’t know what to expect. But let’s just say I was extremely happy that I won two tickets for this maiden voyage. 5. I’m currently holding this tenderloin in my hands, but sadly, I have not opened my eyes to gaze upon it yet. The time will come, though, when I see it. And it will be incredible. 6. Here’s another cut of meat that has sensed my touch and stare. This one I was holding and touching in a helicopter a few years back. It was the helicopter of my rival, and he was trying to show me how much better his life was than mine. All I had was the meat, a far cry from a fully functional helicopter. So even though he asked me not to bring meat onto his helicopter, I insisted. It made me feel less small. Secure, somehow.",0

They aren’t being asked to return the money. 
Various construction officials who built hospitals way over budget received thousands of dollars in bonuses. Other high-level VA officials directly responsible for the suffering of America’s veterans received tens of thousands of dollars worth of bonuses — and Uncle Sam isn’t asking for any of it back. 
If that doesn’t make your blood boil, you aren’t paying attention.   
This is government corruption at its absolute finest. While ordinary citizens who did their duty to this country are forced to drain their bank accounts because the government screwed up (again), executives and corrupt officials get to live large. 
Corruption like this is why Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so popular. Washington is indeed a swamp , and he is the only one who can drain it. Someone like Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, a 30-year insider, isn’t going to fix what is broken. 
On Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the Pentagon would be “suspending” its program to collect the bonuses from the soldiers who had improperly received them, Fox News reported, although it was presumed that the program would be resumed once some kinks had been worked out. 
If we had a federal government that actually spent money correctly and held people accountable for mistakes, these former soldiers wouldn’t be in precarious financial situations today.  ",0
25922,"Açık ittifak, uzun itaat, yazan Manlio Dinucci","Açık ittifak, uzun itaat yazan Manlio Dinucci Barack Obama, ülkesini İtalya ile bir araya getiren « açık ittifak [ve] uzun dostluk » ile haklı olarak övündü. Gerçekten de bu Avrupa ülkesi, ABD’li efendisine çeşitli anlaşmalarla ve uzun bir uygulama ile boyundurukla bağlı durumda.
Voltaire İletişim Ağı | Roma (İtalya) | 2 Kasım 2016 français italiano English Español Parlamento muhalefetinin sessiz suç ortaklığında ulusal politikamıza müdahale ederek, İtalyanları referandumda « Evet » oyu kullanmaya çağıran Başkan Barack Obama, « yakın dostu Matteo (Renzi) »’ya, İtalya ve ABD arasında « açık ittifaklar, uzun bir dostluk » olduğunu söyledi.
İttifakların ve her şeyden önce İtalya’yı ABD’ye boyun eğdiren Atlantik İttifakının açık olduğu konusunda hiçbir şüphe yok. Avrupa Müttefik Yüksek Komutanı hala ABD Başkanı tarafından atanmakta ve diğer tüm kilit komutanlıklar ABD’nin elinde.
Soğuk Savaşın sona ermesinden sonra, SSCB’nin bölünmesi ertesinde Washington, « ittifakın komuta yapısını –yani ABD komutasını- mayınlayacak sadece Avrupalı aygıtların kurulmasını engelleyerek, NATO’yu bir nüfuz ve ABD’nin Avrupa işlerine müdahale kanalı olarak korumanın temel önemini » belirtiyordu. Jens Stoltenberg, « Avrupa büyük fikri » üzerine yapılan yuvarlak masa toplantısında şöyle diyordu: « Avrupa savunmasının güçlendirilmesinin bir tür NATO’nun tekrarı olmamasını, NATO’ya seçenek haline gelmemesini sağlamalıyız ». Bunun teminatı, 28 AB ülkesinden 22’sinin (Birleşik Krallığın birlikten çıkışından sonra 27’sinden 21’inin), Avrupa Birliği tarafından « ortak savunmanın temeli » olarak tanınan, ABD komutası altındaki NATO üyesi olmasıdır.
AB’nin dış ve askeri politikası böylece, temel çıkarları tehlikeye düştüğünde çıkar çatışmaları yeniden yoğunlaşan Avrupalı büyük güçlerin üzerinde amaç birliği yaptığı, asli olarak ABD stratejisine tabi durumdadır: yeni devletsel ve toplumsal öznelerin ortaya çıkması karşısında gittikçe daha da kararsızlaşan Batı’nın üstünlüğünü muhafaza etmek. Bunun için Çin-Rus stratejik mutabakatının meyvesi olan Şanghay İşbirliği Örgütü’nün, kendi alanını dünyanın en büyük bütünleşik ekonomik sahası haline getirebilecek kaynaklara sahip olduğunu düşünmek yeterlidir.
ABD ve NATO stratejisi kapsamında –Beyaz Saray’ın belgelediğine göre- İtalya, « ABD’nin sağlam ve etkin müttefiki » olarak öne çıkıyor. « İtalya’nın, tüm ülkeye dağılmış bulunan tesislerde, ABD Savunma Bakanlığına bağlı 30 000 asker ve memura ev sahipliği yapması » gerçeği bunu ortaya koyuyor.
İtalya aynı zamanda, geniş bir « meydan okuma » yelpazesi için askeri güç ve finansman sağlayan « ABD’nin küresel güvenlik ortağıdır » : Kosova’da, Afganistan’da, Irak’ta, Libya’da, Suriye’de, Baltık Denizi’nde ve diğer yerlerde, ABD/NATO savaş aygıtının müdahil olduğu ve bulunduğu her yerde.
ABD-İtalya ilişkisinin ne düzeyde olduğunu son bir olgu teyit etmektedir: İtalya’nın satın alma taahhüdünde bulunduğu, ABD’nin Lockheed Martin firmasının üretimi 90 adet F-35 avcı uçağından ilk iki tanesi, muhtemelen 8 Kasım’da, Puglia bölgesindeki Amendola üssüne varmak üzereler.
İtalya’nın, ikinci dereceden ortak olarak F-35 programına katılımının bedeli, resmi olarak 2016 Bütçe Yasasında belirtildiği gibi, 12 milyar 356 milyon Euro kamu parası artı, henüz tamamen operasyonel olmayan ve sürekli olarak güncellemelere ihtiyacı olacak avcı uçağının devam eden modifikasyonları için olası diğer harcamalar.

Was he ever. 
As Twitchy told you , the FBI reportedly decided to reopen their probe into Hillary Clinton in light of emails discovered on one of Anthony Weiner’s devices.

25925,Tancredo: America Needs New Sheriffs - Breitbart,"Local sheriffs traditionally have been among the strongest advocates for robust enforcement of federal immigration law, but the Obama years have left a legacy of nonenforcement masquerading as a “Priority Enforcement Program. ”   [Sheriffs in Denver, Houston, Austin and elsewhere have announced their vigorous opposition to cooperation with federal law enforcement. The problem is that Obama’s “enforcement priorities” for ICE allowed tens of thousands of criminal aliens who were eligible for deportation under laws passed by Congress to escape deportation.   The attitude of local sheriffs is important because the debate raging over “sanctuary” policies will not be decided in Washington, DC alone. Restoring effective enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws will require rebuilding a strong   partnership, and that cannot happen if local sheriffs continue dragging their feet on lawful ICE detainers while singing from the ACLU songbook.  Some sheriffs are insisting a local sheriff or local jail should not be accused of following “sanctuary” policies merely because they will not honor ICE detainers. A county sheriff explains that “less is more” rationale in a recent newspaper interview, here. However, I suspect most Americans see that attitude as a lot like a motorist insisting he is a very safe driver despite flunking the sobriety test with a 0. 20 alcohol level.  The ICE detainer is a lawful, essential instrument of federal law enforcement and should be honored by all local sheriffs. Local jails that refuse to do so are releasing hundreds of criminal aliens back into the community —  criminal aliens who are eligible for deportation under federal law.  In Colorado, the chief culprit and cheerleader for sanctuary policies is the Denver County jail. In 2014, Denver was listed in an ICE document as ranked number ten nationally in the number of ICE detainers rejected over an   period. Now, if ICE shows up at the sheriff’s jail at the precise time of a prisoner’s release and takes custody, the sheriff is supportive of that. Hooray. But if ICE requests the jail hold the criminal an extra 12 hours so ICE can pick him up, that request will not be honored. Why? Because the ACLU has won a couple of federal lawsuits at the district court level  —   for example, in a 9th Circuit case in Oregon  —   to establish the highly dubious principle that honoring the ICE detainer would be violating the alien’s 4th Amendment rights. The fact that no federal court in Colorado or the entire 10th Circuit has ever made such a ruling is evidently not as important to some county sheriffs as what the ACLU thinks.   Unfortunately, in the last years of the Obama regime, there developed a silent partnership between Obama’s minimal enforcement policies and some sheriffs content to see less reliance on detainers. Eventually, this policy of nonenforcement became the hallmark of what are known as “sanctuary cities. ” Under Obama’s policies, ICE went so far as to develop a new detainer form  —   DHS Form    —   that did not have the word “detainer” anywhere on the form! Accepting and complying with that detainer was even labeled “voluntary”! Is it surprising that many police chiefs and sheriffs did not complain and went along with this   on detainers? In effect, police chiefs in a dozen or more major cities became enablers and partners in Obama’s war on immigration enforcement.  On the good news side, it is widely rumored that the U. S. Department of Justice will soon announce that the federal government will indemnify local law enforcement agencies against civil liability if they are sued by the ACLU (or anyone else) for honoring an ICE detainer. That new policy should quiet the criticisms of all but the most   sanctuary advocates.  We must hope that the nation’s local sheriffs  —   who perhaps got too comfortable with the Obama era’s   policies  —   will now welcome a return to a more positive   partnership in immigration law enforcement based on constitutional norms, not the values and priorities of the ACLU.",0

25927,"KREMLIN: Putin Congratulates Trump, Hopes to Work Together Major Issues","
21st Century Wire says… 
Over the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that “ Russia is Hacking the US Election ”– blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly ‘hacking’ US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. 
It goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party’s crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. 
Today’s stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. 
With such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward… 
In a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other’s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. 
Putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. 
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some “burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,” RIA Novosti reported. 
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that “building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other’s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.” 
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia’s relations with the US “was not our choice,” however. 
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia’s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. 
“We are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,” Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow…

25931,FX’s ’American Crime Story’ to Explore Monica Lewinsky Scandal,"Producer Ryan Murphy says season four of his FX crime drama American Crime Story will tackle the Monica   Clinton sex scandal. [Actress Sarah Paulson  —   who starred in the first season of the   anthology series, The People vs. O. J. Simpson  —   has been confirmed for a role, Murphy told E! News, but said she would not be playing   Lady Hillary Clinton.  “That’s earmarked for talks with somebody else,” he explained. “We’re casting that now. I can’t say what Sarah is playing, but it starts shooting at the end of this year. ” Murphy says the show will focus on “the other women” who were ensnared in the 1996 sex scandal, involving   House intern Monica Lewinsky, and the events that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. “It’s a very interesting book,” Murphy says about CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin’s book, A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down A President, which 20th Century Fox optioned the rights for last month. “It’s not really about Hillary Clinton. That book is about the rise of a certain segment of a   group of people who despised the Clintons and used three women, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp to try and tear him down. The Toobin book is amazing. And there are a lot of bizarre crimes within that book that you can highlight. ” “But the show isn’t really about Hillary Clinton, it really is about the other women. In fact, we might be doing the Clintons with hand puppets [laughs] I don’t know,” Murphy explains. “We’re more focused on the mechanizations behind the scenes to try and get [Bill Clinton] impeached. ” The first season of American Crime Story explored the O. J Simpson murder trial. The     swept the Emmys and Golden Globes. Murphy said season two will tackle Hurricane Katrina and season three will focus on the 1997 assassination of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace. “We’re striking while the iron’s hot,” Murphy says of the   filming schedule. “But that was largely due to actors’ availability.

Warren, who has captured the hearts of progressives, was a   campaign surrogate for Clinton during the 2016 election and appeared    with Clinton in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. “I watched that last couple weeks, where she was getting up with that craziness and anger,” Trump said of Warren’s final few appearances on the campaign trail. “They are hard. I said, ‘She is bad for Hillary. ’” “Pocahontas would not be proud of her as her representative, believe me,” Trump continued, bringing up a nickname for Warren that he used from    on the campaign trail. Watters suggested that Warren would “probably run against” Trump in 2020. “I hope so,” Trump responded. “That would be a dream come true. ” Warren has attacked Trump on the campaign trail, calling Trump a “nasty,   fraud” during the American Constitution Society convention in Washington in June. She has continued to attack Trump after he assumed the presidency, most recently for Trump’s decision to fire   federal prosecutor Preet Bharara, when she said the president wants a bunch of “tame prosecutors who won’t investigate him. ”",0

25936,"Florida’s “deceptive” solar initiative, backed by utilities companies, loses support","Florida’s “deceptive” solar initiative, backed by utilities companies, loses support ‘It's a monopoly wolf in solar sheep's clothing’ By Nika Knight Posted on November 4, 2016 by Nika Knight 
As utilities companies funnel millions of dollars into a last-ditch effort to convince Florida voters to pass an anti-solar initiative, the latest polling data shows support for the measure falling . 
Florida’s Amendment 1 is “ deceptive ,” environmentalists argue, as it is written in pro-solar language but would in actuality block widespread adoption of solar power in the Sunshine State. 
The measure is backed by a political committee formed by utilities companies, which has so far raised more than $26 million to fund the campaign. 
“As we like to say, ‘it’s a monopoly wolf in solar sheep’s clothing,’” Dr. Stephen Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a founding member of Floridians for Solar Choice, told the Sierra Club’s Sierra magazine. “We are in a pitted battle to stop the utilities from choking off citizen-owned solar.” 
The initiative would “write people’s right to own or lease solar panels and other equipment into the state constitution,” InsideClimate News explains . “But it would also make it unconstitutional to require a utility’s non-solar customers to subsidize those who do go solar. Those subsidies have helped make home solar affordable and are the best incentive to push the fast-growing energy source to widespread use.” 
Support for the measure fell markedly after an audio recording leaked to the public last month in which a lobbyist working for electric companies bragged about the measure to industry insiders. 
The Miami Herald/Times , which released the recording, reported : 
Sal Nuzzo, a vice president at the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, [ . . . ] called the amendment, which has received more than $21 million in utility industry financing, “an incredibly savvy maneuver” that “would completely negate anything they [pro-solar interests] would try to do either legislatively or constitutionally down the road,” according to an audio recording of the event supplied to the Herald/Times . 
He offered others a recommendation: “As you guys look at policy in your state, or constitutional ballot initiatives in your state, remember this: Solar polls very well,” he said. 
“To the degree that we can use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu and take what they’re kind of pinning us on and use it to our benefit either in policy, in legislation or in constitutional referendums—if that’s the direction you want to take—use the language of promoting solar, and kind of, kind of put in these protections for consumers that choose not to install rooftop. 
“I’m discouraged as a citizen how far we have slipped and see Amendment 1 as a means of accelerating that decline in solar in Florida,” Graham said, according to the Miami Herald 
And Graham’s far from the only prominent voice to condemn the measure: “Former Vice President Al Gore, speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, described the amendment as ‘ phony baloney. ‘ Carl Hiassen, Florida’s best-known opinion journalist, has called the proposal a ‘ slick, oily fraud, ‘ and even the usually apolitical Jimmy Buffett has urged a no vote, noted 
Such statements from opponents of the initiative have gone far to quell support, according to a new poll 
One of those voters was “Barbara Waks, a retiree who had already mailed in her early-voting ballot when the Herald story appeared. She said that she thought she was supporting renewable energy,” the New York Times reported 
“I felt so stupid,” she told the Times. “I’m familiar with the political arena and the garbage that exists, but this is beyond the pale.

The European Parliament has awarded two Iraqi women from the Izadi minority group its prestigious human rights prize. 
On Thursday, Nadia Murad and Lamia Haji Bashar won the European Parliament's prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for their plight when they, along with other women and girls were abducted, tortured and sexually abused by Daesh terrorists after the militants overran northern Iraq two years ago. 
The two were awarded the prize as part of efforts to protect the Izadis, who are followers of an ancient religion mostly practiced by more than half a million people in northern Iraq. 
The community members, especially women, have been subject to torture, sexual abuse and slavery by Daesh. 
European Parliament chief, Martin Schulz, hailed the two Izadi women for their bravery, saying they had“a painful and tragic story” but “felt compelled to survive to bear witness.” 
""The courage of these two women, [and] the dignity they represent defies all description,” Schulz told the assembly in Strasbourg. This photo taken on May 5, 2016 shows Lamia Haji Bashar, an 18-year-old Izadi girl who escaped Daesh, in northern Iraq. (Photo by AP) 
Daesh abducted Murad from her home village of Kocho near Iraq's northern town of Sinjar in August 2014. The slight, softly-spoken young woman, who is now 23, was then brought to the city of Mosul, where she was tortured and raped. 
Bashar, from the same village, was enslaved and sold two years ago after watching the slaughter of her family and friends by Daesh. The 18-year-old then fell prey to an Iraqi hospital director after 20 months of captivity. She later lost her right eye in a mine explosion which hit one of her friends.

25941,"Despite opposition by majority of voters, Maryland fracking ban may be lifted","Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:20 UTC © Andrew Cullen / Reuters Fracking has been banned in Maryland since last year, but next year's proposed regulations jeopardize the moratorium. While the planned regulations are strict, they would allow fracking - a practice which is opposed by the majority of voters. Maryland has a year until its moratorium on fracking expires, but voters are already being asked to consider new rules on the controversial practice. Those rules would introduce heavy regulations but leave room for the possibility to allow fracking. A statewide poll taken by OpinionWorks found that 56 percent of Maryland voters would support a complete, statewide ban on fracking. Fracking is the method of pumping water and various chemicals deep underground in order to extract natural gas. Only six percent of the voters in the Maryland poll believe fracking comes without any risks. The risks of fracking are still being studied and were part of the two-year moratorium issued in 2015. A study by the state's Department of Environment is expected to show the potential impact of fracking, then use those factors to develop industry guidelines. The department has until the end of the month to finalize its proposed regulations. With only 28 percent of polled voters opposing a complete ban on the practice, some Maryland politicians are looking to pass laws that would make the ban on fracking permanent. In September, State Senator Robert Zirkin (D-Baltimore County) told The Washington Post that he would push for a complete ban, saying ""there is only one answer, and that is to ban fracking in the state."" ""If at some point in the future it is absolutely foolproof safe, then we can have another discussion,"" Zirkin added. ""But as of 2016, multiple states have done this, and all of them have seen bad results."" Other state lawmakers have kept their efforts local by trying to create small government regulations that would keep fracking out of their counties. Prince George's County banned the practice explicitly last spring, while Montgomery County effectively banned it through a change in its zoning laws. Comment: The oil and gas industry is battling tooth and nail to continue fracking as more communities are taking steps to institute bans - and with good reasons:",0

A strong earthquake has hit Rome, shaking centuries-old buildings in the Italian capital. 
It is not known if it has caused significant casualties. 
The US Geological Survey said the earthquake measured 5.6 on the Richter scale but that was later revised to 5.4. 
The epicentre was 50 miles south east of Perugia in the central spine of Italy, which has traditionally been prone to quakes. 
Arcangelo Vicedomini, a software developer in Nettuno, near Rome, tweeted: ‘Earthquake in Italy, 5.6 Richter, epicenter 66 km south of Perugia. In it was feeled well. In Nettuno chandeliers are dancing.’ 
Today’s tremor came two months after a quake in central Italy killed nearly 300 people. 
The August 24 quake – which measured 6.2 – destroyed the hilltop village of Amatrice and several other small towns. 
The US Geological Survey said today’s quake had a depth of only seven miles, which is relatively shallow.",0

Как сообщает freebeacon.com, ссылаясь на доклад, ""Соединенные Штаты в последнее время сталкиваются с большой и растущей угрозой своей национальной безопасности со стороны китайских спецслужб по сбору разведывательной информации"". 
Эксперты выделяют как наиболее серьезную угрозу усилия Китая по проникновению в закрытое киберпространство и американские национальные структуры безопасности. 
Прогнозируется, что китайские спецслужбы могли получить доступ к 5,6 миллионам отпечатков, некоторые из которых ""могут быть использованы для идентификации правительственных агентов США, работающих под прикрытием, или для копирования биоматериала для доступа к секретной информации"". 
По оценке авторов доклада, деятельность китайской разведки ""значительно усилилась"" за последние 15 лет и реализуется через различные структуры, в том числе министерство государственной безопасности, Народно-освободительную армию Китая и другие военные организации. 
Копия проекта годового отчета за 2016 год была получена Washington Free Beacon. Окончательный отчет будет обнародован 16 ноября. 
Система европейской ПРО представляет угрозу безопасности России, заявил ранее заместитель начальника оперативного управления Объединенного штаба Центрального военного совета КНР генерал-майор Цай Цзюнь 
Такое заявление китайский генерал сделал во время совместной с минобороны России пресс-конференции, посвященной вопросам противоракетной обороны. 
""США, реализуя план поэтапного развития системы европейской ПРО, не предоставили юридические гарантии ненаправленности ее против Российской Федерации. При этом в действительности она представляет прямую угрозу безопасности России"", - заявил Цай Цзюнь. 
Кроме того, он добавил, что Россия и Китай в 2017 году проведут второе учение по ПРО. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, о том, что свободному использованию космического пространства может помешать система противоракетной обороны (ПРО) США, заявил сегодня в ходе брифинга ""Глобальная эшелонированная система ПРО США как угроза военной безопасности России и Китая и стратегической стабильности в мире"" представитель главного оперативного управления Генштаба ВС РФ генерал-лейтенант Виктор Познихир.

The commander of Russia’s flagship Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, Sergei Artamonov, said via videolink that the ships are now in the ‘designated zone… in the eastern Mediterranean’ and ‘are now jointly carrying out tasks, manoeuvering to the west of the Syrian coast’. The battle group has travelled to Syria from the North Sea through the English Channel in the biggest such naval deployment in recent years as part of Russia’s military intervention in Syria. Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov pictured in international waters off the coast of northern Norway last month Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, pictured in the Englist Channel, is part of the Russian Task Group, which includes the sole the nuclear powered Kirov Class Battlecruiser, Pyotr Velikiy and two Udaloy Class Destroyers, Vice Admiral Kulakov and Severomorsk Russia has been flying a bombing campaign in Syria for the past year in support of President Bashar al-Assad and has deployed a naval contingent to back up its operation. The naval task force has been monitored closely by NATO, whose chief Jens Stoltenberg voiced concern the ships would be used to support the Russian military operation in Syria and ‘increase human and civilian suffering.’ The ship’s commander was speaking to a presenter on Russia-1 television from inside the defence ministry for a news show that will air this evening in Moscow. The Russian warship ‘Mirage’ passes the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul on its way to Syria He confirmed that aircraft are already taking off from the ship’s deck to view the conflict zone. ‘Flights are being carried out from the deck… they are working on coordination with the shore port,’ he said. ‘The flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days,’ he added. HMS Richmond observing aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, which is part of a Russian task group, during transit through the North Sea Russia’s Interfax news agency on Friday had cited a Russian military and diplomatic source as saying that Russian MiG and Sukhoi jets have been regularly flying into Syrian airspace from the Kuznetsov to ‘determine combat missions.’ The Russian television channel also spoke to the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, which is part of the same flotilla. Asked whether foreign aircraft were flying over the ships, the commander, Vladislav Malakhovsky, said ‘they are afraid to come closer than 50 kilometres away, realising very well how powerful the nuclear cruiser is.’ – Seeks UN assurances on truces – Russia says it has ceased strikes on rebel-held east Aleppo since October 18 and has also held brief unilateral ceasefires on the ground it calls ‘humanitarian pauses.’ It has accused the United States-led coalition of failing to persuade rebels to cooperate to allow civilians to leave, as only a few have done so. The Russian defence ministry on Saturday said that it will introduce further ‘humanitarian pauses’ only on condition that the United Nations humanitarian mission guarantees it is ready and able to organise aid supplies and evacuations. The UN has warned that east Aleppo is now down to its final food supplies and has urged Russia to extend future truces to allow supplies through. Russia said Saturday it is ready to act ‘at any time’ as long as the UN ‘officially confirms its readiness and ability to supply humanitarian aid to Aleppo and evacuate wounded and sick peaceful residents.’ It complained that previous assurances from the UN had turned out to be ‘just words.’ Vehicles carrying humanitarian aid that try to enter the designated humanitarian passages into the city have ‘every time’ faced ‘shooting from the rebel fighters’ and have been unable to drive through because of mined roads, the ministry said.

25953,New York Times Corrects Fake News Editorial Blaming Sarah Palin for Shooting - Breitbart,"The New York Times issued an online correction Thursday to its lead editorial, which claimed that Sarah Palin had incited Jared Loughner to commit the mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011 that killed six and wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ). [The editorial was a response to the shooting Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, in which gunman James T. Hodgkinson targeted Republican members of Congress at a baseball practice. Four players were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) who remains in the hospital in critical condition.  Originally, the Times article, “America’s Lethal Politics,” had stated: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a    girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. It also added that “there’s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack” in Wednesday’s shooting. As Breitbart News explained Wednesday evening, after the editorial was published online, all of the Times‘ factual claims above were false. Now, the article reads: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a    girl. At the time, we and others were sharply critical of the heated political rhetoric on the right. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. But in that case no connection to the shooting was ever established. A correction now appears at the bottom of the article: Correction: June 15, 2017 An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. The Times came under intense criticism in conservative media for its “fake news” editorial. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

25957,Bad Hombre Crackdown: Sessions Ramps War on Drug Traffickers,"United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed federal prosecutors to pursue the most severe penalties for defendants with the most serious and provable crimes. [Sessions instructed federal prosecutors to “charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense” in an   memorandum sent to more than 5, 000 assistant U. S. attorneys across the country on Thursday.  In a speech on Friday, Sessions highlighted the rapidly increasing crime rates in U. S. cities and pointed to drugs as the main cause. “The murder rate has surged 10 percent nationwide. The largest increase in murder since 1968 and we know that drugs and crime go    they just do, the facts prove that so,” Sessions said. “Drug trafficking is an inherently dangerous and violent business. If you want to collect a drug debt, you can’t file a lawsuit in court. You collect it with the barrel of a gun. ” The memo sent by Sessions also rescinded the policies of former attorney general Eric Holder Jr. effectively immediately. “We are returning to the enforcement of the laws as passed by Congress, plain and simple,” Sessions said. “If you are a drug trafficker, we will not look the other way, we will not be willfully blind to your misconduct. ” Sessions made clear that the criminals he is referring to are not   offenders but rather major players in America’s war on drugs. “These are not   drug offenders we, in the federal courts, are focusing on,” Sessions said. “These are drug dealers, and you drug dealers are going to prison. ” Sessions said that under the Trump Administration, the Department of Justice (DOJ) would stand behind law enforcement agencies across the U. S. “We will do all that we can to keep you safe and promote public support for honorable officers in your dangerous work,” Sessions said. Sessions encouraged all Americans to find a way to show their gratitude for law enforcement as he pointed out that those working in the field do so to help keep America safe. “Bring a home cooked meal to your local precinct. Go to a national memorial service or simply shake the hand of a police officer and say thank you for your service,” Sessions said. The move by Sessions against drug traffickers comes after he announced on April 28 that the DOJ was going to start targeting the notoriously violent   street gang, Breitbart Texas reported. Results can already be seen across the country as federal agencies look to rid America’s streets of crime. Breitbart Texas reported on Thursday that the Department of Homeland Security had concluded a   nationwide crackdown on gangs which led to the arrests of over 1, 000 confirmed gang members.

[The filmmakers have secured the rights to Melissa Fleming’s bestseller A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea: One Refugee’s Incredible Story of Love, Loss, and Survival, according to the Wrap.  The book centers on the story of Doaa Al Zamel, a    Syrian woman who fled Egypt and set sail for Sweden, only to be shipwrecked and forced to survive for days with nothing but an inflatable water ring secured around her waist.

25964,Limiting Your Facebook Audience - The New York Times,"Q. When I check into a restaurant or add it as a location to a photo on Facebook, can the restaurant’s page see my post? A. Facebook allows you to set an “audience” for a post, which basically means you can decide which groups of people can see what you share on your timeline page. You can choose to make the post Public, where everyone on the web can see it  —   or you can limit your audience to just the people on your overall friends list, to subsets of people on specific lists among your friends or to yourself. To select the audience for a post, use the   menu in the status update box. The menu should be set to whatever audience you used the last time, so if you shared a post only with friends, the menu will stay on Friends until you change it to something else. If you add a location to a post that is set to Friends or a smaller group, the people who manage the restaurant’s page will not see it. If the post is set to Public, the managers of the restaurant’s page can see it. However, if you decide to use the tagged image from the restaurant as a cover photo or profile picture, the restaurant’s page managers could see it. This is because Facebook makes each user’s cover photo and profile photo visible as public information  —   which means everyone on the site and even people who do not use Facebook can see it. If you do not want the restaurant’s   managers to see the photo if you decide to use it as a cover shot or profile image, remove the location tag before you post it.",0
25966,"Despite Not Being Asked, Sports Writers Vow Never to Play Golf With Donald Trump - Breitbart","The reporters at TheBigLead. com gathered together recently to discuss the question of playing golf with President Donald Trump, and most vowed not to ever play with the commander in chief  —   not that any of them have ever been asked to do so. [In an April 13 feature, TheBigLead asked, “Given how much golf every President plays, it got us thinking: If you won or were invited to play a round of golf with President Donald Trump, would you play?”  Of the eight BigLead sports reporters asked, only three answered with a “yes. ” Those who said yes, Michael Shamburger, Jason Lisk, and, Jason McIntyre, all answered with a quick paragraph. In the case of Shamburger, he gave but a   answer in the affirmative. Ah, but those who said “no” had a whole lot to say to explain their petulance. Writer Ty Duffy puffed himself up as a moral warrior for refusing to play golf with Trump. In fact, Duffy said he wouldn’t even deign to shake Trump’s hand on or off the fairways. Next, Kyle Koster was blunt with his answer. “No,” Koster huffed. “I have no interest in spending any time with Donald Trump. ” Writer Ryan Phillips, as apparently someone smarter and more interesting than Trump, said he would not want to golf with POTUS because, “he just seems like someone I’d have absolutely no desire to talk to or be around for hours. ” For his part, Stephen Douglas, who also said “no,” went on to insist, “it’s complicated. ” While admitting it would be quite a thing to tell a child that daddy played golf with a president, Douglas also noted that refusing to play with a president is also quite a story. Ultimately, Douglas deemed the opportunity a “hard pass. ” Finally, unlike the others, Ryan Glasspiegel  —   who also said he wouldn’t play  —   didn’t eschew the possibility because he hates Trump, but because he hates golf.

25973,WATCH: Iraqi Christians on U.S. President - ‘We Have Confidence in Trump!’,"In a new video, a number of Christians living in Iraq expressed their admiration for U. S. President Donald Trump, and their hope that he will make good on promises to assist them and come down hard on the Islamic State. [Asked “What do you think of Donald Trump?” several members of the clergy as well as lay Christians answered that they sensed a positive change after the Obama years, and felt that they were finally being noticed.  Father Immanuel, a Syriac Catholic priest in Mosul, said simply: “I love Trump because he understands this Christian matter in Iraq. ” Archbishop Bashar Warda, the Chaldean Catholic bishop of Erbil, said that he was “really encouraged to see that someone at least is thinking of the Christians and giving, not a priority, but at least attracting attention. ” “For me,” the Archbishop said, “I would say this is probably the first time that an American politician like a president would say, ‘No, there are some people who are dying or are suffering because of their faith and we have to think seriously about that. ’” Though in different words, a common thread running through the responses was the belief that Trump actually cares about persecuted Christians in the Middle East and would do something about it. Yohanna Toways, a Christian refugee from Qaraqosh, said that Christian and Yezidi minorities had actually prayed to God for Donald Trump to win the election. “We have confidence in Trump,” Toways said. “Before he was elected, all the Christians and the Yezidi are praying [for him] to win, all of them, and now that he is the president we have the hope he will be the savior of these minorities by his strong decisions. I think he can help us. ” People also said that Trump offered hope to local Christians, after eight years of a president who did nothing for them. “People here were more than disappointed with Obama, because he did nothing. So the view of Obama was terrible,” said John Neill, a volunteer aid worker for the Archdiocese of Erbil. “I think people here are feeling excited about Trump, that he will do something,” Neill continued. “He stated in his election speech that he would do something about Daesh. That is an indication that he will go further and help the minorities in Iraq to get back their lives. ” “If Trump cannot give them hope, then what hope is there?” he added. Similar sentiments were expressed Father Benedict Kiely, the founder of www. nasarean. org, a Christian aid group that has promoted awareness of Christian persecution in   territory, especially through the spread of the Arabic ن symbol used to mark the homes of Christians. “Many people said in our interviews with them that they had hope because he is a strong man,” he said. “God bless him. Let’s be strong and help these people. He promised during the election I remember specifically to be the president for the Christians. ” “So let’s put it into action,” he said. Follow Thomas D.

25975,Trump Weighs In as Senate Slides Toward Showdown Over Neil Gorsuch - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump devoted Friday’s weekly White House address to praising Judge Neil Gorsuch, his nominee to fill the seat of beloved conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, and pushing for his speedy confirmation by the Senate. [“Judge Gorsuch is incredibly qualified, he has a sterling record, he was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals,” the President said, making his case to the nation as a showdown over Senate cloture rules draws closer. “Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is about more than his incredible qualifications. It’s about preserving our republic,” he continued.  The Senate fight over confirming Gorsuch has reached a   over the last week, with the two parties running out of room for compromise. As the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans have signaled their willingness to confirm Gorsuch by any means necessary, increasing numbers of Democrats have insisted they will filibuster any attempt to allow an    vote on the nominee, making it ever more likely Republicans will move to change Senate rules to allow a simple majority to close debate on Supreme Court nominees. Democrats, who under current rules need only   votes to block a vote on Gorsuch, themselves used the “constitutional option” to allow simple majority confirmations for   Court nominees in 2013. Four more Senate Democrats, Sen. Tammy Duckworth ( ) Sen. Brian Schatz ( ) Sen. Catherine   ( ) and Sen. Claire McCaskill ( ) confirmed Friday they will move to filibuster and force the constitutional option. Senate Democrats are finding themselves under immense pressure to close ranks for this unprecedented filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, first called for by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) last week. Friday, CREDO, a   “” and a bevy of other progressive activist groups put their names to a letter to be delivered to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee demanding any Democratic Senator who fails to join the filibuster against Gorsuch be stripped of all funding from the national Democratic Party apparatus. “Democrats who refuse to defend the Supreme Court from Donald Trump’s racist, fascist agenda should not receive support for their ” CREDO told supporters on its website. Only nine Democratic and independent Senators remain who have yet to announce their intentions on the Gorsuch Confirmation, by Breitbart New’s count. In order to confirm Gorsuch without changing traditional Senate rules, six of these would need to join the chamber’s   Republicans and Senators Joe Manchin ( ) and Heidi Heitkamp ( ) Democrats who have expressed their support for Gorsuch. Republicans have responded with more open insistence that they will do whatever it takes to confirm Gorsuch. Sen. John Cornyn ( ) in a CNN   urging his Democratic colleagues to reconsider their filibuster, was unequivocal. “Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice. The question is whether Democrats will give him the    vote he deserves,” he wrote. Even Sen. John McCain ( ) who had as recently as Thursday held out hope a compromise might be reached to preserve the Senate’s traditional cloture rules, walked back from reports of a “deal” Friday. “I’ve had conversations with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. That’s all. There’s no gang. There’s no negotiations. Just having some conversations. No deal. No negotiations,” he told the Daily Caller. Gorsuch’s confirmation vote is now set for April 7.",0
25976,Limbaugh on Comey Hearing: Message to Trump Is Stop the ’Drain-the-Swamp Stuff’ or Face Impeachment - Breitbart,"Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh maintained a House Intelligence Committee hearing that featured testimony from FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Michael Rogers was meant to send a message to President Donald Trump and his administration.  Limbaugh argued that although there were some good questions from Republicans members during the hearing, it was meant to be a warning shot at Trump  —   allow Washington Republicans to run the town or face possible impeachment. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): These hearings today, what happened last week and the week before that, what happened during the transition period  …     What all of this is can be explained simply by saying, “Look at how terrified they are in the   York establishment, of Donald Trump and draining the swamp. ” The Never Trumpers on both sides of the aisle. There are conservative Never Trumpers today celebrating over the fact that Comey made it official that there’s an investigation of Trump and colluding with the Russians. These people know that there isn’t any evidence of this, but that doesn’t matter. What everybody in Washington supports is the smearing, the slander, and the libel of Donald Trump. And these hearings today? The FBI director, James Comey, is trying to save the jobs of a lot of people. He’s trying to save the careers of a whole lot of people  —   his included  —   in, I think, an inappropriate way. And the Republicans in this committee? Look folks, I’ve been waiting. I’ve been patiently waiting. I’ve been trying to hold it, keep the powder dry. But the Republicans on this committee  …     I know it’s early, and they’re gonna go on all day. But so far, outside of Trey Gowdy and a question from Peter King and Devin Nunes the chairman, there just hasn’t been much. For example, “Are you still investigating the Clinton Foundation, Director Comey?” “I can’t say. ” By the way, Comey said he got special permission to reveal this investigation. Who gave him that special permission? He said he went to the Department of Justice. Who’s over there? Who runs that? That it would be Jeff Sessions. The Trump administration itself granted permission for Comey to announce this today. (interruption) Well, no. My point there is that there’s no attempted   of anything going on there. The Trump administration could very well have said, Jeff Sessions could have said, “Comey, look, it’s just like you said last summer about Hillary: We don’t detail ongoing investigations. ” But he today was given permission to do just that, and he’s running with it. And the whole point of this today  —   and, by the way, it doesn’t mean I’m not gonna go through this and give you what the real news of these hearings is today and what the backdrop of all this is. Because there’s a really salient factor that’s driving this from the Democrat side that is never going to be reported or commented on, which I’m going to touch on myself today. But, as I say, the purpose of this is to further the narrative that Trump is illegitimate, that he should not be president, that his election was the result of tampering by the Russians. So the objective is that Trump either stops this reform business he’s got, stops this    stuff, and starts letting the Washington Republicans run the town again, or they’re gonna impeach him. That’s the message being sent today: “You either straighten up and fly right or you’re gone. ” “We’re coming for you,” is the message of these hearings today.

[In a story published in the Journal:  The White House sent a warning shot to congressional Republicans that it may increase its outreach to Democrats if it can’t get the support of   conservatives, a potential shift in legislative strategy that could affect drug prices, the future of a tax overhaul and budgetary priorities. Days after the House GOP health bill collapsed due to a lack of support from Republicans, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus brought up the idea of working with Democrats multiple times, leaving little doubt that the White House intended to send a message to the   Republican flank. “This president is not going to be a partisan president,” Mr. Priebus said on “Fox News Sunday. ” He said that while “I think it’s time for our folks to come together, I also think it’s time to potentially get a few moderate Democrats on board as well. ” Read the full article here.",0

Doesn’t Nike have to actually bring its brand to American shores and make this sneaker inside of our borders and actually pay people in America to make a shoe they’re asking people to buy?” “Don’t you think it’s a little bit hypocritical for Nike to say that equality is everywhere when it’s paying workers overseas   of what they would have to pay for an American to make this?” he added. Travis went on to call what Nike has with its Indonesian employees “Indonesian virtual slave labor. ” “I guess everybody’s equal and there are no boundaries as long as you don’t live in Indonesia,” he concluded.

25986,The Fed Plans for the Next Crisis,"  
In her recent address at the Jackson Hole monetary policy conference, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by the end of the year. Markets reacted favorably to Yellen’s suggested rate increase. This is surprising, as, except for one small increase last year, the Federal Reserve has not followed through on the numerous suggestions of rate increases that Yellen and other Fed officials have made over the past several years. 
Much more significant than Yellen’s latest suggestion of a rate increase was her call for the Fed to think outside the box in developing responses to the next financial crisis. One of the outside the box ideas suggested by Yellen is increasing the Fed’s ability to intervene in markets by purchasing assets of private companies. Yellen also mentioned that the Fed could modify its inflation target. 
Increasing the Federal Reserve’s ability to purchase private assets will negatively impact economic growth and consumers’ well-being. This is because the Fed will use this power to keep failing companies alive, thus preventing the companies’ assets from being used to produce a good or service more highly valued by consumers. 
Investors may seek out companies whose assets have been purchased by the Federal Reserve, since it is likely that Congress and federal regulators would treat these companies as “too big to fail.” Federal Reserve ownership of private companies could also strengthen the movement to force businesses to base their decisions on political, rather than economic, considerations. 
Yellen’s suggestion of modifying the Fed’s inflation target means that the Fed would increase the inflation tax just when Americans are trying to cope with a major recession or even a depression. The inflation tax is the most insidious of all taxes because it is both hidden and regressive. 
The failure of the Federal Reserve’s eight-year spree of money creation via quantitative easing and historically low interest rates to reflate the bubble economy suggests that the fiat currency system may soon be coming to an end. Yellen’s outside the box proposals will only hasten that collapse. 
The collapse of the fiat system will not only cause a major economic crisis, but also the collapse of the welfare-warfare state. Yet, Congress not only refuses to consider meaningful spending cuts, it will not even pass legislation to audit the Fed. 
Passing Audit the Fed would allow the American people to know the full truth about the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy, including the complete details of the Fed’s plans to respond to the next economic crash. An audit will also likely uncover some very interesting details regarding the Federal Reserve’s dealings with foreign central banks. 
The large number of Americans embracing authoritarianism — whether of the left or right wing variety — is a sign of mass discontent with the current system. There is a great danger that, as the economic situation worsens, there will be an increase in violence and growing restrictions on liberty. However, public discontent also presents a great opportunity for those who understand free-market economics to show our fellow citizens that our problems are not caused by immigrants, imports, or the one percent, but by the Federal Reserve. 
Politicians will never restore sound money or limited government unless forced to do so by either an economic crisis or a shift in public option. It is up to us who know the truth to make sure the welfare-warfare state and the system of fiat money ends because the people have demanded it, not because a crisis left Congress with no other choice.",0
25989,"Amazon extends olive branch to Megyn Kelly over book reviews, “flood of one-star ratings”","11.23.2016 @4:17 PM EST More Establishment ties? 
( INTELLIHUB ) — It looks as if Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new book publisher, Harper Collins, may have been concerned with a plethora of negative book reviews posted by ‘Trump trolls’ on Amazon, resulting in Amazon censoring free speech by removing a score of reviews from the website entirely, reports say. 
Apparently Kelly’s new memoir titled Settle For More missed the mark so much that “a whopping 76% of all reports were one-star” at one point, before Amazon made adjustments in an effort to aide Kelly, according to Slate.com. 
Although USA Today and others are touting negative reviews as ‘attacks from pro-Trump trolls,’ Kelly’s negative reviews only stem from Kelly herself, who serves as a played out die-hard Establishment mouthpiece for the corporate elite. 
She’s been “trying to suck up to Rupert Murdoch for that twenty-million dollar contract,” one lady told Intellihub. 
‘She’s courting him [Murdoch],’ the lady said. 
Currently Kelly’s book has a 2.4 0ut of a 5 star rating on Amazon.com.   Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0
25990,Secret Service Shoots Man Near White House - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A man who approached the White House on Friday brandishing a gun was shot and wounded by a Secret Service agent, the agency’s spokesman said. The man, whose identity was not released, was taken into custody and treated at a nearby hospital. President Obama was away at the time, playing golf at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. He was told about the shooting, a White House official said. The episode began shortly after 3 p. m. Friday, when the man walked toward a security checkpoint on E Street, southwest of the White House. “The Secret Service Uniformed Division officers gave numerous verbal commands for the subject to stop and drop the firearm,” David A. Iacovetti, the deputy assistant director of government and public affairs for the Secret Service, said in a statement. “When the subject failed to comply with the verbal commands, he was shot once by a Secret Service agent and taken into custody. ” The agents recovered the gun, Mr. Iacovetti said. The shooting, in a   area near the National Mall crowded with tourists and other bystanders, was the latest in a string of security episodes involving the White House. In September 2014, a man who climbed over the fence on the north lawn eluded officers and made it through the front door of the White House before being apprehended. Several days later, the director of the Secret Service, Julia Pierson, was forced to resign. Since then, the Secret Service has significantly expanded training for officers and beefed up security around the fence. In this episode, the Secret Service said, the armed man did not penetrate the White House grounds. “No one within or associated with the White House was injured, and everyone in the White House is safe and accounted for,” an administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to comment publicly about the incident. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was secured “within the White House complex” during the shooting, said Meghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman. Still, the White House and Treasury Department were placed on lockdown while the police investigated, interrupting an unusually sleepy spring afternoon at the White House. Mr. Obama, who is scheduled to leave on Saturday for a weeklong trip to Vietnam and Japan, decided to squeeze in a rare weekday round of golf with three close aides.",0
25991,E3 Hands-On with ’South Park: The Fractured but Whole’: South Park Takes Aim at Superhero Genre - Breitbart,"The title of South Park: The Fractured but Whole essentially sets the comedic tone for the upcoming   RPG which sets its sights on the superhero genre.[  South Park’s latest video game acts as a sequel to the 2014 release South Park: The Stick of Truth which was well received by critics and fans alike due to its surprisingly compelling storyline,   humor, and engaging gameplay. The Fractured but Whole aims to outdo The Stick of Truth in every way, ramping up the series signature offensive humor and outlandish storylines. The new storyline of The Fractured but Whole see’s the main characters assuming their superhero identities that many fans will recognize from the TV show. A fight between members of the team known as The Coon and Friends results in the superhero group splitting into two factions in an apparent nod to Marvel’s Civil War, one led by Cartman as The Coon and another led by Kenny’s alter ego Mysterion. The player takes on the role of “The New Kid” and can play as a male or female character. The demo that I played at E3 took place in a strip club. Your character starts as a lowly sidekick, not yet having made the transition to   hero. You accompany Captain Diabetes inside the club where you search for a particular stripper with a male   tattoo on her chest. Players must traverse the strip club speaking to various strippers and attempting to gain information from club patrons. Eventually, two men offer to take you to the VIP room in the back of the club in exchange for a lapdance. This triggers a lapdance minigame where players must move the controller’s analog sticks in certain directions in order to grind on the lap of the business man. Once this is over, the businessmen become belligerent which leads to a fight scene. This is where we get to see The Fractured but Whole’s combat system in action. Much like The Stick of Truth, the combat is   with players moving their team members on a grid system and selecting certain attacks in order to beat their enemies. Shortly after this fight scene players learn the name of the elusive stripper  —   Classi, naturally  —   which leads to Captain Diabetes hatching a new plan to find her. Captain Diabetes suggests concocting a drink that will knock out the club DJ who announces each new stripper, allowing Captain Diabetes to use the PA system to call the stripper to the stage. This leads players on a search mission for certain ingredients which are obtained through various   mechanics such as firecracker and fart throwing. Once all of the suitably disgusting items are found, the DJ is given the drink and promptly leaves to get sick, allowing Captain Diabetes to use the intercom system to call Classi, who attempts to escape upon seeing the player and is then chased by the player and Captain Diabetes, which ends the demo. Overall The Fractured but Whole is made specifically for South Park fans. If you’re not a fan of fart jokes and crude humor, this game is not for you. Those that enjoyed The Stick of Truth should be thoroughly impressed with The Fractured but Whole when it releases on October 17.

25992,Earth To Ammosexuals: NRA Admits No One Is Coming For Your Guns! (VIDEO),"Earth To Ammosexuals: NRA Admits No One Is Coming For Your Guns! (VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey   
For decades, gun-toting, ammosexual Right Wing Nut Jobs have claimed that the government is going to take their guns away. 
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has been preaching this kind of crap “news” for years, and blaming it on Democratic presidents. It turns out that the organization has finally admitted that this is a lie. 
When asked about it, President Barack Obama said : “I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” 
The NRA responded with : “Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms — from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama’s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a ‘pen and phone’ to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent.” 
Even if Congress and the president were able to pass such a law, the Supreme Court would rule it unconstitutional if challenged since they would be going against the Second Amendment. 
Not only has the NRA lied about taking away guns, but Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is spreading that BS as well. He said this about it back in May: “Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to abolish it. Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take the bullets away. She wants to take it.” 
Americans really need to stop listening to these fear-mongering idiots. No one is coming after your guns. We need to keep guns out of the hands of people who abuse them and commit crimes with them. 
Here is a clip from The Daily Show about Obama’s last batch of gun control executive orders :

Trump on if “tapes” exist of his conversations with Comey: ”Well, I’ll tell you about that maybe sometime in the near future. ” pic. twitter.  Friday during his joint press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, President Donald Trump was asked if tapes existed of his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey.  Trump said he would address that “maybe sometime in the near future. ” Trump said, “Well, I’ll tell you something about that maybe sometime in the very near future. In the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction. He’s a leaker. But we want to get back to running our great country, jobs, trade deficits. We want them to disappear fast. North Korea, big problem.

It’s almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know. You have to run up the whole East Coast and win everything as a Republican, and that’s what we did.

25996,John Kasich Signs One Abortion Bill in Ohio but Vetoes a More Restrictive Measure - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Gov. John Kasich of Ohio on Tuesday signed into law a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but vetoed a far more restrictive measure that would have barred abortions after a fetal heartbeat was detected, as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. In reaching the split decision on the two bans, adopted last week by the Ohio legislature, Mr. Kasich said the   heartbeat bill was “clearly contrary to the Supreme Court’s current rulings on abortion. ” He called the   ban the “best, most legally sound and sustainable approach to protecting the sanctity of human life. ” The   ban has no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion rights advocates consider it extreme. Under existing Ohio law, there will be an exception for life of the mother, Mr. Kasich’s office said. Current Ohio law bars abortion after 20 weeks unless doctors can show that the baby is not viable outside the womb. Many medical experts cite the age of viability as 24 weeks. With the governor’s signature, Ohio becomes the 18th state to adopt a   abortion ban, though two of the bans  —   in Arizona and Idaho  —   have been struck down as unconstitutional by federal courts. Legal experts say Ohio’s   ban is far more likely to survive a constitutional challenge than the heartbeat bill. Barring court action, the law will take effect in 90 days, but a legal challenge appears inevitable. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, which said on Tuesday that the measure was “unconstitutional and will harm women and families,” was expected to file a suit to block it. “There’s no way we’re going to take this lying down,” said Gabriel Mann, a spokesman for Naral   Ohio, an advocacy group. “It’s too horrific of a restriction for women who are facing medical complications and situations where they need an abortion around that   period. ” About 20, 000 abortions are performed in Ohio each year, Mr. Mann said, and fewer than 2 percent occur after 20 weeks of pregnancy. While the state keeps track of the number of abortions, it does not track the reasons for termination. Abortion opponents argue that one abortion is one too many. Mr. Kasich’s actions come as abortion rights advocates and abortion opponents around the country are gearing up for intense battles in the wake of the election of Donald J. Trump to the White House. Mr. Trump’s victory has changed the political winds around abortion politics, emboldening the   movement. People on both sides of the debate see abortion rights in greater danger than at any time since the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, which found a legal right to abortion within the 14th Amendment. Mr. Trump has committed to appointing Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. Even so,   movement leaders in Ohio feared that the heartbeat bill would bring on a court challenge, and could ultimately set back their cause, given the current makeup of the Supreme Court. In June, after the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia, the court struck down a   Texas   bill,  . But even if Mr. Trump fills Justice Scalia’s seat, the balance of the court will not change it will still tip in favor of Roe,   said Michael Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life, the organization that pushed for the   ban. “The governor got this right,” Mr. Gonidakis said. “At the end of the day, he had to exercise great restraint in what legislation he signed. ”",0
25998,300 US Marines To Be Deployed To Russian Border In Norway,"« Previous - Next » 300 US Marines To Be Deployed To Russian Border In Norway 
It has long been a controversy for the United States often getting involved in affairs that shouldn't necessarily involve them. Many other countries believe that the United State is nothing more warmongers who lust for more power and authority over the many weaker countries throughout the world, hence the history of unwarranted wars that have taken place throughout. 
Some of these range from the Vietnam War, which was shown to have been a basis that never existed in the Gulf of Tonkin event. Another infamous event includes the idea to invade Iraq, which included the destruction of many innocent people, but did not assist in any way for any other country. It created more hatred however. Troops From US May Open Up Shop In Norway 
Despite all this, it is now being believed that US troops may be joining their NATO ally in Norway by stationing troops in the country of Norway. It is expected to involve over 300 marines going to Norway. This is troubling as it is the first time foreign troops have come to the country, since the devastating events of World War ll. Could this possibly be a preparation for World War lll, if the United States is coming to a country that is near Russia? 
It could affect Norway as the Defense Minister has expressed serious concern regarding the Russian military, which has continued to flex its muscles through the takeover of many smaller countries with mere ease. Norway has come under some fire about the decision to involve the United States as some believe this is not a good signal to show to someone that opposes them as it looks like they are welcoming the idea of a war . 
Some also believe that Norway should try to defend itself by reinforcing its own army rather than involving the United States troops to give them a helping hand. Some also believe that it makes them look rather weak if they are instantly calling upon their strongest ally in the United States to help them as soon as they start to have a fear of a certain situation. 
What remains unknown is what may develop upon stationing these troops. Is World War lll on the cusp of existence with the strategic and sudden move by Norway? Hopefully not, because this could easily be as devastating as all of the other wars combined, given the advancement of fighting techniques.
